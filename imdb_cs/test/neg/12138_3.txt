UP TO VILLA (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> WARNING: YOU CAN FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> It's hard to know what UP UP THE VILLA is, beautiful but shallow a period piece, one of those that had the only goal to earn Oscar nominations for the best costume design and artistic direction (one for cinema and the other for the score is also welcome). It has the same basic idea of ​​thousands of period pieces made each year: a good-looking, intelligent woman trying to find love in her strange place. She has many difficulties, but in the end she finds herself in the arms of a man with whom she has failed. In this case, our Lady is in Florence, sometime before World War II. It is an English widow who deals with a rich but old man (who, of course, does not love). One day he meets another man who has no reputation but for whom he falls in love. Of course, her friend, who helps her to get better or worse, and the third person who commits suicide, is in a lady's room and prepares a risky situation for her. Guess how the story ends ...? There's no bad movie on Villa. I've always been quite interested in this story, but it never surprised me. The problem is not slow stimulation, but a scenario. Adapted to the novel, it needs something more piquant, exciting, twisting and tense. Every time you think the story warms up, it will be cooler again. If you think this is a conspiracy involving the Chief of Florence, it is, but nothing changes in the story. It's just going on and going, until the foreseeable end. As I said, VILLA is not bad. If it is a bit bland, it will never be content and too sentimental. The negotiations are half but certainly convincing. Kristin Scott Thomas made some bad choices for CZECH PATIENT (saaaaaaaappy romantic drama THE HORSE WHISPERER and boring / irritating RANDOM HEARTS). UP TO VILLA is undoubtedly better than those pieces and Kristin is also better, but she can do more than that. Sean Penn is good as always, although his character is a big guy. Anne Bancroft is an amazing actress (GRADUATE, my God!), And here she won't let her character become ridiculous. Now the supporting actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davies is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.com). The director is good but not brave. It was interesting to know that the director was the same as ANGELS AND INSECTS (starring Kristin Scott Thomas), another such dramatic drama, but bolder. The visuals are important here. Florence is amazing, the costumes are great, scenery, music ... Finally, UP NA VILLA is an average romantic drama, but of course it could have been much better. It's observable and interesting, but don't expect a thrilling movie - it's not! This kind of movie fails because it wants to have some secrets, something to see ... However, there is not much to say mainly because of the shallow scenario. For Oscar nominations, don't worry - they'll probably get them.
