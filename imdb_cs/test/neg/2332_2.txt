There is an inherent problem with commenting or revising such a film. I remember feeling the same as when I didn't like Dogma. If you don't like a movie that's strange and controversial like Mulholland Dr. Of course, for those who have already seen this film, you know that the whole point doesn't make it anyway. I have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream. has quality. In other words, the plot is not structured like other movies. With the case of Mulholland Dr., it looks more like an unfocused collage made by the third grade boy who put off until the last second to make his art project. It doesn't make sense, it's not supposed to be, but I know it was a TV series initially. Looks like Lynch had a bunch of untapped movies and decided to crush him with a lot of new stuff. You will notice that nudity, sex, and foul are growing at the end. All the things he wouldn't film for television. <br /> <br /> For a better film, which is not a traditional, linear way, rent The Thin Red Line since 1998. That was a great movie. br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of ten
