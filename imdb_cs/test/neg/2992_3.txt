There seem to be a lot of fans of this movie, but I find it boring, slow, meandering and meaningless. I watch and enjoy a lot of art and independent movies so I didn't expect an action movie. I didn't agree with any character. The country guy was a bad guest and didn't seem to try to find a job, and his relative in Istanbul was humorless and emotionally closed. In a DVD interview, the director says the film is about a common situation in Turkey - about a person leaving the country because there are no jobs and they come to Istanbul and stay with relatives trying to find work. This in itself is interesting, but the film wasn't.
