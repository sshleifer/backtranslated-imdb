I got this movie as buy one store on troma.com with The Ruining (which is not much better). The main reason I wanted to see Star Worms II: Attack of Pleasure Pods, DVD is a double element with this movie. I really didn't know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer, I was scared. It looked terrible. But hey, what can you say from the trailer? Well, obviously I could say a lot. This film honestly didn't make sense to me. Special effects were so terrible that you can't tell what's going on in God's name. I know Mark HIcks had an extremely low budget, but come on. And it's sad because he sounded like an epic film in the interview and more than you saw. But unfortunately, watching a movie is one of the most boring hours and 15 minutes of each person's life. It's so extremely painful to sit. I can't even explain the plot to you because I didn't understand it and I saw the movie twice! Apparently they used some type of "extraterrestrial dinosaurs" puppets like they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are terrible, I can't emphasize enough. And mostly bad special effects are fine, but this movie needed them wrong. It takes place on any futuristic planet where foreign dinosaurs fight each other and bad actors in hooded sweatshirts run around, and they seem to be in kkk. And some box with blue light on it is president. I know that in a conversation, Mark Hicks said something about being a TV pilot, well, I see why it wasn't for CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this movie. 1. Music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that keeps in your head for days. And Lloyd Kaufman's introduction is always cheerful. Overall, don't waste your time, but check out Star Worms II: Attack of Pleasure Pods!
