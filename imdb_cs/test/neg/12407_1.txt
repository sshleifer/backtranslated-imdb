Disclaimer: During my time in foreign cinematography, I enjoyed a wide range of films that cover different genres, including horror, action, drama, comedy and romance, to name a few. So I enjoyed a thoughtful, serious tone of drama, as well as thoughtless popcorn entertainment from action movies. With my wide range of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean films in my band, I am convinced of my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and add. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize. It's one of the worst Chinese movies I've ever seen. To get started, this overrated epic showcase is an infamous "slideshow" action sequence that is nothing but an ultra-cheap and pathetic form of action choreography. One simply needs to show a series of detailed shots of the grimace of faces, swords, legs and / or arms and then the dead body. Bravissimo! Now you have an action sequence for Ashes of Time. The problem lies not only in its poor quality, but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and incoherent that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on. The dramatic element of this film is not there, because they rely on the characters who tell the viewer that they love someone or hate someone, instead of appearing on the screen to display elements that make all characters generic and colorless, so viewers are completely indifferent to their activities. In fact, the story itself is an absolute disaster, introducing too many characters too quickly with the way too many plotter devices. The complexity of the artwork in the movies can be used very advantageously (ie the Story of Two Sisters), but Ashes of Time becomes an exploitative waste when doing nothing but a convoluted very simple graph for no good reason. In fact, this whole movie acts like a series of smoke screens to cover its flaws. Terrible action choreographies are covered with "slideshow" tricks and chaotic camera movements. The non-existent development of the character is covered by characters who apparently say how they feel. And the mindless story is covered by confusing the viewer with convolution. As if it wasn't bad enough, this movie was extremely dull, seemingly over 150 minutes instead of the real 95. /> <br /> Rating = Rarely 0/5 stars.
