It's hard to tell actors from non-actors. Bad American movies can be noticed by all teen prefacing every single line of dialogue with "Do you know what?" Bad Canadian films can be noticed by all the young men who end every line of dialogue with "Eh?" Did we learn filming in the century? Can't the whole weight of millions of wannabs descend on Hollywood with scripts and reels in hand to save us from these horrible TV-movies-to-order?
