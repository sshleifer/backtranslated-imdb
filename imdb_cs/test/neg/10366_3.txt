This film has some shortcomings and most of these shortcomings are lack of something going on. Probably the biggest movie to show direness in Fly-Over Country, "Rolling Kansas" is a movie in which nothing happens and you don't care about anyone. Just as life begins, it moves and then ends. Several humor attempts are made, but everything falls very flat. Occasional portraits remind the viewer that they could lose their lives by doing something in addition to watching this movie and one rock song they bought and used in every single instance. a good movie. This is free and repeatedly often on Comedy Central because no one has seen it, no one wants to see it and it's a little better than dead air. It's not a heck of a weak praise, but the movie is one rock song worth listening to. Too bad the movie isn't worth watching.
