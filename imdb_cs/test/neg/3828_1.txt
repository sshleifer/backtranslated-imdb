I can hardly find words to describe how much this piece of waste has insulted me. Why is it that American filmmakers always look there to portray Jamaicans as a bunch of backward bush children, and even worse, throw people to play Jamaicans who sound totally ridiculous when trying to emulate an accent? We are not all very dark, not all of us go around wearing machetes, whether for work or for protection, we do not go naked in our houses and do not do VOODOO !! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, businessmen and women, musicians, actors and filmmakers. I am sick and tired of watching all these Jamaican portraits as a bunch of dreadlocks wearing Rastafarians who do nothing but sit down all day long to smoke weeds on the beach or shoot weapons in the air (When we're not in our tree houses). YES, we wear clothes. YES, we have electricity. No, weed is not legal on the island AND WE CHANGED BETTER English BEFORE YOU! The worst part is that it's not just about being angry and bitter, these are the real answers to the questions most of Jamaica asked overseas at some point. Read the book before you think it is in another country and worse, you decide to make a movie about it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO JAMAIC! Earth, where all we do is murder white people and beat our bong drums ... The stories from the crypt have officially disgusted me, along with the entire crew of people who worked on this waste, especially the writer.
