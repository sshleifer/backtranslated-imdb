I'm not going to comment too much on what is ??? Stereotypes, total ignorance of the reality of Colombia, a terrible mission en scene, a bad choice of colors, NO funny (it was supposed to be a comedy and expect you to laugh because some distance music is next to nonsensical scenes), the direction of very bad actors somewhere people, I mean interpreters, you'll know they are at least good, but when you see it, it's impossible to guess), you are tired of music ... this "comedy" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm in it, it's rap singing in final credits .... pathetic, right? etc. etc. etc. I haven't seen a movie so bad for a long time!
