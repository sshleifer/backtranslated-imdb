The title of this document is very misleading. They do not state at all during the documentary how the introduction of the Nile perch to Lake Victoria causes problems facing the city of Mwanza in Tanzania. The film tries to place Tanzania's problems on the ecological cause, but the truth is that the problems stem from the parasitic external force. The documentary is very slow, without any stories. Instead, it relies on small fluctuations in text between any related segments to display pieces of information that add little or no to the subject. There are only two attempts to discuss the environmental effects of Nile Perch fish. One of them is a small segment of about 10 seconds long, where an interview with the managers of the factory where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the Nile Perch was introduced into the lake and consumed other fish species. The filmmaker does not try to watch or go deeper in this matter. The second attempt is to film the performance of another documentary that deals with the environmental impact Nil Perch presented in this documentary, and again does not attempt to make the problem devastating. The subject that this document deals with has nothing to do with Perch fish itself and more with the problems most African countries face. The film attempts to combine the introduction of perch fish with AIDS, poverty and pollution in Tanzania, but there is never a direct link. As every intelligent person reads well with problems in Africa, the problems listed here are not unique to Tanzania, but they affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with fish. It would be great if filmmakers showed how the local economy or life was before the introduction of fish and how it was negatively affected by the introduction of fish, but not. The fact is that many of the people they meet say that fish provides many jobs and opportunities. Yes, things are BAD in Mwanza, but they are the worst in other parts of the country and continent. Poor Attempt of Documentarists to Combine Fish and Famine in Tanzania is a document that is quickly discredited by itself. First Tanzania is a very large country, and Lake Victoria is only a small part of the country. In fact, many of the personal conversations say they can find Mwanza, the fishing town on the lake, find work and feed their families because it was so bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This document is very weak, has no narration, and does not actually attempt to connect anything that it exhibits with Nil Perch. He plays the emotions of people by displaying images of the devastation of poverty, famine and AIDS that do not try to show you how this is all unique to Victoria Victoria in Tanzania or directly related to perch fish. The fact is that most problems have more to do with war, globalization and Christianity than with the environmental impact of perch itself.
