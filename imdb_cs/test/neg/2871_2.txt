I didn't think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time that I like CKY and Viva La Bam much more. I think much of it was really stupid and had no conspiracy for being a movie. I highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie, but anyone who likes viva la bam, CKY, or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts to be cut out. I think Jonny Knoxville was supposed to play in the movie because he is a much better actor than most people from Haggard and probably would make this movie more fun. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and he should have more skating.
