Paul Muni and Bette Davis, a monstrous monster, while the bland studio architect Archie Mayo seems to be in this racially provocative film that comes out of his "bitter end" by condemning segregation attitudes, upset and oblivious. A heavily filed and badly built film collapses under its own weight in the first fifteen minutes with a scene from a control room that will never be restored when Mr. Muni starts chewing the scenery at the yard where he shakes and howls in an almost incoherent manner. Johnny Ramirez is a Mexican American from the other side of the track who, thanks to his dedication and grit, gets a law degree from a school in a night shop. In his first big case with a car accident, he shows only clumsiness and is quickly ready for a fool to look at his well-founded opponent and impatient judge, who recommends that he be repelled. Destroyed by the failure of angry Johnny to work in a gambling joint where the owner of Charlie Roark (Eugene Palette), who likes his style, is related. The owner breaks it in, but there is a problem with Mrs. Roark (Davis), who also wants a piece of Johnny. He kills Charlie, implies Johnny, and slowly goes crazy than being freed and free with the high company Wasp, which coldly explains to him that they are from "different tribes, savages" and never will work. When he escapes to escape his rage, he is killed by a car. Ramirez sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhood rationalizing his best to stay with his own. Apart from this frightening denouement Bordertown has a number of bad performances complimenting the overall ugliness of the story. Muni's Ramirez is unjust as his situation might be, and he is so harsh and arrogant that it is difficult to show sympathy for such a bullerer with his head. Davis is no better than less than a loyal wife who matches the same teenage Muni emotions. Her Lady Macbeth crazy scenes don't show he's going to become the best film actress of her era. Margaret Lindsay as Muni's American Dream is cold, distant, and flat. Bad as Bordertown is (and is very), it remains an interesting indicator of time and attitudes. The rest is just mishmash of bad acting and uninspired direction.
