I've never seen a TV series or previous movies. It's probably why I didn't enjoy it too much. Boring and simply not funny, it sums up nicely. <br /> <br /> Given the budget that the movie looked like, it's embarrassing that they couldn't even make a pass-through job. We went to the cinema without exception and hope to see a somewhat funny movie that wouldn't be too much taxing in mind. My friend fell asleep halfway through the movie, and for the next 2 hours I was hoping to finally get up. Hope that died with final credits.
