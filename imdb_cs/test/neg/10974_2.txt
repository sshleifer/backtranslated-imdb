One wonders how FLYNN could fail as badly as the 1997 release with Guy Pearce in the lead. It is not often that casting someone so famous is so accurate. FLYNN was stumbling at the box office and did not finish in cinemas in Australia ... even after CONFIDENTIAL ...! From the dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes (probably Guy Pearce), FLYNN embarks on a rather robust and interesting start. Unfortunately, FLYNN runs out of steam after about the first 35 minutes and with the hammy entry Steven Berkoff in a detour to New Guinea (appearing and acting as he wanted Klaus Kinski's role in FITZCARRALDO) the film begins to resemble the film's body Believe it or not, about 70 minutes, it's boring and you're happy to see it. But such a promise! Pearce IS Flynn! But the film caused a rebellion at the box office and, unlike The Bounty, sank without a trace.
