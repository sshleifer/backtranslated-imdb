Some folk friends have recommended it, but as a film it really lacks originality. I found that the characters are unflattering stereotypes, and the story is predictable almost from the beginning. However, if you like traditional English / Appalachian ballads, it will keep your interest long enough to hear more. I also read that the soundtrack is nothing like music in the movie, with professional musicians filling out for the actors.
