Star Stars (Heather Graham) along with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). Her story Joline, who is determined to find her ex-husband, who is in the middle-age crisis. Determined wasn't what I was expecting to miss in a comedy that was ultimately a genre. It was beyond stupid and not-realistic, Casey Affleck released a reasonable performance, Graham's recent roles were a lack of gloss and this is not an improvement. Graham's last role was blessed, which I also found misleading and did not show up against me at all. Pros Affleck <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, unrealistic, poor acting and not a comedy movie!
