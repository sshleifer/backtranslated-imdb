This film captures short moments between mother and son in rural Russia when she dies. I'm so torn between being nice to a movie or claiming to be a patience test. The film is beautiful on one hand, with a sparse dialogue capturing the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say, because all that needs to be said is passed on by words. The son shows his mother so much care, love and patience that I think it is a celebration of unconditional love for the family. Also cruelly reminds me that I could be in such a situation, stuck in a helpless place, I had to take care of a very sick person. "Mat I Son" is a cruel reality. On the other hand, "Mat I Son" moves too slowly. Do I really need to watch a train passing through the horizon for 1 minute? With my previous experiences from "Telets" and "Aleksandra" I am tempted to put "Mat I Son" among them as a whole. I think one must be in the right state to appreciate this movie. Sure I see it, but maybe I'm not in the right state of mind.
