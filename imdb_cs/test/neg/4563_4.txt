This is a movie in an old dark house. The young couple creep around the strange mansion that Satan was telling him to run from one to the other in a badly sorted crew: a distressed lady, an ape, a monkey man, a dwarf, various strange people. looking people, and (for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in the throne room where the hero is required to play a "prize is the right" type of competition involving climbing up seven steps with seven illuminated tracks; hence the name. Too much of the same thing for my taste. The creeping surroundings of the entertainment house corridors are fun for a while, and then repeats. Compared to Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy, who do the same thing in two cylinders, it's not really funny. It's not even scary, and apparently it shouldn't be: the household is too absurd. Most of the films in this genre balance comedy with a real threat, and usually two - the fact that characters are led to believe is real, and another that is covered. Here the cover doesn't need to be taken seriously, nor does it apply. There are a few moments of fun coming out of the mix, but it's a lot of fun. The novel on which the film was based was a straightforward thriller and I think it could be played directly for a better effect - and yet it could be.
