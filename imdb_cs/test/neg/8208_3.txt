This film is trying to be more than it is. First, the deal is terrible. You have to get through the incredibly bad delivery lines and terrible emoting. The land is quite interesting. A shipwreck appears (probably because it was made of strings and balsa wood) and a few guys are on the shore. If it wasn't bad enough, a guy named Count de Sade lives there. He lives in fear of pirates and is absolutely insane. Anyway, he's got a big slave, a young woman, and a few dogs. There's another woman who doesn't talk and his wife is a leper. Anyway, things go wrong because these men have to deal with this case. He is arrogant and likes to introduce and deliver lines. The rest of the film involves an escape attempt. He has an ironic end that I will not reveal and the film will save. I wouldn't bother if I were you.
