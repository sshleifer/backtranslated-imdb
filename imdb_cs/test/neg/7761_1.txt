Watching family affairs, coronation st & east enders at weekly nightly family affairs is by far the worst, bad conspiracy, bad sequence, and the worst behavior of any soap, worse than the Americans and it says something. <br /> <br /> I find it very frustrating that all these shows on Uktv Australia "are so far behind the UK, and when one tries to find out why this happens, it just tells you a story to show double episodes to be captured There is no need to say that it will never happen, I am very glad that family matters are going, they create room for something better, but at the same time I know the reasons why they realized it. what had to leave us in tension? Why do you feel that you have to keep everything from your fans secret? "Should try to keep your public up-to-date. His characters will disappear and reappear for seemingly no reason, engage in people and enjoy their lives." why family issues should end, even if we are so far behind here in australia, it is easy to see that writers have few ideas for new land, so much plot repeats and old episodes are coming back. introducing new characters, lots of them are really bad actors like scratching the bottom of the barrel and ending with Drek greetings Vince
