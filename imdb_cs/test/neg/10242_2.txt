The strange thing about Galaxina isn't that it's totally wrong, even if it is. Strangely, despite being totally wrong, it's not funny. Very bad movies have their own brand of unintended humor - the secret to their success, you can say. But the galaxy is completely different - it's the worst MST3K nightmare, a bad movie in which deliberate * and * unintentional humor falls straight. It's easy to see why deliberate jokes fail - and the reasons are quite colorful. Sometimes it is a question of timing; sometimes it is a good idea to be poorly processed (a human restaurant * could be cheerful, but it wasn't); sometimes it feels like a mix appears in the cutting room, with the floor appearing; and sometimes jokes are just bad jokes. Bad movies get laughter from such an unintentional effort. It's harder to figure out why Galaxina doesn't care about this number. Something is slightly wrong with the unintentional humor in this film, just as something is wrong (at all slightly) with deliberate humor. This is a totally bad film, whose very poor nature is not what it redeems. In my experience, it's absolutely unique.
