I am currently 22 years old and I remember how this movie appeared in theaters when it first came out. You heard me right, I was 5 years old, and yet I can still clearly remember what I saw many years ago. Was it a mystical journey through the fantastic world of Mark Twain's creativity? ... No, on the other hand, it was a pretty creepy movie about the dark, depressing and actually suicidal side of Mark Twain. One scene that still annoys me was a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain plays the organ at his own funeral. Would this movie be for adults? Well, this movie may contain some interesting insights that one could use with Mark Twain's working knowledge; But believe me, "Adventures" is not the movie you want to use to introduce your little children to Mark Twain.
