We Take: The most powerful of the AIRPORT movies, and probably one of the worst movies of the 70s disaster. As if milk franchise with all its content, producers of this third sequel AIRPORT fit in more action, silly subplots, gratuitous star performances and goofier elements. In his attempt to be the biggest AIRPORT yet, CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 is the worst yet, and probably one of the worst movies of the 70s disasters. With his bad results at the box office, it's no wonder that this genre has surpassed its welcome. The film opens with a rather catchy Lalo Schifrin score, supported by impressive footage of the titular aircraft. in his former glory (the same aircraft used in this film would be involved in the crash in July 2000). But then there are credits and we look into an "all-star" cast that is nothing more than faded Hollywood stars, TV actors and not very popular B actors. The storyline is stronger than ever: George Kennedy is back in the role of Joe Patroni, now a Concorde pilot (piloted by pilot Alain Delon) on his way to France after the Summer Olympics. Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely), a reporter who has just discovered that his friend, a renowned weapon manufacturer, Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), is selling his weapons to terrorists. To prevent it from revealing news to the world, Harrison sends his rockets and the best saboteurs to prevent the Concorde from landing. The cast / subplot is more stupid than ever, even stronger than the alcoholic Myrna Loy or the singing nun. We have Cicely Tyson, who transports a living human heart in the cooler (!), Martha Raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character doesn't go deeper than that), J.J. Walker and a saxophonist with smoking (probably the most naughty character in the movie), Eddie Albert married an old woman Sybil Danning, Avery Schreiber as a Russian coach with a deaf daughter, and a love story between reporter Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici coach Mercedes McCambidge). In addition, the film gets much closer to the LOVE BOAT episode than ever with the strongest portraits of Charo (and her pet Chihuahua) and Bibi Anderson. Camp enthusiasts will undoubtedly receive real kick-in-the-ball in this stupid entry into the long 70's tribe. This is a real disaster in more than a word. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 of 5.
