Nishabd means no words. This must be a prerequisite for the scenario before the film is filmed, and so in this film it cries for content. What you go is an unusual love story between a 60-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl, and what you get is a very common, very common event that doesn't excite or surprise. So what's left for us is with the picturesque places of Kerala, which were brilliantly shot by cameraman Amit Roy and the camera-friendly history of the newly found Jiah Khan. It does not cover the lack of a specific scenario. Producer-director Ram Gopal Varma, who has such good results in the field of films, has to stretch his socks. As for Mr Bachchan, I do not want to discuss it with this film. <br /> <br /> I feel a loss of words in the review. I stayed without a word, without words! Personal View: This film can be compared to the same bad movie that was released for a time called BLACK. I don't see the difference between the history of lead characters in both movies. What did you say right now? This was a world bla bla movie theater, and I have no taste. Well, take a walk. No, I don't mean literally, but a real theatrical performance of this film. Because in this case, you can find this movie as an Oscar material.
