I have to admit that I am not a big fan of Satanic horror movies and it seems to me that I like them less and less whenever I see a new film, and it's not surprising to watch movies like Satan Fraternal! Despite my low ratings on IMDb, I was surprised when I heard some good stuff about this movie and my expectations increased. That turned out to be a big mistake, because that's exactly the movie that suggests his rating: it's very bad! The story is your basic bundle of satanists that is causing problems, and we are focusing on a small town where people have been murdered and kidnapped and it is not entirely clear why. Satanists are behind it and it is bad news for a mother, father and daughter on a trip who are trapped in a mysterious city. I had the feeling that this movie could be in the same spirit as the miserable satanic movie 'The Devil's Rain', and although it's not as stupid as Robert Fuest's later film, it's no better. It looks like the plot is quite on Earth, but it's also a bit boring and I can't say I was having fun during this movie. Of course, the Satanic Brotherhood has its fans, but I'm not one of them; this is a movie that I don't see a reason to recommend ...
