It comes from an adult who accidentally stumbled upon the first and waited for a film aimed at children and was surprised by the adult humor that was in New Groove's emperors. I liked the Chronicle the most, so I was excited to hear about the sequel (other than "Kronk"). I just watched Kronk's New groove, it took me two days because I had to shut down, I was so bored in half over it. The next day I was finally watching the rest, and unfortunately the other half was a bit feeble first. Being a Disney movie I expected to have some music scenes, but this was filled with them and they weren't fun. The great thing I found about New Groove emperors was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience, from toddlers to adults. Kronks New Groove in all honesty did nothing for me or my girlfriend and we both loved first. It's really aimed at small children, comedy is pretty childish, music scenes aren't very well done and the plot itself is extremely challenging. <br /> <br /> Save money and, if possible, rent a movie is definitely not worthy of a second viewing. I was incredibly disappointed and shocked at how this film was put together. In fact, they managed to build a character (Kronk) in this film not funny, which is amazing in itself. Of course, each opinion is different, but I am very amused, I usually enjoy continuing (sp) though others discredit them, mostly because I loved the first one so much that I needed more characters and without no matter how bad the plot was, I enjoyed the movie. I can't say the same for this, I'd never think I'd turn it off halfway through pure boredom. Buy at Own Risk.
