The first thing I noticed is music. It's not as amazing as the scary theme of Rugger Deodat Cannibal Holocaust or the masterpiece of Tale of The Two Sisters, but I won't let it stop in the movie so soon. It is to be assumed that a woman examining her hypothesis for her dissertation that cannibalism as an organized practice never existed would think that it must take into account that they are wrong and prepare for way accordingly? Or why are you even going if you already believe the hypothesis is true before it was tested? This is quite incredibly ignorant and makes the movie seem to be much more unrealistic and wrong script. This is actually similar to Ruggero Deodato, just totally wrong. No weapons, no decent hiking clothes, just nonsense through and through. People don't go to such college trips without months of planning and training. But I Turn ... <br /> <br /> Things don't get to a very good start for our brave but stupid adventurers who are out of the way to skip the iguana jaywalking, and their bait pet Ferrets fall off the cart almost into it's extinction, then fall into the mud hole, well I think it's time to go. Well, then turn the coins to see if they keep going or forget the whole thing. How does the scene make sense? All their beliefs are based on turning the coin? After having to spend time, and money, and preparing just there. That is getting worse. Defiinitely some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever fictional for the film industry. Mike talks about how he and his friend were captured by cannibals and put in cages in the mud pit with 3 inches of long leech sucking on their blood. I found it interesting, because when you remember the first cannibal in which they enter in the jungle, the man they mistakenly think of as a simple native is sitting on the ground and drinking such leeches ... wondering if they are the same? Indeed, although this movie is just awful, the scenario is horrible and acting is emotionless regardless of content. They simply agree to prefer to give up rather than to eat them by cannibals, as if it were no big decision. Mike is obviously crazy, but just like in the first film that heals a native with such a terrible behavior, he is simply unrealistic. Rugger Deodat's film easily feels that the Americans got what they deserved, while in this film they are barely blamed for the natives for what the Americans have once again attacked. And that's why the film is somewhat pointless. We've already got a point from the first movie, so why was it a sequel? Lieutenant's name is Rizzo?! Could it be even worse? Often with movies like these, when you look into the cast you'll find that they don't really act in many other movies and their bios are all but they don't exist so you can imagine I was surprised to find Giovanni Lombardo Radice in this movie, who was in Scorsese's gangs in New York. Lt. Rizzo looked familiar and found himself in the Spiderman 2002 movie as a very small captain in a tug. He reminds me how William Shatner went from Admiral to USS Enterprise to a cop in the car. Ironically, sometimes irony works. Shatner could never get the music right until his recent album "Has Been", which is really good as well as Bono from U2 could never get the hairstyle right, and Dan Marino could never win any Superbowly. Sometimes irony is just sad, just like Christopher Reeve, Superman can't go ironically. The man will always be a legend because he was such a great guy that I turned once again. At this point you can say that I was quite bored that I even discussed Cannibal Ferox. The cannibal Holocaust message was about who the real savages are and what's really bad? What do savages do in natural life unknown to our moral records or what do we do to others with malicious intent? It seems that the cannibal Ferox report is "Be careful what you are looking for because you may find it." I'll say it for Cannibal Ferox. When Gloria returns and writes his dissertation, claiming that cannibalism does not exist, saves others who would be curious and go where angels are afraid of pedaling, but overall this film was really bad. <br /> *** / 10
