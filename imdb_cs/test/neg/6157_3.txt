The story and characters really needed work. The idea of ​​the world is a kind of neat, but no one has bothered to develop either of them either through exposure or through conspiracy. Despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the movie, it makes sense that you wouldn't use the exposure because nobody is new in this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) wander off the field and get lost, and get acquainted with believers and fat, lazy, rich people in the museum, we get no real idea of ​​who these people are, or why we should take care of them. Smart movies have ways to develop it simply by having characters in the world. Simple things like ordering a drink at a bar or talking about something in the past are things that make the movie world unforgettable, not endless shots of crappy planes and cheap CG effects of someone trying to make loops in ultralight. <br /> <br /> If it's too hard for you, here's a little tip - collect a few places. If everything becomes disjointed because you often pull up, stay in one place for a moment and talk a little bit about the characters. All unnecessary crap should be removed. Get rid of the whole scene of the wind believers. Get rid of people full of museums. Get rid of all the annoying flying crap if you can't make a sentence relevant to the story. Do the whole thing on a big plane or something. People just talk about something that matters to us. Hey, get rid of Bill Paxton. Keep the film center around the character of Tasker and his relationship with the robot, Byron. Indeed, the biggest problem with the film is that we don't care about anyone because nobody has time to either explain their motivation or dive into their characters. We don't like Matt (among other things because he is also played by Bill Paxton). He's a villain who doesn't buy enough, except to let the android, Byron, go. And this action is even less important than most of these three key points: 1. Byron is a killer. 2. Byron is indestructible 3. Byron can leave any time damn good. We try as Byron because there is some kind of pathos, but it is largely undeveloped. All we have left is an angry, glassy-looking robot that acts like a muffled and timeless moment, and practically zany. We don't know why or how it develops emotions, but we know he murdered someone. We do not know why he murdered someone or the circumstances of this terrible event because he is not developed. We cannot feel compassion for him if we do not know the story. All we know is the fact that he's killing people. And he likes Bill Paxton. We hate Tasker enough (partly because he is played by a good boy Mark Hamill) because while grumpy and ruthless, he does nothing of the ordinary for his character - a post-apocalyptic peace officer. Sure he would kill Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug traffickers on the road to growing poppy for heroin. And first he shoots him. He won't kill anyone who doesn't get in the way or who doesn't try to hurt him physically. This applies equally well to the last confrontation in the museum. He uses a crest of police brutality against a lazy dilettant (F. Murray Abraham is wasted in this role), and everyone else draws a gun at him. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand what it is to solve Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), a partner of Tasker. After only 10 minutes with Matt, she is ready to switch sides, despite her loyalty screams, and despite the fact that Matt was telling her garbage. If it's love, then I choose hate every day. <br /> <br /> Really. Paxton's character is about as sweet as Simon in "True Lies" or Pvt. Hudson from "Foreigners". Anyone in these movies? No why? Because he's a fool and a fool. Why put him at the forefront of this movie?
