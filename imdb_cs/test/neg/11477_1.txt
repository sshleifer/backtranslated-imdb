That's the worst comedy I've ever seen. It's hard to explain because (if you haven't seen it) I bet you've never seen a comedy that wasn't good or bad; it's just there (that's the original part - not good or bad, just there)! Allow me to say that I've seen every comedian appearing in the lead role, and like everyone else. That's a secret. Support wires actually work (even if the dialogue is bad). The only character that's pretty good is the one played by John Goodman. He has a pretty good job with what little dialogue has and actually has one funny line (I'm not going to mess up the funny line in the movie if you decide to watch that. I'm not going to call them characters because no characters have been developed. This scenario is so youthful that they don't even bother to give fictitious names to the leader. They all just use their own. Nor does it seem to be trying to act. It's as if everyone read aloud to each other from the scripts the local junior sent them. I actually wrote a paper for my English class when I was thirteen. It wasn't even funny. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, just don't bother to rent it. It's not funny. Nor does it have a bad dialogue that you could groan. I just sat there looking through the whole thing. It was so boring that I couldn't even irritate how bad it was. I can't imagine how it is even rating 4 here.
