What in the world! This piece of game theater would be suitable for Lifetime Network. Michael Imperoli is a good actor, but I think his depiction as "Stu" has lost. The assemblies were unbearable and too much. Support cast where are you? The casting party should be partly to blame. The camera was useless. It's a story about gambling with after school. Stories of this kind should be left in the world of Oliver Stone. It would still suck butt, but at least it would be fun to watch. It was an attempt to lose bikes before the race started. Mario Andretti in Indy 500 1982 came to mind.
