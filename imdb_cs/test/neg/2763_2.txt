If this film is an accurate representation of J. Smits' acting skills, I think he made a big mistake when he left TV. Didn't he watch any movies that David Caruso played, especially "Cold Around the Heart"? As for the acting ability, what Mary-Louise did, much better. Yes, it is a terrible scenario, idle and completely lacking in continuity, but skilled actors can and have overcome similar obstacles. Very disappointing.
