I was at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto for 10 years and the event I saw was completely different than I saw on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD I was watching. I do not understand how wwE does not have rights to some old music because most of these songs were created by WWF, which should not be afraid of royalties and royalty that prevent exhibitions like SNL from the season's release. It's pretty stupid to whine, but for me hearing Demolition come out on their theme music at Wrestlemania personally was the memory that I never forgot, and it didn't exist on this DVD. What is their purpose even to own the rights to this huge video library if it has to be so drastically modified?
