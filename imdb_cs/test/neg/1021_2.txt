The Southern Cross, written and directed by James Becket, is a waste of good celluloid and an actor's endeavor. A film formula is not necessarily bad if it pays off on its promise that the film does not have. It is a tedious combination of film clich√©s that can be traced to thousands of different films from the past. It is full of random and empty twists that add nothing but aimless action, such as the protagonists' trip to the ghost town, followed by inexplicable rascals. This was apparently conceived as a pretext for firing and escape scene bordering on the nonsense when people poured in and out the door and ran around the windows while guns were shooting at each other. One believes that someone has told Becket that there is a ghost town in the Chilean foothills, and he said, "Oh, great, there you can make a scene." Don't waste money on this. It's a lot of random pieces and pieces of hundreds of different movies that are thrown together and called action drama.
