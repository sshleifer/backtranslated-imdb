I don't believe I saw a horror movie so bad because ... damn, I don't believe I've ever seen that horror movie so bad. The act alone was enough to make it happen. Bad behavior went far beyond the fearsome film. It was just awful. And have you checked those divine special effects? When the demon (who looked more like a low-cost puppet) came out of the wall, I couldn't tell if I should be scared or laugh at my ass. As a huge horror fan of the genre, this film was more than a slight disappointment. I couldn't help but notice that the director is from Portland, OR, which is my own hometown. I must say I'm ashamed. If I could, I'd give this movie a negative 500.
