Kokoda was inspired by events on the Kokoda track during World War II, when Australian militias slowed down and eventually stopped the pressure of 10,000 Japanese soldiers to move on land and capture Port Moresby. In fact, this means that the movie is set in this time period, but it's fiction and all that is happening is just a tangle of standard scenes from other war movies. The first hour is just one clich√© after another. Some scenes are just there to draw us into the feeling that this conflict was frightening when it seems that there is little evidence. Both sides fought hard for control of the track and neither party was proven. Both sides suffered from a logistical shortage, and the terrain was a big deal in this conflict. As the Japanese approached Port Moresby, their supply line grew and it eventually led to their downfall. On the other hand, when the Australians retreated closer to Port Moresby, their supply line decreased. Some scenes seem to be straight from the manual on standard scenes to include in any war movie. The film was misleading and emphasized the youth in the production team. At a time when Australia was able to do a big movie about one of Australia's best moments, Kokoda is a shallow disappointment.
