After September 11 in New York, this drama about American firefighters was conceived as a greeting and tribute to their professionalism. The story is narrated with a series of flashbacks where after Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) firefighters crashed across the floor of a burning building, and only communicate with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) over the radio. Basically, Flashbacks show how Jack grows out of recruit when he sees Kennedy as a father figure to become a fireplace legend. Currently, Jack's comrades are trying to get him, but it's too late, and he'll let them leave, ahead of his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they know. They also play with Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Robert Patrick as Terminator 2 as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan. Finally, the flames of the film are all I could pay attention to and enjoy the way the characters deal with them. Sufficient!
