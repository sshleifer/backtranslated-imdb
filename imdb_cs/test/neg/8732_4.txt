Rock Hudson's second venture in the sci-fi genre after Seconds is an Embryo film that combines the elements of the bride Frankenstein and Pygmalion in one somewhat strange movie about the lack of a better word test tube baby growing up to be Barbara Carrera. Hudson is a scientist who experiments in organic development and has a chance to first experiment with his own Doberman Pinscher when he is accidentally hit by his car. Some female pituitary secretions are given to a premature baby and grow remarkably into an adult. Noble by his success, Hudson takes the fetus from the dead accident victim and puts it some of the same thing. <br /> <br /> What he gets is Barbara Carrera. And it develops physically and intellectually at a marvelous speed. What he doesn't do is evolving emotionally. Still Hudson passes her as his new research assistant to friends and family as sister-in-law Diane Ladd, son of John Elerick and daughter-in-law Anne Schedeen. Embryo does not examine some of the real problems of this kind of science, but uses them instead. Special effects, as they are, are quite second. Hudson seems to have lost interest in the project about halfway through the film. What would be really interesting is if he managed to get a boy and grow up on a Harlequin hero. Now it would be something Rock Hudson could sink his teeth.
