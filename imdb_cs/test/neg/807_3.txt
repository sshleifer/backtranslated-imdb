Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who hunts with his favorite dog. However, the dog seems to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps behind him. It soon turns out that, despite the fact that Hunnicutt and his dog were roaming the water after they left the water, they both died in the water - no one reacts to them when they talk and see and hear people talking about his death and the death of the dog. Still, it is strange that Hunnicutt is really slow to catch up and it takes him a moment to understand that he is talking about him! I think it was actually done as a padding because there really wasn't enough material to fill half an hour of slot time. Later, in a "surprise twist", he comes to heaven - or at least his concept of the place. He is invited, but because he does not allow dogs, he has other ideas! Overall, he acted reasonably well, but dubious spiritual values! With no twists or irony, this episode is a bit boring - not "Twilight Zone-y" enough for my taste.
