Princess Warrior is a sci-fi action movie with a pretty thin plot - basically on the death of their queen mother two sisters, one evil and one good, a struggle for control of the throne. A good sister is defeated, so she runs on Earth, where she appears to be naked naked in a strip club amid a wet shirt contest. The rest of the film is basically one long chase because the evil sister tries to find and kill a younger good sister. However, Bob, a kind-hearted DJ, helps a younger sister, and everything is complicated by the involvement of the police and ignorance of good habits and cultures. The older sister catches her younger sibling several times, but the other man can escape and run again. Throughout this event, there is a cult of women on the home planet that have some kind of cosmic age to bring the good sister back. Sadly, much of this movie seems to be a rather boring car to chase scenes when they drive around Los Angeles (and what was it that sound effect when a police car crashed ???) The film culminates in another physical struggle between nurses with a predictable End. It seems to be borrowing elements from Star Wars (light sabers and the look of the girls' home planet in the opening and following scenes), Dr. Who (telephone booth as a means of transport) and some of the costumes (from the cult on the home planet) could be taken from the Star Trek episodes. Mrs. Dana Fredsti (evil sister in the film) in another user commentary mentioned "endless (and boring) wet T-shirt competition. It's the longest wet t-shirt competition ever in the cinema history and the only one where the contestants were Wearing industrial cotton polyester shirts that resisted all the efforts to be wet and translucent I couldn't say better The only thing I would add is that the music in this scene is just annoying. The games are at the top, but it seems to suit the whole film style, and the actors who played Vinnie and Vito were too much for me - I just found them uncomfortable. he does not take the whole thing too seriously, unlike Sharon Lee Jones, who behaved decently, but seemed to take everything more seriously, and all the police officers were portrayed as blatant idiots, probably adding comic relief, which is a bit left the film was rather comical. <br /> <br /> In terms of evaluation, this film had a lot of bad language; some topless women and others terribly dressed in thongs, but not enough skin to satisfy those who seek nudity; one sexual scene depicted in a non-graphic fashion style; and little violence - though there was a threat of violence across all scenes, sword fighting and beating were exaggerated, and the camp was "offensive", even though the actors seemed to have a lot of fun with it. > <br /> I wonder who came up with the character names? Ovule, Curette (a surgical tool used for scratching and cleaning), Exzema (a suspiciously similar disease characterized by scalable skin and itching), bulemia (eating disorder with binging and cleansing) and Rickettsia (another disease)? Overall, it's a bad, low budget, campy, sci-fi action movie, but I enjoyed it, though I might need a few more drinks.
