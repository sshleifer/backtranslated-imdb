As a writing teacher, there are two ends that I will never allow students to use: "Then I woke up" and "Then I ran over the truck." Now I add: "Then I hit my head." I feel it is absolutely unfair to use these tricks to hide the lack of imagination. The whole issue of transmigration could be dealt with with some intelligence and craft, but in this film they couldn't or wouldn't do it. I'm not saying it's totally worthless, but it is so predictable in its progress, except for the stupid end. There are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this guy. They should have done it immediately. It's just a forgotten, borderline horror / sci fi movie that has nothing to offer.
