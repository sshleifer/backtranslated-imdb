Terrorists should watch this video as torture, not only for the worrying last scene in which tying and hitting a woman with mental health problems is probably a source of comedy. for about half an hour it would convince even the bravest fundamentalists to spill beans rather than sit down for more than one minute of the disaster. This movie is terrible. I rented it because a friend said it was merry to find out he was talking about a director who was making a comment and not about the film itself. I think if you find that fearless arrogance is fun, you like it. It is probably true that he goes on and on about the chicks that "banged", which is most tasteless when he is the main actress on the screen. Actually CJ Stacy was the only good part of this movie - her charisma shines like a diamond in this horrible dung pile. This is probably the only movie she made by IMDb, I hope she is involved in theater or indie stuff because I think she has a talent and natural beauty that really benefits every production.
