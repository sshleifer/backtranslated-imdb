Murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect to be made for television, but not. Being the only player to comment on, Bullock is (though Michael Pitt seems to be moving to bigger and better things), it's no big surprise that this movie quickly breaks away from the memory that will replace the more important things. Like ... you remember when you lock the front door when you go out. Or return your clothes back when you leave the shower. Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, police with personal problems (not all). She and her new partner (wet Ben Chaplin) are invited to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual except that the perpetrators are a few teenage students who think they have planned and performed a perfect murder. As the investigation continues, a battle of wills will appear between Cassie and the chief suspect Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling). The crippling problem is that these two lines are hopeless. Bullock, while looking at her very well, is in the role of a stubborn cynical cop like Rodney Dangerfield (in fact he would be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete unregistered subject and I'm sorry to have to put this film in his resume in his attempt to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, as the rushing, smiling suspects, are appropriately adopted. As if the reluctant leadership was not enough bad enough, a story that would send someone who was asleep and a highly predictable (but illogical) end to this movie in his head before he could run. Murder by number "Nothing at all, even the nonsensical nude scene from Bullock wouldn't buy her. Well, just a little, but not enough to save it. Forgotten, predictable and redundant - this is one movie that won't move the genre of ponytail forward. As Cassie probably says next time, there's nothing there people see. Keep moving ...
