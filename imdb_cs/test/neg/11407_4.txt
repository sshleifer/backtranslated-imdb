I swear I didn't want to! I chose it just because it looked good on the back! This film wasn't terrifying at all and was actually very confusing. The demon wind was actually used only a few times, and people were killed quite cheerfully. One major light spot saw Sherri Bendorf from Slaughterhouse playing in it. When I saw what had happened to her, I made up this little little movie. And 3 out of 10. NEXT!
