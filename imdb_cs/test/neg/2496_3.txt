The United States has built an atomic bomb to show its superior military power and to end World War II. Fat Man and Little Boy depict American physicists' efforts to devise the technology necessary to create the bomb and tension that existed between scientists and the military over the possible use of the bomb, and even the acceptability of its creation. Scientists thought the bomb should be a deterrent, a mechanism that would stop the war by wasting as little life as possible. Fist, they saw themselves as in a race with German scientists, who attempted to build nuclear weapons themselves. When the Germans were defeated, many scientists hoped to stop working on the bomb project because they knew that the Japanese did not have the technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon and therefore do not pose a threat to massive loss of life. Those who favored the sequel to the Manhattan Project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration, inviting the Japanese head of state to view its deployment on any small desert island. This massive demonstration of the force they felt would be enough to win the war - no killing would be needed. The US Army, under the command of General Leslie Groves, had hoped all the time to use the bomb as a real weapon to be deployed against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against the Japanese. Due to the persistence of Japanese soldiers on the small Japanese islands, the US decided to drop the bomb on populated cities to end the war, first Hiroshima and then Nagasaki. The demonstration of this enormous amount of power has also alerted the rest of the world that the US is the dominant military force, with a focus on Russia, whose increasing military strength and economic weight in Eurasia threaten our world's leading position. Fat man and little boy was a movie that meant good intentions, but mistakenly confused them wrongly with the choice of actors, scripts and cinematography. One of the main points of the film was the struggle between a military look at science for killing and a scientific view of science for knowledge. The basis of this conflict is the continuing disagreement between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman performs his job in the General, Goofy, Massively Angry and radiates his dependence on the project's success. Dwight Schultz, on the other hand, never raises much resistance to the demands of the general, who in his listeners always looks rather weak, deflated and phlegmatic. John Cusack presents an incredibly unsympathetic figure in the flat role I've ever seen - he looks like he is reading his lines. Laura Dern seems to be suffering from the same disease. None of the characters help a scenario that is almost childishly ridiculous in the way it attempts to explain scientific concepts unconsciously, offering the most realistic share relationship between Mr. Cusack and Mrs. Dern, which one can imagine, nor does it give us the cheap excitement of watching the military drop nuclear bombs on Japan, and relies on a technique that is bad at any time, even though it explains the characters that are the innermost thoughts or narrations about something that could not appear on the film medium, but used to read some absolutely banal selections from Cusack's Diary. The cameraman offers us some shots of the ominous shadow of two bombs that might be striking if it didn't look like cardboard cutouts instead of a bomb, but a fake atomic fire really looks fake - and why use it when the shots are hand-shaking are so breathtaking and realistic - and the ubiquitous brown tone doesn't seem thematically appropriate. Besides, it's not a bad movie.
