I always liked Bill Murray in movies like Lost in Translation and the movie trailer looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. Murray plays Jack Corcorin, who recently discovered that his father had died, and is expected to hear his will. He finds out that his father was a clown because he left a big shoe, his whistling nose and his main heritage, the elephant! The only way Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4,000 miles in 4 days and get him to a safe $ 30,000 zoo. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are little tiny moments of humor, such as a truck front bending forward, and Murray screaming, but overall it's useless. Pretty poor!
