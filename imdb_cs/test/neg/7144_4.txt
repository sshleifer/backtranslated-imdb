I finally rented this video after searching for many months. At first I just wanted to see it because I'm out and out of fan Neil Pearson (Patrick, friend of Isobel, head). However, the film stands very well without Neil (although he handles himself very well in this film, he is overshadowed by three major female characters). It's a scary, intense movie that the British do so well - certainly "chick swings" into the house and it's an isolated setting that gives the film almost "Wuthering Heights" aura. The film is full of tension and end, shocking, yet inevitable. I'm glad I watched it, it was worth waiting
