Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can watch the same movie with one of them who loves him, and the other one hates him. As for "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers," I fall into the second category. I'm of the opinion that John Carpenter made one of the best films of this decade in 1978. \ t Despite its shortcomings, it still keeps well into the 21st century. She has repeatedly used many old horror movies, but has used them in an original and effective way. She had no preconceptions that it was anything but a movie about an escaped psychiatric patient watching babysitting at Halloween Night. Yet there were "ideas" in the film, but they were gently introduced and not pushed into the skull. He compared the myths about the macabre festival with the reality of what was happening in the story, with amazing ambiguity. The 'Filmmakers' of this 'movie' probably don't even understand the previous paragraph. That is why we are captivated by this unfortunate and awkward piece of disposable celluloid. The direction, scenario, and playing are the lowest layers you can imagine. This is the type of film that is so insensitive and boring that you want to crawl back into the uterus and die. It is also really, really sad to see a veteran British actor Donald Pleasence wasting his acting skills with this spit puddle of film. He seems to be deprived of all energy and resigned to the fact that it may be his last film. Maybe it killed him.
