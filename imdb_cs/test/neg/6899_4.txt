This film seemed to be very fast in graphics and graphics. My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie, which rarely happens when we go to theaters. That was Nickelodeon Production, and it would be better if they released it at t.v. station. The animation itself was in some parts o.k. but the plot was terrible. The classic story of a son trying to meet his father's expectations is used in many children's films, but animation or graphics must be really good to keep the baby's attention. This was not the case with this film. There were also unpleasant elements between the leading male character and the leading female character that the plot could not do.
