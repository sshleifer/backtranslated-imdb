The Mexican Werewolf in Texas is located in the small border town of Furlough, where Anna (Erika Fay) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes) and has a Mexican friend named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) who is determined to watch the animal that terrorized the city, killed farm animals and several residents, including some of their friends. Local Mexican legends talk about Chupacabra, the evil myth and legend. Erm, I'm fighting now because not so much is actually happening ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Scott Maginnis I'm not going to beat the bushes here and just say that the Mexican werewolf in Texas is a terrible time. The script only sometimes mentions the word Werewolf once and for the rest of the time it is referred to Chupacabra, in fact I suspect that it was not really conceived as a werewolf flick at all. The "werewolf" creature looks mostly hairless and more like some bad dog, there is no reference to anyone changing during the full moon and actually attacking a few occasions during the day, there is no transformation scene and at the end when it is killed, not changed to anyone. To be honest, unlike the name, there is nothing to mark the film Werewolf at all and even the name is just a rip-off of the highly popular American werewolf in London (1981). This is the kind of homecoming that I personally think is killing a horror genre for how long it was because there was a real low budget horror movie like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978) or Friday the 13th (1980), which were all made from shoe budgets, perhaps The Blair Witch Project (1999), but this is in recent years and crap like Mexican Werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance of being considered a classic. The character is terrible and things happen around them, dialogue is nonsense, the pace is terrible, the story sucks and practically sent me to sleep and as a whole this movie is just stupid, I'm sorry, but I don't know how to describe it otherwise. Director Maginnis does nothing to watch, there's an annoying hand-held camera type camera that could easily give someone a headache and quickly 'blink and miss' editing that just annoy and irritate to the same extent . It's not scary, it's not nudity, there's no tension or atmosphere, and special effects are terrible. The monster really looks bad and it's no wonder the Maginnis keeps it in the shade, or shortens their scenes so fast that you never get a good look at it. There is no color in the picture either, it's almost black, or over saturated desert sand oranges. Gore consists of several false guts (blinks and you will miss them!), A few bloody wounds and a separate arm, a big problem. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 300,000 I admit that the budget was low, but I just refuse to accept that for making such a garbage movie, there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their poor budgets go far. The whole thing has the appearance of a home movie, it has no style and is indeed bland and boring. Acting sucks too, though you probably already knew that. The Mexican Werewolf in Texas will probably join several people in rent / purchase / tracking because they might mistakenly think it is a sequel to John Landis, which is certainly not and not even a good werewolf. Don't be fooled by it's horrible & I am enough of having to waste time / money on home amateur crap like this.
