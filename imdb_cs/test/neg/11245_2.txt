My mother forced me to watch this movie with her as one of the victims of the whole Enron scandal. How many times can I say terrible? The script was so weak, using cliché clichés. The writers seem to have put this story together with several articles about Enron. When we watched the movie, we were honestly able to complete about half the lines and thoughts of one-dimensional characters. I realize that it was probably adjusted from the book, but was it so bad? I do not know what to say. Just awful. Best on film? Shannon Elizabeth was actually holding her clothes. Besides, this movie gets a big fat F.
