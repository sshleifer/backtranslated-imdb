Why was this film made? What were the creators of this thinking?!?! The first 8MM film had at least a storyline that made sense and was potentially interesting. The first film was about the sniffing film industry. This sequel is about ... keep ... porn industry! Yes, as if the snuff industry, the industry in which people are reportedly being killed for a movie for entertainment, was in the same league with the adult film industry, the industry in which people film other people dealing with unstimulated sexual acts and situations . for eroticism. The idea itself should warn you about how badly conceived the idea for this film is itself. He is not helped by the lack of conspiracy, character, acting, direction, script, logic, theme, or even sound design. This is a remarkably boring movie that never interested me. Literally nothing works. Why would a mysterious thriller movie about porn industry that involve assassination and treacherous work anyway? I am not very interested in adult movies, but I have certainly watched them before. Why would someone do a film about what's wrong, and that they would do it in the sequel to the snuff movie? I don't even know if there is an industry involved in the production of snuff films, but I hope it doesn't. The idea of ​​a snuff film itself is frightening, and only people who are really sick and ill will be part of it. I don't think the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture. I'm sure a lot of people do pornographic films for good intentions rather than hurting and killing people. It's never okay to hurt other human beings. The adult film industry is not about injuring people. It's about creating movies that are distracting and waste of time for me. What is the movie trying to say? It does not work.
