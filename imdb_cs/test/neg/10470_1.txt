Bone Eater is located in the small desert town of Alabama, where developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) finances the construction of a large resort. Later one night, three of his workers, Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rae) dig the foundations in the desert as they discover what looks like a tomahawk ax, unfortunately an ancient Indian demon called a bone eater comes and kills them Yippee. Local Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) is soon breathing Krantz's throat when the resort's construction stops, Sheriff Evans also has to deal with a bone demon because he kills anyone he encounters ... <br /> <br /> You know, that I consider myself a fairly big fan of the horror and sci-fi genre, I definitely don't think my opinion is more valuable than anyone else (unlike many others here on IMDb ...), but please believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the worst Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' I've ever seen and is against some damn strong competition. As a horror and sci-fi fan, there are two names that, when dealing with film, send after my spine shakes in anticipation of how bad it turns out, these names are Jesus 'I have no talent' Franco, who has nothing to do with Bone Eater & Jim Wynorski, who drove an absolute catastrophe that is Bone Eater. In fact, Bone Eater is so wicked Wynorski hiding under the pseudonym Bob Robertson, when a director as bad as Wynorski hides under a pseudonym you know the film must be bad. Where should I start? Bone Eater is just the worst movie I've seen this year & is so bad that it's untrue, the story is horrible, the screenplay is sloppy (Sheriff Evans at one point tells Kia to meet him in the hospital, but when there they meet later) surprised the acts and says, "What are you doing here?", at one point Sheriff Evans declares victoriously that we are in the twentieth century, and that ancient Indian demons are nonsense, although in fact we are in the twenty-first century, when a woman tells a flashback story where three men wake up Bone Eater & kills them, but because she killed all three of them, how did anyone else know to pass it on in the legend? a little awkward. The character is a horrible clich√©, a town sheriff who saves the day, his daughter gets involved, which adds some personal motivation, and as for Native Americans there is an old wise man, a young hot head who hates a "white man" and a young woman. who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like Storm Cloud & Black Hawk. The film is as boring as hell, nothing happens, the story is horrible, it is full of holes and blackouts in any kind of logic, set-pieces are horrible, there is no horror or gore or tension or mystery and Bater Eater is just a kind of movie, thanks to which you lose the will to live. Bone eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I have seen in a while, from a rodent who looked stiff to a moving bone individual who alone is just a selection of bones magically held together on a motorcycle that jumped a large gap to the horrible CGI truck that hit the edge of the cliff for a van that was thrown to one side of the bones of the individual. Whenever the eater needs some speed, the big horse is made of sand and dust! In principle, it is quite a nice idea, but it looks terrible and the scenes have cheese cowboy music on the soundtrack! There's one pointless scene in the end, when Sheriff Evans cuts his own arm (why?) And bleeds, but there's no one drop of blood in it, whenever a eater in the bones kills someone he usually disappears. dust cloud, boring. It is necessary to see the cheerfully crazy climatic breakdown between Sheriff Evans and the bone-eager to be believed, Sheriff Evans comes from horseback with a tribal paint on his face, while a bone-eater also rides his horse and has a contest that is just a competition that is just misinterpret correctly. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of $ 700,000, Bone Eater is filming in a very dull, forgotten and flat style, there's no sense of style at all. Most of the film takes place in bright sunlight and when you look at it on decent TV, the desert scenery is occasionally nice. There are several 'well-known' actors really slumming it here, Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in a similarly themed but much better 'Creature Feature' Snakehead Terror (2004), William Katt will obviously put his name on all the crap as long as long. He gets paid while ex Star Trek man Walter Koenig must be really desperate to agree to appear in this. Bone eater is really a cruel 'creature feature', it's really not much more about it you can say about it other than drive well. The worst movie he ever was on a Sci-Fi channel and that says something, right?
