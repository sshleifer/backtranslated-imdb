But then again, what is it? I chose it at my local 99cent store, you guessed it, 99 cents (plus tax). I remember seeing it on the video as a teenager and I thought it was a cool movie. Too bad a movie and my memories don't match. Regardless, it's not too terrible a way to blow a couple of hours, and it's elegant to see some vintage Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah .... Blah .... Blah .... Man, oh man, I can't think of anything else I could say about this movie ... (Just fill the space to meet the ten-line rule .. .) Good golly, it's pathetic, how bad is this movie, that the best thing I could come up with considering it was five frickin'lines text? So anyway, ten lines of text, huh? Hmmm, ten lines are hard to come by when you don't remember the squat about the movie you just watched.
