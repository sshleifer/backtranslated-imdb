If you've seen this movie, then you'll know it's one of Bollywood's worst movies. Bollywood is known to copy Hollywood movies. Who would know they will copy Terminator 2. The difference between the two film industries is Hollywood spends millions and Bollywood spends 100 thousand (average). This is a problem with this movie, if you want to make a T2-style movie, then do it right. The director added a fake fantasy story about a reincarnated snake who found his long lost girl (in the previous birth) dead 2 boys, but guilt goes to 10 people. Suddenly she reincarnates into the spirit and together they want to kill 10 people she blames for her death. Not to mention that Reincarnated Snake Guy or Villain has some super powers. It can turn into anything, it can fly, disappear, shoot power, wind energy, name it, have it. He even gets pits and survives the T1000 style. You are probably thinking how to survive. Its best to ask and its best not to waste time and money on this movie. His best just to forget this movie even came out. I think it's a shame to use a great starcast for this outrageous movie with a pointless story.
