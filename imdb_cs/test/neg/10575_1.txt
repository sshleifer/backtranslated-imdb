That was the stupidest movie I've ever seen in my life. It's a total loss of money and time. I went to see this movie with my friends, and when the movie wasn't more than one person in the cinema - not that there were a lot of people to see that horrible movie - he said, "Wow, what a good movie." Someone actually left! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated him every minute. My friend put my head on my shoulder, because she had enough after the scene with Rick on the ceiling. It wasn't funny at all. Believe me, I went with 11 other girls and not one of my friends liked it. It was ridiculous! I've seen many movies, but this was the worst! I mean, the scene in the movie is with an old man who stood with a rocket with a dead person. I can't think of these things.
