This movie would be okay, indeed probably excellent if the directors left the interviews and the concert shots separated. "Into the Void" is a great song, and I hate it as it is cut off in the best part to go for a mutter interview with Ozzy Osbourne. It was supposed to be at the end of the movie, or it was in a special feature. The best part of the concert DVD is to give them and let the music play, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to put and simply play because the music is constantly interrupted. However, this film has several powers; concert shots when it plays, it's great. Black Sabbath returns to the scene after a long break without Osbourne and this film captures well: Sabbath basically jumps fans. Of course, fans have a sweet advantage in the film because they see the band live, of course, but they also don't have to deal with the constant conversations that DVD viewers are burdened with. Shame of Jeb Brian and Monica Hardiman (directors) for making the movie! Also, shame on Wyatt Smith for movie editing in such a way.
