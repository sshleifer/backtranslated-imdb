I sat over two hours of pure boredom. I'm looking at the IMDB here, even though it's not on the list, it's on top of 250. I was a little sursped. Although yes. I'm very impressed with Robin's and Matt's acting skills, but he hasn't saved the film yet. I'm not sure what I really didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I despised mathematics. Maybe I'm not too much to talk for two hours. Although I loved "American beauty," but that was it. I just want 2 hours back. It was a great waste of my time. If I miss something in this movie, send me an email. I'm wondering why it's on top 250. And don't say "Because it was a good movie". <br /> <br /> 2/10
