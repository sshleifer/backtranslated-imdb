I don't think I'm going to spoil somebody's experience with this movie by telling you not to see it if you have something better to do than work under the stove. Under it, it gets dirty and sometimes you have to clean it up. I think the film suffers from a lack of sex and violence, even if there's one stunt hound that looks so dangerous that it can only be shot in a country where life is cheaper than beer. The "gargoyle" heart is in the right place, but its ambitions are conservative. It's at least unconventional. But I had a great time playing in it, playing a persistent idiot in a horror movie that says, "What's that hole?" and dies for his arrogance. Plus, I have to meet Michael Pare. Every film junkie should work with B-film at least once before his death. And the Romanians are the most beautiful people I've ever met. Literally the most beautiful. Stroll down the street in Bucarestu: if 7 out of 10 women are not absolutely beautiful, you walk down the street I have not met; and be comforted by the fact that at least 5 out of 10 are available for drinks. Part of the movie was shot at Casa Radio, an abandoned, unfinished classic communist bloc-Georgian Nightmare originally intended to serve the KGB propaganda ministries, ie Radio Not-So-Europe. The building is five storeys high and occupies the city block; the best of all, while its facade exudes a great bravery of the Brotheresque state, is located near the city center as a post-apocalyptic ruin in the burdock and cannabis jungle, which is inhabited by dozens of Roma and dozens of wild dogs. The construction on Casa Radio was suspended when Caucescu and his wife were executed on television in 1989, and holes still appear that appear from the top floor that is sun-burned (offering surrealistic views of a modern quarter-meter stretch of concrete roof, decorated with protruding reinforcement rods and old automobile parts, overlooking the crumbling ancient city) down to the damp, ghostly basement (which doubles in the Gargoyle lair movie). <br /> <br /> Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Casa Radio has hosted several non-union film shoots, including "Highlander III". This is attractive to manufacturers because it's a cheap place, massive in scope and free space, bizarre looking, and without headache insurance because it's still state property. And no one complains if you don't clean up after your production: anything that stays in place is interpolated into the construction of resident gypsies in their shack in this real urban jungle. The director's assistant was bitten by a bloody dog ​​while filming "Gargoyle." Apples provided by catering were pushed into cast service and crew as projectiles in order to keep hunting dogs at bay. I was bitten by wild dogs in Bucarest, once in a bar (!) And once in a city park. Within two weeks, I survived two wrecks, both in taxis, and neither of them saw drivers as a reason to stop cars. <br /> <br /> GEEK NOTE: A Sci-Fi network or channel or whatever was one of the supporters of this movie (the smaller the budget, the more producers on the scene), so it's a little strange that no one had a problem with the original title "Gargoyles" until it was time to show it on Sci-Fi already had an unrelated series of that name. The title was changed sometimes relatively close to release, as I have a color-corrected copy marked by a former title.
