I work in the office on weekends and there is a television that only receives one channel. So I don't have a chance to turn to something better. However, because it provides little background noise. Sometimes I have a decent movie / show. Not today. Today I have a "Breaker Breaker". The city looks like a third set of rates (which is of course). All the actors and villains seem to have just stunned a stunt school. I saw better dramatic action at the carnival. Special effects (the flames at the end of the movie are more fake than Michael Michaels). Even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor ... Badly acting, badly filmed, poorly written film.
