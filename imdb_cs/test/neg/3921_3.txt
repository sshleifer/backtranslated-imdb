Apparently influenced by the success of Pal's "Destination Moon" and Lippert's "Rocketship X-M", it just doesn't mean it's cut. Limited special effects, a thin line of story results in a production that even half a decent cast can't save. I don't believe it here. No one seems surprised to meet with the Martians, just like earthmen, etc.
