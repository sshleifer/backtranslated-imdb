Now you really can u call that movie. I knew some of the movies that Japanese people are doing are good for nothing but this bad one? I think I slept three times in this movie. No horror, some tiny percent (0.2-0.5) comedy. The action admits that he has some, but the scenes are badly filmed, the actors are pathetic. None of the actors did a good job in their own role. They weren't convincing. The script is also terrible. I think this movie can be great, really, but for the sixties (not 100% sure.) I recommend NOT seeing it if you don't want as bored as me. I can't quite imagine this movie got a rating. It's OVER, OVER, OVER RATED !!!. This is, of course, a personal opinion. I don't want to offend anyone, but who could have this bullshit? So I hope this helps someone NOT lose some time "enjoying" this movie. However, it is your choice!
