With horrible movies like this, even considered filmed, it's very easy to understand why Hollywood is in such serious trouble with bad plot and worse remake all the time. I think the viewer is supposed to laugh at their back end through 'black' in-jokes, 'pimp up' view and 'bling'. It's so unbelievable that it's "over the top" and it's so bad that it's even after the "so bad that it's funny" brand again and dropped sharply to "absolutely embarrassing for everyone" I'm very, I'm so sorry for every minute I missed on this. I want my time back! Save Your Suffering, DO NOT LOOK IT. The only reason to even give 1 point in the rating is that 0 was not an option.
