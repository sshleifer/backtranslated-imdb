Despite decades of tax incentives in terms of international visibility, the Canadian film industry is still lagging behind most Central African and Islamic states (surprisingly few Canadian films are released outside their native banks) and Nouvelle-France aka the Brave Battle is another example of why. More than any other country, commercial Canadian cinema is unable to develop its own identity and is stuck in the pale imitation of other countries' failures. On paper, this historic drama might have seemed vaguely promising. There is certainly a rich vein of untapped material in Canada's history, as the French and English warned and bought and sold the colony, though none of it makes a cut here unless you count a strange blink-and-you-miss-scene characters saying "Wolfe's dead" or "Nouvelle-France is no longer" before returning to soap operation. But even if it is not a history lesson, it is neither a drama nor an epic adventure that promises a new title: there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by half a dozen re-enactors, and one shed a shed. The square we've ever seen in Quebec is a fairly flat-lit studio interior, giving many scenes an old television miniseries look, as well as the director Jean Beaudin's reluctance to offer many ways of long shots or even exteriors. What you get for your money is a simple but torn-out romance Harlequin about condemned lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control, where the biggest surprise is that Fabio does not appear in the cast. It is the kind of film that whenever two characters are going to make a beast with two backs where the camera switches to a comfortable furious fireplace or waterfall. The Anglo-Canadian-French co-production, which is not to unite the once-fighting nations like throwing every country with a decent goulash break, this massive box-office disaster was clearly intended as a Canadian Titanic - even if someone he neglected producers that they meant a movie, not a ship - but it turns out to be a cheap cheap revolution without battle scenes, crowds, or a few moments threatening to work with stunning courses in a short time. The Montreal mirror has described it as "so bad that one cannot even find the strength to laugh at it." This is somewhat unfair because while most of the time the film looks like a miniseries under the age of 80, the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny, with the characters who mistakenly put their feet in the bear traps, the horrible husbands who claim: look again at your nice lover, honor cuckold! and our heroine is accused of murder and - gasping! - Trial witchcraft humorous enough to be in Demi Moore's version of Scarlet Letter. Throw in the British British governors, malevolent slaves, and Celine Dion at the end, and you have something that sometimes feels like the kind of movie that Timbo Hines has tried (and still managed to skip wildly) with his legendary War of the Worlds, albeit without a stunning technical incompetence. The versatility of leader David La Hay seems to be limited to the number of other actors that may look like during the movie: it starts looking like Andy Garcia, takes a short look at Al Pacino Revolution, flirts with a pure shaved style Tch√©ka Karyo before turning to younger Ted Danson, as his character grows old. While his introductory scene responds to the news of his father's death with an expression that looks like he is waiting for the director to tell him he can go home, he now promises a bad acting feast, actually giving the impression of moderate support. an actor who is lucky at the last minute when the person who was originally cast has read and saved the script. It shows that he is willing and gives it to him, but the grace and charisma that a part needs is simply not. Billie Piper lookalike Noemie Godin-Vigneau's front lady is not exactly set the screen up despite the center-cast cast as a peasant girl who is the loot of the vile Vincent Perez corrupt and perverted Intendant Le Bigot (that's actually the character's name) double drunk drunk confident Sebastien Huberdeau and the saddest of all, the revolutionary dirty old priest Gerard Depardieu, in a dirty gray-haired wig. It is really a deplorable look to see once a great actor in the absolute rock of his game when he blends movements that look like he was not just losing the will to act, but the will to live with him. He couldn't bother clearly sticking to the English dubbing sessions (or even a couple of long shots where he was very much doubled). A small miracle that talked about retiring at the time of the short film release. Some short comic relief is provided by Jason Isaac in his Patriot default mode, which overlaps Wolfe from Quebec rather as an asthmatic Alf Garnett / Archie Bunker played Timothy Dalton on speed, while Tim Roth William Pitt stands on the sidelines with an occasional confused smile of someone who is built in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and lots of free days, even though it's Benjamin Franklin Colm Meaney. in the film for less than three minutes. (Voltaire and Madame Pompadour go for a few minutes behind the head but do not make any comic or other impression.) Supporting actresses are generally better: Juliette Gosselin and Bianca Gervais as real and adopted daughters of a strikingly beautiful Irene Jacob looking for the world as a young Fanny Ardant is refreshing and deserves much better.
