The lines in the title of this review are the first lines in this film song, a beautifully demented parody (in my opinion, horrible) of "My Favorite Things" from "Music Sound". And this fun little detail is not the only aspect that makes "The Body Shop" aka. "Dr. Gore" (1973) recommends to his colleagues Gore / Trash. A film that was created almost exclusively by J.G. Patterson Jr., who served as a producer, writer, director and lead man as dr. Gore is undoubtedly stupid, but there is no doubt that it is fun and that everyone involved, especially Patterson, was aware that they had not made a masterpiece. Dr. <br /> <br /> Brandon (Patterson) famous but totally crazy plastic surgeon loses his beloved wife Anita, a model in an accident. Along with his hunchbacked assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey), he henceforth kidnaps beautiful young women in order to confront a new, perfect wife from their body parts ... <br /> <br /> "Doctor Gore" is undoubtedly a movie "so The bad thing is it's a good kind of "but it's also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous trashiness. Mad Science has always been one of my favorite horror themes, and in fact it's also one of the most amazing themes for ridiculous movements of Gore Trash. Apparently shooting at a minimal budget, "Doctor Gore" devotes a number of "Frankenstein" films, especially James Whale's masterpiece "The Bride of Frankenstein" (1935), and resembles the appearance of Troma / Herschell Gordon Lewis Gore, such as "The Blood Feast "(1963) - Just that it looks much cheaper and more miserable. Apparently J.G. Patterson's motive was not just to make the fun bright: To be a rather ugly, weird boy, his role as Dr. Brandon gave Patterson the opportunity to discern a pair of hot, barely dressed young women (who later ended up as body part donors in Dr. Brandon's lab. <br /> <br /> Most gore is actually very well-designed for a clearly small budget The dialog contains a few very funny lines ("Give it, it could be a door ... and have your coat not to see you're a hunchback.") In addition to the above-mentioned theme song, "Doctor Gore" also includes a wonderfully crappy look country band called "Bill Hicks and Rainbows" - my new favorite band, NOT. I wondered for the rest of the movie whether Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey, who are an assistant assistant, are twins or even the same person - they both look the same and have two Unrelated obese, red-bearded boys who are looking weird in one movie would be a huge coincidence. This is the first movie I've seen of the few Pattersons, sadly the man died of cancer in 1975. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Doctor Gore" is a movie that's definitely not for each. It's actually total crap. But it is also fun and I recommend my fellow fans a strange and cheap camp stuff. Dictionaries should show the image from this movie under "trash flick".
