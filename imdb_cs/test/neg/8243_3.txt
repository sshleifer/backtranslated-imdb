Generally, I loved Carry on movies, but this is actually pretty awful. There is very little laughter, because the whole thing is so forced. There's a lot of talent on the screen, and some are better off than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are all right, but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just delicious. Joan Sims got out of the way, but in the case of usually beautiful Charles Hawtrey, it's just sad. When you think about the sad end of his film career is almost too depressing to watch. The film's homophobia is ugly and a very unpleasant experience. The file looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series, the movie is very clearly set in England. The sea side looks cool and there is no attempt to create illusions. It looks like cheap production. You'll be surprised at how badly you look at it, especially if you loved the show.
