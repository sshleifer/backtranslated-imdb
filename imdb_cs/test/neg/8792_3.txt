It is painfully clear that all the efforts in this film have been directed to cinematography and very little attention to everything else. The most obvious mistake is the mistake of the entire female cast. Many of them are very experienced and capable, but they all seemed to be out of place, and having a willing director certainly did not help. The story is a very common Geisha story, and the characters acted very inconsistently, so making it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine. The theme of this film is "modern prostitution," but it was still annoying as the leading character Tsuchiya Anna still spoke as a member of a female motorcycle gang, while everyone else spoke in the old Japanese hardware for that setting. This film has very beautiful vibrant colors, similar to "Hero" Zhang Yimou, but viewers can easily say that it is filmed in a cheap, sophisticated set. Two sequences with embedded Shiina Ringo songs were really nice, in the middle of the movie. Actually, I didn't like her music a while ago, but fit perfectly into this movie. Although Ninagawa Mika is totally unsuccessful as a film director, she has great potential in PV production (music video). I think the story was very clear, because the director couldn't focus on character development, and because Tsuchiya Anna is an unconvincing act like Oiran. If this film was directed by well-known director Jidaigeki with another well-known actress in Japan, he would have the potential to become a masterpiece.
