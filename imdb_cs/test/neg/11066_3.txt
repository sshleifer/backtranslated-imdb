Monday 02.10.2006 So I always met my father. We ordered a Japanese departure, turned off the lights and moved the game. I am a passionate fan of horror movies. However, The Cavern released on DVD in October this year was most likely released. It seemed promising, meeting all the standard requirements of all horror machines: outlined by the start of a hostile character, the sex scene could not be missed, and the pre-spook too familiar (when they unexpectedly provoke you, but turns out to be a friend of idiots). Then, finally, when I got down to stuffy little things, I was ready for some real action. Director, I admit he was excited. Of course, you will have to fill 81 minutes when people move back and forth in a space of about 10 feet wide. It all starts when some college students are tied to "cavemen" to join together for another dive. They all look like seasoned professionals, very serious and spiritual about the entire cave. This time they bring new, along with some annoying photographer, blinded by his National Geographic cover, to understand the full danger of diving in the cave. As they descend deep into what they call "hell pit", they soon realize that they are not alone in the abyss of death. I will politely skip all spoilers if you are naive enough not to touch my advice and avoid wasting time. Though the atmosphere and background music were scary; and there was a lot of blood and gore, when the moments came close to witnessing some real breakage, it was more like watching porn without a full frontal. The camera was intentionally dark and shallow. I think the director used it. I suppose what I like most about the movie was moving characters. They deserved the Acadamy Awards for those who touch bickering scenes. I almost threw a tear when they finally got ... Tear for joy! If you like dry horror, soft porn and hate brave heart. Then it's the right movie for your next Saturday night.
