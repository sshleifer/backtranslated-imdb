Au! What we have here. Not as badly as a painfully boring, half-entered excuse for exploitation. It was brought to you by the only one, J. G. "Pat" Patterson, yeah, the same from Moonshine Mountain. Dr. Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, is somewhat inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else. Later, Mr. Patterson also plays in this joke, as a scientist / plastic surgeon who has recently lost his wife in a car accident and is mad about grief to the point that the next step is to defeat countless women, then perhaps robbed several Graves for body parts make "together" a perfect mate. It won't be easy, but thank God, his friend Gregg has a hunchback that can lend a hand and offer moral support. If there was ever a need for proof that some people's goals are not meant to be fulfilled, here it is, gang. Apparently, Patterson hayseed never had any work to direct anything, much less, to follow in the footsteps of the good god H. G. as Master Gore. I've never seen a movie about kids that just refuses to give the viewer a single reason to watch. Even a whore is boring. Almost remotely funny, but impossible to tell if it's intentional or not. I'll select "no". Shot in Charolotte, North Carolina (home of the California Ax Massacre), most likely a 3-digit budget, according to a guy who's unreal was who probably had awards for drive-in trash, so, maybe we should give a good ol 'JG break, I think he tried (I assume) that is more of what can be said for most, and this movie is better than any of the great super heroes budgets that theaters released these days, though I realize it doesn't say much. In addition, Dr. Gore is quite an improvement over Patterson's previous failure, The Electic Chair, so it's easy that he would improve his craft in time if he didn't die, so maybe it's not that bad, especially when compared to another DVD movie How to make a doll, so what the hell, look at it. 4/10
