That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still trying to overcome how bad it was. It's just because it's Godard's name, it's not great. In addition to making sense, we see one insanely long shot of a traffic jam that is not overwhelming, incredible or anything like it. While this long shot of traffic jams is happening, you'll probably feel like a pastrami sandwich rather than watching it. Pieces of supposed story, silly, silly characters. What message should we take from this? It offers nothing and has no purpose. The director's arrogance in introducing these lousy, boring chains of smoking French people to sit and talk for hours and then pass them on because art is truly stunning.
