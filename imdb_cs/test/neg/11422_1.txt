I can't believe this movie gets a rating that's here on IMDb. Of course, I came to the conclusion that IMDb is somewhat worthless to see if the film is good or not because 99% of the films are rated from 6 to 7. It's the conclusion and failure of the crowd on the Internet. For this purpose, most people are average, and unfortunately, most people are simple minded to entertain fast food lifestyle morons. But I turn. Film. I really don't want to waste time writing about it. Let's say I found it tailor-made for seemingly two groups of people, young teens, at the age when violent action movies of any kind just hit the spot, and goth types that just love to choke anything that gothic vampire fantasies can . get your hands. If you are not in any of these categories, you will find this film absurd. I enjoyed the first underworld. At that time, it was fresh and kept some poor quality. The second attempt tried a bit, but sometimes I enjoyed the direction and cinematography. But the whole movie felt like a science fiction production or even a TV series. I found out that the actors are being over-directed. Their body language stiffened in unnatural idealistic poses that seemed to be strong. The lines spit out as if the young actors spit out Shakespeare's line, rejoicing in such an egoistic fame that they were in such a role, but by shameful shame. The storyline was dry and predictable from the beginning. I found out that I wanted things to "move" because it was so easy to say what would happen. At first I tried to take care, but my brain was forced to shut down. At the end of the climax, I actually caught myself falling asleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and didn't make sense that it wasn't even worth it to write them all down. If you pimple the face of a teen or chronic goth, sure, do it. For the rest of us, forget it like I'm just about to do it.
