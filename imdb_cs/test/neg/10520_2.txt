Obvious rip-off "Air Bud", this movie is really about parents too much about parenting. All the weaknesses of the characters (eg adult coaches who do not know the game) get to the limit - so much that they are absolutely incredible, not funny. Here is no semblance of reality, people and you will not develop sympathy for ANY of the characters. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is a good-looking opponent team (uniforms) in the first game the dog plays. Perhaps he chose because the setup is said to be near Arlington Heights, IL, home of the Columbus Crew franchise player, Brian McBride.
