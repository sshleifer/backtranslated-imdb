If you value your life in any way, shape or form, you will be polite and go through this seemingly "interesting" DVD movie. <br /> <br /> I know what you think, "I saw the preview and it looked great!" However, the buyer beware, I fell into the same trap. One of my friends expressed some reluctance to watch this movie, but I forced her to sit down. Oh, how I regret this decision. Like most horror movies, the movie starts cheerfully in a sunny Mexican resort where two couples are lured into the ancient Mayan ruins. Upon arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of the two jungles who are all but ignoring their greetings. As if it wasn't ominous, the tour group throws out a big plant growth and declares the unused path consumed by wildlife the perfect way to the goal. I think it wouldn't be much of a movie if they made rational decisions and just turned around, but that wasn't much of a movie. After some hiking Sixsome (the visitor of the resort brought a friend) he found the wreckage and suddenly his beauty and history scattered their doubts. This means that as long as the frantic tribal men armed with revenge do not emerge from the jungle, they have shouted in unintelligible language. Given that brutal verbal attacks are silenced by a calm, exalted tongue - don't ask me - but they still try to do the same, in vain. Suddenly, the sixth member of the trail, Dimitri, is pierced by several arrows from the Mayans, and all hell is released. Shooting completes work and the dismayed passengers retreat quickly to the ruins. Now that there was sometimes a plot to this movie, it ended up here. The performance lasted a maximum of 20 minutes and was unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the movie. At the top of the ruins, the Fivesome now realizes that they are trapped by the murderous locals and continues to make innumerable good decisions, one of which is to use a withered rope to drop one of its members into the shadow of the ruins. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously injured and then trapped in ruins, and both friends are seriously injured and try to save him. The rest of the film continues to be fruitless, with no real horror, just blood and gore, as shown when one girl throws a plant growing in it, gushing torrents of blood, and then again when one's legs are cut off, just to have the same platinum from the girl who would strangle him later. My only satisfaction in this film was the observation of Jonathon Tucker, a very attractive, starring Jeff McIntire, growing increasingly fragmented and desperate and sitting long enough to discover that almost all casts die of a terrible, horrible death. Their simulated pain seems to be an adequate replacement for the time this film was. It is likely that the ruin is an ancient house of dangerous spirits with evil, a body that feeds flesh to turn away and consume unhappy visitors. Unfortunately, I did not get such a warning from the screaming bloodthirsty plants, and the only bad thing about this movie I was really horrified about is the screenwriter.
