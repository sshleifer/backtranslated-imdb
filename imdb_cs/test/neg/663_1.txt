I am stuck in traffic (living in Sicily) on the way to the theater (at the military base) seeing Superman coming back, it was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie was to play "See No Evil", there was no poster on it, and only a short description of the movie on the schedule ... but my girlfriend and I decided to check it out ... Once I saw that it was made by WWE I knew it would be terrible. Some of the people in the theater laugh most of the time and it was the first movie I honestly considered going out, and I saw "The Ringer" ... all right, I was leaving, but I was too busy sleeping. The death of the evil in the end was pretty good, but otherwise it was just stupid.
