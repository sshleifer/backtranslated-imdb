This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Cast's International - Australian-posing-to-be-British, stage American and character with an English name sporting an unknowable "European" accent. What clear-cut efforts in this colorful crew are undermined by the conspiracy and strange innocence scenario. So short was the sheriff's budget of this movie and the overall production values ​​are so low that they wouldn't have trouble winning the film limba competition. In the last twenty years we have seen horror movies and stalk'n lomillers of extraordinary (though not necessarily "high") quality that have not been created at all. Recent examples include a badly made, but absolutely scary "Blair Witch Project" and, of course, the last - the low budget winner, SAW, who has virtually unknown leadership (Gary Elwes is just someone you don't even remember when you saw it). At DARKHUNTERS, it is shocking to find a famous actor, Dominique Pinon and Hollywood's-was Jeff Fahey fighting bravely to save the film. It is embarrassing to see the once handsome Fahey in coral make-up, who emits bizarre bad lines. I would rate this movie 0 out of 10 had it possible!
