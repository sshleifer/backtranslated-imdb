Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are in this ca. 1840 "Western". However, this in itself does not help the absurd story, with innumerable historically incorrect elements. His wild dance at a party giving his neighbors notices someone (this guy is SEVET SIX?). He always murmures Bible verses, demands respect while driving sons and friends away with his own righteous screams and emotional cruelty. end. There's a lot of drama, but not enough to make you feel good. This story was clearly written for the stage, even when the movie was shot. Perkins whistles "My Bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song wasn't composed until 1882. <br /> <br /> The critics of Sophia Lorens knocking "command of the English language" are rather small. I found her English flawlessly and absolutely audibly. Like Neapolitan, Loren speaks a distinct dialect, which often had to be dubbed into "proper Italian". But her "accent" barely affects how she speaks English. As the first German American generation, I can appreciate the efforts of those who learn English as a second or even third or fourth language. "Desire under the Elms" is a drama (or even tragedy)) in the classical sense. For my pleasure, there is a logical story and a total "payback" for the time spent. Star fans don't want to miss it, but others will tune at their own risk!
