Unfortunately, Diane English is such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman, whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendes, who may not be my favorite actors. See how the movie could be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy and just bad? It was made by Diane English, who is known as the writer of the very successful television show Murphy Brown, and this is her first film for which she wrote the script. The film was a work of love for English that has been trying for many years to make it happen and I respect it. I even found scenes with supportive players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in a short but unforgettable portrait, funny, clever and enjoyable, but in general this second hand film is "Sex and the City", which has been released only a little . months ago. I didn't find sex and the city very well when I saw it, but it was simply brilliant next to The Women. At least, Sex and the City saved us a long and tasteless scene in the hospital hall, where one of the characters had a baby and her friends supported her. Poor Debra Messing, what she did to deserve the nightmare she got, and we, the audience, along with her? Films like "The Women" give the whole genre, chick flicks, a bad name. It's nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so hard to make a really good comedy about women's friendships and hardships, about marriage, motherhood, and professional evidence? These are all very convincing and important subjects that every modern woman can relate to. Why make movies with lines, dialogues and situations so clich√©, predictable, not funny and offensive that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie ends? When I saw a new movie, I checked the original The Women from my local library and I really enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago, and kept my interest all the way. The old film had real star power.
