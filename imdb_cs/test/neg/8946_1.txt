** SPOILERS ** I rented "Tesis" (or "Thesis" in English) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar, his later efforts "The Other". Based on what was brilliantly measured and the eerily effective creepfest that was the movie, I assumed that his earlier efforts would be of similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead, I ended up with the most compelling apologies for the lame-brained slasher movie I saw from the German film "Anatomy" (which reminded me a little). The storyline has potential, but it is fired within the first 20 minutes. It revolves around an innocent-n-pretty psychology student Angela's (Ana Torrent - Jessica Harper deadringer) thesis on violence in movies. Through some far-reaching circumstances, which are too stupid to come here, she found herself in a tape of "snuff" on which two men were tortured, mutilated, and killed a young girl into the camera. Angela and her horror friend Chema (Fele Martinez) are shocked, but at the same time, they are biased and decide to get to the end of who is responsible. That leads to ... well, nothing. They never really give a reason why they would like to find girl murderers (because they definitely refuse to contact the police during any of the emerging events, even when their own lives are threatening) and the secret itself is as flabby as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny. There is only one "key" (the type of camera used by the killers) and it is a) really weak and b) in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called "disintegration" occurs only through blind happiness, the increasingly ridiculous conspiracy of conspiracy, and the SLEW of terrible, transparent and utterly redundant red sequences that are only hidden to run out of time. Seriously - Amenabar might know his things about scary stories, but he never read a detective book in his life. The key to good whodunnit is to have a large group of potential suspects and remove them one by one with clever deduction and gradual discovery of more and more evidence before moving to the finals. In "Tesis", * POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD * The identity of the killer is quarreled by amateur detectives almost immediately, and then we get 100 minutes of a writer who tries to take us out of the scent until his ideas run out. Hands up and says, "Okay, ya me, it was him all over"! Regarding any kind of logic or motive of crimes - no such luck. You're watching a bad movie if that's what you are after. The only thing that pulls "Tesis" down from being a stupid, badly written thriller is the way he actually tries to make some ridiculous, confused 'point' about violence in movies. I have no idea what the attitude is, which is trying to attract on this subject, but it seems to be determined to cram a ton of misleading, confused psychobabble, between the rest of the gibberish, and say "look at me! I'm political!". The final scenes in which the "point" of the film is supposedly beaten home are so utterly absurd and naughty, one can't help wondering if Amenabar feels embarrassed to watch it. If not, he should. This is a total 'amateur night in the slasher house' stuff. Overall, I can't believe I've wasted two whole hours (that was like at least six) just hoping something can happen. The Urban Legend of "Snuff Movies" (and that's basically all they are, despite the fact that this film is trying to indicate that they are some kind of criminal phenomenon that sweeps the world!) Is an area that can be so excitedly exploited in good horror movies ("Videodrome" anyone?) but it's so easy to step through the line to the child "would it be cool if!" Territory with him (ie: "My Little Eye") ... "Tesis" hits the historically lowest level of the film "snuff". At each level it is better to be dead and buried. I'll grant it 1 out of 10 for some nice lighting, but that's all it gets.
