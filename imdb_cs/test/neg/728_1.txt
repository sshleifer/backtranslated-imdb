Tired of several attempts to sit down and watch this "Gilmore Girls" program. It confused me that I couldn't put my finger on what it was about. Was it about a young woman who had a baby in her life and never grew up? Was it about the daughter being more responsible than her mother? Was it a rebellious rich girl and her hostile daughter? What the hell is that about? Finally, I didn't care. The cast makes me scream. Writing is neither "intelligent" or "intelligent", it is syrupy and boring. So why did I look? Because I have heard so many good things about it and I am not one to express my opinion until I was looking. The Knee-Jerk reactions are usually bad, so I watched several times. When I first watched it, I saw a mother running around 12 years old and a daughter who acted like her was 40 years old. I never liked any of the "Freaky Friday" movies - I'm not saying it is so, but there are some similarities. Also I have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked her, "What is it about?" A very bright young lady, usually articulated, never gave me a direct answer. So I asked the others who were fighting it - they didn't even know it. Gilmore Girls turns out to be a TV program that is like an "art house" movie. Many of us do not get it, but those who go are desperately trying to find meaning where there is really no one, just to be "hip". Yes, Lorelai of Lauren Graham is sorry - whining, whining, nasally WHINE. All hour. Wow. And the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The city is hockey, men are wolves, grandparents are boring, and unfortunately I find nothing to redeem these characters or care for anything they do. It's like watching the paint on the wall.
