OK ... before I get more or less constructive criticism of the movie, I'd like to say a few words from the heart ... THIS FILM SUCKS !!!! DO NOT SEE THAT THE LARGEST, WHAT ARE GOOD PUPPIES AND WOODEN ACTIVATIONS, NO-FENCE STORIES .. So let's see why I think the movie is so bad: 1. It's not a story. There is no conspiracy. The director tried to create a mystery that wasn't the feeling. 2. The whole thing looks like a big, hourly and half-promotion of some goth-wanna-be-but-still-looking-like-BSB-band ... All boys in school have perfect abs, no fat or ugly young people ... there is no good-looking girl in the movie, not one. The main character is either wet in the pool or all sweaty in bed ... poor guy. It must be horrible to go to such a date. 3. Can the boys do something good with their powers? Anything good? Like postpone a fire in that old barn, or help his friend who got into an accident instead of just running around breaking things and pointing in front of him. 4. Wooden playing. The main character has only two expressions on his face. Expression number one: sad. Number two: trying to look seductive, but still sad ... There are 4 guys in this band: The main character, his best friend who got into an accident, the blonde and the fourth ... what was the fourth name? I think he spoke only twice during the whole film: once at the beginning (he said that jumping out of the cliff with "power" wouldn't kill them) and the second time he and the blonde lost the girl. the movie could have been done without it and no one would have noticed ... Anyway, my verdict: 1 is the perfect score for this movie. Guys - don't see it. There is very little action, no tension, no hot girls. Girls - At least Actors Are Good Looking ... What I would recommend you is to get the sound of this movie - that's the only thing I liked about it.
