I should have known better .. the tracks were all over IMDB.com. This movie was written and directed by the same guy who has no records. The cast is a bunch of unknowns with the possible exception of Joe Estevez, who seems to specialize in bad movies. All I have to say is that I don't see any reason why anyone wants to see this horrible, amateur filmmaking attempt. Turn on any broadcast channel at 3:00 to see better movies. Said Nuff.
