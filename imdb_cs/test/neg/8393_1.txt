If it is an artistic and essay film, there is not enough art, not to mention the essay. <br /> <br /> If it's a thriller, there's not enough thriller. <br /> <br /> If teenage drama is not enough drama, and when it comes to teenagers, there is not enough NOFX and too much Nino Rota. I thought it might be a trailer for Tony Hawk's upcoming movie, but there's no Tony Hawk, so I think I'd be cheated: it's not Tony Hawk biopic. If it is an action movie, it lacks explosions that would add some interest to it, or at least make a leap to sleep in their chairs. Most characters seem to be dead inside, but it's not a zombie movie. In fact, if it's a movie, there's not enough plot. If it's not a movie, it takes too long to become a music video. <br /> <br /> If it's a music video, it's ... it's an album I'm not going to buy
