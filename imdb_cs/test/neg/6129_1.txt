Oh, boy. This film is something for lovers of "real" cineatique art. It really doesn't make any sense at all. It's totally boring, especially because of "anti-peaks". All people behave more than strangely and unrealistically. Sometimes it looks like sitting in a theater because in a dialogue actors tend to face the camera (and thus the viewer) instead of themselves. As I said before, if you are in the more refined movies that are shown in Cannes - go for it. If you're not, you better leave this movie alone because you'll be more than disappointed and eventually know that you have wasted your time - like me. Two inches down: - (((
