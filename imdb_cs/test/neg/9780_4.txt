This is another imitation of aliens and not very good at it. Replace the universe with the South African Desert, throw the same ingredients, a group of people trapped in the inhospitable landscape, let them catch a strange creature, and you have the same old story of a very ordinary movie trying to make a classic movie. A group of miners and scientists set out to find some missing colleagues and find their bones in a deserted body. Their vehicle falls apart and heads for civilization while a monster pursues them. The African site is pretty nice, but that's basically the whole movie that's going on. There is a futile attempt to build tension, but I find that it really doesn't work and made the movie somewhat boring. Creation didn't look much and when it did it really installed a sense of horror. one scene where somebody gets a body ripped out of his arm, but it was basically on the front. In conclusion, I found this movie about as exciting as watching the paint dry.I put this movie 4/10 and that's just because it is an interesting place that alone is not enough to store this movie out of being a total snooze-fest
