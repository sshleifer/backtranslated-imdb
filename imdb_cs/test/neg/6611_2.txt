When just a few days before the film's premiere, his screenwriter retreats from the project, and demands that his name be removed from the credits, you know it's not good. The books on which "Wiedzmin" is based have great potential for a living fantasy movie? "Geralt de Rivia is a witch, his only purpose is to destroy the monsters that torment the world. But not all monstrous looking is bad, and not all righteous is good?" But everything that didn't matter when a low-budget Polish film crew decided not to make it a 13-piece mini-series. A two-hour film is a by-product of their activity to maximize profits. <br /> <br /> In this case, it is not difficult to point out what people are doing to make this movie bad. Rendering (incoherent, because it is too many stories), playing (below average, except for Zebrowski), dialogues (bland), editing (jerky), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (poor), film is a bad experience . Only the soundtrack made by Grzegorz Ciechowski brings the beauty of the world "Wiedzmin", which has never been screened. Even the magnificent flora and fauna of Poland (where part of the "Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was shot), a key element in almost all fantasy films, was not fully exploited. The more I think about this dead loss, the more words run out of me. At least it's nice to know that Marek Brodzki, the director of "Wiedzmin", has only directed one film since then (in addition to Germany). So far we have a fantastic story and a fantastic RPG computer (released in 2007) referring to Wiedzmin's books. But I am sure that one day the righteousness will be made by the Wiedzmin saga and treated equally well.
