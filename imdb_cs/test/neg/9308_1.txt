Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 wine bottle - it didn't have any substance to start with and worsen with age. This film proves to be completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his latest film and that his serious lack of success will reduce his chances of getting money for all future businesses. It's right there with "Lightning Jack" and "Les Patterson Save the World" as the most striking example of an Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic it is that with so many infinitely excellent comedy talents in Australia, Yahoo is given such vehicles to express its schoolyard comedy brand. And thinking - he had seven years to come up with the script. A true genius!
