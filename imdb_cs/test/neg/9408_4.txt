Al Pacino was once an actor able to do the role work without resorting to the constant use of profanity. In other words, if he could act, he didn't have to talk like a drug addict. McConaughey had to be overwhelmed by Pacino because he became the promoter of the "F" word as well. This may be the society they actually live in, but most of us have the common propriety to watch what we say in a mixed society. I don't remember the exact words the professor used to explain the constant use of vulgarity, but it was something like that. "This points to a lack of intelligence, poor language skills, and disrespect for all who have to listen." Maybe it is time for Al to do several game courses again to improve his talent. Oh yes, the movie ... Probably the worst thing McConaughey was playing. Hopefully, his next role will be in the community of talented people. Rene Russo was always hot.
