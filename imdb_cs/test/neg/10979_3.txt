This film begins at A and never reaches B. Its name promises much more than the film adds. It is superficial and filled with the usual clich√©s of a story in which one questions his sexuality. People are a pleasant, even binding type. The leader (Kevin McKidd) overcomes if there is reason to act at all. Playing a horny plane, Simon Callow is always worth watching and it's by far the only reason to stay in the movie. However, the garbage of his male group "meditation" or what are growing extremely tiring in short order. They seem to have been thrown into the mild mix of the movie in misleading efforts to change settings and keep inactive. The same goes for a really strange and unconvincing trip. Don't worry about pausing the tape so you can have a snack. Let the thing run; nothing is missing. Hugo Weaving's character is useless. It appears in succession with one of the fewer leaders and does not even encounter the rest at all. The result of this sequence is not explained, and Hugo's real estate business has nothing to do with the story. The film is a total disappointment at the end because there is no resolution. The thing just disappears and we're sent to final credits. This is interlude without structure.
