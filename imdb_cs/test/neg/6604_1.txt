not many people outside of Poland had the opportunity to get acquainted with the brilliant writings of Andrzej Sapkowski. He is very popular in Poland for his fantasy stories (I believe none of them has ever been translated into English.). Make a Long Story Short, Wiedzmin - The Main Character of Sapkowski Books - is a traveling monster slayer, a man of extraordinary power and skill: it's almost your favorite tolkien-style cool guy. unfortunately, no one would understand it after watching the movie. The 'wiedzmin' film is nothing but a collection of random scenes, featuring wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowski's writings, but not ebony remotely resembling the plot and the dramatic tempo of the original. The fact that some of the footage in the film shows attractive naked women does not add any quality to it. the film is getting worse and worse with every minute, and it doesn't even meet the requirements of the "so bad it's actually good" category. If you are really into fantasy and want to learn something about wiedzmin, instead read the book.
