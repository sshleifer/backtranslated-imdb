The "Snow Queen" is based on the famous and very beautiful fairy tale Hans Christian Andersen, on the girl, Gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen. This adaptation attempts to capture the story of adventure and light complex metaphors through rich sets and production design, but fails in many ways. Like many Hallmark productions, the potential of this story is totally undercut by cumbersome scripting and control. Both actors playing Gerda and Kai are pleasantly pleasant but forgetful; Bridget Fonda as Snow Queen looks on the role, but otherwise she is wrong for this role. There's a remarkable lack of dramatic tension on this meandering three-hour miniseries. At least some of the stimulation problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story, especially in the introductory hour that represents the main characters. "Snow Queen" would be perfect for preschoolers with enthusiasm for imagination and a little patience. "It's great eye-candy without scary, and acting is perched on a kind of mime over-the-top level that explains the story in a very, very bold text, just make sure you read Andersen's story.
