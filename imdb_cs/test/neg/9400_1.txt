Yes, I really found this movie disgusting. I didn't like Sandra's character Oh, she really upset me. She is unlikely to be admitted to rural Italian life because of the fact that she is not white. It was a little nonsense PC. The movie is also offensive to Italian men. For example, one man she (Diane Lane) has an affair proves to be a caddish cheat. But guess what: in the end your typically American-American brick head will turn up, all laugh and tan, and finally find what it wants all the time: a real American, and now colonizing another part of the world. In fact, this film is quite racist in its portrayal of the Italians and the way it conquers them is either the smarmy of lotharios or the backward peasants. <br /> <br /> The photo was good but the film and its attitude were garbage.
