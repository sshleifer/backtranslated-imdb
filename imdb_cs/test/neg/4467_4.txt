Being a longtime fan of Steve Martin, it hurt to see him in a movie with such a clich√©. The screenwriter had to rent only some videos and took a piece and piece - this is the least imaginative movie I have seen for a long time - I knew exactly what would happen in every scene as soon as it started. Also, African-American stereotypes and references to slaves are quite offensive. But the worst thing for me was to see Martin in the film without a trace of a joke. He is probably one of the most intelligent actors, and here he is completely sold out in a totally silly script. He must be in his aliment to make such a lame effort.
