I'm a pretty tolerant guy when it comes to movies, even B movies. I regularly watch some B movies for fun and can range from surprisingly good to horrible. I usually set my expectations before these types of movies, and even after I did, Descent was just scary. I really didn't mind that they tore the Core to some extent, but they didn't care about the material. Some scientists fear earth seismic activity and must travel to the depths of the earth to stabilize the ledge. What we get is a monotonously long lineup in which two dueling scientists Luke Perry and Rick Roberts have to work on a secret mission called Project DEEP. The commissioned man, General Fielding, played by Michael Dorn, secretly holds back important information from Marshy Crawford's assistant, played by Mimi Kuzyk. Rounding the cast is Natalie Brown, who plays Jen, a mission specialist who created the "Mole" drill that is used to plunge into the depths of the Earth. <br /> <br /> Besides some pretty good special effects, and Set Design, nothing about Descent is worth it. The movie starts pretty fun, but gets quickly set in a tedious tale of uncontrollable seismic activity that has been done to death in other movies like Core. Descent also has a bad script with useless, forgotten dialogue between characters. To make matters worse, there is virtually no action, no real threat or danger. Attempts at comic relief are painfully indecent. The plot has gaping holes and some subplots are left untied at the end, leaving a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> <br /> When concluding this movie, there was only a cheap way to get everyone involved to get a paycheck. There was no idea behind this film, no innovation, it's just there. In addition to some pretty looking special effects and set designs, this movie fails at every other level. The story comes from a garbage can from Hollywood and the characters are uninteresting. Descent will simply descend into boredom and frustration. Avoid at any cost.
