I can't think of anything, I repeat, something positive about this "movie"! The 1-hour 45-minute movie can be shortened to a short 5-minute movie! Nothing happens in most of the scenes, and the camera seems to have been left deliberately on record to extend the movie's time! All you see is someone in the background walking or watching TV without a specific topic or even talking what has happened! I feel I missed 105 minutes of my, family and friend's weekend for nothing! If the film is poorly created or the screenplay isn't great, it's a whole different story, at least it allows you to discuss something, but about DISTANT, I have to call it "film" because it was a film shot by a camera. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, imagine a 105-minute film based on two three lines of the story! What are you going to do about it? 5% content and 95% fillers! That's exactly what "Distant" was for us at least! The actors did a great job that had nothing special about them, barely talking or showing any special emotions! I picked up this movie in the comedy section of the shop, relying on what I read on the back of its cover. After watching the movie, I was still wondering what's funny about it other than our face.
