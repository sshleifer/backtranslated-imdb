The film starts quite well and seems to get somewhere when African American travels negligently for an airline. There is one scene in which his dog gets into the engine and that is really a sad thing. But the way he is portrayed makes it difficult for a person to find out whether this is a humorous attempt or a truly tragedy to think about the extent of negligence? After this point, they clearly ran out of ideas. If you are stuck around long enough, you will soon be treated with one of the worst movies ever made. It is essentially a highly racist sequence of drug smoking, humor for toilets, styling of each segment of the aircraft to reflect African-American pop culture and almost nothing else. You would think that only 3 white passengers on board will lead to some cheerful consequences, but nothing happens. They were basically just added to show how badly they could initially be treated and later be admitted to the bonnet if they acted. Avoid.
