I was also cheated. Here I waited all kinds of man to eat Pirahnas and what the hell you get. An hour and a half nothing, but an embarrassing silence with some strange guy who is not weird to be scary. <br /> <br /> I thought $ 5 couldn't be too much for a movie. Damn I was wrong. It was very hard to follow the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled. It's not so good that it's bad. It's not even the kind of movie. Its nothing. absolutely nothing for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> CRAP COVER !!!!!!!!
