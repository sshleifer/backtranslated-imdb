Steven Seagal made a really boring, bad and boring movie. Steven Seagal plays doctor !!!!!! ??? This movie has several action scenes, but they are poorly directed and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. A group of American Nazis spread a deadly virus that is capable of destroying Montana's state. Wesley (Seagal's character) is desperate to find a cure, and that's the Patriot story. Patriot is an extremely boring movie because nothing happens. It is filled with boring dialogue and illogical gaps between events and silly actors. Steven Seagal is absolutely pummeling in this movie and I wouldn't recommend this worst enemy. 3/10
