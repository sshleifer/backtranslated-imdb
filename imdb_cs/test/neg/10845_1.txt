I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I have ever spent. It's LAME! I couldn't believe they could come up with something like that. <br /> <br /> There is no graph on the plot. Everything you expect to happen will only get worse. The deal was terrible. My dog ​​could do better. The special effects have no effect - apart from inducing total mistrust. And those cheesy lines ... why? <br /> <br /> The only credit I can give to this piece sh * t is the opening scene. They were actually pretty nice. And one of the reasons I decided to rent this. The graphics showed that he is probably the best and most realistic CG of the whole film. The total reality gets 1 out of 10 because it can't mark it below.
