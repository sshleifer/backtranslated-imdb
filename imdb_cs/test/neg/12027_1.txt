I bought this film view, invisible to science fiction congress, and I got what I deserved for something so stupid. Simply put, this film is unlikely, boring and unknowable. I was so bored and disgusted by the lack of plot development that I turned it off to watch Mythbusters repeat. I understand that this was a very low budget move, or at least it looked like a very low budget move, but it does not excuse the horrible action, the terrible plot and the worse the camera. It looks like a group of college students did between classes and drunk. Maybe if the villain wasn't so ridiculous and the conspiracy was something that could actually happen in law enforcement could be so bad that it's funny. This movie is not funny, it's just bad.
