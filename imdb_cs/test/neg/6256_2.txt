Originally harped as a sequel to "The Slumber Party Massacre", this film hits the face with a new name. First, if you want to include the word "massacre" in your movie title, you better deliver it. This one is definitely not. There is no gore, not on screen murder and no chainsaw, as box art would trust you to do so. Instead, we get thin paper that is exaggerated about a group of cheerleaders who are stuck in a deserted cabin on their way to a football game, only to be offended one by one. Again, this movie might be fine if the gore share was a little bit higher. Why directors, especially those who direct movies, are afraid to show that ANY is out of me. Now I'm not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on ... why else would someone rent a movie called "Cheerleader Massacre"? In addition to this problem, the film suffers from shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. Looks like cheap, cheap, and the actors aren't that good. He tries to get us out of the way who can be the killer, but it also fails. The end ends in a ridiculous mess. If you come across this movie, you will leave and find the original "Slumber Party Massacre" massacre. 2 out of 10.
