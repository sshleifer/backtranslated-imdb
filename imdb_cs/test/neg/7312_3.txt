Well, I must say that I own this movie and I like the ending. The film is boring and slow, but the last fight is so fun. Let's say that if a fake bird didn't attack the main evil guy, this movie would be 0 out of 10. But the bird does it 3. If you are really bored or want something horrible to watch this renting and fast forward to the final battle.
