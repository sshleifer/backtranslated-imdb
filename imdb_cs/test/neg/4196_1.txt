The guy, with the unlikely name Shy Walker, is looking for his two daughters in a cornfield an hour and a half. This is the whole conspiracy ... of course, with a bad deal. Walker wanders around a corn maze (maize? I got it! HAHAHA ... not funny) and shouts "Girls? Where are you?" about 1000 times. For some reason, whenever he runs at a pumpkin, laughs at the voice (as if the pumpkin is laughing at him, yeah OK ...). His daughters scream at most of the movie ... though there's no reason to scream (maybe because they're still stuck in this horrible movie?). The twins directly from "The Shining" appear every now and then. Most corn mazes look the same, so Walker's search very quickly very old. The filmmakers realize that there is nothing for this movie (even the music is repeated), so they try to do interesting things by turning the camera really fast, turning upside down, inserting smaller pictures of the same image at different angles, using red lights the maize looked scary and turned the camera 360 degrees (at least I suppose it was done intentionally, but it's probably just an example of incompetent filmmaking). More often than not, when Walker travels through a maze, you don't see his face. I think the guy who holds the camera can't look up that ... This movie gives you a new award for the original 'Dark Harvest' (which has nothing to do with this movie, except that it also includes ) of the cornfield). Don't be fooled by rating R. Walker says F three times and now we have a "horror movie with an R rating". The scarecrow on the cover doesn't even appear in this movie ... and if you want those who came back from the first movie back, you know things are bad! Instead, we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around (unfortunately he is dressed like Mr. Walker, so I didn't even realize he was watching him for a while). I've come up with a guy's identity in yellow shoes long before Walker did (the film is almost over when he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). The end of the film goes on and on ... and just in case it's not slow, there's a slow motion! The last sound you hear (except for your own laughter) is a very bad sound dubbing. If you don't know, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. At the very least, they didn't promise to continue!
