This film revives the true march in the bad film industry and Saudi Arabia, I want to know how the director managed to confront the people of the industry after making this film, the work was so bad, we don't know how a Saudi cinema like Rutana and others do not support yang filmmakers in KSA as the United Arab Emirates We hope that the film industry in Saudi Arabia will prosper in the future. But without such interference, fools traders and idiots make us bad movies that do not benefit the reputation of cinema in Saudi Arabia as a Roman and Iranian cinema At the same time, please creators of a simple experimental cinema in Saudi Arabia such as Abdullah alayaf and others to dream of a good film industry to participate in the festival world far from big companies silly interventions
