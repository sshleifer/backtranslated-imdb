The good idea he had had the cumbersome production reduced. <br /> <br /> Quite a bit of the dialogue was unintelligible because of the sound / background level, which did not help this reviewer. Neither Welsh accents, sometimes impenetrable. At the end, I lost the will to live trying to continue the dialogue. This film did not know whether it was to be a farce or black comedy - and required different approaches. Some of the incidents have been put so strongly that they merely deserve a moan, some have been so incredible for this kind of conspiracy that the story is not worth it. Playing was a major good - although the American just came out as a clone of a mad scientist "Back to the Future". The little boy was very good. I looked at him all the way, but God knows why: I can't remember once laughing.
