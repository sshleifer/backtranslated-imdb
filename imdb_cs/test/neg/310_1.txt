The film made no sense at all. Good Actors (SergioCastellittoaparticular favorite; he was great in "Uomo DelleStelle" / "TheStarmaker" but it was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, great Italian director as opposed to the average one who made this effort), but terrible, rambling script, terrible editing and a director who seemed to have no idea what he was trying to say, and finally said nothing. The heavy load of garbage, but the kind of film that some Italian intellectuals who were my misfortune that they knew in the dark and distant past would love it, and unfortunately Italy has no monopoly on them, can be found everywhere and probably recognize it as great masterpiece. I've never thought much about Bellochio as a director. I remember seeing his first film "PugniNella Tasco" / "Fists in my Pocket" (or some such title) in Rome when it first appeared 50 years ago (I lived there time). All the usual pseudo raged about him, but it left me quite cold. I didn't think he was almost a director and not yet. He certainly did not improve his age and this film must be one of his worst.
