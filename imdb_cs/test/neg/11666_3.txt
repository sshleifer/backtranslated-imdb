This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, he is also one of the most unintentionally cheerful. I like to compare it with Plan 9, in that it may be so bad, so awful, so stupid and so waste of time that I laughed out loud. One of my biggest problems with this is that it's a complete Robin Hood ripoff, and let's be honest and say I like Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Robin Hood: Men in stockings. But let's face it from the forbidden love between Peck (who is sure to be asleep. Although in all things it was a few years before To Kill and Mockingbird) and a female character (which is so forgotten, apparently, I forgot her name.) "On the last scene where good guys dress like monks to deceive evil boys," ROBIN HOOD "screams everywhere. But I don't think the movie is worth seeing. On the contrary, I think it's one of the most fun movies I've seen in years, though it was unintentional.
