That's not a good movie. Simple and simple. Remove hardcore sex scenes and what you have is average plot, average gameplay (at best), routing and boring dialogue. Add to grot and you have average plot, average playing, blowing direction, boring dialogue, with algae hardcore porn. The problem is that porn is nothing special. So it's not a good movie and it's not a good porn. This will fail in both counts. They can say that this film was made by women and they wanted to do it with it, and so on. But speaking is cheap, the end result is what counts, and what we have here is an average movie with some sex thrown Do for shock value to try to con you wasting time watching it. One of those movies where you'd rather have time to watch.
