Well, I was at a British university, in fact I went to this one in this movie and it was nothing like that. This is a terrible, badly made and fiction film. The worst thing is that it could be really good if they bothered to spend more than 12p on it, in fact if it really wanted to represent true British students, it should work as one and take out a Â£ 15,000 loan. Doesn't say anything about the life of the Union where diving was, tea drinking within 4 hours, endless chats of group dynamics ??? Where was diversity and fun? Maybe I'm just romantic, but I don't remember Fresher's week being so horrible and total. And finally the question remains ... bed or wardrobe?
