Others said that this dialogue is irreversible, and I agree. If mum and daughter were really so seasoned, they should be the queen and princess of space, not digging in a small town. I really tried to watch several episodes, but when the humorous staccato muttered pop culture drivel, I'll start a flip channel. I've been watching a bit of a new episode to see if anything has changed (the better I hoped), but no, the same old "we're so smart with our pop culture links" that I almost barfed. Long-time fans who are not happy with newer periods that could only be awake and get sick with a regurgitated pablum that never stops.
