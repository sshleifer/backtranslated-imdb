It's not just that the movie is lame. It's more than that. This movie is simply useless. Do we need another Western? How about Western with Afro-Americans in title roles? Does it sound stupid, unlikely and lame to modernize the genre? It is. Incredibly lame and common sense. It's so that lame Baz Luhrman's movie "Romeo and Juliet" where her in modern times to attract young people and create some hype with his reworking of the classic story. Well, Baz Luhrman has failed miserably, even this mess. In fact, the story is not bad, but the whole idea of ​​eliminating racism from the racist genre of casting all African American actors is itself racist. It's also naughty and simple (like Baz Luhrman-man is a bad director). Hey (I heard you say) Mario Van Peebles! He's also in the movie! How can it be racist? It is not. I said that the idea of ​​casting all African-Americans instead of whites was. The film is not racist, it's just nonsensical, stupid and very boring.
