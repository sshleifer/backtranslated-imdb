The story of this film is a clich√© and has apparently been torn from Jurassic Park. The creators didn't even try to hide it. It looks like there is not enough budget to organize decent dinosaur dolls, so the viewer instead sees some robotic toys that move in a very unnatural way. It's funny because it's so bad. Acting is almost as unnatural as dinos. Nobody in this movie seems to be really excited (which I understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it is almost impossible to watch without falling asleep. One positive comment I would like to make about "Raptor" is that it won't take 90 minutes.
