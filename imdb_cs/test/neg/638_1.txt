What do you get when you give Lou Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges, Barry Corbin with a bad toupee and an alien on the train? You get a very bad movie called "Alien Express" or "Dead Rail" that would be more fun on the old Comedy Central series "Mystery Science Theater 3000." You name it, this horrible film has suffered in the areas of acting, conspiracy, action and special effects. In fact, outside passenger train shots looked like production personnel used a common HO scale model in front of a painted background! The rest of the special effects go down the hill. The story is very predictable and is similar to the 1970s "Horror Express" and "The Cassandra Crossing". At least "The Cassandra Crossing" had a better cast, an engaging story and real scenes from trains. ; otherwise, "Alien Express" derailed long before leaving the station!
