Worst. Film. At all. I can't believe they had to hire Jeremy Irons to believe this piece of crap - and they still failed. Did they believe that if they were to stick to the plot of a book that their target audience couldn't come on their own? (probably). "Hey, let's do a lot of things to explode and give Mina a big boobs, and let her speak a falsely shattered English." F * ck it, we go to the box office, we don't mind any ideas of dead authors on human nature. Also, add Orlando Jones with some classic "black attitude" as a support character and it doesn't matter the interesting conclusion of the book - Guy Pierce has to get some dogs at the end. "
