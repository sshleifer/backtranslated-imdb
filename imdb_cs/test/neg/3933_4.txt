The storyline at Petites Coupures definitely left this viewer impressed. At 48 hours or more, the character of the Auteuil is a teenager, losing his wife's affection, attempting to seduce Scott Thomas, is rejected and continues to drag the female figure in the back of the car and then finally be shot for his trouble. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler end *** <br /> <br /> wha ??? The only thrill in this movie is Kristin Scott Thomas. Like Charlotte Rampling, she seems to be a natural star in French film. I hope that one day Fran√ßois Ozon can fill her in where she can show her true talent. There are some fine French movies such as the remarkable Le Colonel Chabert begging for the release of the DVD, yet this is a trip that will be picked. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. <br /> <br /> zzzz ..
