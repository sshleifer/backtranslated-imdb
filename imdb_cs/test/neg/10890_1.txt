I only remind very good films and utter waste. My goal is to help people who want to see great movies to spend their time - and money - wisely. Also, I want to prevent people wasting their time on rubbish and wanting to promote the fact that the director / producer of these garbage films can't get along with it for a long time. We'll find out who you are and vote with your feet - and wallets. This film clearly falls into the rubbish category. The director and writer is John Shiban. It's always a bad sign when a writer is also a director. Maybe he wants two checks. He shouldn't get him. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see anything else, forget it. I'm not going to say anything about the conspiracy - others already. I am a bit worried about how much the director likes to bring the poor girl's face closer to her when she cries and screams. These long-lasting images are a little worrying and can say something about Mr. Shiban's mind state. Maybe he should get psychiatric help. <br /> <br /> Enough already. It's crap - don't waste time on it.
