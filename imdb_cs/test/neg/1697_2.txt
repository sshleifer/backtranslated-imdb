Forced, cloning, formulation. Do these adjectives cause you to rent? Miriam Hopkins was brilliant in the original "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde." A few other early films of her, notably "The Temple Story of Drake," are never shown but said to be excellent. Here, she is cutesy, bossy, and thoroughly unappealing. Ray Milland as a rich Greeniwch Village is not convincing at all. Both child artists are haunted and also have no relation to the village as it was then. Speaking as a native of Greenwich Village, I will find ersatz, generic and fake settings. Not that I was a few generations, but my relatives were there in 1937. It's not funny. It's not authentic at a distance. We don't care about characters. So many films were made about the fighting masses and capitalists at the time, and they did with elan. "Easy living" comes to mind. It didn't happen in the village. But that is very true. This rings with a pounding knight.
