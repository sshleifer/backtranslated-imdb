why oh why did I waste my time watching this movie? It was given to me by a video friend and I thought I'd watch it, it couldn't be that bad. firstly, the negotiations are just frightening and we should believe it to be real? Secondly, this film recklessly tries to copy Blair's project of the witch (yawning) and makes it very bad. So if you want to worry about your life I would suggest that Simpson Halloween special would be much more frightening. but if you just wanted to laugh, then it would be enough for this film to be enough. but overall I would avoid this movie at all costs or drink a lot of alcohol before watching. the best bit? Its only about an hour and a half, thank God.
