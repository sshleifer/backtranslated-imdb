Usually I like teens / high school genres, but this movie was really missing in originality. The only prerequisite for this film is that four friends cheat their way through high school and the tension they build on their friendship. There is simply not enough depth or character in the story to watch the audience for the entire length of the film. Acting is not so bad even though the actors really don't have much to do with the dialogue is insolence and clich√© '... After watching this movie, you need to wonder how the country producer might come across a project like this and think: "I have this one make a movie. " No wonder she couldn't get a theatrical release. Andrew Gurland is a hack, avoid or burn.
