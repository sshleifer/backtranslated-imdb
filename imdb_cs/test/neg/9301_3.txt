This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mafia based off Buffalo. He is also a furious alcoholic, and it has caused his job performance to decline. After falling asleep in his car during a by-hit, his uncle's crowd boss sends him to San Francisco to attend AA meetings and get a job as a morgue helper. If you think it has no meaning at all, you are not alone. It is worse. Well, actually it gets better, but not before it gets a lot, much worse. Frank suddenly becomes a masterful pretense despite a lack of training, but his reactions to people in the funeral home and AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to take root when he sees positive changes in his life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition to Frank's sponsor, although he has almost nothing to do (his character tells us he's gay, but this ends up having no meaning whatsoever). The film plunges itself into the idioc with the introduction of the Tea Leoni character. She is absolutely unrealistic, and her role as an interest in love for Frank flounders, as two actors do not have chemistry together. Around the time he comes into the picture, Frank becomes much less exciting than a character. His characterization is seemingly random; its behavior is not consistent. The comedy is inconspicuous and only occasionally funny, especially disappointed with regard to the comedy pedigree cast. <br /> <br /> Problems appear in this. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italian, Russian and Hispanic. During the entire movie, Frank tells numerous people he is hit by a man (including an entire AA band), but nobody seems to care, or wants to do something with it. The film relies on a clich√© of scenes to carry it through its final act, most notably when Leoni is an unbearable character chasing Frank down at the airport, only when he is ready to board the flight back to Buffalo. Although it has a strong premise and an interesting first half hour, the film quickly becomes a complete disaster and turns into complete nonsense. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates one year of sobriety. I hope to celebrate many, many years I have not seen "You Kill Me". <br /> <br /> My class: D +
