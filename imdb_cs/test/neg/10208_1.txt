I worked on this cruelty ten years ago. Luckily nobody knows for me because I didn't make the last cut. And when I saw a movie in theaters, I was glad! My agents were driven nuts (apparently for the first time) by filmmakers, rewriting the script every day, and changing their arrangements with agencies as often. Later they told me that once in California (we shot in Atlanta) these "pros" had 4 1/2 hours in shots! Even adjusted up to 90 minutes, it's at least twice as long as needed. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise - what is the film waste!
