Really a very bad movie, with a few good moments or qualities. It starts with a pregnant Linda Blair who runs down the corridors to escape what might be monsters or people with a pitchfork, I'm not sure. She jumps through the window and wakes up and we see he's very pregnant. The extent to which she is pregnant varies greatly throughout the film. She and the annoying and possibly belated little boy, who I thought was her son, travels to a deserted hotel on the island. Italian horror directors will find the most irritating little boys to have their movies! David Hasselhoff and his German virgin girlfriend are already on the island (you know the Germans say they love Hasselhoff ...). He photographs and translates an esoteric German book about witches, I think. <br /> <br /> Traveling to the island is also an older couple who bought it, and a real estate agent and a woman I thought was their daughter. She was obviously an architect, and Linda Blair and a boy are children of an older couple. I think everyone was traveling together to the island, but Linda and the boy seemed to be unlike the others (maybe they were filmed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel seems to be clean, certainly from the exterior, but has no great effect. An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak is still appearing at the boy and sometimes singing something in German, which eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder. People start killing, either in their dreams or sucking in hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are fine, but not enough to recommend the movie. Although the copy I was watching said she was uncut on the box, the death of one character whose veins explode was actually shortened. Much of the scene shows reactions of another character because we don't see ourselves. The most horrible scene is the one in which a man or a demon with a really dirty mouth blows. He looked particularly ugly. There's a sad and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is obsessed. I wish the horrible movie would throw it, do something original with its role, and let it leave Exorcist for her (except for the annual horror conventions). In a strange, predominantly Italian, tradition that claims to be a continuation of something unrelated to it is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. This is allegedly the continuation of Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La ( 1988) - it's not (that's a better film than this). La Casa 1 and Two were Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than those). There is also Casa 5, LA (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to want to be a sequel to the hoax series La Casa and the series House: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), Horror Show (1989) House AKA III and House IV (1992). How's the Horror Show? It is not in fact, that claimed to be a sequel, thus requiring real serial input to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) Confusion. Especially, The Horror Show is also an AKA Horror House and La Casa 5 is also an AKA Horror House 2. Does your head still hurt?
