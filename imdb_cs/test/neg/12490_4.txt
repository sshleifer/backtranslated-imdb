Dear Mr. Ram Gopale Varma, I do not know in what capacity I am writing this letter to you. I never said he was a complete fan of Amitabh Bachchan, who sat down in Jaadugar's act. I also ask for some important designations in the Godfather Fan Club because I watched Coppola classic more times than you supplied the flops from your Factory. And of course I am your great admirer since you had Nagarjun, who wrapped the chain chain around his joints in Shiva. When you announced Sarkar and called it your father Godfather Everything he wanted to know was the date when the first look would look like, on Sunday the promo would be released, on Friday the film would be released. It was a sheer desire to work when they knew that you, and not someone hovering between Amritsar mustard fields and the tulip gardens of Amsterdam, had taken on the task of re-creating the Puzo site on the big screen of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> Your cast couldn't be more of you? working for the first time with a legend, throwing Abhishek as his son, giving Kay Kay a role he deserved for years, bringing back forgotten faces like Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar, and picking out complete non-actors like Katrina and Tanishaa to join the list? Before July 1 you made Sarkar the most anticipated movie ever for all godfather godparents who worshiped Bachchan. The opening headlines gave hope that your overwhelming sepia-promoted telly promo set on fire. But now you have marked Sarkar as a tribute to the Godfather instead of the word "inspired" that you have used all the time. You probably don't want both creations to be compared, but if the medium is the same, then Kaante would be compared to water dogs and dam dogs in town on fire. <br /> <br /> Also when your first and last sequence? the core of any scenario treatment ??? They are about establishing and transferring power, you can't keep Nagares and Corleones apart, even if you replace the American Mafia moves Maharashtrian political power to play. But you're wrong, Mr. Varma? You wanted to show Amitabha in his seventies avatar as he whispered at Salima-Javed's lips. You wanted him to be bigger than life. You wanted him to be his own brand (o). How could you steal his voice in the name of using silence? How could you keep him rooted in a chair in pursuit of interesting camera angles? How could you leave him imprisoned without his voice and character? Cinematographer Coppola, Godfather cameraman Gordon Willis, disguised Brando's eyes throughout the film because he didn't have the power to make up for the annoying voice or the sudden flash of fingers. However, you tried to repeat the Malik Act from your own company. But Bachchan is not Ajay Devgan ?? his forte does not lie in stagnant view and suffocating silence. You did make a man look like a comatose patient who, from time to time, reminded him to look at the tag cards and the mouths of those predictable one-sided inserts. On that, Agneepath is there, every given Saturday. Which fan of Bachchan would go and watch Kay Kay Menon steal the thunder under his nose, where Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his house? Which Amitabhu enthusiast would go and watch him focus on achaar and the tsar, in a film that talks about power with capital P in promos? We can't handle so much in the name of limitation and underestimation! You don't even have to allow the camera to lie there for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him. Give me an old-fashioned camera-on-Bachchan style, every given Saturday. Kudos to you, of course, for being an actor from Abhishek, first in Naach and now in Sarkar. You also let him show Mallik Sherawat that he can run like his father. Even in a short prison sequence, you really make Bachchans out of the text, an opportunity that Shaad missed in Bunty Aur Babli. I wish the film was a father-son story rather than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of characters that appear as advertising windows on the Internet. You can also leave women more in the script than Puzo and Coppola have done and again, you deserve all of Brownie's points for pushing them so effectively. Pathak is a welcome return as a mother in the middle, Tanishaa loving as a nice girl, Katrina's revelation as Abhishek's confused lover and Rukhsar's silence talk about volumes. However, subfolders are not a classic remake. When your free-flowing camera tries to make every frame look like a hat, and your loud background irritation is constantly irritating, we remember that we are in the factory. Well, maybe not Nino Rota's score, but Sarkar certainly deserved better than Govinda, Govinda chants, and devious flutes. Mr. Varma, some of your factory directors tell me you are dealing with every project, from overseeing shooting plans to overseeing editing editing. Maybe in the middle of all the different scenarios, the shout of Bhiku Matre is muted by the silence of Subhash Nagare. You may need to close the factory shutters and work on a single home product. Otherwise, your products would remain products, use and throw, not treasure. And movie enthusiasts like me, for whom there are no hits and downs, just a good movie theater, would rather choose a movie without a Factory Final every Saturday.
