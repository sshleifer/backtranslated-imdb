That was one of the most diverse films I've ever seen. Everything in the film seemed to be connected with the justification of some other element on which it was affixed. There's even a talking buffalo who wants his wet nose wiped to become a spell. Even a brutal father seems to be imprisoned just to give children an apology to leave the car. It was ridiculous, but uncomfortable because it was a serious subject that seemed to be used only to build the plot.
