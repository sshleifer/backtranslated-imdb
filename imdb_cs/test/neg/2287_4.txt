This is more than just Bond adaptation: it's a simple rip off! With average character sketches that Ian Fleming wouldn't approve of, this movie goes as the worst 007 movie. Elder (and haggard) Connery tries to relive in the last 12 years. The result is a humorous, cheap version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moora!
