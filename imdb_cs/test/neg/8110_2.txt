I found this film is a complete waste of 96 minutes. jones was a weird boy and he is badly broken! According to my memories that could be wrong, wasn't he just 16 or 17 years old? Spoiler ** Why did he leave college and rent an apartment with two crazy girls arguing about the boy? and the cowboy who lives under jones also scared me as he knew what had happened in the apartments that were not floating around me for a minute. I don't understand his thinking about a girl who took pictures for fun and stayed in her room when mandy moore was always over and it was obvious she wanted to be more than friends with him. I dont really find this movie funny or artsy or dramatic or anything, I found it to be a silly and complete waste of time (D-F +)
