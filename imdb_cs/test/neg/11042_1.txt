There is a thin line between being theatrical and being simply forced. Forced behavior. Forced to persist. Forced fence. Even forced photography. There are people who say "the movie is developing like this because it's from Asia" but I don't see any kind of forced elements on Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There is a thin line between fiction being (and every work of art that is, in his way, in his way, fiction) and are only unlikely. In a more personal way, I just don't feel anything with the film, it doesn't take me anywhere, and I just can't believe in a fictional world that is designed. It just doesn't feel right, there's something in it, or it just doesn't click through it.
