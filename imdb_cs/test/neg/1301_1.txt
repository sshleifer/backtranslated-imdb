This movie was only on two nights running on ITV1 .. dear oh dear. Someone actually bought it on the strength of Robert Carlylse. OK, I missed the start .. but what I saw was so bad, I thought, no ... I watched in embarrassment for the stars in it. Nothing was based on reality, I doubt that things would be the same as in this movie. Everything was bad in this movie. OK, but not reality. He wrote the impression of a curtain from the cliff. Yes, wording. I couldn't guess the end. From what I saw that the army was superior, the people who were doing heroic things got right next to the time to do their thing, just wouldn't that happen? It was worse than leaving the brain at the door. It was annoying ... as someone else said ... yeah, right .. of course it would happen ... no! Credits mentioned Quebec and Canada .. so it was a co-production, lacking a third party. I'm not usually that critical, but it pissed me off.
