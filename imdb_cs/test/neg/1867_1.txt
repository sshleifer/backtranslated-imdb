All movies that contain "goofy sound effects" should be taken. If there is one thing I hate, it must be using the "whoop whoop" when someone gets in the head. The only movies I've seen is Ghoulies IV and Hobgoblins when they're at the bar, and Pixie beats a guy in a red suit with a beer bottle ... or he prefers to drink a bottle of beer because she never really comes across him. Yes Ghoulies IV does suck. But I have to wonder that they are NOT doing so-called "Ghoulies" mouth when they are supposed to speak? Their faces are almost as static as the masks used in Trolls 2. Damn, I can make a better mask of construction paper, some rubber cement and a handful of glitters. That was sucked.
