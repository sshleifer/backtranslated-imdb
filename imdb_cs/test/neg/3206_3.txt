Critters 4 begins, and I quote 'Somewhere in Kansas 1992' & record the last few minutes of Critters 3 (1991) as the recurring character of Charlie McFadden (Don Keith Opper) is about to shoot the last two remaining Critter eggs in the universe we're informed about meant the extinction of the entire Critter race, which is against some intergalactic zoological law or something. Charlie's bounty friend Ug (Terrence Mann) is now known as Tetra's adviser and is a leader in the intergalactic council and instructs Charlie not to shoot the eggs, but instead places them in a pod that will land very soon. really land fast near Charlie and Charlie really puts eggs in it, but is also caught in a pod that I suppose the cryogenic ally will freeze, as it has never been explained. Critters 4 then informs us that we are "somewhere in Saturn Quadrant 2045", where the rescue ship gets through space drift (credits barely ended and Critters 4 already steals all thoughts and scenes from Aliens (1986)). Rick (Anders Hove) has decided to get unidentified, on them as well, under & try & do a little money out of it. With the help of his crew, Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) and Bernie (Eric DeRe) have successfully recovered. They will contact the Intergalactic Council and Tetra Counselor to say they will go to an abandoned space station where trade and content will be traded. Tetra also specifically tells Rick not to open under. So in the true horror movie Rick opens the pod, angry Charlie and the egg Critter that hatches, kills Rick and escapes into the space station ... <br /> <br /> Co-directed and directed by Rupert Harvey I thought Critters 4 was quite a pointless film and covers Critter's series of movies with a priest rather than a bang. Joseph Lyle & David J. Schow's scenario is predictable and clich√©, a space station with an unstable reactor that blows up in a few hours, the protagonists will only escape to be hurt early so that they are stuck, race against time to save themselves, constant bickering and arguing between the crew, the division of the people, and the loser who turns into a hero and saves the day, yawn. A lot of conspiracy devices seem to come directly from extraterrestrials and tear with Star Wars (1979) with a sticky waste scene. The characters are no better and you probably won't give any damn about any of them. While other Critter movies could be described as a comedy of horror part 4, it seems to be deadly serious throughout. Critters 4 is also incredibly slow, impeccable and boring. It's more than 30 minutes before the eggs hatch and after this short succession it's almost an hour's mark before seeing them again, why make a Critter movie and barely characterize it? It can't be due to expensive special effects because they look just like gloved puppets, oh & how can only a few hours old Critter run the entire space station and set the course for Earth? How do they even know what the Earth is? Why would Capatin Rick open anyway? What is it all about a female scientific and rubber alien thing that is mentioned only once? Why does Intergalactic Council Want Critters So Wrong? Why just send four men? Why is this perfectly looking space station completely abandoned? Critters 4 looks cheap all the time when it comes to dark unimaginative sets and even steals shots from Android (1983) for ships and space scenes, Critters 4 was probably such a low budget that filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects and those that they need to look serious from Android. For the most part, only two Critters are used, although some begin to hatch, but on the day it happens, it's pretty late because most of the film is hard to see and the effects for them are the worst of the series. Forget any blood or gore, because the Critters kill only two people in a 90-minute run, just not enough to keep my interest. Acting is very poor, just like Angela Bassett's over-the-top melodramatic reaction to see several Critter eggs particularly crouching worthy. To see Critters 4, it's such a cheap and unpredictable work as you might hope to see. The End of Critters 4 is finally to save the universe from the Critter threat, hoping that it will save us our local video stores from the threat of Part 5 ...
