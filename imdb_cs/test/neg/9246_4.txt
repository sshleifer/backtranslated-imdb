Too broken to be nice, too free to be interesting and too clumsily photographed to be tolerant MR LONELY is an interesting idea destroyed by really bad movie making. Like Ken Russell's film in the worst case, or LOCUST DAY reworked by amateurs, it seemed Mr. LONELY looked like a good idea for a few pieces of paper (no scenario you see) and a free vacation somewhere, but at the end we have a widescreen who looks like he was created by film students whose parents told them that everything they did was a great creature. Or did I get a filmmaker? MR. LONELY is a waste of resources, trying to be (gawd!) Unpredictable and intentionally off. It ends up being unpleasant and forgiving .. and absurd. What is the point of going to Scotland? What a stupid idea in this movie about Hollywood illusion. Maybe Korine wanted to remake GODSPELL ... but the result is GOD-AWFUL. Oh and there is some subplot like remnants of the footage from FITZCARRALDO including Werner Herzog, Nun and the plane. Add slo-mo drifting and violin music to all wistful and melancholy, add James Fox, which seems to be seen as bold (like in PERFORMANCE) and the result is an amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen. It could be fun to film, but the result on the screen is a mess. Imagine an American PIE BAND CAMP with food poisoning.
