Coach Preachy or Straight Sappy. It's bad writing combined with even worse behavior. You can choose to drink Gatorade out of it after school special, but I don't, nor on his 20th Toby Robbins / Islander philosophy, a motivational moment. It's too much posture to be fun and not essential enough to be informative. I have respect for the coach and the program that inspired this film, but the move itself is terrible. As someone who played rugby for nearly 20 years in the states I was hoping for a better rugby movie (even one that has something to do freely with rugby). And I can tell you that Haka, done by the Haoles and Islanders group, is not intimidating (just as when all blacks are doing it today, really boys, they all saw it, it's time to put it down). If you want real intimidation, stand against a bunch of South Africans (real rugby convicts). This is a fake and badly made movie about being a real and good person.
