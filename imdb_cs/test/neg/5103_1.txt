The film itself is only a compilation of scenes that have no natural meaning for a person outside of Russia. I will not deny that some pictures and techniques were quite revolutionary at that time (filmed in 1928), but the problem with the film is that it is not interested in an intellectual or ordinary person. We only follow the orderly form of the pictures, from one man who beats a horse to a toothless soldier in war. Everything in between is embarrassing, unhappy and totally useless. It would be possible to think of a forum that would be of interest to the viewer, but it would not be so, although the director's method is quite genius. Overall, this should be seen if it's art. a student, a hallucinogenic drug, or a student of pre-Karkovsky film.
