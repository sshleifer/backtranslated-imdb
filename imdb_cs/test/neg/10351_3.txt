It's not bad, but in the end he misses the quality of the Australian series. Jokes are few and attractive among them (they shouldn't be), filmmakers think too much about cinematography (this should look like a home video) and it's like a serious version of Kath and Kim. It's stupid. It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two crooked middle-aged women who think they're hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There are no "Look at me Kimmy!" jokes. Fat friend Kim is not fat at all, and he's not a little stupid. It's a stereotypical black / latino cat. It's not as stupid or funny as the Australian series. It will be straightened. Nothing is the same. I admit that this show is sometimes quite funny, but it's not like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to an American Bogan family. They failed. It was supposed to be really stupid and cheerful, but the actors don't act stupid! For me, it's just a typical American TV show. It's a wasteland if you want it to be something like an Aussie show. 2 Stars because it's an OKAY show, just nothing to be.
