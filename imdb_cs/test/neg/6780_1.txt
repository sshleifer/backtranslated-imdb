I had great expectations about this movie (not like it was an apocalypse now or 8 1/2 but high enough), and when I saw it on the cable, they were all broken. Starting with acting (a poor, almost average, astonishing waste of good actors and talent) and the story itself: Since when does a five-member band leave on a supposed "hot" zone? One big mistake that costs the film dearly. Very good actors here are very bad, like Sean Penn, who recently reiterated the irritating way to talk about "I'm Sam", and Michael J. Fox, who wastes a good opportunity to defeat Charlie Sheen on "The Readers" currently playing "average" ". But the most irritating character was Diaz (played by John Leguizamo, another stupid loss of fine talent by the director), it was a cheesy, frightened and insecure kind of man, even more irritating that Jar Jar Binks (yes, you heard it). The battle sequences are average, the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence when Michael J. Fox trapped his feet on the VC tunnel. de Palma has a weak job here and if it wasn't for movies like "Scarface" and "The Untouchables", I would consider him a "bluff" director: too much publicity, bad filming. br /> 3/10
