This movie laughed me so much. It was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. So incredible and the worst story ever. Such behavior was wrong. I don't know how to make this movie so popular with Bollywood actors and actresses. The script must be somewhat funny. The visual effects in this movie were exciting to watch painfully. I think a child in a kindergarten could do a better job of visual effect and a monkey could do a better job of coming up with a chart. The storyline has many attempts to copy large Hollywood movies as a Terminator, but it fails. I laughed when I saw this movie. A complete disaster in the history of Indian film!
