Carrot Top is the "Chairman of the Board" and his AT&T ads are a living proof that fecal fumes are available in orange. Not available, however, as HBO charges for such garbage. Blehhh! COTB's saving grace is that it surely fills suicide hotlines across the country, which may provide jobs for thousands of phone therapists who have lost their jobs when memory treatment has been restored, though (unfortunately) Carrot Top is likely to contribute to its AT sponsor & T. with increased phone traffic from devastated HBO viewers. I can imagine hordes of traumatized TV viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 car in the other hand, dial out of the last despair before leaving the life board to escape the specter orange hair COTB monster echoes in their synapses such as burning agony, irreversible meningeal swelling.
