Crash of the Moons isn't too bad. Basically it's a few episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a movie. However, it is extremely dated. A good example of this is Winky's Vena treatment. One must remember that it was aimed at being shown to children in the 1950s. He will succeed in this respect. If you like 50's children's science fiction, go ahead and look at it. You will see John Banner in pre-sgt. Schultz's role. He's got a pretty good job at it. All in all, I would give him 6 out of 10. It's not great, but not bad.
