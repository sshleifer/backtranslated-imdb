Quentin Tarantino was once a relatively successful filmmaker. Now, unfortunately, he does not only make horrible movies, but also names that resemble them. cool retro flashback to biker films of the 60's and 70's, that's a new depth. Believe me, I like it when the blouse falls into the film more than the other, but I also kindly thought of watching it closely. To use a word that I have never thought of, his msysoginism (you see, I can't even spell it out). The storyline (in the vague sense of the word) is as incomprehensible as the Vinnie Jones accent, its terrible behavior is not ours, it is such a damn testament as one might think. This is just awful. Shocking. It almost made me cry. In horror.
