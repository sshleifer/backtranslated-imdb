Where do I start with Killing Mind before I mention the good one? This movie is about a young psychological profiling FBI woman, or something that for some reason goes to work for LAPD for a little while. There are some recognizable faces like "I Love You, Man" Wayne's World Block, playing a cop (also a nice beard!) And two guys who always play cops ..... you guessed it, cops. One of them was one of the cops at Gross Point Blank, followed by John Cusack about the place, and the other is the FBI who has specifications in Final Destination, who is also in the refugee as another cop. I know the FBI, the US Marshalls, the CIA, etc. They're not cops, but they're all the same. They enforce the law to some extent, which makes them cops in my book. Do not be afraid to disagree with the definition of the cop you want, but they are still considered to be trying to bring the evil ones. Some, I'll turn. The woman works side by side with these policemen, who seem to sit in the library in the basement or something, and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that no one has learned. She saw the dead body as a child, so she naturally decided to open the case again because she was personally attached to it! I also like how the person who profiled the other people's psychological condition witnessed the murder as a child. Sure, that's something someone's head can hit? He starts asking questions to some journalists who have concealed the story when it was opened, even though it seems to be at the same age as the woman, so he probably wrote a newspaper at the age of ten, or wrote some school reports. and decided to be the best person to ask. Then we see that as well as reopening the murder cases from 25 years earlier, she tries her hand at petty theft as some really inconspicuous bloke sprints over a busy street wearing a balaclava. The way of mixing, stupid! Like her and the cops she has in the park, he's following him, and as he crosses the bridge with his wife and child, the thief catches the baby from his mother's arms and throws the baby into the river. If you haven't figured it out yet, it's the best piece of the movie. I'm not sadistic and I hate children or anything, but the scene looks so stupid that I promise you to laugh wet pants if you watch this movie. It's better when a Final Destination & Fugitive cop jumps to rescue the baby and then declares to his friend "It's a baby!" As he didn't know, he was behind me before he jumped in. Anyway, he's chasing a thief, but losing him. Later he recalls that a random dog was not barking at a thief, so he was supposed to be his and decided to walk the thief through the dog. The dog had no sign or anything on it, so how did she know where to find a dog, so finding a thief was another question I wouldn't get into. shortly after, I stopped watching. The story was really slow, and after I stopped laughing with the kid who was throwing, I had a little lost interest and missed what was said. I say I'll go on and assume the killer was a journalist block because he looked a little clever and spent a lot of time with him, and anyone looking at Columbo knows a man outside the police force who spends most of his time with the investigating officer is your evil man. Plus, other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious, so I'm sure it was him. So all in fact, the movie pants, but it's worth watching just that one famous scene.
