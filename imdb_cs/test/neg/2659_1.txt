It wasn't until I saw Sidney Pollack in the picture that I added to this movie. That's his worst possible movie. Absolute dreck. The dialogue is wooden and incredible, the storyline is incredible. Kristen Scott Thomas is wasted in this movie. There is nothing about her character who even wants to believe in this story. Harrison Ford is like on Valium. There is no life in his eyes. I blame Sidney Pollack for the failure of this movie. The script is horrible and he's too smart to see it. So it smacks of some kind of reward, whether it's a studio commitment or something else, but this is just BLOODY ROTTEN!
