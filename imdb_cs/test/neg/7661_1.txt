Prior to airport 79 'these movies were pretty good. They had decent special effects, stellar cast and good acting performance. This movie has ruined the franchise, and there are many reasons for it. Let's talk about special effects WOW !!!! They are terrible what the director was thinking about. I know it's just 1979, but it lets you look at other very good special effects of movies like Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​Concord, and that could be the best movie at the airport, but they did too much with it. How about Joe Patroni (George Kennedey) firing a flare from the cockpit window to prevent the rocket looking for heat from reaching the concord. It also makes 90 degrees of dives and loops. This is completely remote and unrealistic WOW !!!!!! Believe me, special effects don't help this scene and they really are out of the bad .... They almost look like a cartoon, and that's how the whole movie is !!! Finally, lets talk about acting, which in my opinion is extremely poor at fair at best .... Over acting is a major issue in this movie, especially George Kennedy .. Which I really like as an actor but just isn't cut in this movie. Full guilt must go to the director who did a very bad editing job, and really broke Franchise Airport. Too bad Concord is not yet used today, it was the miracle of air travel ...
