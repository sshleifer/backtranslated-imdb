I loved this movie! It is still the best parody of Russian cinema. Who else than Sokurov could blind Tarkovsky so well. Did you think "Stalker" is slow? Get on the plate. "Mat and Son" makes "Stalker" look like "robbers of the lost ark". You should never miss this movie! There is no excuse - even if you live in a busy life, you can still enjoy this movie by holding the fast forward button on the VCR. Sokurov gave us his first feature film, which can be appreciated in 12 minutes. I suppose the next great masterpiece of this form will come when someone has the vision and the courage to exhibit a film that consists of a movie. no sound or picture at all - 45 minutes black, silent screen (not already explored in "In The Soup"?). It seems that the filmmaker (and fans) forgot to "motion" is the first word of "movie". <br /> <br /> !!! MAIN SPOILERS AHEAD !!! Do you want to achieve the heights of genius that this film has achieved? Here's a step-by-step guide: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find some items and a picturesque landscape (I think Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, look for some luxury car or perfume. 3. Shoot about 3 rolls of film. <br /> <br /> 4. Photoshop results play around with saturation, blur and aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Just take a movie camera, shoot the top 40 pictures and let your "actors" murmur your lines off the screen. Don't worry about writing it in advance - just let the actors say what they want (lines like "Do you want a drink?" If you can't think of enough dialogue - no problem! Just repeat what they say several times. If that's not enough, let the camera run the same. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the Internet, no problem! The static image will compress to anything with standard mpeg encoding - 73 minutes of film would be about 2-3 megabytes, even at the highest quality level.
