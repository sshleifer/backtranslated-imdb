Despite its ambitious ambitions, Zurlini must be considered a failure. One thing is to create a world that pulls the viewer into the feeling of boredom and anxiety experienced by the protagonist (which I think is what Zurlini was trying to do). It's a totally different thing to make a movie that is itself boring and absurdly episodic. Despite beautiful cinematography in a terrible place - and a wonderful score - the film never attracts viewers inside. Too much is unintentionally funny (a fake sound of dripping water in Drago's quarters, for example, or a silent film overflow by some actors) or simply confusing (why exactly does Drago want to leave the fortress for the first time?) To make the film a coherent work.
