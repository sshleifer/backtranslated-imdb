I saw this movie in the theater and it was a horrible movie. The way Michael Oliver, who is getting worse now, is the greatest intolerance I can't circumvent. Junior upset his father because he wouldn't go to school that maddened his father Ben. Also, Crazy Dance Ride Operator is not fair to Junior because he will not allow him to go on a ride. And that Lawanda Dumore is as terrible as a serial killer for Junior because she threatened Junior insults, which is why I can't tolerate this movie. Even though the movie is re-released to the theaters in the expanded version, I wouldn't see this movie yet, because this movie isn't something I could even tolerate. It really stinks!
