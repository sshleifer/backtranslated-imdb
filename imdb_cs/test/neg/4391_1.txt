This movie actually hurts to watch. Not only was I not once allowed, but in the end I got a serious headache. Sometimes I apologized to the actors involved. The best way to summarize this is to note that sex comedies are probably the least entertaining and least sexy of all time. I'm sorry I can't give less than one vote. To give this one rating is an insult to any movie that scores two or better. <br /> <br /> Now I see the shooting of the sequel. Hearing that someone really pays these people to make another film will convince me that there is too much money in Hollywood. RAISE ITS TAX !!! Doing the sequel to this film can very well constitute a crime against humanity; perhaps an international tribunal or U.N. to the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a really bad movie. Really really.
