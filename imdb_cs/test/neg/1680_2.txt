An elite American military team, which obviously includes two good-looking women and a man who can't understand teamwork, a lot of bats, terrorists, and a Spetznaz team that acts like a gang that can't shoot directly - they all thrown into a messy plot with average action. This one has nothing to do with it. The characters aren't convincing. Even an environment that has great possibilities looks like something from the heart of rural Pennsylvania, not an exotic Boreal forest in Eastern Europe. Bats are definitely wild. Can they even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet (harpies?) Or slash a hand. You see Delta's power, surrounded by hundreds of bats, with boys shooting assault rifles and guns at them, and firing on the ground. It would be like trying to shoot a skeet with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet. Totally clueless. The dialogue is sharply unrealistic, with boy / girl jokes and flirting in the middle of the tense part of the mission. One of the teams is thrown down and the first on the scene stares sadly at his body, overwhelmed, nor bothered to take a cover or secure space. In fact, the rest of the group appears as they talk about how the area is laid out like a minefield - thanks to the heads up up. <br /> <br /> If you want a contrast in how a horror movie involves a small military group can be done well on a low budget check out Outpost. Harvesting is not the movie you want to see. In fact, I think I'll give him two instead of three if I can do the other half. At this point, it seems unlikely.
