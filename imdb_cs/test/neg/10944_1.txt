Most people enjoy the luxury of writing in the title of the movie, and find out about the movie before watching, but unfortunately I have never been one of these people. I would not even read the synopsis for fear of spoilers, but there are two sides, because if you ignore such a warning and even give the film a chance after appearing in theaters, you enter at your own risk and maybe just end up with bad mouthfeel, which is exactly what I feel about this silly movie. Frankly speaking, the only good thing about Shakalaka-Crap-Crap are some of the songs (and seriously excluding the title track). Even the promising talent of Kangana Renaut (Metro, Gangster, Woh Lamhe) is seriously wasted here when he plays Ruhi, a woman who has attracted the attention of both leading male characters, played by Bobby Deol (who plays AJ without roots) and Upen Patel (who plays Reggi, an upcoming artist who transcends AJ). Celina Jaitley provides the right amount of OOMPH required from sociality, which gets pissed off by Reggi (whom she helped get the foot into the recording industry door). Doesn't that sound like a mix or movie that should include Anupam Kher correctly? Well, you're wrong because she's like Regg's father (another pointless talent). The film might not be so bad that its excess killing would not be behind Deol's character. The moral message was too sermonous (revenge had a deadly dark side) and the end was too exaggerated to wonder why you first sat down on such a crazy movie. Indeed, this is the epitome of crap.
