I just finished watching one episode (S1- # 5 Boy in the Bush), so my review isn't fair. <br /> <br /> But this episode is a very bad version of CSI, it's a bullshit. Main character, Dr. Regardless of her name, she is so fake that it actually hurts. I wouldn't want her to add dog food! Another damaging thing is David Boreanaz of "Angel" fame, a good actor, doing a great job, but wasting the woman's idiotic behavior. The support cast is fine, but everything is destroyed by this stupid act of Emily Deschanel. Very unsatisfactory version of CSI, very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some potential talents involved in it. That woman is really sh # t, at least in that episode. But based on this perspective, I won't even invest in tracking, even if it was shown on the elevator screen.
