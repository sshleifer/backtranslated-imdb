Considering that Carson McCullers is one of the most important literary figures of the 20th century, he seems to need a very large lack of talent to destroy one of her stories, but this film shows that it can be done! How do actors owe their way to becoming directors? Wooden, unmatmospheric, unsympathetic, totally unsynchronous with the poetic sympathy of McCullers' writing, my jaw dropped with horror and mistrust that such a mish-mash of film could ever find finances and supporters. The only redeeming features are some slightly good performances (although it said Vanessa Redgrave seems to be permanently portraying the same performance no matter what character she plays), and some good cinematography in places, but otherwise it is a bitter, bitter disappointment It could, and it should be, a modern masterpiece. Simon Callow should hang his head in shame and keep acting!
