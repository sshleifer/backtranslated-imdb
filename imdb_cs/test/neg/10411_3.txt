The family (a teenage boy, his mother and stepfather), ill with urban life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from her and have a fresh start. However, their idyll is destroyed by three brothers and their slaves, who do not kindly accept newcomers to their patch. While they have objects thrown through the window and are threatened on the street, it's just the beginning, the youth decide that it will be even worse by having a relationship with the dreadful sister of the trio. With a law that is not willing to do anything about it and is rapidly rising with violence, the boy decides to take things into his own hands. when it was done. Initially, you can laugh at some of Hamma's acting and ridiculous dialogue dedicated to characters, especially over-the-top bad guys. But then you get a totally unnecessary scene like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch or a thief's sister get to be beaten by her siblings for a brave sleep with our young hero. In fact, the whole view of women in a film that seems to be pathetic creatures who shout a lot and can't defend themselves is quite despicable. But of course there is a compulsory nude scene, which this time includes a young lady who sinks into the bra pool under a very thin shirt. Who cares about the consistency of a conspiracy when you have some willing young stars ready to get rid of it. Right ?! The peak is centered on the teenager, who until now was unable to sneeze without a jump, suddenly turn into a Rambo clone and blow his attackers to the left, right, and middle to save his stepfather, which the gang holds hostage. It's totally unlikely, but hey, so is everything else in this movie .. so at least you can't blame he's not consistent. So instead of trying to find the logic in the place where the word doesn't exist, check out the IMDb Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie, etc. Their career has hit dead ends. Why? Sit down and everything will be clear. Remember the children if you want to do business in this area, hire a decent agent and always read the scripts they offer you. Please .. 3/10
