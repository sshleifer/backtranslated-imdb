After finishing the novel novel Heart of Darkness, I continued and watched a film that was complete and absolute disappointment. At the beginning I expected the film to help build a book puzzle. However, even though I was reading the novel, the film still made no sense at all, so I can't imagine being lost if I left out the book altogether. The writers seemed to have chosen their favorite parts and put them in the film, leaving out anything that would help viewers understand the pointless conspiracy. This scary movie made no sense at all, and I would strongly recommend that I not observe it because it does nothing more than leave you totally confused and confused.
