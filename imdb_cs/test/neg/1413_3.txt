this film, though it could be considered a fine comedy attempt, is not what the previews did it to be. the first half consists of a typical Williams robin who stood up in the material, though he did not really make many voices; was always great on one liner and hitting punchlines ... somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program that is used in the election. Here is where network 3 comes ... a woman who helped with this program wants to be right and bad company wants to close her spoilers ** her boyfriend even helps them even if it is not even this movie could be one of political brilliance (maybe with a prophet on the reign), but he didn't notice the soul from too many cooks.
