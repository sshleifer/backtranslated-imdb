This show is perhaps one of the most boring, most unbearable exhibitions I've ever seen. While humor was subtle and I am all for gentle humor; Jokes just weren't funny. The show is about two kiwis in their mid thirties who live in New York and try to start their career in music. I saw this episode where Brett leaves the other Kiwis during an ambush. Well, the idea of ​​conspiracy has potential; but I had the feeling that half of the episode was just a fill, and the other half was really important to the story. I mean, they still explained how the one who was left behind was betrayed and had the other mistrust. I have one advice for writers: to mention it once for idiots who can't think of it as they behave and go on. And I found that the characters are annoying. The character who left the other, Brett, found herself too innocent and naïve, the one that was left walking around talking in this monotonous and robotic voice. The third band manager was obviously incompetent, but it was the character I liked. He is also the one who won the show one-star rating. All in all, the show I don't intend to follow again.
