The future of fantasy never looked so dark! Christopher Lambert fights the evil demon Grendel in this grim-looking fantasy. "Epos" I said? Um ... there's only one place, so you can't call it an epic adventure, do you? The site is a medieval / futuristic 5-inch tall castle, so how did they pack in all the actors? Oh, I get it, those with special effects. Miniature. Silly me. <br /> <br /> Here are a few reasons why you wouldn't like to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Lambert is again trying to do his sword tricks. in Highlander. <br /> <br /> - Sets and costumes are amazingly cool (if you're 12 years old). Rhona Mitra has a sensual pair of rappers who like to show off the whole movie. - er, Christopher Lambert has white hair ... <br /> <br /> - Every time they start fighting, the over-the-top crazy techno-soundtrack gets. So why are these medieval slayer-dudes fighting while they should be dancing. <br /> <br /> - They don't have electricity in this lock, but they have speakers installed that seem to work well. So where's the amplifier? I think they borrowed it from techno-dj who released the soundtrack. Watch it on top of the unusual demonic CGI creature coming directly from any Playstation 2 survival game. <br /> <br /> If all of this intrigued you, then look at it (at your own risk), but don't tell anyone I told you about. I strongly suspect that Pinhead's visiting while filming, because this movie doesn't have a soul. Anyway, if you want to see the beautiful Rohnu Mitra really show some skin, then watch Paul Verhoeven's HOLLOW MAN.
