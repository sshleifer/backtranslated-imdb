If it wasn't for the cheerful role of Christopher Guest, I'd stop watching this movie after 20 minutes. The jokes were flat, the movie jerky and slow going, some characters were uncomfortable and painful to watch, but the character of the guest still laughed at me, so I got stuck with him. <br /> <br /> I feel like there's a much better choice out there!
