"I remember being born ..." <br /> <br /> "The Vision Quest That Was the American West." <br /> <br /> "We went to the psyche ..." <br /> <br /> "I'm sure their first response is to be a cuckoo" <br /> <br /> " ..the place is scary ... "<br /> <br />" I think there's another dimension here. "<br /> <br /> Artist (Marta Becket) and her husband decades ago left the hustle and bustle New York City and moved to a city that was abandoned, with 10 residents in Death Valley. There they reconstructed a theatrical painting that is very domestic. And as soon as she finished, she practically didn't make a dance show. In many ways, he is very reminiscent of Werner Herzog's FITZCARRALDO or FIELD DREAMS - although AMARGOSA is a true personality documentary - not a mythical crazy person like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. Her husband will eventually leave - much of it probably because of the lifestyle she chose. So today he lives with his ten cats and a burry refuge, along with his new male companion, Tom. <br /> <br /> What you think about this document depends on your perspective. If you are in the thoughts of New Age and open to these feelings, then we are more likely to appreciate the film. Her talk of how she recalls her birth, spirits, visions, quests and psyche honestly stated that a psychology teacher was crouching in me, and that would certainly be the case for many people. In addition, her burro shrine and trying to keep the horse in the desert will most likely appeal to PETA and many other animal lovers, though with my background in the environment and biology, I see burros and horses as mold that would destroy native plants and animals. So in two different accounts, I tend to think quite the opposite of Marta - which is more of a "palpable" and "sensational" person. Depending on what you think about it, it will definitely color your views - and I'm sure most people will either think it's a genius or a matrix! You just have to guess what I think. Now, despite all this, the film is interesting and Marta's life is definitely not boring - especially since in recent years people have actually begun making trips to the desert to see her perform. There is a clear continuation for her and her unusual little world. Although I would not be almost as positive as most reviews, I cannot be as negative as the reviews because this strange document has some merit. I like movies about unusual people and Marta is definitely unusual! I also appreciate her love for her art and happy life - this is a precious gift. I teach art school psychology and it would certainly be interesting to show it to employees - where I am sure we will get a strong positive and negative response to the film - it depends on whether the teachers have taught art classes or basic curriculum ! Surely it would be interesting. By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but when Martha's husband had matters with which it happened?! After all, they lived in the middle of no where I was wondering where to find partners. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you want to see it and / or stay with it, you can find it at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/.
