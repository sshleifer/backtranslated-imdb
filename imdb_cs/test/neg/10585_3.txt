When a defeated teenager is bitten by an insect, he becomes a Dragonfly superhero ... Superhero Film is the latest spoof film that hits the screen. But sadly, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved in the Airplane !, Top Secret and The Naked Gun), they still suffer from the mistake of the last spoofs ... especially it's stupid than fun! The fault lies mainly in the grafts. It's not just funny. Some of those jokes work like nail scenes, but other parts just fall. For example, X-men spoof, or the entire farting sequence. Blazing Saddles It's Not! One of the key things about the best spoof movies like Airplane is that although the dialogue is extremely fun, the cast for most of the game is absolutely straight. This makes it even more fun. Even though a simple dialog box is in the foreground, there may be funny things behind the actor. Again funny. Another key thing is that everyone has a conspiracy of species to hang gags. <br /> <br /> The recent trend seems to be to make scenes from different movies, then try and spoof them. As a result the so-called site of these films very rarely exists. Another drawback of these movies is that some scenes were actually funny in the original versions and in most cases even more fun than the spoof scene! The cast tries to get into the needed spirit, but with a lot of unfair dialogue and scenes, it's hard to deal with it. Given that recent spoof films are going, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or terrible Meet The Spartans, but since some of the people here have done In the past, good, funny movies, there's nowhere good enough.
