This movie is there with an Oscar and a moment of moment as one of the unintentionally funny movies of all time. It is worth lending to some wildly big laughter. The story is ridiculous. It wouldn't happen in life as if it were so incredible. the way James Woods tries and chases heavy hitters before giving this supposed two-bit hustler work 3000 miles away in LA, what a joke <br /> <br /> I love the old beat VW bug meaning how low it is' I got into life for all that is tootski. Sean Young is incredibly bad as: "I love you forever, no matter what, wife". It wasn't so funny that you would throw on how sweet a sweet young trying to project herself.and as bad as you will ever see. James Wood overacts throughout the movie and he's so extremely funny and he's the way over the top, he's just not believing Woods looks like a parody of cocaine devil off Saturday Night Live.but watching Woods on ` ludes' is worth the rental price. I love it when Woods tells a guy who wants to give him some more "people" that he doesn't, Woods just made three giant coke lines. This is something very funny. The end is so comical, but right on the steam with the rest of the movie.
