Do you know the old saw about the train wreck? The one about how he can't be turned away? This movie isn't so good. The only reason you're still is that you brought your children and you can't leave them alone in the theater. You can take a nap. Tim Hill should never work in the film again after he has delivered this terrible piece of waste. Jason Lee manages to capture a decent comedian actor and turn him into a robotic, insecure actor in this production. I haven't had much hope for this movie, I confess. If it wasn't a single family movie, I could marry my son for Christmas, my wife and I wouldn't be with him. God, I wish we could come back in time and stop. I leaned forward to my wife for about 10 minutes to tell her what stinking she was, but she beat me to a blow. I'm not kidding. It's ugly. Only David Cross's great work will save this review from being just 1 star. The story is deceptive, insulting and stupid, as you might expect in a movie in this genre (though it is recent). Curious George "was blissfully intelligent and entertaining". Behavior is mostly poor. The decision to "update" Chipmunks songs for today's audience was at best unsuitable and worst. It does not work. The old chipmunks were clever, malicious and crafty. These chipmunks are stupid, somewhat witty, unpleasant, and in surprise unnecessary to the point of uselessness. This film, either as a retrospective, a tribute, or a completely new production, is absolutely perfect. fail. The last straw? My son couldn't wait to leave. Instead, you can spend your money on renting curious George.
