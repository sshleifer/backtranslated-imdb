Ok, if you like your monster moovies annoying, stiff, starchy, and tumultuously boring but with lots of strangling, then head right for "Lady Frankenstein", stagy, costume Italian corpse-walker. Joseph Cotten ("Citizen Kane") plays the crunchy old Baron himself and must really need to pay for this condition. Sexy Sarah Bay, who starred in European cows without cows, usually as Rosabla Neri, including "Hercules Against the Moon Men", plays her ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a disheveled dress. Cotten makes an ugly, spectacular monster (cud that really is such a great effort to be nice?), Who immediately strangles Cotten (who took his check check & run) and wanders around the strangling in sight. Tania (Bay) decides to switch his lover's brain (which is old and wrinkled) with the brain of a younger man (who is "beautiful" but stooopid) so that another monster strangles the first monster Cotten who wanders around strangling people. Well, after a big exposure, and some strangling, 2 monsters strangling each other for a little, Tania stabs the first monster in her back, and then has sex in the burning ruins of her mansion with a second monster - just keep him gas of her! Doh! There is so much strangling happening that you almoost overlook the fact that the movie is about as exciting as dead carp, and mooves as fast. The Alpha Video version I saw for this review has been heavily modified and one wonders have eaten a lot of nekkid people who have been sliced, not that the movie has improved. Director von Theurmer earlier helmed a variety of grade Z Euro-Waste, including "Jungle Warriors", "Island of the Dead" (as Mel Wells), and "Crucified Girls of San Ramon". MooCow says he's going to avoid this movie's corpse and find something that could be moving in a moore-filled gas. <br /> <br />; = 8)
