Go to the video store to get the original. I don't understand why Hollywood has to have a perfect foreign film and redo it. "Mostly Martha" or "Bella Martha" has a much better cast. Starting with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more as a perfectionist obsessive than the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones, the Italian cook and niece suddenly got rid of her mother and was forced to live with her aunt, not suitable for babies. In many ways, the American version of the film is a copy of the German original. They just exchanged actors. However, they also changed the story because it would be difficult and not very plausible to materialize a father for a baby girl in an American context. <br /> <br /> I've been thinking about it. Maybe my father could be Puerto Rican, or Cuban, or Mexican. There are so many "guest workers" in the US. However, I doubt that any of them could assume the responsibility that the Italian father did in the original. The American film is therefore leaving, but holding an Italian chef. This changes the story. The original "Martha" is so removed from reality that he thinks it's okay to send her niece to a stranger in a foreign country. The American "Martha" is softer, so the film is sweeter and has no edge to the German film. <br /> <br /> In the original "Italian" cook is not so good looking, but much charming, the little girl is a little brat, but much more believable and "Martha" is more representative of a woman's career in today's world than a watered version, we are introduced in the American version. The whole American opera was very unpleasant. I loved Italian songs in the original and bought a CD. Hollywood realized that "mostly Martha" was a great movie. Maybe the distribution companies should put in more theaters, or they should be in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is much better. By the way, it reminds me of another remake. "Shall we dance" is one of my favorites in the original Japanese version and completely forgotten in the American version.
