This movie is simply garbage. I have to say I'm a garbage expert. I reserve a "1" rating for movies that are wicked but funny, but this movie is just boring and definitely not miserable in a funny way but miserable. It gets "2" so those of you there can distinguish between those who will laugh at you and those that will allow you to fall asleep. There are scenes in this movie where the actors are looking at something, their expressions are overwhelming and there wide eyes and flabby jaws tell the audience that what they are looking for will be deeply awesome, it just isn't just a wardrobe or even more desert. It must be pretty god damn horrible to leave, let me tell you that I came out and made a few people.
