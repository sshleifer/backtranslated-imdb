In 1976, her mother, Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz), lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night a box is placed on the doorstep, and the next morning they open the box and a button appears that must be opened with a key. By late afternoon, a man with a terrible scar on his face comes to the door and represents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and reports that if he presses a button in the world that the family doesn't know, he dies and receives a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it, nothing happens and the offer will be moved to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone, including their son, about this deal. The motivation of the family to push the button is increased by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, will not enter the new job he is applying for, and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that her funding for the faculty is decreasing. One of the pleasures of this bizarre sci-fi thriller, based on the "Button Button" by Richard Matheson, will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ridiculous premise. Opening a film is particularly problematic when it is based on realism in the home. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the state of schizophrenia to justify his excursion to paranormal activities and parallel universes. Without a dreamlike state that is a far better film, The Box and the very idea of ​​a device that can kill someone in the world is unlikely. That Norma would also take someone to her home, which is almost as scarred as Two-Face by The Dark Knight, and believes in this offer, she seems to be just as fancy. If it is not so likely, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy about someone who has been struck by lightning, the possibility of extraterrestrial life, or some other divine influence on these situations. Scenes involving gates that open in public libraries, accidental bleeding from the nose, and mindless drones that follow the Lewis family are almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. The film can be called interesting purely to see where it goes. Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to keep our attention through many of the film's controversies. In one scene, Norma teaches a class and then asks her a strange boy about her leg. She scoffs at her when she misses four fingers. Later, for a wedding rehearsal dinner attended by Norma and Arthur, the same student appears as a waiter and seems to be chasing them. However, any justification for all these peculiarities is packed in a highly fictional sci-fi revelation that many find unlikely and hard to swallow. What is most disappointing about the film is that once the Button is pressed surprisingly early, many of the moral implications that were initially promised diminish for most of the image. The end that will not be spoiled here will restore these moral questions in the hope of repeating the Greek tragedy. While similarities can be seen, at this point, due to the unlikeness of so much film and uneven performance, there are few reasons to care for. Cameron Diaz's southern accent might be unnecessary, but surprisingly, Langell, who is most disappointed in the film, with a very inconspicuous written role, like a mysterious scarred man who seems to be hiding a military base that dr. It's really just a shadow of his massive performance in Frost / Nixon. There are not many other actors in the film; in particular, both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but as mouthpieces of Kelly's pastiche of thought. Developed and concise interviews, such as where Norma sympathizes with Arlington over their deformities, and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know if one of them kills some of them, it emphasizes. Since 2001, Richard Kelly has been unable to make a film that would fit Donnie Darek's quality and imagination. Although this film might be interesting for a while, it is too absurd and unlikely to be fully exploited, which would certainly not justify more views due to the somewhat illogical revelations of the film. Sci-fi fans may be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say under the surface remains mysterious. The box this year is one movie that should have been postponed.
