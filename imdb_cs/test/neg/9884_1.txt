This movie was boring. Very like Underworld, just less interesting. It's not a werewolf, not a horror movie. The leading couple was boring. I didn't care about Vivian and Aiden at all. And there was so little development of characters that I didn't care about any character in the movie. The story was thin. The transformations were essentially zero. I liked the wolves themselves, maybe I did a wolf document, I'd like it better. I wouldn't recommend this movie. I didn't find it fun or interesting. It's just pulling and everyone in it is a dull move. This movie could win a prize for how to make a werewolf movie.
