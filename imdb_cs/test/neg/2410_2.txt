I didn't know what to expect from "Future-Kill," but I certainly hoped it would be a little better than I had. I knew the rating was bad and the rating was unfavorable, but the Subversive DVD-cover illustration looks out of the cold and can't resist. For a very long (too long, in fact) time, this film has increased the impression that it is an unofficial sequel to Porky's with lame, vulgar and offensive fraternal pranks. Five mega-dorks, one of them being a fine young Jim Carrey clone, desperately wanted to become a frat party, but their final dedication could only be a little tight and dangerous. They are dropped into the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces, along with the outbreak of violent gang war. It doesn't take too long to be confronted with Splatter, a seemingly half-man and half-machine warrior who runs a gang I never knew who they were or what they were. Was it government experiments? Kyberg? Terminator mimics the distant future? Does anyone care? "Future-Kill" is a bizarre amateur movie with a script that jumps from one subject to another without any logical connection or narration. The story borrows vital elements from big movie classics like The Warriors, Escape from New York and The Terminator, but the result is a huge Sci-Fi monstrosity. Costumes and special effects are very sad and there is expensive and cheap nudity. Acting is terrible, but I'm willing to blame delayed dialogues instead of casting members. One to avoid at all costs, despite the really cool DVD-cover art. Resist it!
