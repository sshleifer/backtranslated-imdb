I've read more reviews of this movie from hacks, and although it's definitely not the best movie ever made in the science fiction / horror genre, it's not bad if you accept it for what it is - low budget, b-movie fare, that (say) "borrows heavily" from similar "Alien" (ugly extraterrestrial monster by the cocoons of his victim) "Kind" (wonderful and confused "space girl") and "Incubus" (the beastie-breeding-with-captivity-girlish angle). This is one seriously ugly movie, and the whole thing was apparently done on a budget line, though the stranger is not too bad (I've seen much less compelling men-in-rubber suits in any case). None of the acting is Oscar material and the Isle of Man is not very convincingly doubled for Boston Massachussetts. The plot is also quite predictable, and the assumption that a strange craft could throw miles away and crash on the ground, plunge into the center of all girls' campus - and thus comfortably provide a rich source of perfect breeding victims - is absolutely ridiculous. However, the film has its thrilling moments, there are some nudity and semi-nudity helpers and the film features one of the few movie appearances by the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (like "Space Girl") who was just 24 years old in London murdered by her jealous friend shortly after filming this movie.
