Oh, my. Poor Jane had to do an old thing that was moving. Even with regard to bad production values ​​for time (1971) and format (some sort of mini-series), this is a baaaaaad. No matter what you do with Austen, the dialogue should sparkle (even in this, perhaps the most serious work) and the melodrama should be strictly out of bounds. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this production. By the time you get to Anne's "Frederick, Frederick, Frederick," you either laugh or cry. If you're not just "visually" collecting all the existing Austen movies, you can skip this one. But if you watch it, there is little consolation: actresses playing Anne's sister are doing a great job with their roles.
