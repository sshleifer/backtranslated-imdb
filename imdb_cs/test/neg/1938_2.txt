I haven't seen every jackass episode. It was a little fun if nothing else was possible. But after watching Jackass # 2 I was like Bam and Dunn. They had a nice attitude in the jackass movie so I thought I'd tune in to viva la bam. The boy was wrong. Seriously, you could pair up a lot of 2'graders, give them the same budget, and bet they could make something more creative on the screen. C'Mon MTV !! In 23 places where most people are attuned, give us this waste. You don't know characters because there's no attitude at all. You can't appreciate Bam or Dunn or anyone else. If there was only a tiny little thought. Everything we don't forget as soon as the next shot continues. Finally they manage to make a good shot and enjoy what's happening. You're sitting there, just waiting for their reaction, and then some blockbuster closes the scenes with two lame sentences and a bang. Was it this shot, or what, please? If I were there, I would laugh and laugh. Do some crazy things and keep your adrenaline pumping, but these guys ... They just read stupid reactions. Yes, they'll get a couple of audience laughter with cheap coarse jokes or gigantic jokes that I think are such cash wastes. Many many ordinary people who have not been taken under the Jackass wing could have written a much more entertaining scenario. Or impress a visual camera. Even spontaneous would-be men without a script would get a better job. MTV could bring more reassuring material to the screen. All you have to do is fire the writer of this silly show. Some scenes really require a bit of courage and therefore two stars.
