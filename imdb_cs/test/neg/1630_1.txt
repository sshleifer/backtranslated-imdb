I saw this on a late, late, late, late show when MST3K was just the eye in Joel Hodgs's eyes. I had the honor of seeing it without knowing exactly how bad it would be. I did not know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run "at the end of the earth" for an hour and a half (thank God that her father gave such specific instructions) and then take a few days to return the castle with help. I did not know that a barbaric type of sword could fly into the forest to create a curtain and lightning powder bombs in 30 seconds. I had no idea how a disjointed film could be. It's a bad thing, kids, a very bad thing. If you like bad movies, go for it.
