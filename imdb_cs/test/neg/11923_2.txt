I met TV in the early 1990s and loved it ... <br /> <br /> What did you like about it? Breathtaking drawing style? Flawless Art Action? Absurd and dead communication between characters? The whole arrangement of the surrounding future world? No matter what you loved on it ... <br /> <br /> The end of 2005's Aeon Flux has nothing to do with it. Karyn Kusama, the so-called "director" of the film, was hopelessly exaggerated when he switched the original content to a new movie. If you are not familiar with the original series, you will not understand anything during the first 60 minutes of the movie. The story is unpredictable and vapid characters do not develop during the film. Kusama's attempt to improve the story by implementing some rather faint explanatory talks between the main characters is not just a lame attempt to cover up its shortcomings as a narrator, it is simply inappropriate from the original concept. Charlize Theron can be an attractive woman, but she can't be a Ã†ON character. Although she was chained to strings doing action scenes, her lack of talent for physical movement simply destroys the action sequences in the movie. The result is a vast number of hectic sections of the image that cover the sheer glare of her character. Forget the rest, it's not what to talk about ... I give 1 point for Ms.Theron showing her breasts and 1 point for nice architectural photos in the movie. And it is done.
