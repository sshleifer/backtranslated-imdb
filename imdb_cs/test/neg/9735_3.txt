I was hoping to learn something from this movie, but I was disappointed. It's all about Rommel and praises him as a great general, but in no time did we ever get an idea in this movie of why he was great. What made him successful? Was it his drive, his unwillingness to accept defeat, his discipline with his men? I was looking for Patton's rendition, which really got into the character, but it fell to the ground. Most of the dialogue is resourceful and sensational and feels musty and artificial. There is some good action but not much. The tail end of the story, which discusses his involvement in the plot to kill Hitler, was the most informative part and probably the most interesting. But as a history lesson about Germany's greatest general, it was a failure.
