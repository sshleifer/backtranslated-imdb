This is a great example of what happened at Comedy Central after Dave Chapelle left. Here's the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his maiden name is Ned Holness, and it was known until his 18 when he changed his name to Ned Arnel Mencia. He was born in Honduras, even though he acts like Mexico. He also grew up in the United States. I could forgive you all the bullshit, but ... <br /> <br /> He was caught to steal other people. Joe Rogan was his loudest critic in this way. The Stereotype Olympic Games were an idea that a couple of Miami DJs had pulled out. He stole Bill Cosby's jokes. He stole George Lopez's material in his special HBO special (13 minutes). He thinks what he's doing is so original, but Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli have been racing for years for this idiot (others). <br /> <br /> This show will collapse and burn. The word Beaner cannot last until it gets old. He hasn't done anything new since the first episode. <br /> <br /> "Want to hear a joke? Beaner jumping fence! This is funny for 3 seasons!" No. Awful.
