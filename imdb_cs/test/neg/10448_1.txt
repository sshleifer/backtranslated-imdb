Finally, the film rival with "El Padrino" and "Darkness Falls" when it comes to sheer and utter numbness. This is actually the first movie I ever got on 1 out of 10 on IMDb for good reason. <br /> <br /> There's nothing special about one. Usually, this is not a problem for me, except that the only character that is in any case interesting or different from everyone else is Harrington of Great L. Bush. Secondly, production values ​​that are non-standard - TV sci-fi like Stargate have more convincing sets, and all underwater scenes that are not processed by SFX teams are filmed on dry "falling particle" sets that are not very convincing. . This film is literally "drydocked". The worst, however, is that this BORING movie. For the first 45 minutes, I felt like we were moving around and in circles: "It's a prehistoric shark." "Bullsh * t." "No really." "Bullsh * t." "I'm not doing this." "Bullsh * t." "Here it is!" "I didn't see anything." "Let me guess?" "Yeah. Bullsh * t." Then it will rise so easily for about twenty minutes. Then we return to the dialogue. Dialogue is not a bad thing, but that's the movie. Characters speak. That's not a bad thing, except that the movie is not very good at it. The dialogue is often fictional and cliché, and it is not very interesting to listen. I see no point of slandering special effects; this film has worse properties. <br /> <br /> The sets are small and unrealistic. Negotiation is subpar. The scenario - O Lord, the script - is worse than the sci-fi TV garbage. That interests you where the movie's budget is or was. Still other horrible, horrible additions to the 'Megaloadon' (there are about four) series of movies. Bring Steve Alten, please ...
