When Jim Wynorski first announced that he was going to make a new sequel to my favorite series of all time, the "Slumber Party Massacre", I was thrilled. I've been waiting for a new installment for literally years. So began production and very small pieces and pieces for filming and the actors involved were released until wrapped. Then the title notification changes. This new sequel should no longer be called "Massacre of Party IV Massacre", but "Cheerleader Massacre". I was a little disappointed, but having a different title would be a very small price for a movie that I have been waiting for so long. I was still very impressed and on the edge of my seat to see it. Maybe a month ago some very advanced copies of the movie were released to some extremely happy viewers who saw the movie. months before its publication. Several reviews leaked to the net and judged them, I started worrying about Jim Wynorski's "Cheerleader Massacre". <br /> <br /> I met the film for the first time tonight and I was still scratching my head. As I read in another review, "Cheerleader Massacre" is definitely NOT a new installment at the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, but slasher swipe them all on their own. And bad in it. Before I get to the specifics of the movie, let me first mention what a huge fan of Jim Wynorski's movies I am. I always thought he was a real genius, with a winner almost every time. Yes, his films are made on cord budgets and do not contain the most powerful gaming, but they are still fun. They are what they are: campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time. From "Sorority House Massacre II" to "Hard to Die", "Chopping Mall", Jim made goods on more than one occasion. One of the reasons I was excited about this film being his last project. "Cheerleader Massacre" (in my opinion) doesn't reflect any of the movies I've seen in this director / writer. past. First, the production was very cheap and the movie was actually filmed on a videotape, something I had never seen Jim before. The actors were mediocre, at least, and the story was almost ridiculous. The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you of an old-fashioned pet rather than an escape from madness. Of course, the film is dotted with female nudity. This is Jim Wynorski's movie we're talking about, people. But some of the shots we see here seem almost like time. There's an extremely long shower scene that includes a cheerleader coach who seems to be going forever and it very reflects Jim's "Sorority House Massacre II" shower scene. The girl even bathes almost as much. "Cheerleader Massacre" is also extremely clich√©, to say the least. The opening scene is literally something we've all seen in HUNDREDS past slasher flicks. The guy and the girl who are doing, on the verge of completing their relationship when ... you guessed it. They are hacked to pieces. Brinke Stevens, who I never thought was a great actress in the first place, also gives one of her toughest and most powerful performances in her little portrait. We're talking about possible cue cards. She recalls some of the incidents that her character endured by the murderer who had seen the police twenty years ago, while shots from the original "party massacre" massacre. Why did the original film footage be used if it wasn't the new "SPM"? I have no idea. There are also two explosions in this movie that I am almost sure were recycled from other films. Not only does this film recycle FOOTAGE from past films, it also recycles results from other films. . Some of the music used in "Humanoids from Deep" (which was also recycled prior to "Coroner") can be heard throughout the film. There are at least two more also that I can't identify, but I'm sure they were used before. After sitting in this movie's horrible acting, ridiculous story, non-existent gore / special effects, and a video camera - like quality, I have some serious concerns about Mr. Wynorski's career. Has a man who has enjoyed viewers in the past lost his niche? Only time will show. And let's not forget his latest movie. New installment in "Sorority House Massacre", now called "Final Exam." I think I see a pattern here ...
