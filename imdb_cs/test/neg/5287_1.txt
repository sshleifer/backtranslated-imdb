Acting was very inferior, you had Costas Mandalar, who acted as a triple-brother of Forest Guard Triple H, like Scott McMahon looked like his deputy, I think he should look after you, but there's no emotional involvement. You have silly lesbians, not that I have something against lesbians, I don't just have foolish people who keep running around in a punch like a shirt and a grunge hat that still asks if anyone has seen their dead lover. Villain might be scary and somewhere about what he is trying to fight with age and death is a story of morality, but he is getting lost in this movie. Costas Hurst Helmsley points out that they will soon become victims on the way back to the city, while behind him are the lights of the city. Also Ed Gein's Revelation, but Gine said it. As a Wisconsin citizen. We had our share of Monsters Gein, Dahmer and McCarthy, but if you use it, say it right. God Why do I watch all these horrible movies. Oh yes, I'm gutting for punishment and watching them so you don't have to.
