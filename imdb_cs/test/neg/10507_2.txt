As I said, sometimes the budget is low. You can see a good movie without a lot of extra BS that can hide a different piece of crap. Well ... that was the crap. If anything, I thought it had humor, unfortunately humor was unintentional. The only half-humorous play came from Bill Smith and his part was cut out (that's a joke). There was never Bill Smith, nor was there anyone who could act. Even Gerald Okamura licked and was cast in almost 40 films. Combat scenes were comic and I felt I could kick all their $% # @ # $. The sound was terrible as if all the sound was recorded on the scene. My 10-year-old could write a better script ... BTW, my 10-year-old fell asleep ... without fun. I give B + to edit the film for just 90 minutes ... 60 minutes would be A +.
