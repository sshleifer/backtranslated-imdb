When it was released this film caused a feeling. I watched it and was excited. Beautiful, usually young, naked women filmed in classy style we knew so well from director Hamilton. His photos never become porn and the same goes for this movie. I saw it again today and was bitterly disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow scenes, all shot with some vaseline on the lenses, is actually all that is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed, but they are not real creatures with the soul. Actually, nothing happens. It's like Hamilton's shooting with moving pictures rather than photos. And after a while it will be so boring. I didn't even watch the whole thing the second time because I slept a huge sleep. That's all that's left of this masterpiece: it's a very good sleeping pill. And you will never depend on it! At that time 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
