This abomination and the continuation of ONE MORE (without thanks) and the disastrous disaster of Jerry Lewis, such as RAISE THE BRIDGE LOW THE WATER, led cinema owners to shut their doors rather than being forced to operate these films. . The truth: in the 1960s, the block movie booking was still being promoted on unfortunate suburban and rural cinemas ... that means the movie was forced to run pitiful timewasters like the FIDDLER ON to get a good movie. THE ROOF, or something like that, I was rescued at the United Artists reservation office by a laughing salesman waving a flop of letters in front of me and squinting, "Now before we get to this, lemme see ya date you first". which basically means: "books these duds and we'll give ya a tired hit". This is how and why so many cinemas were shut down, forced to screen and bother their weak audience with these assembly line failures with lame comics and boring talent. The cinema owners, exhausted by quarreling, simply closed, sold the gas station and saw the cinema destroyed. These days the same type of movies (eg: NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY) get driven to 20 movie seats 99 in mega google plex instead. Nothing much has changed. FREDDY GING FINGERED ... anyone?
