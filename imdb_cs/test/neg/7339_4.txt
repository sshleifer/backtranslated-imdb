I love the book. It is full of passion, romance, tension ... and the film carries two spunky. Kylie Minogue has already been a star in Australia and starred in Neighbors and released her first single. The decision to occupy her at The Delinquents was certainly a marketing trick. It didn't pay for me. Kylie could have been great in her neighbors, but she was too sweet and innocent to play wild Lola ... Lola was down. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. The movie was boring. She pulled herself, lacked the passion of the book, concentrated on Kylie, and was generally disappointed.
