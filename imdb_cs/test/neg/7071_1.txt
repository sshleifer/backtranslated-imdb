This movie was such a mess that I actually paid to my friends, which I pulled to see it. The only reason I went to see was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the set. I'm sure this movie was supposed to be camped, but the approach was so cumbersome and self-reflective it turned out really flat. Judd Nelson plays the role of an obedient garbage man who is on the side of a comedian hack. His life is hell and worse is his uncomfortable and prevalent companion Bill Paxton (who is embarrassed - for the talented actor it was really tasteless). Mad accident changes Nelson's career and follows chaos. The humor attempts were sloping, predictable, and often foundational and tasteless. Wayne Newton's cast as a talent agent is a novelty, but he does nothing - comedy or otherwise. Overall, it's a very weak and unpretentious attempt at humor in a camp that goes like a lead balloon. At least you could laugh at AT Plan 9 from space. This one just wonders who thought it was a good idea to fund and film. One of the worst bombs you'll ever experience.
