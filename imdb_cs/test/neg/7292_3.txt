When I put this movie on my DVD player and sat down with coke and some chips, I had some expectations. I was hoping this movie would include some of the strengths of the first film: Awsome Animation, a good flowing story, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and soundtrack. But to their disappointment, there is no one in Atlantis. If I read some reviews first, I wouldn't have been let go. The following paragraph will focus on those who have seen the first film and who enjoyed it primarily for the points listed. Milo returned from a showcase in your local video port (or anything) and had the expectations I had. The music feels like a bad imitation of the first film, and the voice voice has been replaced by not so perfect. (Except for a few characters like Sweet Voice). Real drawing is not so bad, but animation is a particularly sad look. The storyline is also weak, because more than three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the only adventurous story we've ever received. But don't understand, it's not a very good Schooby-Doo episode. The only time I didn't laugh was, even though I laughed once or twice. <br /> <br /> Viewers who have not seen the first film, or do not care for a similar sequel, have a quick overview of this movie as a separate product: If you like schooby-doo, you can enjoy this movie. If you haven't, you can enjoy this movie if you have nothing to do. And I think it might be a good movie for kids, but I wouldn't know. It could be better if Milo's return was a three-part comic strip or breakfast series.
