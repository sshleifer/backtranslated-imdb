This movie started out as a pretty decent movie, but it never really started, instead it was predictable and even a little silly. Some scenes were pretty well done, the photos and cuts used in combination with the sounds and made it a little more interesting to watch, but since the story was slow, he couldn't keep the interest alive. More importantly, it's not scary at all! It should be a horror movie, but it wasn't the only scene that would approach a scary or even exciting one. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the actors weren't as great or colorful. you will remember the rest of your days .. <br /> <br /> A totally traceable movie, but it doesn't add anything, and once you're done watching it, it won't be long until it's forgotten. The reason I watched it was that I read a rating that gave him the highest score, but I disagree and instead rated it 4 out of 10. If you still want some Japanese horror, I recommend you watch instead of Ju-On! <br /> <br />
