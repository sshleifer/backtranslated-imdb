I was fortunate enough to read the book in advance and know a little about Tudor England. film writing and editing of this TV movie was largely horrible. I felt like I was looking at a really bad drama doc about the period rater then the movie. <br /> <br /> First there was too much cut between the important parts. And when we leave out the important events that took place at the time, one is the fall of Rome with his desire to divorce Katherine from Aragon, which has led England to break away from Rome and establish its own church. barely enough for a book. I am all for creative freedom, but at the border, especially when it is a well written book as the beginning. In Mary's book, Catherine was first born and then young Henry was born. Both their father is Henry eight. in the movie they show Harry's first then Catherine. And they suggest that Catherine's father is William Carey. there are too many bad moments in the movie to write it to everyone. However, I will say that the portrayal of Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone because Boleyn's sisters were probably the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the book and know nothing about Henn's Eighth Court, I suggest you stay away from this movie. And for those who read the book, the film annoys you for not having enough details and important conspiracies.
