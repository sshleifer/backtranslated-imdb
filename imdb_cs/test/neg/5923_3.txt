I really liked the idea of ​​traveling between dimensions, and I even liked Wade / Quinn tension in the first episodes. Some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extraordinarily interesting backdrops for their stories. However, as the show went there there were more stupid disputes between friends and a less true bond. There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension. And every world had one of the characters in love. The writing started to get bored and everything was upstairs. Too bad it would be nice if I had a few years on television that would be tightly knit (la Star Wars).
