I do not know in what neighborhoods people who have written enthusiastic reviews for this film live, but I am glad that I am not there unless they have comments on cartoonish-ness of this thing. Okay, we'll learn to suspend our distrust of movies like "Die Hard," but when we see little Jodie wiping out a Glock street gang like NOVICE ... c'mon. All she needed was a bald head and a torn shirt and she should be Bruce Willis. Jodie, the executive producer, apparently blinded her, what a joke and a waste of money it would be. Or there was a fantasy where there is only one blonde and everyone else is brunette or Hispanic. Even the dog is black. Little Blondie is the only good and (except Black Police Officer) everyone else in the city is some nasty minority to get her. Refusing your fear of gaming talent to the point that you think the only way you can notice it is to be the only bright place (literally) at the camera in a dark, sad and dark neighborhood / movie / cast? Apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie ... The Dark Knight. Sensual Holes Conspiracy, Chewing Furniture, Gratuitous Violence ("Watch Girls! You Can Do It Now!"). ..Spend time with your family instead of watching this hole.
