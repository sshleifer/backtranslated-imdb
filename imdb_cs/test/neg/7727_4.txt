It is true that HOTD 2 is better than Uwe Boll crapfest, which was the first, but it is like saying that drowning is better than being chopped alive. OK OK, I'm a little rough with this, just that video game adaptation Zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth. Resident Evil was fine, but his sequel is pure garbage. First HOTD enjoyed crap more than anything else; Uwe Boll saw it. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The fun value was there, the hot chicks were there, gore was there, but ... is that it? The scenario, though subpar, was better than the first one. But in the script, they take on terribly written characters, silly action sequences, clichés, and ends that stretch and reach a level of ridicule that would make Bollmeister very, very proud. But could it be worse? HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as a mad doctor looking for a cure for death. As you might guess, everything goes to sh * t. Near the College Campus, Zombie (or Hypersapien?) Seems to be the center of the epidemic. . Their main goal? No, it's not blowing sh. Instead, they have to get a sample of zombie blood so they can cure a deadly virus. Meanwhile, there are bland interactions with the character, an unbearable amount of cliché (but hey, at least that black man is not the first to kill), and a decent looking zombie. Negotiations are clear. Who would have thought Sticky Fingaz was an actor who was able to be him? I do not. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shone somewhat like lead. And the support cast was also clear. It was all clear. The effects of make-up on zombies were fine, it could have been worse than the first HOTD: just the guys running in dusty mummy suits. Gore was fine too. Cheap movies and even cheaper tensions are almost non-existent in this film, which is a good thing. The action sequences were stupid like f * ck, but at least there were no zombies fighting with a sword or that ridiculous slow motion. Overall, this film will only appeal to Zombie enthusiasts, arcade fans and someone who wants to rent a cheap Horror movie for the weekend. Apparently it will be the third, as the end suggests, but I wouldn't count on it. If Uwe doesn't decide to do that. A 4.
