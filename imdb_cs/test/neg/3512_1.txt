This movie was horrible and in the end I wondered why someone went into trouble to do it. Now it wasn't all bad, I studied film and this movie was very nicely assembled and had very good film everything with interesting angles to very nice lighting and excellent camera work. I wish I could see it back at school because it would make a good movie on which to write an article. Brno University of Technology ........ Since I graduated and lost most of my film, I realized that the movie should be especially fun, this movie was long and boring and I'm not sure when it finally got to the point, that it was worth the time. <br /> <br />
