I consider myself a big fan of low-budget horror movies. The more bizarre and imaginative the film, the more blood and guts, the better, and I really fall in love with cheaply made movies if they are done right. Luther starts pretty well ... his circus origins, the haunted run in the supermarket, the old lady's assault and his disruptive work of a female farm all fit nicely. Hot sex / shower scene follows when daughter women and daughter friend come to the house. When Luther steals boys from a motorcycle, the film turns to worse. Characters are presented with many opportunities: A) save your loved ones, B) get the police to help, C) escape, or (most importantly) D) KILL LUTHER !!! I can't feel empathy or fear for characters who are too stupid to help themselves. Chareters is getting away from the chance to arm themselves with weapons and knives while Luther is gone. The policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective in stopping Luther, though at one point he has a rifle directly aimed at Luther while Luther clucks and makes his rendition of Polish chicken dancing. I found myself helplessly coaching my television: "Make sure he's dead!", "He left, get out of there!" Or "Kill him!" Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but barely Hannibal Lecter. If you can't outsmart this egghead, you deserve what comes to you. You'll be so fatal to the middle of the movie that the fate of half-wizards will be so lethargic that only morbid curiosity can keep you to a slightly fun end. This film has been recorded as one of the 101 Greatest Films of Fangorie You Have Never Seen ... Fangoria is half right on Luther Gek's.
