This is a terrible adaptation. The worst was music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story from the early 18th century ?????? The only character who didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open, and I like Jane Austen's films usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when they didn't have any chemistry or indication of what they were looking for in the movie. Isabella and her brother were exaggerated; It wasn't an immediate secret to me that she and her brother were "bad guys" and part of Jane Austen's excitement is the discovery that you think it's good, no. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.
