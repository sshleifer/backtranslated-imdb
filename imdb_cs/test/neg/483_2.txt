"Dolemite" is a moving story of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation movie titles), an ex-con who probably should still be in prison. He gets into trouble with cops, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes and society in general. He's just such a nice guy. Not even a movie, though it is still hilarious and worth a look. The fragile assumption is that the Dolemite (played with so much enthusiasm as Rudy Ray Moore's star can gather) is in jail for a crime he claims has not committed. When a drug strikes or a drug bust or a drug something is supposed to go down, the overseer releases him to stop it, or help it, or just watch it. It's not very clear. All I know is that I did not know that the court system freed the convicts to allow them to prove their own innocence. I think my ignorance. The storyline is intricate and unimportant, basically Dolemite bypasses killing people (usually with very badly choreographed karate), sex and curse of people, sometimes rhyming. The pleasures of the film are his complete incompetence and his utter indifference in the matter. I stopped counting how many times I saw myself seeing a mike boom after being on one scene for the entire duration (by two minutes of the movie). I stopped asking why the guard was looking down where Dolemite was sitting, even after he stood and walked around as they returned to the forthcoming shot and Dolemite sat inexplicably. I stopped wondering why Dolemite was dressed when he changed naked in the street because he didn't want to get into a car with ugly clothes (reads: normal) the prison had given him. And I stopped wondering where he had learned karate when he was playing a man's stomach and cutting it somehow. The only time I was nervous and tense remotely was when the disgusting, flaccid white mayor walks around naked naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck that barely covers him. You still say, "Cut off ... cut off ... cut off", but by the time they do, you're already emotionally scarred. The film is ridiculous in every possible way. Moore as Dolemite is either funny, cool, or both. If you're on the lookout for a bad movie, you found it with "Dolemite".
