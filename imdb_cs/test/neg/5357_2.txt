What can you say after watching this movie? That means if you were interested and focused on seeing it to the end. I stayed without a word because of an incredibly boring story, an unpleasant situation where one American is equal to fifty or more Iraqis and boring dialogue. I think that if this movie has something to learn, it probably looks like "Don't screw up with the US, or we'll come and kick your butts". In addition, this film really encourages and votes for killing masses of foreigners in the name of war. I got a picture of chess pieces coming out of the board. Except it's fast and not so much thinking. Moreover, no spirit has any spirit for it; Then how can you worry about what happens to any of them. Excluding tasteless war movie fans, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There should always be something more interesting.
