This film tried something but failed. All tensions were cheap and there were so many tired tricks and conspiracies. At least I was having fun. Ghosts are trying to warn the family, so why are they attacking a girl whose name I didn't care to remember. And what was black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they fell far. Where does the hell come from (John Corbett's character)? They just roll out of them where there is a huge field. And why did he suddenly lose it when the ravens came? And if the ravens were an expression of their family's spirits, then why did they attack him if they tried to kill him? It does not make any sense. So many things in this movie don't make sense and acting is not very nice on the main girl's side. It's not terrible, just like her movie days. So this movie wasn't great, but I had a good time, and sometimes it's all that has to be horror. Rental for fun is not good.
