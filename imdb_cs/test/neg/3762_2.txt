I bought "Rocketship X-M" on DVD in a two-pack with "Destination Moon." Now I see why the distributors did it: nobody who saw this movie would buy it themselves. I can't understand what school system has proven to be a reviewer who claimed that RXM is "a great prediction of how space travel would take place ..." Start straight up, then do 90 degrees to the right and faster and faster until you reach the escape speed ... I don't think Apollo remember that program, no matter the astronauts should be weightless, once they shut down the engines, gravity will change direction each time it goes into the engine room hatch Going to the Moon, but "missed"? No problem, it's just hop-skip-and-a-jump and you'll be on Mars! And OK if you want to live on Mars, given the state planetary knowledge in 1950, it was a forgiven convention for telling stories, but can you force them to look at least like a little stranger? These Martians looked like extras from the cast of "10,000 BC." e wouldn't be able to collect it with an above-average secondary. <br /> <br /> And it's out of blatant holes: 12 minutes before running (as you recalled the ever stupid PA voice says "minus as many minutes") astronauts give a press conference ! I think the time constraint is why Dr. Eckstrom has not changed from coat and tie to space. And how clever, though they were going to go to the moon and were wearing suits, they brought tourist gear (and rifles!) Just in case they ended up on Mars. They were lucky to have landed anywhere because the method they had developed for landing was to have Dr.E look out the window and tell "Lloyd Bridges" to throttle every now and then. Note for designers XM-2: how to give a pilot a window? Ditto previous comments on informal sexism that had eye-candy Dr. Lisa (Osa Massen) is a doom is all by repeatedly screwing her fuel calculations, but hey it was in the early 50s. She was there to fill the sweater, not a useful function. "Rocketship XM" is remarkable for being one of the first movies to say "ohmigod, we all blew up with these A-bombs here," but it can be noticed that without wasting 77 minutes watching such dreck. Incidentally, this message could have had a somewhat greater impact if there were some money in the budget for the real ruins of the Martian city rather than the dim images. I appreciate the "good" bad science fiction, the unique way the "future" looked, and for inherent (if condescending) humor, if we look back at the audience's naivety 60 years ago, but this film had to be offensive even then. "Rocketship X-M" is not even suitable for MST3K-style lampooning. Sometimes it's just ... bad. Who wants to buy a DVD? I swear only once.
