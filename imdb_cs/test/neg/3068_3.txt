When I realized there was a guest image on the DVD cover, I realized it was a local movie. The word Detroit in the title supported my suspicion and I did some things and yes, the local movie was. So I picked it up. Someone I knew actually knew some producers / directors (don't forget which one) and said producers / directors have people to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant! Great idea. The filmmakers, thanks to their cast and crew, will make some capital to make the film. Then investors (cast, crew, others) gain some profits, I think. <br /> <br /> Profits! <br /> <br /> Um as well. This film totally paralyzed me. The special effects were strange as with the special kids riding small buses to school. The meeting was very amusing, not deliberate. There is a great line where one says "well? This bone is not smoke alone!" as a collection line. Unfortunately, this is the only fun part of the whole movie. Story? Well, I followed it in about 3/5 of the way in, then everything stopped making sense and when we sat there watching it, it suddenly ended. I mean, as in, .. no solution to anything .. like they ran out of time. "Sorry people, from time to time, good night!" We sat there confused and booed and threw another movie. Then about 20 minutes later my neighbor showed up ... with one of the movie guys! We threw it back and he (the actor) gave us a running commentary that was amazing because he totally ripped the movie! <br /> <br /> What more can you ask for ?? The most absurd scene for me was a motorcycle scene that was so dark that it could literally be a man running around with a flashlight and not a bike at all. That and the jaw falling suddenly on the face is enough to make you howl. In pain! Zombies looked less than zombies than my co-workers. And I don't even work in the morgue. That's why I recommend you see it if you could get someone from the movie to come and give you a regular comment on all the things that went behind the scenes and make sure that this person hates the movie because it's just adds to the fun. Otherwise, make it one pass. Rent something like Feeders if you want your jaw to fall badly in a fun movie ...
