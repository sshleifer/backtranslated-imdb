** Can contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Ok, you can close this movie with one word: wrong. Two words? Really bad. Why do I think so? Let me explain. Guttenberg leads a team of special players that is made up of four people assigned to re-perform a deadly virus after a weapon dealer stole it from the lab. They do this by attacking a weapon dealer in mid-flight and returning in some way. However, Guttenberg is suspected because one of the terrorists knows his name. After the survey, team members are attacked by strangers and they all start to think that they are all others. After deciding not to trust their boss, they decide to steal the virus again and try to lure out any attackers. Theoretically, this is a conspiracy that could have worked in a low budget budget. a movie that wants to be televised. However, the plot is compromised and the movie destroyed in several accounts. First, the storyline is completely predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie ends after three minutes. Second. Acting is really bad, or actors tend to act like dummies. There is not much emotion, a change in facial expressions, etc. In Guttenberg, I was particularly disappointed that I believe it can do a lot more, but it will not succeed in trying to be a rough action hero. Besides, even though I'm by no means an expert on this subject, I absolutely believe that I could put together a better team of secret operators by taking five strangers and training them for a week. It seems to be a topic in the film making things as stupid and unprofessional as possible. This is also true for good people, bad guys and passers-by. Then I sincerely doubt the film's scientific and technical advisors. For example, I poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and didn't break immediately. You don't know how to really do it, but let's say this movie has a predictable plot, bad behavior and seem to be amateurs in what they do. Sorry, it can't be nicer. Don't play this movie, it's not so bad that it's funny. 2/10
