A terrible action film, led by Franco Nero, replaces his cowboy hat, weapon belt, and coffin, which he dragged behind the white Ninja gear in DJANGO (1966) with all the tools that belong to her! Despite practically continuous action, the film is absolutely clich√© and unintentionally funny - with a campy villain, on a boot, in Christopher George. Susan George (no relationship) is an attractive woman with a washed out husband, Nero a warrior whom the villains try to pull from their oil-rich land - but the other doesn't count on Nero martial arts (and stunts) gymnastics. The solution to their problems is to hire a similarly qualified Ninja for themselves, which, as it happens, turns out to be Nero's deadly enemy (played by Sho Kosugi who appeared in two other sequels and is currently involved in another!). The summit takes place in an arena where Nero 's army army' eliminates' George and what remained of his gang from previous confrontations; However, the subtle way in which it sends its nemesis is effectively implemented.
