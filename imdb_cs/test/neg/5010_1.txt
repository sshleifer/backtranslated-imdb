I tried to watch it and I was very disappointed. Don't expect intelligent and insightful humor of Aly's brother David in the middle of this break ... it's the polar opposite. But if you're shit, fart and boner jokes, you'll be in heaven. I suppose this is the bathroom humor of those who have had several bongs that just explain why many ecstatic reviewers have reported this crap as "the best television writing ever". I suppose those who hate such hate humors have not been able to look long enough to make sure they submit a review, but I'm just sending a warning to those who don't know viewers looking for top-notch comedy. Exaggerated characters. The shock factor is set to 10. And laughter is set to zero (unless of course you are looking for a youthful, low-level humor.) <br /> <br /> I did it over 40 minutes, I prayed all the time that would turn the corner to valuable fun , but unfortunately, it's just worse and worse. And beware of the ubiquitous Amy's distinctive expression - your eyes will roll. It was nice to see portraits of recognizable comedy actors I enjoyed, but I can only assume they agreed to participate as a kindness to the Sedaris family. I'm sorry for those who loved it. . This is my opinion. It was so bad that it inspired me to write the first review.
