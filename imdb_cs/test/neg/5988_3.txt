SHRIEKER is full moon production. I knew what to expect (very little quality), but I didn't expect it to be as painful as SHRIEKER was supposed to watch. It's just awful. Bad playing, confusing script and direction. Annoying characters I wanted to kill. The whole thing was probably done in one week. I saw CHARMED episodes that were more complicated and more convincing than this cheap one. <br /> <br /> He has the look and feel of a solitary episode of a poorly-conceived TV series that has never been seen. It was a spell to watch, and I could feel my mind darkening by a minute. Watching a movie shouldn't be so hard.
