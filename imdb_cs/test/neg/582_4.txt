Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays a small self-employed "garbage collector" (and inventor of the time controlling machine!), Who secretly courts the city's big-shot niece. After spitting, Lou's girl (Dorothy Provine) runs into a misty cave - why it's vague that we'll never know - and appear as a giant 30 feet. Provine is certainly a good sport and she doesn't bother trying to look ridiculous (it would be impossible anyway), but the screenwriter is really cruel to this character, not only because it is a giant but also annoying harpy. good. Provine bosses Costello around while creating a trigger with army soldiers who call, but nothing fun happens with transformation. Trumped "Attack of 50 Ft. Woman" in the previous year, the film features Lou Costello in his last bow, but provides little. Special effects are marginal, while the script needed more fun lines and direction snappier stimulation. * 1/2 from ****
