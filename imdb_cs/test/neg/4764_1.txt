This film is about a group of people who are infected with a strong artificial virus. They are watched by government men into the desert. The film's assumption is quite interesting, but limited by the fact that the delivery is extremely boring. In no way does the film deal with the viewer at any level. It is true that a tiny budget is a problem, but it is not the reason for a film failure. Much more blame is the very over-the-face delivery. There's a lot of narration, but unfortunately the narrator has an unpleasantly dramatic voice. It seems that these people have become very little and you will be rooted in for government men before the end - the sooner they kill the protagonists, the sooner the film ends. A much better title for this movie would be Four People Running About The Desert With Some Stock Footage From The Helicopter. Overall very tiring.
