I just wanted to leave a quick note because it's not listening here, but I just saw this movie, the version I just rented was released in 2005, as far as I know, and it was actually called "Don't Go to the Attic" I just realized That is the same movie as Devils Harvest in search of some actors who knew the movie. "By the way, I'm in Ireland, so maybe it was just released here and in the UK now, but that's what his call here. ......... he is not really happy that it matters because I would not recommend this movie. The only words that look at the mind are the CHEESE CHEESE CHEESES !! battle: o)
