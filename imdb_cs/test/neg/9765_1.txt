This is total disappointment. Forget this abysmal movie and take a TV series instead. What did they do on earth when they made the American president quite reasonable? All politicians were supposed to be dull buffons (Peter Cook is good as British Prime Minister). It lacks the biting of the original satire, going instead for the "lowest common denominator" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if I'm generous! Unfortunately, this is yet another example of a remake that completely lacks the point of the original, the difference is that both were written by the same people.
