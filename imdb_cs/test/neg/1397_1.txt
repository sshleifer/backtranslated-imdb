I thought "puppets that make call calls" is pretty low, but I don't believe Carl Mencia's show is even comedy. Its main goal is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable when using the word "beaner" as many times as possible. I have never felt compelled to write a review claiming something terrible about IMDb, but I really hope that this show will never be restored or re-launched. Mencia's trying to be another Dave Chapelle, and maybe hired only by the net, because they hoped to fill these shoes. Obviously, it's up to Chapl's intro (blues guys vs. mariachi band). However, Mencia has an absolutely * no * attitude, and does not delve into popular views of Hispanic culture enough to come up with creative poke on it every time. Instead, he keeps a small number of shocking nicknames for his Latin colleagues and makes "jokes" about immigration. Once in a while he uses the tiny darkness of the skin to make fun of someone else, such as the Middle East. These jokes consist mainly of repetition of every joke or stereotype created against culture and possibly some incredibly old themes (eg 9/11), in a diluted, stand-up style, while he laughs to himself to cover the audience style. I think he's too afraid to really offend anyone, so it just makes the viewer uncomfortable. He also beats jokes to death. If you've ever seen "Why is f *** this message?" you'll know what I'm talking about. At first it is funny, but he just walks on and on and becomes apparent to the captain. It's a train that is purely painful.
