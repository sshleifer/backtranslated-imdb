If you want a terrible interpretation of "MacBeth," then this is your answer. Filled with the archaic English language Shakespearic in the Australian environment of the 21st century, this film is disappointed and leaves you head scratching. But that is not all. Not only is there a sophomoric action sequence, but there are plenty of scenes where the female body is displayed. The witches who played actresses more like schoolgirls than witches put on a display of soft pornography with MacBeth on a remarkable affection. Welcome to stupidity and corruption - all at once. It's a miracle why this project was green lighted. So much for modern cheesy films. "D-"
