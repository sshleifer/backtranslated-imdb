This is the most accurate and shameful biblical movie I've ever had when I looked at the disaster. I'd like to know why anyone could see it. I'm so surprised that a big name like Jon Voight agrees to act in this shameful piece of garbage. Many people who may not have read the Bible will now be introduced by believing that this film is accurate and that it really bothered me. I think the creators have something to answer. The worst thing is, I think that no one could make such obvious mistakes with the biblical film because they can examine the Bible for the truth, so I believe that the creators deliberately twisted what the Bible says and that is something nobody has the right to find that it is very offensive. There are no words strong enough to describe exactly how I feel about it.
