The idea of ​​bringing Dracula to the present times is not bad - after all, it could revive the series a little by injecting it into a series that Hammer has all but exhausted in a long series of generally excellent movies. Since this day proved to be a miserable early seventies, the results were very stupid and looked more like FIRST BITE LOVE (deliberate comedy). To see Christopher Lee in a movie filled with seventy-five hips and electric guitar chords and ridiculous rock music seemed silly. To make matters worse, the performances are much higher here - with the intense and stupid performance of "Johnny Alucard". I also thought it was really funny that Van Helsing's grandson noticed that "Alucard" was "Dracula" written backwards - no one else came alone! Wow, what cunning! So because so much of the movie was wrong, why did you still earn almost a decent score of 4? Well, when the story came to an expected showdown between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Draco (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. In addition, and I know it will sound very sexist, but if I had to watch a bad movie, at least Stephanie Beacham's character was wearing some really nice clothes that revealed enough ... "talents" to say so. So at least it was a nice movie to watch. By the way, the film ends with the phrase "can rest in FINAL peace" at the end, although it wasn't the last Hammer Dracula movie with Lee. He returned for "Satanic Rites of Dracula" just a short time later and it was in many ways even worse than this bagpipe monster movie.
