It happened to me that I captured this movie on late night television. I saw the introductory credits and I thought it looked good. I was very bad. Although it was not bad bad (had some funny and tender moments), it lacked any sense of coherence. It started pretty well with Kathy Bates'character, who was suffering from a middle-age crisis when her husband left her and her singing idol was murdered. But Kathy played these dissatisfied women so well - I mean Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem wasn't Kathy, it was a clueless scenario that went everywhere. It was as if the writers had to think about what to do next. The script also felt very inventive. Some others who commented on this movie wondered why they didn't get a movie release. The main reason I think it would be to avoid embarrassment and critics would be murdered. I said that a small woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she was.
