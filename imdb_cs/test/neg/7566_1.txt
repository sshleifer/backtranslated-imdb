There have been many films about the life of an American dream. And that's one of them. First of all, there's a lot of bad stuff on the technical side. The sound is bad, I had problems understanding the dialogs here and there, and the camera positions could be better. To show how Jonathan is losing his dream, with girls, drugs and alcohol, is doing very badly. Acting is very bad as well as from all the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time seeing it from start to finish, and I couldn't wait to see the movie end. /> <br /> If your expectations are low and bored with bad weather on Sunday, watch it. If you're in a deep story with action then it's not your movie. Normally, I shouldn't give a score of 1 but 4.5 for this movie. But the reason I gave it 1 is due to poor sound and camera usage, not to mention the bad scenes with cheesy effects.
