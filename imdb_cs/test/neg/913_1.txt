people get a clue! I think writers don't have one, so I'd expect that ... this show is such a pale imitation of '60 to show that you can laugh at it! and the Sixties Show is the one that has cheap special effects and is in B&W fer Chrissakes! And the mood and writing of the old exhibition is MILES before this drive. Get HiP Kids! if 98 degrees or Brittany told you to watch it, you would! You know it! Just walk around and tell all your friends that you're 'IN' with a 'scene' BEFORE they became too cool!
