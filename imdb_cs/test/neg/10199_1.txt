One of the worst movies I've ever seen! After what I noticed, what happened? To this day, I'm confused, can someone explain the movie, please? Both acting and image quality are so bad you will think that you are watching someone's school project with a home video camera. First, I can't believe that as some people could give 10 stars to this movie. Because it's an incredibly bad movie! This movie is not at all scary! There is no Typical Horror clich√©. Storyline and Acting This movie was terrible. It's not fantastic, surrealistic, or horror, it's just a horribly bad Turkish feature film. And finally there were a lot of useless scenes and useless characters. When I look at 'Gomeda', I fell so hopeless, so sad for a young Turkish filmmaker. Please don't do 'cinema' like this!
