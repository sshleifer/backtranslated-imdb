What can I say about PLANET ABOUT PLEASURE I haven't said about other lengthy soft core movies? Very little . It's just another movie with a very weak plot that was used to set up very unconvincing scenes among male non-actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbo, who obviously had silicone implants. Actually, the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of movie, as cast members cut their hips together, giving them painful expressions as if they were constipated or something. No wonder a lot of people say sex is overestimated
