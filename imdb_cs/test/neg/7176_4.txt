I admit it is not a great movie. It's practically screaming "low budget", but strangely enough, I still felt like a movie because although it lacked the quality it abounded with energy. It was like a small engine that could and merge the movie into one! The film takes place in a radio network and affects some of their low-level employees - bilateral boys (one very ambitious and free and the other girl), as well as a new receptionist. All three have visions of radar fame, but they must now settle for their humble work. This story appears to be a murder that seems somewhat blue. I didn't know it was a mysterious murder movie and I was a little surprised. However, like most B-secrets, cops are lamebrains and it is on our proud hero (Moran) to try to save the day. During all this, I had a hard time deciding whether Moran was uncomfortable or loving. I'm still not sure! There is a moment in the film that is high on the cringe factor, and that is when both sides try to play the role of radio comics. They appear in black and imitate the 3rd or 4th Amos n 'Andy imitation speed. Besides being very insensitive, it wasn't funny either. Fortunately, it seemed that the producer of the show they were trying to feel was the same. <br /> <br /> Overall. It's easy to skip this movie and I wouldn't blame you if you do. However, the strange and frenetic pace of the film seemed to complement the film's artistic flaws and I am glad to see it. A good movie? No, but one who is still worth seeing for fans of old Bs. By the way, maybe I don't have a very good taste, but I thought BOTH's female singer really had bad voices despite the fact that everyone in the film is captivated by their warriors. Listen for yourself and let me know what you think. I just couldn't believe it was allowed to sing on the film - though it was just for the humble Monogram Studios.
