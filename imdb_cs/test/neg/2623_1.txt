Thank God I didn't run any heavy machines, it could have been the worst catastrophe. The shots were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, same shots, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. The story was a bit empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did you get that stupid accent? Random shots of the scenery just to include them did not add much. There was more in the car than anything else. The direction really didn't take us into any of the scenes, and he didn't feel me for any of the characters. If the IMDb had an option, I'd rate it as zero. Great sedative if you can't sleep. There he went for 2 hours of my life I'll never come back.
