Four young elementary girls are witnessing the murder of one of their classmates in what they thought was innocent. The killer is a strange young man named Milo Jeeder. Sixteen years later, the four people who survived this event reunited in happier circumstances in the same town where it happened. They believe that Milo drowned in the river shortly after the murder, but soon learned that the demonic murderer Milo had also returned, still a young boy, unchanged even after nearly two decades. <br /> <br /> The cover of this movie It looks really great (but I was still expecting a bad movie to come out). When I put the disc in the player, the menu will appear and the movie will still look great. Sadly, this film is not all I cared about. The film is your average film slasher attempt and when I say average, I mean it like any other small budget movie that has never been welcomed with open arms to most members of the horrible community (I'm talking about you, a horror fan). In other words, you can go up to all the horror fans and most of the answers would be "sucks". <br /> <br /> What mistakes did the movie make? In the first place, DVD art wrapping makes Milo look really dark, but they do it out by showing his face in the movie in many different scenes. He had the potential to be a very strange character. Secondly, the back of the envelope says Freddy, Jason, Chucky, etc., to pack their bags and go out because Milo is much better ... why would you want to say that in hell when it comes to them - name, low budget slasher movie who apparently failed? I think it just increases your movie expectations, so it's harder to impress you. In the last ditch effort to attract attention, he says (in very large letters) "From the creator of Anaconda." It just shows you how low it will be for the movie. Gore gets angry in the movie, the director gives you some nasty angles when someone comes to mind. Music is not so bad and I have never fallen asleep during the film (congratulations). I'm still trying to figure out what Milo is. It would be best if he were a zombie, if someone else knows, tell me. I assure you that I will not lose any sleep and think about it.
