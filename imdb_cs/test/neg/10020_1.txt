Of course, most 1980s slasher movies are not worth the celluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may also be the toughest. > <br /> Six promising smoking students decided to go camping. Of course, <br /> <br /> and you know it, they start killing one by one with a mysterious stranger. The top has a hunky forest guard trying to get into a teen in time before the last cute girl becomes a buzzard <br /> bait. John Carl Buechler, my favorite B-movie guy, has made this miserable <br /> <br /> make-up effect. The cast features Carel Struycken, "The <br /> <br /> Eastwick Witch" and Addams family movies. Sadly, <br /> <br /> does not jump to the very end of the movie and is contained in <br /> <br /> burning makeup, which makes it unrecognizable. Steve Bond (Anyone <br /> Remembers It?) He's in the early role of the victim. Brown's direction and cowrote scenario, both smell like Brno. > <br /> presents brown bears in the forest. The film casts on <br /> <br /> so much that I accidentally rented a special episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Much of the <br /> <br /> cast sits around the fire and eats, then walk, and sit back and eat <br /> <br /> again. The Forest Guardian takes part in the strangest scene he has ever featured in the film: he tells a joke about a wide-mouthed frog and a baby deer. Jackie Coogan, who had to forget that he had once worked <br /> <br /> with silent cinema legends, has two scenes and is involved <br /> <br /> in the second strangest scene he ever put in the film: he Hunky Forest Guardians have a cucumber talk and <br /> <br /> Creamy Oat Bread sandwich ... yeah. There's no one minute of tension there. A killer, a forest fire <br /> <br /> who has survived and is looking for a partner, tracks students from behind <br /> <br /> trees. We know he's a killer because filmmakers have a dubbed sound effect that is used to wake the audience every few minutes. Skip this pile of pine sap and rent <br /> <br /> "Halloween," instead. It is rated (R) for physical violence, mild rifle violence, gore, <br /> <br /> some profanity, brief female nudity, mild sexual content, sexual <br /> <br references and drug abuse.
