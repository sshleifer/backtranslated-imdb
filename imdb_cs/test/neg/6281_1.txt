I felt like I was looking at an example of how to make a film. I think the director shot it in his backyard! There was no real plot. <br /> <br /> Terrible scenario. <br /> <br /> Terrible gaming. <br /> <br /> The worst production I've ever seen. A few bad CG effects and then spent the rest of the movies strolling in what looked like a junk garden. I don't normally write reviews for movies, but I've been moved to warn everyone about it. Life is short to lose time with this movie!
