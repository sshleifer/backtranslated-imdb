And again, Columbia Pictures decides to make a "hash" using Curly's original version and without any gags or jokes to launch! Towards the end of this pitiful swing, when Joe gets stuck on a bull, the studio didn't make much effort to sound again, if you listen carefully, you can still be curly "Woo woo woo woo woo". Also, when Moe and Larry throw darts to "slow down the bull so that he can get out", it is lifted straight from the original because you can actually see Moe and Larry "magically" look 15 years younger. Why did Moe allow it all to happen? It is a burning question that can never be answered because, to my knowledge, in real life he was quite sensitive to any criticism and had rather high standards for his work, as did Larry, Curly and Shemp. Don't waste your time on this.
