You know I only watched 15 minutes of this movie, so I can't really describe how great it is. I think the concept itself is so original and interesting that it didn't let me go. Then there will be the meat of the award-winning academics and the director of the academy. YOU CAN LOSE. I imagine he's in the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet. This movie is coming. You're watching it and you're in shock. It's so brilliant, so the original is so great. It'll feel half an hour later you turned off the screen, but when you go to bed, you'll see it's only 15 minutes after midnight. Enjoy !!! <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
