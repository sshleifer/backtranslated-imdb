Frederick Forsyth's books are always so complicated, with twists and turns and usually a big surprise ending. This adaptation had none of it. So much of what was great in the book (the history of Monk and the betrayed agents, the conspiracy affecting the outcome of the Russian elections) was completely missing from this error. adaptation. Instead, there is a whole new plot on biological weapons that was yawning. Forsyth's protagonists have always operated in the shade, forever only slightly beyond the reach of antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of performing their mission. This film resigned from the shootings and the pursuit of cars at the beginning. Swayze's monk could also hang around his neck the inscription "I AM THE SECRET REPRESENTATIVE" for all the attention he himself made during the film. And with all this attention, the amount of time it took the bad boys to catch up with him was surprising. I have granted that there was some energy on this film, which is why I give it "3" instead of "1". It was also great to see some unused professionals like Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. I hope one day someone will do justice to the film adaptation of Forsyth as "Jackal Day".
