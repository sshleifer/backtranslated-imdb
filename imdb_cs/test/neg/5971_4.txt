After watching Darwin's nightmare, one must have the impression that Tanzania is a living hell, while its population is quasi-slaves who supply the finest fish to well fed Europeans, while fish bones leave the starving population. In exchange for the fish, they acquire weapons produced in the West, which are mainly eagerly awaited by the unemployed population, because their soldier is their only source of income. So everything is dark with business. the incarnation of evil and the source of all misery? Not quite. Fortunately, Darwin's Nightmare shows only dark sides and completely excludes positive aspects. In fact, the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecological importance that victoriaperch has for this area. <br /> <br /> For the countries around Lake Victoria, the Victorian house is the second to third most important source of income. Wages in the fisheries sector are above average. Tanzania has banned huge trawlers from securing the work of thousands of fishermen. Neighboring states have reached sustainable conservation agreements. Lakeside towns benefit from the taxes that fishermen have to pay for every kilogram of fish caught and taxes on exports and factory profits. In addition, Tanzania has banned the export of local traditional fish, which still play an important role in supplying the local population. By ignoring these positive signs, the documentary film discourages poorly needed Western consumers and investors, and thus threatens to exacerbate Africa's situation. <br /> <br /> For further reading, I can recommend two articles written by the German alternative wing on this topic: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013. 1 / textdruck http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text
