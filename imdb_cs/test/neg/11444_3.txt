This movie has it all: it's a thriller, a chase movie, a romance story, a story crowd, a comedy, a road movie ... well, in fact it's none of that at all. <br /> <br /> While you're waiting for something interesting but not, you're still watching the same boring, uninspiring and superficial movie clich√©s with a very bad soundtrack. Even the star acting role lacks credibility. A jerk with his jokes, a girl who is hard to find, crowds of guys who play hard and incompetent cops yawn ... <br /> <br /> I recommend not to watch Backtrack. If you want to see a good movie by a famous actor director, check out "Three Melquiades Estrady Funerals" by Tommy Lee Jones. Now I say it's worth watching.
