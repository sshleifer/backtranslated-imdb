Besides the fact that this movie was made (I think it seemed a good idea at the time of considering BOTTOM was so popular) one thing that confused me about PARADISO PENSION was what happened to lighting? There is no artificial lighting in this film at all, and I watched it on the TV screen, so it wasn't a case of attentive tape. In fact, the film was filmed so darkly that it was impossible to see what the hell was going on. But if dialogue were something that could be, maybe it wasn't a bad thing
