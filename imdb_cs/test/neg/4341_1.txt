This is a pale imitation of the Die Hard series that just sucks. The film's low ambitions are clearly seen when the terrorists hold the vice president hostage and have to call the White House to ask them to transfer some money. In most films of this genre, the president is kidnapped or held hostage because he (or she) is the strongest person in the country with a finger on a nuclear button, etc. kidnapped? The honest answer is probably not. Why would the terrorists choose the Stanley Cup final to carry out their operation and why, despite the many explosions around them, viewers inside the ice hockey stadium do not know the situation, they are unanswerable. Let's say this movie is really hockey, not hockey. Those who liked the film and found it exciting should get their life.
