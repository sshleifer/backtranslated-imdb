I like Ali G show, I believe this guy has a comedic instinct, but (yet) hasn't developed it to talent. The film is a little worse than I expected. I didn't find the Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Jokes for 5-year, some good, some terrible. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that seems to be "offensive" but it's actually funny, see Tom Green's 'Freddy Got Fingered'. /> <br /> 2/10
