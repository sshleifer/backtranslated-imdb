The promotion of this film suggests it is shocking and sensational. Well, we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses, so we're not shocked by the Duke of Mantua urinating during his retreat of La Donny Mobile, nor is it sensational to see the Guild sing Caro Nome in the bathtub. It's just a crack and boredom. On this film is his lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk builds the ducal palace in the swimming pool. In fact, he's not a duke, he's just a character named Duka, so it's hard to see why he's got a lot of hangers and his own jester, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in an apartment that is equipped with an orange sofa and decorated in a mottled wallpaper that is de rigeur among avant-garde directors. <br /> <br /> Concepts of an opera like this can cause unexpected and unintentional humor. What we can do is that the Guild has a maid, even if she lives in an apartment. When there is a call that Monterone is taken to prison, we see that two escorts in pink shorts are marching from the pool. One imagines being accused of urinating in a public swimming pool. It was commonplace that opera films were synchronized with their lips 20 years ago, but today it's no excuse. Dubbed opera is like soft porn. You do not believe in what is happening because artists do not make enough effort. Guild actress does not seem to have learned her properly. He barely moves his lips to sing. When Caro Nome sings in the bath, he lies down with his legs slightly laid out. It's hard to tell which hole is to emit sound. Duke, later it concludes by singing while engaging in licking with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon. The sound atmosphere never looks right with an orchestra sometimes sounding like it's being played through a transistor radio. Relatively slow, preferred darkness of rump, so the overall effect is karaoke in your local pub. It is a film about the production of Spanga. Spanga is a little village in Friesland in the Netherlands. They usually stand in a tent in a field. If I watched this performance in a tent in a field in Friesland, I'd be quite forgiving. By filming this production and its worldwide audience, villagers will also be left open to global ridicule.
