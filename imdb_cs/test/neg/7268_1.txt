What the hell!? That was my first reaction to this movie (actually my first reaction contained a greater oath). This is not Star Wars! Star Wars are space battles; Star Wars are Power, this film only has a retarded witch with a magical ring. Star Wars is a lightsaber battle, this movie has no battle worth mentioning. Star Wars are humor, this film is not. Star Wars are galaxies far, far away, this movie has horses in it! Besides all that, Lucas got the crazy idea of ​​letting a five-year-old child play a leading role !? Big, big disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Don't look at it! 1 out of 10
