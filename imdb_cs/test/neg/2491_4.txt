This movie is definitive 5. I finally caught it on HBO. I remember when it came out in the theaters to tell a friend that it would never be a hit, because the Americans didn't want movies about history, especially movies that would be more about ideas than events. I don't know if that was the reason FMLB didn't do well, but now that I've finally seen it, I can add a few of my own notes. First, while Dwight Schultz was a fine at Star Trek and The-Team, as the leader in this movie, he is off-putting. I expected Jon Lovitz to shout, "I'm ACT-ING!" He phrased and the tone of the voice sounded like he was trying to be really an ACT-OR, at a stage where he had to strangely emphasize various words and phrases. Secondly, I enjoyed the quiet position of Paul Newman as a manipulator who tries to drive these cats (scientists) and reach their destination at every turn. Third, there has been some discussion about the moral consequences of creating a bomb A and whether the US should use it. Probably not enough, or as deep as it is justified. Finally, there seemed to be a lot of twists in the dramatic effect. I don't know how many events in this movie are true to life, but things like having a test bomb in chains or a laboratory accident caused by a spilled cup of coffee (and a scientist killed as a result) were stretching the limits of trust. Maybe it happened, or events that were similar, really happened, but they certainly felt like different scenes were added only for the dramatic effect that undermined the whole tone and purpose of the movie. <br /> <br /> FMLB was OK. I need to know more about current events to see if it was upstairs or mostly.
