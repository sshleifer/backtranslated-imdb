For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation may be fine. But just for them. This is a discontinuous version of "Cliff Notes" Mansfield Park, and if you haven't seen another version or read books, parts of it would be scratching your head. Why was it so hard to make good adjustments to this book? He took such freedoms in the 1990s that he barely seemed to be the same book - thinking was totally modern and seductive. Here we have Billie Piper, who looks like a beautiful globe. She has a charming personality that evolves nicely - but she has flagrently died blonde hair, with black eyebrows and - over much of the pic - dark brown roots. So much for a virgin cousin. It's incredibly distracting, and the rest of the cast is in greasy hair, a crumpled garment genre that shows a real disrespect for the accuracy of the period. One thing is good here - Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford of all versions. She is perfect, flirtatious without being modern or suggestive, miserable and completely free of any moral or ethical compass. In fact, Henry is good enough to be a slight temptation for our heroine. Jemma Redgrave chooses one of the most interesting roles in the story. reasonable. That's just the production that really lacked the mark, really low for Austen fans. The only usable version is the one that has a special duck (ideal for role) Sylvestra La Touzel (despite the very gay Henry Crawford - he's just ridiculous).
