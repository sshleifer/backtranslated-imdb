6 out of 8 comments on this topic rated this movie as valuable, so let me balance the balance. If it's the best British independent filmmakers can offer, then they have to pack and find a job in another industry. Unfortunately, it was 82 minutes for me, I'll never see you again and hopefully some of you will save 82 minutes. Although the idea of ​​the film is interesting, it is not sufficiently developed to keep the viewer strapped. Student characters are bland and uninteresting, and frankly, you don't care what happens to them. The soldiers are practically cartoons of every baddie he has ever seen in a movie, waiting for Captain Markovic to twist an imaginary mustache. Some of these effects were pretty good and showed some imagination, but they were destroyed by shocking bad acting, bad scenarios, and unclear cameras. The budget can be better spent sending "actors" (and I use that term freely) to the game classes or the Thomas Brothers to the film school or maybe to spell checking because the headlines were misspelled. The fact that mis-spellings have not been picked up and corrected speaks of the immaturity of the entire production. I can only assume that the positive comments are made by the filmmakers, whether or not they are. watching a completely different film. I urge Thomas' brothers to never give up their daily jobs, if they continue to do so, they will certainly starve to death.
