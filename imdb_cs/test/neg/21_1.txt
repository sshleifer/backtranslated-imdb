Bloody Birthday is a totally trash movie from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I found that acting is quite good with regard to the genre of the film and its obvious low budget. I don't know what's going on with cinematography, but it looked terrible. Too exaggerated. Maybe it's a bad DVD conversion or maybe it always looked, I don't know. There are really no redeeming features to talk about. There are few deaths but not really bloody. If I were you, I wouldn't bother with it. The best DVD was a 15-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg, who was very entertaining and honest. He had nothing good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits that the film was unsuccessful, but would like to recreate it because he believes he has a decent plot. However, he died in 2004, so I think it will be up to someone else to take on this challenge. As things have been done in recent years, I would not be surprised that there is at least one re-make in the cinema today. It couldn't be any worse than the original, I suppose, but I couldn't worry about whether it was again or not.
