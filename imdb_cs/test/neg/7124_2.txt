The original GRUDGE (original American remake) surprisingly gave way to everything you could do with the ghost. She had a tension, a dark and moody atmosphere, a few good shakes and some truly scary images. GRUDGE 2 is trying all these techniques, but eventually fails, just showing us the same old things we saw in the first movie, as well as the chaotic story constantly changing from Tokyo to California. It starts in Tokyo with some of the schoolgirls traveling to the house, now heavily blocked by one strip of police tape. One of them finds himself face to face with a similar ghost girl with wide eyes while trapped in a closet. She gets out, screaming furiously, and all of them are running away. Then we moved to America, where their mother sends them to Karen's sister to find her and bring her back home. Finally, we find ourselves after a well-known concept of a curious guy and a girl exploring the history of a mysterious house. From the beginning we looked at the girls who disappear one by one, as did the young boy who hears strange noises in another apartment at night, leading to a very unsatisfactory end. "Scared" scenes are boring and ineffective. Just like The Ring 2, avoid this terrible sequel to God ...
