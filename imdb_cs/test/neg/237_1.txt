Robot vs. Aztec's mother was one of the strongest and least believable movies I've ever seen. O.K, I can buy that woman in the film is a reincarnation of a virgin who has been sacrificed to the Aztec God. What I can't buy is that an incredibly fake-looking mummy and an even worse robot. If you want to watch such a movie, you want to see a lot of combat action. But the robot and mom are fighting for a minute in total! Perhaps the worst of all was the art of dia de los muertos that they had in credits. That's the worst I've ever seen. If possible, avoid this.
