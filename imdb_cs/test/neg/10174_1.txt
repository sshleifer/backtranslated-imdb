Okay, this movie was the worst show I've seen in years. The actors weren't bad (I thought it was a b-movie so they did b-film acting). Anyway I watched this movie, wondering OH COOL movie UFO Sci-Fi. POORLY. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to send people a message. The last scene was extremely confused. This is a terrible thing that must be done to believe in something. What someone believes is a matter of opinion. This film just shows how damaged religion is, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> This is not where you want to watch b-movie. If you want to watch a movie that tries to wash out the masses. So this is a litter selection. Go for it. If you are going to pass the message, do it, do not push it. Ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such an extent. Especially Christians.
