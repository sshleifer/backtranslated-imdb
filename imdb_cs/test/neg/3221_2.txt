My friend decided to rent this thing, he was lucky it wasn't my money. The story, which might be interesting, is totally wasted by incredibly bad acting and terrible editing / directing. Maybe it might become a classic because it is something special :) (for example, Gary Busey's character) All the characters that have been played were the only thing that caught the film a bit when the wrong reasons caught you. where the film itself failed. In short: the loss of time and money <br /> <br /> 2/10
