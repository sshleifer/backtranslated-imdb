That was a horrible, boring movie, even for a documentary. Sometimes it provided insight into life and also had funny moments, but overall it is not worth seeing. Every time I began to sympathize with Mark and started to hope he would be successful, I would be disappointed with his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse.
