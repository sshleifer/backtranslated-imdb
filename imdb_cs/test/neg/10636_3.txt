I saw it on TCM today and I was shocked by Jean Arthur's overreaction. Her bugging eyes in surprise and just generally over-do everything was not in the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was amazing in her restraint and comic timing. It's the best thing in this movie. Wilder's gags were flat and frankly something like something a freshman in college would try to "get away" from being evil, witty and dirty, but it sounded boring and not funny at all. Humor seemed too hard to be funny. The end was absolutely perfect. SPOILER AHEAD: I never thought for a moment that Art Lund was suddenly out of love with Dietrich and then suddenly fell madly in love with Arthur. Billy. Take it easy! 3 out of 10.
