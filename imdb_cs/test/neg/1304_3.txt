Digital effects have been made on cheap and action sequences have no tension. It was basically for television and shows. David Suchet looks boring and Nigel Planer looks down to embarrassment! and as for Dick Van Dyke, accent Robert Carlyle, no comment! If you want to leave for an hour or two, if it doesn't work, he'll do it. If you want to buy a DVD, wait a few weeks and pick it up at the Asda store because it's where it's headed! If the budget was bigger and Richard Doyle's book followed in more detail, it might be something special, but how its a little poor. Check out the trailer! Or read the book and see what could have been.
