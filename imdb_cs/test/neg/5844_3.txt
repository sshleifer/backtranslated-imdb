A good example of the differences between American and foreign cinematography is the movie I have recently watched on television. . I'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not doing well, but why should we care so much whether these two things stay behind me. Love, affection, playfulness, attraction? None of them have been realized on the screen in their interaction. Knowing that Robert Redford would eventually turn out, it was clear that the good part, the film's flesh, was between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson just couldn't pick up all the emotions for the movie. He seemed to hold back, impressed by his receding hairline. OK, so fast forward. What idiots these two (Diane and David) are for thinking they can get back $ 50,000 that they owe gambling. There is no acting faux pas, just a nasty bad, lazy, unforgivable writing. Of course, they will lose all their money. Surprised? I know I wasn't. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the movie)? a romantic, possibly emotionally frigid man, updated by Gatsby. Very good role and though not great, great actor, besides the two, Redford looks like Olivier. She immediately falls in love and longs for Diane and we, the viewers, to feel it once. Love this woman like that! Not David's way, rubber mouth mouth with Diane on the slimy pier. (I saw it right?) As a Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. Yes, it is instructing a seemingly dead viewer that he is a rich man, but he also looks damn good and at this point the brain of the dead audience appreciates! Another symbol of the wardrobe includes David's ironed shirts at the end of the film, which means determination, after a long overwhelmed wrinkled shirt on himself. in Hollywood Movies? Suddenly, they all appear British, complete with lace dresses, three-piece suits for men, hats (HATS!) And of course a parasol. Yes, Diane, her transformation into a rich man's fianc√©, is now finished, is there at an auction that turns slightly with a parasol. Though she insisted that she could not be bought, she eventually succumbed to sexual tension. Here, the film unfolds into pure America. Of course David and Diane will end together, my question is: WHY? Diane was bored with David, why not let her go on a wave of Robert Redford? And I think for a long time? How can he get away from the sexually romantic thrill of this sexy older man just because Woody Harrelson brings his receding hairline to a garden party, settles down and looks Demi Moore in the eyes. It's just not how it goes. He was so WEAK. But we must have our happy ending. We have to swallow the Moral Lesson. We are not sophisticated enough to have it differently. Director Lyn tried to make Fata Fatal an attractive line-up, youthful. In addition to garden parties where something like an SUV, t-shirt or baseball cap is in sight, a reliable public transport system that connects far-California cities and towns. How else to symbolize a return to middle class or working class life?
