This movie was horrible, simple and simple! Animated scenes had a terrible graphic. It was absolutely clear that this movie had my food bill on the budget! Behavior was just as bad. I saw better playing in pornographic movies. I'd really like an hour and twenty minutes of my life. In fact, I just signed up for IMDb so that other people wouldn't follow it like I did. Don't get me wrong, I like sci-fi movies! This one looked more like an introduction to the video game: (I'm glad I spent only $ 1 on this one!) The story reminded me of a black movie, a prisoner on the ship escapes. good ... what do we do ??? I wouldn't let this game in the background of my house when I was cleaning! Bottom line here, you can do better.
