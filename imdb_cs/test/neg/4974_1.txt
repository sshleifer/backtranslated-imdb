I started watching it because I was looking for a nice comedy for my Sunday morning. Then I noticed that it was a road movie, and I decided to really watch it. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes were terrible, but I wanted to give it a chance because I never rate the film without watching it closely. Then something started to improve. It looked like a nice road movie about friendship. But then the movie began to have horrible predictable clich√©s, and when the movie was over, you let yourself feel that you were wasting your time. Was there something to say? Why do they even make such a movie? And I did not expect a modern citizen Kane, but I still have some ideas on how this film could improve. So take my advice; Leave it alone and go check out the real road-movie. There are many. I don't want directors of these movies to look bad by putting their names on this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
