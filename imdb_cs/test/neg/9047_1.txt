Throat snoring. I saw this piece of horrible, stinky, worthless, junk in Cameo Movie House (now the famous Crobar Night-club) on Washington Avenue on South Beach in 1980 or 81. they laughed at it. terrible, rough, piece of waste. The theater was on its last legs, and snoring and sleeping drunks were mostly on the spot. They didn't miss the damn thing. These actors deserve an Oscar for the worst and I think the worst role in the film's history. The joke was, the theater showed another Mi Mi Lay (at least a great name!) Smelly ... barf city. He said enough. If you are under 12 years old, you can get a few chills. More than 12, you will snore after opening loans. It's just amazing that anyone has spent a cent on filming this movie. And to think, this is considered a "cult" classic. YUK !!!!
