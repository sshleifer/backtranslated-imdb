I loved the beautiful Greek scenery, but the story, which is not something you can watch anyway, was even harder to watch in the movie. I can't imagine anyone watching him if he didn't read the book, and then, like me, they might wonder why Australian Allison turned into a French Anne and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story story. The mysteries in the book seemed to be cut or omitted in the film. I saw it when it first came out and had the same problems because I read the book several times. I recently watched it with my granddaughter (very intelligent in 20 and usually in the movies I love) who were mostly amazed at how young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen were in it, but otherwise they couldn't imagine why it would be possible observe to the scene.
