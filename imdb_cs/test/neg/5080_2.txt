When I saw the names of the main actors (Statham, Snipes and Phillippe), I thought the movie should be at least decent or interesting. Instead, all I got was not just boring 92 minutes, but the frustration of knowing everything that was supposed to happen, and I heard a lot of fake and dilapidated false phrases. The main problem is that the film doesn't have a good story. And if you have it before anyone can help you, not Statham, not Wesley Snipes ... nor John McClane could save this movie :-) It could be great for kids if they're not older than 12 because they don't care about the story so much, and there are big explosions in the movie.
