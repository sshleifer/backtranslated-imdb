The director does not know what to do with the camera ... too many options and always chooses the wrong ... let the travolta take command ... and control the film from start to finish. characters are not developed ... maybe because we need to watch them sing ... no tempo ever, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow ... wrong: travolta OK ... johansson, she's too adult to be 18. .. even if it's really 20 ... <br /> <br /> happy ending? well it seems to be one, so the story is sad, but not too sad ... travolta doesn't know how to play guitar, but the director doesn't seem to care too much for being completely out of sync ... > <br /> The idea is the only thing that's great ... but how has it developed? well, it's just full of stereotypes and lines heard too many times ... too bad, another missed chance ...
