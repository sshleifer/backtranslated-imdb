Maybe it's better. I wouldn't know. I did it in the first twenty minutes before I cut him off and entered a period of mourning. It was evident that the plot itself was known. A man, Paul LeMatt, a professor of entymology in Columbia, is riding with his dog to a small town in Ohio in search of his former wife Diana Scarwid. There he meets people who either ignore him or are hostile. They can smile, but something is happening under it. Such a kind of arrangement is home lawn for filmmakers and viewers and is pregnant with options. You can make a neatly drawn commercial success like "Bad Day at Black Rock." Or he would, and probably DID make, a nice "Twilight Zone" episode. The cast also includes experienced artists as well as some formerly prominent names. Kenneth Toby, a science fiction veteran, is a superficially friendly motel manager. Diana Scarwid can perform impressively, as she said in "Silkwood." For some others, their scope is limited. But it's a badly directed and shabby font. <br /> <br /> Shabby direction example. The LeMatt dog hates Kenneth Toby, right from the bat. So when LeMatt comes out on the street, Toby sneaks up to his room window, growls at the dog and writes something down. Cut to LeMatt on the street. He hears his dog howling. Then POV shot probably a dog zipping towards LeMatt then around him while the wind blows and LeMatt gawks at the camera. Cut to the same shot - coming from the other direction! No matter what the camera represents, what LeMatt is looking at will never appear. Maybe it was nothing, because suddenly the wind stops and LeMatt is alone on the street and looks a little confused. "You should never bring the dog to the top," notes Toby, smiling from the porch. What is the scene about? <br /> <br /> An example of shabby writing. Two examples. (1) If you sit down and write a stereotypical waitress in a small town, without any craft work, you would come up with a blank girl with hair on her head, gum, walking between the tables. Right. (2) Everything similar to plausibility is thrown out of the window in favor of special effects. LeMatt's car chugs stop, then explodes while waiting to be fixed in the garage. Stopping: believable. Explosion: supernatural. Even Edgar Allan Poe did not approve of such an event. <br /> <br /> And the attackers themselves? Think of a modest masterpiece, such as "Invasion of Body Hijackers". Something is happening in the small town of Dr. Kevin McCarthy and it takes half the film to keep the secret going, and the whole time tension is building and doubting. Here, twenty minutes into the movie, the stranger goes to the motel and tears off his face and reveals a vibrant, radiating, naked brain. Pregnancy is interrupted. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you the end because I do not know what it is, nor do I care about it. I suppose it had something to do with insects, because why would Paul LeMatt be an entymologist? (By the way, who deals with their classes?) But I'm not even sure they're mistakes. It is quite possible that the trade with errors was random. The writers made him an insect specialist and then forgot about it. That won't surprise me.
