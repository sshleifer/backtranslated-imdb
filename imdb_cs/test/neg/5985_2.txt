This movie is billed as a comedy. What was so funny about having lost your home for a supposedly premeditated arson or drug caused by the violent rape of one of the main characters. Does this art imitate life? Jack Black was slightly amusing as a mountain man, a farmer. However, even this segment of the film was full of pathos. What was the meaning of life in the midst of nothing with an escort. If Black's character were so paranoid, why should he make acid with a group of people right from Woodstock? There is no end to disconnected relationships, less scenario conspiracies, and scene transitions lacking any coherence or logical chronology.
