I bought this movie as I thought the cast was decent and I love Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit. <br /> <br /> Let me first say that acting is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin is angry with his character at times and times. Patsy Kensit is so powerful in some scenes, but not very convincing, and the supposed poetry that spews in her hotel room in a particular scene is utterly garbage. Mrs. Kensit is definitely very suggestive and sexy, but in the end I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this movie. Mrs. Rubins' character is initially innocent, then sexy when she plays Stephen Baldwin (Travis) for a fool. Support for the cast includes Adam Baldwin (no relation to his more famous namesakes) and M. Emmet Walsh, who has appeared in many films, also noticed Art Evans, who was one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2. The movie is decent and there There are several nude scenes with Rubin and Kensit, a little action, but it certainly isn't a fast moving or intelligent thriller. There is a special scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and Stephen Balwin's character is wearing sunglasses and when to see him again, the area around his eyes etc. He is painted instead of black, then the sunglasses reappear when they leave the crime scene and The police are in pursuit, a very obvious mistake in editing. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of one lady or either Baldwin, then you can find something you like, but others should avoid. This is a sensible but unusual thriller and not really worth more than a few dollars if you want.
