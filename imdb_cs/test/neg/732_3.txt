I will admit that as soon as I started watching this movie, I had the privilege that made me watch it until its conclusion. Probably it was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero to do it with his victim, or perhaps the fascination of having the money to produce, distribute and show this movie that let me look for merit, or maybe Some bizarre wish-filling fantasies could be the place at the end of all the pain. But no luck. So you are warned not to start watching it in the first place, so that it doesn't happen to you. There's nothing worth wasting an hour and a half. First person mockumentary and schtick about Fabian's "quest" to impregnate Falkland women come even more like sophomoric (maybe Freshman - a high school student, a film student project before you can imagine. that both local residents (who are, in fact, real people, in fact) are somewhat disgusting sexual politicians (regardless of whether you take it literally or symbolically, regardless of whether you take it literally or and sexist). The reason I watched him is the same reason that once one starts to grasp the scab, it's an irresistible fascination to do it until it's gone, even if you know it's bad for you. You just want to see what happens. Finally, it is rather dishonest filmmaking, because it does not seem to have any moral center, no clarification of the local political situation, no place in this type. the political-sexual personal film universe and Goddard. In short, he has nothing to say and spends a long time pretending to do it. Smug would be a one-word slogan. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that filmmakers rent "Waiting for Guffman" or hell several times, even "Blair Witch Project" if they want to watch schtick with a little more style and a little more real emotion. Or at least a fun value.
