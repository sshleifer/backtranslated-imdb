The virtual innocent Indri finds himself in a house of prostitution run by a merciless pimp MG. Indri ends up imprisoned in the private prison of the MG when he refuses to love him. Of course, Indri and the secular top of Helga are joining forces and planning to escape. Blah Mamana Firmansyah, Uninspired Direction and Blunt Screenplay by Pieta Burnam, thoroughly undermines any fragile vitality that this film needs to qualify as a pleasing piece of exploitation from fools behind: a slow pace painfully dragging around the world, there's no gratuitous female nudity anything (girls even during a mandatory group shower scene, they show no skin!), the expected torture and degradation are immensely tame and lukewarm, the moderate grim gore also does not impress, and even the ridiculous succession of cat fights is nothing enthusiastic. Thomas Susanto is a walking cinematography, a ridiculously miserable dubbing, an unbearably long 102-minute run, a kindly thematic song, and Gatot Sudarto's cornball score add more outrageous insults to an already formidable injury. Only some decent last action, which is based on the reel, offers a little relief from otherwise overly abundant tedia. Complete beak.
