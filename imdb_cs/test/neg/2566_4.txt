I discovered "Patriot" in a DVD-store and thought it might be a real action thriller. No, instead it's a low-budget movie with a ridiculous story. It is no doubt a cable film and not a theater movie. Fortunately, after 90 minutes, the film stops, otherwise viewers should take anti-sleep anti-virus. One thing came: it was a nice country where the film was shot. You can really feel American air, but that's all. I hope Steven Seagal will finally succeed in a big hit. It's not visible because my wife and my wife voted 4/10 on average.
