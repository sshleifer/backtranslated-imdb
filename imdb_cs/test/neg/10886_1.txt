I can't simplify it, it's a horrible movie. I worked in the field and made several (short) films myself, so my standard is pretty high, but seriously, I hate this movie. I didn't talk to IMDb earlier, but I hated this movie so much I had to come and warn others. It's a sh * t piece. A writer / director is an idiot who has no idea how to make a good movie and write a good knowledge of a teenage teenager. The characters are unrealistic (the leading woman does not think she would marry a police officer, but is resourceful enough to improvise Molotov's cocktail? I don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon idea, but it looked like it was a sloppy writing and a comfortable bullshit without really thinking about me. This is officially the worst movie I've seen all year. Congratulations to Shiban, now you will be there with such greats as Micheal Bay in a prestigious "should not be allowed to waste millions of dollars to make a movie" club. I hope you read it, really. And 163 idiots who rated this movie 10 out of 10 BWAHHAHAHAHAh oh my god, I hope a demon will appear behind you who tortures you.
