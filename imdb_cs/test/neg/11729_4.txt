A frightening plot, a lengthy scenario, almost everything. The most compelling performance is Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but it doesn't even save this nonsensical and ugly movie. The director's implicit invitation to viewers is not only a suspension of distrust but also a suspension of judgment. It is supposed to be steamy and menacing, but although the film has its erotic moments, there are few and far away. This kind of thing has happened much more. Don't go out to see it.
