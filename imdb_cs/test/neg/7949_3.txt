Why remake the original "Assault"? In my opinion, "Assault" was the real masterpiece of Carpenter. She had all the elements of good Carpenter movies included. An external threat to a small group of individuals. People who have accepted this challenge because they are forced to do so. Insulation! Just remember that the weapons in Carpenter's original work have not heard any sound, which is much more threatening than conventional equipment. And now this remake. Focusing on the psychology of "the main character I" and his relationship to the main character II (evil, but honest). An anonymous threat in the film Carpenter replaced conventional conspiracy / corruption. "Remakers" simply did not understand the main storyline of the original. And so something quite ordinary was created.
