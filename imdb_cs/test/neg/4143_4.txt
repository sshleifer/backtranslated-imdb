I wanted to make this movie, but I can't find it in myself to do it. <br /> <br /> Showing Duality of Combat Styles, It's Li vs. Li in a somewhat decent battle for superiority. br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where the story brings a performance. Li is very amateur acting, hesitant and stiff for most of this movie ... until the very end. At first, I cheated on believing that she was doing it for only one of her two characters. To show the difference in personalities. But it seemed to be inexperience or lack of talent. Towards the end it was a little better, more relaxed. But that wasn't enough to save his performance. Acting Jet Li is improving as his career moves forward. I hate his actions. I hated him in this. I also have to say that the effects were very impressive "B". What are the effects. The story had great potential. It was uniquely creative, bold and fresh. Unfortunately, even the budget was not enough to accommodate better lighting, effects, film quality and some acting lessons, or the director didn't care too much about these little details. He also did not bother with SCIENCE in science fiction. The fact that was a great critic for this film. Battle sequences were a bit one-sided, as they seemed to give more character and little to others. But in all cases the story created for a very enjoyable attempt. <br /> <br /> How nice it was, I couldn't help but think it was just one of those movies, you can't help but watch what it was, rather than what it is. <br /> <br /> Heads 6.0 / 10 on the "B" scale. This is 4.2 / 10 (on the "A" scale) for a good graph, from ... Fiend :.
