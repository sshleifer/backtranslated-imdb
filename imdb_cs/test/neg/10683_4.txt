I was all ready to hate it, but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerant - though MTV's filming style (DV shooting, booting) is pretty charming! I liked the self-mocking of the script as well as his central idea that a female vampire leader would double as a contracting killer. As for the cast, Eileen Daly (best known as the "star" of those horrible intro "Redemption") has an undeniable presence on the screen - and despite her age, she is quite sensual; however, chief Christopher Adams is uncomfortable. David Warbeck has a short role as a physician (nicknamed "Horror-Film Man"!), Who carries out an autopsy of one of the vampire victims; The movie seems to have taken a long time to shoot Warbeck in 1997! There is a lot of nudity and violence on hand, but not very sad senses (especially because its subplot involving a secret society of vampires infiltrating power structures is barely developed); The film is also too long for its purpose and finally slips into tedia in the last half hour.
