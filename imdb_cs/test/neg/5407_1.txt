It is one of the worst movies of all time. No research or thought has entered this film. Action scenes were thrown at random intervals, making no sense in the context of the movie. Items appeared and disappeared randomly, etc. Obviously, it was driven by a "stunt coordinator" who should return to his old job. Skeleton Man rode a horse in the whole movie, which amazingly, could change color as you wish. Either that or someone thought the audience would be blind and not notice. Blood would be on the actors in one scene and the next, miraculously disappearing and then reappearing. Everyone who is associated with this film seems to have forgotten to check for irregularities.
