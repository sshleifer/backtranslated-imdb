I really didn't get this movie because I'm not some perv like you who is lesbian. The girl in the red wig tries to be too funny (her lips are silicone)!) but she's really lame and insecure. He tries to leave as a surfer-guy (better than dressing slutty, but still weird and definitely unfashionable); the film doesn't explain why he's trying to pass on as a man. Well, "get" a poor, stupid girl. I forgot. She does all the silly inventions that aren't funny, and she's a really lousy actress. Besides, the waif look is so OUT! This silly blonde from Melrose Place plays (surprise) stupid blonde. She thinks the girl in the wig is a guy! They even recognize each other! Ewww! I think the part was a little funny.
