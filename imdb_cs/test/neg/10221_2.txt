I found the first bit of stopping the animation animation interesting and mostly live action short with the girl going in any country it was in my interest, but another 11 odd shorts really didn't scare my interest or make me think of anything on everything. Music and 8mm shots seemed so random that it all looked random. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you get it for free. <br /> <br /> When it comes to music that is in such a step, it didn't hit. I rented a DVD because I thought it was stop motion animation or SMA mixed with live action and only the first short was SMA, the other had a small stop motion mix with mostly live action. These were paper cutouts, and the rest were 8mm camera footage with a music bed. I had no sense of what I saw.
