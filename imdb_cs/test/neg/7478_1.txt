For a while, when I was among the jobs, I used to watch all the night shows. For a while I had a good choice: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... <br /> <br /> Until I reached 1:30 am. Time between Conan and X-Files, on SciFi. The only show at that time was (and still is) Carson Daly. His show impressed me first and foremost. I thought Carson would bring the younger aesthetics into the late night. I couldn't be more bad. He has no comedic timing. His jokes are obviously rude and his monologue is a painful matter of self-confident buzzing. I began to think that he just wasn't able to bring a comedy (and I'm right it isn't), but over time it turned out that the writers must have it at the show. Writing was stupid and too exaggerated, and the parody screams badly. At the end of the show, which was in the studio, Carson writers were drinking alcohol on the stage with appetite at every show, the careless Carson who smiled from the emitted face to the rounded cheeks as the conversations broke. <br /> <br /> Zero interview skills. None. He is trying to be friendly / flimsy, but ultimately unreal and rude. They talk too much. Cuts away the guests. He asks them rough or embarrassing questions - if he can find a question that might even ask them. And as someone has pointed out, guests literally stare at him or curl on their seats, apparently uncomfortable. Now the show has left the studio and it looks like it's been filmed on one cam. Even so, Carson refuses to suggest NBC. At one point, Carson didn't even get a cameraman, he had to film for the episode! Wake up, Carson ... that the manuscript is all over the wall. I see that the show is made by Carson. I can imagine that's why he's still in the air, paying for it himself.
