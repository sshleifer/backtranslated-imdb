Recently I saw a string of films and this film was able to combine all the worst aspects of this type of film. You will receive very little recognition for the cave surrounding or the monster it faces, while the characters are clich√©s (a spiritual guy, a tragedy leader in the recent past, etc.) And the end was only weak. It really upset me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost complete darkness to create the atmosphere. I read that this movie was a real representation of the cave and yeah, I think the caves are dark. Indeed, showing almost complete blackness for half the film really brought the home. I really enjoyed the "descent" that had better acting for my money, showed tighter situations, better monsters and had a good ending. <br /> <br /> **** spoiler ****** <Br /> <br /> The monster turns out to be a guy whose plane crashed and his parents were killed, so he grew up in the caves. He seems to have developed super power and speed, but why he never solves - maybe the same force that launched their torch torches caused it, but during the movie, whenever someone is killed, you get the impression that each victim has something bigger claws. Look at how much blood sprays the walls!) But it's just some dude with a fur draped over him and a mask? I'd be willing to overlook it if the tension was high, but this was hardly the case. Then he starts raping the last remaining caver and roll credits ... I thought almost absurdly wrong. Sometimes the film is so bad that you can appreciate it and maybe laugh, but these movies are not easy to take. <br /> <br /> You watched it, you can't make it!
