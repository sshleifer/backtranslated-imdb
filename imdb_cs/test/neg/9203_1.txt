1) Bad play. 2) For a lot of castaways on a strange planet, it certainly looked at home, especially with the houses and roads you can see in the background. Awful plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing expensive survival equipment and clothes left, right and middle. <br /> <br /> 4) Cool 70 scifi jumpsuits (maybe the only good thing about this movie) <br /> <br /> 5) Interesting boat at the beginning (this crew had to observe Space 1999 a lot). Too bad they'll throw it out soon. The escape ship also sank too fast. * Sigh * <br /> <br /> 6) Anthropologists may find some aspects of the film interesting in terms of the behavior of the primate group.
