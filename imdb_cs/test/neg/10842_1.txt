This movie seems like someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny options, hired a good cast, then turned the whole thing into a really bad screenwriter and even worse director. The director shot a film romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy movie --- strange camera angles, blue filtered shots, persistent, close up looking at raindrops. Steve Zahn was as good as ever. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock struggled with a brave figure who was supposed to be a zana, but whose unusualness consisted of things like crazy kissing her husband she hated, leaving her child, riding a carnival, offering money for money and buming with a ride. airline passengers. The script had very few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. She introduced potentially funny situations, then cut them off before they could develop. At the top of it all gone, the "twist" in the end was smacked in the face for anyone waiting for a fun romantic comedy. If you've seen the movie trailer and liked the way I did it, my advice is: don't go to the movie. It will just spoil a nice trailer.
