There is only one reason why this film is traceable. Up to Schweiger. He is such a good actor that the film is not completely awful. Please take another career with Uwe Boll. Special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (in the evening with ...) talked about Tim Burton, who never read the Batman comic and showed it. Uwe Boll should never have played video games that he still makes movies. If you two want to know how to do it, look at Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games ever to be film adaptations. Some people may disagree, but if you look at the movie, you can see that the ID guys had something to do with Doom. It does not seem that someone in UBIsoft is even close to this production.
