This is by far the worst British comedy ever, as it happened around the first episode let alone the pilot is out of me. The acting is weak from the main character, played by Ben Miller Sarah Alexander (from a fantastic link) directly through the cast. The storyline / story lines were rude and very very predictable using many worn out ideas. A very painful series endure, but unfortunately put in a slot between two excellent shows. describe it as Britain's response to "Meet Your Parents" service that "meets parents" and is as fresh as an old shoe that runs with a family dog. Britain should learn that breaking away from other countries never works by looking at America's sad attempts.
