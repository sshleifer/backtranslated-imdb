This is just the fourth effort I have watched from this director (whom I met and found it quite brilliant on a retrospective of the Italian B-movie in 2004 at Venice's Venice Film Festival) and perhaps the worst. As in the case of BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, it is a first-rate example at the end of the Euro-cultural era - first-class, because it shows the depths that previously uplifting style has fallen into! Here, in fact, we get a conspiracy that revolves around - I'm not kidding people - a killer phone! Charlotte Lewis - but in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and the GOLDEN CHILDREN (1986), she is a model that has just ended the business; She expects her architect's lover to call her back, but every time the phone rings, all she gets is static, accompanied by voices from the neighborhood (or some kind of crap). She befriends a new tenant at her apartment building, who, comfortably, knows about authority on paranormal activity (William Berger) - who, cheerfully, explains that the negative energy that is unleashed, to say, during family arguments can manifest itself through the home appliances to deadly power (I swear I don't do that)! Among the most striking points of the film are: a grumpy bartender whose dingy place calls the hero several times (the chain of events seems to be merely broken by Lewis going through his steps again, EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) -style!), a complete range of nonsensical-looking phones on display, a friend of a heroine who crept over her before killing, a sarcastic cop who greets Lewis on a special event report ("What is a toaster when I was interested?") a bully killed by the firing of a phone booth and Berger's own bloody extinction (with a phone) affecting a pacemaker equipped and causing the doctor's heart to explode! The culmination of the film is somewhat confusing and apparently finally sees all the "lost souls" that inhabit a flock of doves and fly out of the window of "obsessed" office (the service of lonely hearts!). For what's worth, the score - ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti no less - is effective enough, despite heavy metal data being included in the soundtrack.
