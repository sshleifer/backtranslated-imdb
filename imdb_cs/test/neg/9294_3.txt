A very sensitive subject - a 15-year-old girl abandoned by her mother as a child who goes to visit her is still ignored, is raped by her mother's friend, becomes pregnant. There was not enough depth in this situation. Too much time is being chased with trucks carrying a baby. (Interesting, this child with asthma - you will never see him crying - once -, crouching, you have changed your diaper throughout the truck.) I would like to see more relationships, a greater focus on the fact that this girl was a minor - that would be should immediately stand in court. And that was a real story! It deserves a better story than that! <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for the subject, I'd put it closer to 0 ratings. I rented it from the library. Only later did I find that it was a television film. oh well
