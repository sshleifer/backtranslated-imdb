I don't even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> It's not advisable to write a review, so I will quote what another user has posted because I have met him thoroughly, but instead I give him 1/10 instead of 2 / 10 "I'm losing to find words to say how badly I thought this movie was. The initial rule was promising, but in all respects it was absolutely terrible. Let's go through the main points. Fence - a good introduction The idea, but really terrible development, when I thought "no, nobody would do something so stupid", the end was incredibly anti-climatic. Characterization - all characters were either totally bland or grotesque cartoons, the one that wasn't - maybe mother, but that's - music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally horrible, direction - completely amateur, cinematography - doubts that they have heard about it, camera angles / stability / zoom level are often very bad I am totally confused about how this movie It's the worst movie I've seen in the cinema for years, if not at all.
