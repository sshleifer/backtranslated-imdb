I put the blame for Comebacks on anyone who enjoyed the Date Movie and Epic Movie. You people have encouraged Fox's studio to continue in desperate parody movies, and now we're confronted with what can be the most likable and desperate one of them. Comebacks barely qualifies as a parody. Damn, he barely qualifies as a movie. This is the theory of comedy, but not in design. No one, not even people dealing with this mess, might be fooled to think they were making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) did something really poor here. If you can call it anyway, it focuses on a man named Lambeau Fields (David Koechner). When I heard his name in the first few seconds of the movie, I knew I was in a long movie. Funny names are rarely funny and become even less fun, the more you hear them. Lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world, but his best friend, Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers), got another chance to train the Ragtag High School football team called The Comebacks. Lambeau must not only lead the team to victory, but also teach them ways of inspiring sports film clich√©s. He expects his children to have bad marks and problems with alcohol, and if they don't, he'll get rid of them. When the team seems to have a chance to play at the big WC Bowl championship (wrote the 10-year script?), Lambeau is shocked to find that Freddie is the coach of the big opposing team his team will have. play against. It turned out that Freddie had only encouraged Lambeau to take coaching because he wanted Comebacks to lose. Comebacks is a film that is so forced and pathetic, I almost believed what I was watching. Spoof movies have recently changed into a game of "place movie reference", and this continues the tradition. He tries to squeeze as many links to other sports movies as possible, but he won't do anything with them, expecting to just point at the screen and laugh at the intimacy, or try to be funny and fit. face. Some of the movies they refer to include Field of Dreams, Bend It Like Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Light It Lights, Stick It, Radio, Miracle, Remember the Titans, Gridiron Gang, Invincible and Dodgeball: The True Underdog Story. But wait, wasn't Dodgeball a parody of inspiring sports movies? In other words, we watch a parody of a parody of inspiring sports films. If it makes sense to you, you're just the audience this film is looking for. Some of these films are referred to as conspiracies, and some (like Rocky) are simply thrown for no reason because filmmakers wanted to try to refer to as many movies as possible. There are some that the film even feels the need to explain to us in its dialogue, just against we have missed an obvious reference. You know the film is in trouble when it has to spell its own jokes. Worst of all, the screenplay of TV veterans and writers for the first time, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez, doesn't know the first and most important parody rule - You have to play it straight. The actors must pretend they're not on the joke. The reason why classic Zucker Brothers as Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun are remembered so kindly is that they cast serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes, he was a serious actor before he turned to comedy) and Robert Stack, and then threw them into ridiculous situations. It was funny that they behaved as if they weren't in comedy, and kept a stone face on the strangeness around them. Those films wouldn't work if they played their roles widely. Comebacks prove it, because all the actors are forced to play their roles as crazy as if they were shouting at us to laugh. David Koechner is still waving his arms, bulging his eyes and screaming to the top of his lungs to the point that he looks like someone who knows he's trapped in a blind comedy, just trying too hard to pretend he has a good time. The film also does not understand the art of celebrity portraits (also an important factor when it comes to parody movies). What kind of portrait do we get in The Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. At a time when the film casts nothing out of nothing and the nonsensical cast of the music number into "Don't Stop Believing" for Journey for no reason at all, I was just ready to go out of the theater door. I was the only person in my screening and the idea that this movie was going on a pathetic path to the totally empty house I liked. I was sitting in the rest of The Comebacks and I wasn't rewarded for my efforts. The sad thing is that Fox is not yet done to kill the spoof genre. They have a parody of 300 coming out the next year called Meet with Spartans. I guess it couldn't be much worse than this, but I saw a trailer and wouldn't get your hopes.
