I ticked "contains a spoiler" box, in case I say something that is a spoiler and I didn't realize that I said it until I read it again after I sent it. So it's just in case. Anyway, back to reviewing this movie. This film I saw in the heavens tonight and Sky described it (these people must be on acid), it sounded pretty good, but then when I got about 30 minutes into it, I was horrified . In my opinion, this film has the worst screenplay and actors / actresses. A young girl who falls in love with a L.A boy after about 3 hours is a really stupid, lame character who has annoying, whiney voice and boff hair. -.-. Then there is her lover who is an idiot and is also very whiney. In fact, they might fit together. Then there's the boy's mom who's on vacation with him, and surprise, surprise - he's a doctor, and - oh my god, wait, there's more unexpected surprises! A virus suddenly breaks out on the island and knows about viruses! SHOCK HORROR! Yeah, right. Lol. Then there's this crazy religious guy who keeps on "coats of arms" or something, and how the Lord knows everything. Everyone on the island seems to love him, yet he is still stubborn, arrogant, steroid pumped (you really have to watch this movie just for a scene where it comes out of the sea, its head is small and its body is MASSIVE, it's merry ) buffoon who had too much to drink. Anyway, after all these strange characters, including a stoned looking taxi driver, a religious boy finally gives up the doctor and she takes a blood sample, and they get straight to work to find a cure out of it because for some reason that is dramatically saved, all on "erbs and god". And OH MY BOH. YES, ARE OTHER SURPRISE !! You NEVER Cut What! Only when 11 minutes before everyone on the island is dead, in fact, including her son and his girlfriend, he finds a cure and injects everyone, and it's all solved !!! What a pathetic film. I knew it was an obvious end when I first started to watch it, but even though it would be good and some subfields would alternate, but no-no, it was just boring and dry. /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. You'll end up like me - overwhelmed for 3 hours and then demanding for an hour and a half you spent living and watching him back.
