This is one of the biggest problems of this film, along with a large number of the greatest québecois movies: It is done in a flashy way of pretentious people. It's really sad, but the "big blows" of filmmakers (driving Dodge Stratus ...) from this province believe they're right, they know what little people like. Are we not a wealthy province, always such a big movie (30 million)? !!?) is made, it's cut off a lot of others who won't see their movie due to lack of government assistance. Thus it creates mediocrity; only "family friends" movies will be made. I sounded and I am. I went to see Nouvelle-France expecting a trip in the lives of my ancestors, but I found myself stuck in a pile of irregularities: the French accent (we must please our cousin, so f *** our language québecois) and the lack of historical research is few. Add the love story again from the camp and the same musical score, and the Québecois viewer will open and ask for more. I'm glad he didn't do this challenging piece with *** as the Stratge Stratus Big Shots planned ... It will help filmmakers who are not in the very limited "business of film" Quebec. > <br /> Instead, you rent a travel bar and have a really good time. PS: I will never forgive them for having destroyed such an amazing title.
