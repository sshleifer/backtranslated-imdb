a really horrible film about a 30-meter shark. bad story bad talk bad characters bad story even confusing ending complete. Passport Time In My View I thought it was a TV movie, but then I saw it wasn't me I can't imagine that paying to see this load crap please avoid this movie at all costs. although u like jaws that i did on average, i don't see it, even if you have interests in paleontology, you don't see it, even if you like corny movies with corny actors, corny charts during corny tv time, make humanity a favor and no, i repeat, DO NOT pollute your mind with this ridiculous apology for a sci-fi animal thriller, some people have given her ten rantings ... I don't know if they were serious or not (but they sincerely expected that they weren't)
