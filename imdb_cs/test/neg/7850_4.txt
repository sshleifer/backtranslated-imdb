Kissing Bandit was the third and last movie that Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson co-starred in MGM s. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and It Happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra wooed and lost Grayson. I think the third time is magic. <br /> <br /> For romance maybe, but certainly not for on-screen images. Sinatra, once again in his forty films, is once again playing a nice little time in toreador's pants. Filling in the territory of Tyrone Power, which is unveiled in Zorr's stamp, Sinatra plays the son of a man who was the hotel owner by day and the hotel The Bandit Kissing at night. He is gone and left California for education and returned ready to take his father's place, but only in the hotel business. And where to find out about the hotel business, Boston. Of course, some of the former gang members who were born a little older and scary, led by J. Carrole Naish, want him to lead the gang again. But Frank just doesn't say life out of law. But he makes a good impression on the governor's daughter, Kathryn Grayson. Someone had to have it to Sinatra in MGM after the bad ratings he got in the bell bell. Frank is in the section that was more appropriate for Red Skelton. But since it was a musical, I think the brain's confidence in MGM thought Kathryn Grayson must have a singing star. In fact, the best number in the movie is for her, Love is where you find it. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse are making a dance specialty that is pretty. Frank's songs are nice but nothing spectacular. In later years, Sinatra would fall in the mention of The Kissing Bandit and with good reason.
