This film is a shame. How can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into a half-entered love story. The entire beginning of the film was not in the story of H.G. Wells didn't have to be. Also, Eloi was doing completely wrong. They built houses or formed any real company. They didn't care about themselves at all. That was an important part of the story. The way they have created a world that has been without difficulty or complex emotions. They were barely aware of Morlocks. I don't know why this film was made as it was, but some stories should be narrated as they are or left alone.
