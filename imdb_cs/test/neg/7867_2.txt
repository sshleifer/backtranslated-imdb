I hate being too critical, but this was really bad. I like the Baldwin brothers, I just wish talent was spread evenly between them. I liked the general conspiracy, but there were too many "attempts" and not enough "real" activities in terms of quality acting. My favorite character of the whole thing was a bald cop. He reminded me of Dmitri Valtane (Jeremy Roberts, I believe) of Start Trek 6: Undiscovered Country. Just, without hair. <br /> <br /> If you have an MVP for Hollywood Video and you're really trying to get your money, then it's one of three MVP movies you pick up. Worth a few laughs. The only most impressive special effect on the show is Stephen Baldwin's rifle sound. I suppose it will give you a little bit of quality and excitement for the rest of the show.
