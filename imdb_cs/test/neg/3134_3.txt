Bardem is great. The actresses are great. But Amenabar didn't have to do it like that. It's okay to defend his position on euthanasia, which is an extremely sensitive issue. But he does it this way he loses his mind: the film is fake, offensive to intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes very boring. Some scenes are advertising materials, more than just movies. Women are incredibly attracted to this sick person who wants to be killed without understanding his consequences. He seems to care for no one and thank them for their care, love and attention. I believe that Amenabar could make people think differently about this issue, but the way he decided it was wrong. He could make his point stronger to expose the other side of the coin without mocking it.
