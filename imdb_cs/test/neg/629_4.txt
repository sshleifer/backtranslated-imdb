I saw previous films by Cédric Klapisch, so I was expecting a quality film with psychological depth. When I was an Erasmus student myself and visited several friends studying abroad, I know very well what it takes to spend some time abroad while mixing with different cultures. Yes, it's great fun! For this reason, I thought that I should not miss this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find out that L'Auberge Espagnol is not satisfied in many ways: the characters are stereotypical, the events are complete and the story is shallow. Although there are relatively few known situations, they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond trivial events. This made the film uninteresting to watch, and gave me a strong "was-there-done-it-not-you-have-something-to-add?" Besides, the film lacks a solid story. Sometimes it looks more like a documentary or "real-life" show than a serious film. However, I can imagine that if you were studying or traveling abroad, it could be fun to watch.
