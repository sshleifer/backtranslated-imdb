The series won't start because it means going on. Although it's the first two seasons, they are filled with an incredibly average episode, as well as numerous duds, then the pace rises and one of the best space operas is born. The first ever Star Trek: The Next Generation episode is remarkable for two things: it's a very entertaining performance for all the main casts and a special accent for Marina Sirtis that would later disappear. Seeing how it all started is very satisfying and looking at the rest of the series, rather touching. Otherwise it is a very average episode featuring Q, and some giant jellyfish. That is right.
