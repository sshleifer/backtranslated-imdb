Western-style deposits Feminism has remained largely non-existent in various subcultures of India, two entities belonging to the alien realm and threatening (in the name of tradition) have never coincided. Art imitates life (or so claims) and popular Hindu cinema is no exception, reflecting the underlying misogyny, which unfortunately forms the basis of most of the collective Indian culture. But why? What is it about the female gender that has made it so hateful of culture that women are routinely exposed to unimaginable horrors, including rape, murder, infanticide, impoverished illiteracy, infidelity, and the submission of the spirit under the name 'dowry'? The last offer of Rajkumar Santoshi, "Lajja", asks the same pitiful question, linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters / episodes that include the path of shame sustained by her protagonist Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). The direction to Santoshi's part is not in line with the level the story requires. It cannot achieve the necessary sensitivity in displaying the saga of sadness and confronts the question of misogyny from the side instead of the frontal one. Santoshi recently said that he did not create the film for the international film festival, but rather for the masses of his country. Unfortunately, this will be reflected, and the film is too often immersed in the action blood genre that Santoshi specializes in. The film suffers from its jerky, episodic pace and its end is somewhat fanciful. The female occupied a much kinder and rounder character than their male counterparts. The protagonist plays sensitively beautiful Manishu Koiral, who in Lajja proves to be one of our more competent leading women, who is in our time and has the proper performance. One wonders how brilliantly she could shine that the film was created by the director with the appropriate creative intent and appreciation of the subject. Mahima Choudhary puts a laudable achievement and continues to prove that he is an untapped talent. Madhuri Dixit performs as Janki and performs with never before seen zeal and bliss for what truly deserves the name "acting". The role of a street intelligent artist who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child is the greatest risk of her cannon role-song-n-dance, which has maintained its status of awning over the past decade. Which leaves the last and most disturbing performance in this bureaucratic feminist sled, in that it is a constantly gifted Rekh talent. Lajja is a Manisha Koirala movie, but there is no doubt about it, but it is Rekha who controls the performances in a performance that penetrates your bones and sends echoes of horror through the vestibules of your heart. Rekha dazzled as Ramdulari, preventing vanity and kindness to bring performance that is so filled with authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of that part of the film. The comparisons are really ugly, especially when they are built against one of the world's leading women, but in the kind presence of this reigning legend on the screen, others in their shadows fade. "Lajja" has no sophistication of proto-feminist dramas such as "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar", or even the hell-queen "Laadla": it fulfills its feminist goals in two early moments: loud tirade, in which Mahima relies on its in-law for their abuse of her father, who has not committed any other crime than the birth of a girl. It breaks out and leaves the wedding procession in ruins. When she saw her father ravaged, he began to cry and blame himself for the chaotic destruction in front of him. She bemoans, "Why did I say something? I destroyed everything! That's all my fault!" Her grandmother, who silently witnessed how she got hold of her, comforts her when she says, "Why are you crying? There's no reason why you should cry. who came before you, because if we had the courage to say in our days what you said today, you wouldn't need to say anything today. "In this scene, the significance of feminist heritage is clearly seen in the word. <br /> <br /> Another, more subtle moment comes very soon in the movie when Vaidehi (Manisha) escaped from his violent husband to the home of his parents in India. it may seem perfectly reasonable (indeed natural) that any abused woman will seek the protection of her parents, this is a social taboo in many Eastern cultures, India, and once a woman is married, the identity she assumes is the identity of her husband and his personal property ( family, business, children, etc., the equivalent of a Western woman. She is then regarded as defiled and as a "damaged commodity" that has been wholly enforced by her own actions and refused to submit to the role given to her. as she is a sign of family honor, her father repented her of her actions, worried that his family honor would be irrevocably damaged His primary concern is that of the imminent marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister, the prospect made far less likely with a divorced older daughter in the same household. She won't tell her that she has to go back to the man she belongs to, whether she is violent or sadistic. She raises an ancient saying against her that "The honor of every home lies in the hands of his daughter." Quiet and thoughtful, he said, "Yes, the honor of every home lies in the hands of his daughter."
