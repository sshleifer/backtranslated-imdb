This should not be done in the movie. Everything was stupid and I don't think I laughed once. There were bits and pieces that were fine, but that's about it. Lots of parts were strikingly similar to many other movies that made them much better. There were some famous actors, but no one did a good job. This is one of those films that try to have a "cute" end, but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeemable values. Carrot Top is probably the worst comedian right now. Do yourself a favor and avoid this! <br /> <br /> Final decisions: <br /> <br /> Movies: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> Buying a DVD: Definitely not! <Br/> <br /> Rental: Only if you've seen everything else and have a free coupon, but still not worth your time.
