Want the worst horror of the 21st century? El Chupacabra is it. "Manos: The Hands of Fate" is the worst movie ever, but El Chupacabra is certainly the worst movie of this century. It also has to make the difference that he has absolutely the worst leading actor ever. Eric Alegria, starring actor, never made a film other than El Chupacabra, gee - I wonder why. It seems that the monster is attacking people, but everyone who is attacked is moving really slow and is really stupid. And there are no cops in this city, just two idiotic detectives - Hello! Cops first appear at the murder site, then the detectives come! And the monster seems to only attack one person's yard and the deserted area at the docks. Or ... this is the only place where filmmakers can access film. This 'movie' is why the IMDb must allow us to give negative stars. This easily deserves -10 stars, or at least 0. They should allow 0 rating.
