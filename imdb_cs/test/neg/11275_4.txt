For some movies, it's really hard to tell who they were made for. Huevos de oro seems to be heading for a well-educated Spanish middle class. There must be many inner jokes in this movie that you won't understand if you're an outsider. This can be quite annoying. The symbols and references to art and popular culture are abundant, the film refers to the work of Salvador Dali, Luis Bu√±uel and the Surrealists in general. they point to Duchamp's prepared mady. What's more, the main character also has a karaoke talent with Julio Iglesias. But why is it all mixed in quite nice but also unreasonable way, it just escapes me. I can only guess that it all serves to highlight the vital, impulsive, opulent vulgarity of the main character, who the director apparently admires and despises. As all really beautiful women run after him (the main character, I think) is a little worrying. The film has three parts. It starts in the Spanish enclave of Melilla in Africa, where Benito, the protagonist, performs his military service, apparently in a college of engineers. Then he moves to Benidorm in Spanina, where Benito wants to build the tallest skyscraper in place and become a vulgar Howard Roark. In the final part, the defeated Benito moved to Miami, Florida, probably to start a new life. "However, the change of place is not satisfactorily explained, but it also somehow irritates that there is no character development and that the film descends into a soap opera without being convincingly ironic; is growing and deflated. I bought this movie because I am interested And Benidorm is a special place, a small town, in this aspect Huevos de oro only partially satisfied me, in Jess Franco's She Killed In Ecstasy (1970) this place.
