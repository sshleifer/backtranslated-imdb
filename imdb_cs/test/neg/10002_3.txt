Even the Beatles couldn't write the songs they liked, and although Walter Hill is no mop-top, he's second only to provoking action movies. The 1990s came and social platforms changed into music and film, the emergence of a rapper-transformed movie star was in full swing, acting returned to every person who exaggerated regional accent and transparent acting. That was one of the many ice movies I saw as a child and loved to watch them later and cringe. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters with basic lives until the burning tenant goes into the flames of his hands over the map with golden consequences. I'll give it to Walter for a quick and neat setup of the main characters and locations. But to blame everyone involved for making Lame-o performance. Ice-t and cube must have been red at this time, and when I enjoyed both of my career as rappers, in my opinion they fell in this movie. It is about ninety minutes of one guy who has turned ridiculously back to another when you find yourself in many states of the unbelievers. Now it's a movie, it's not a documentary, so I'm used to wasting my time to read all the silly plot in this movie, but there are many and no leads. I felt it was watching that everyone on the scene was confused and just playing cuff stuff. There are two things I still enjoyed, one includes a scene with a needle and the other is Sadler's huge 45 pistol. The bottom line is this movie is like a domino pizza. Yeah, she's sick when I'm hungry and I don't want to cook, but I'm well aware she tastes like shit. 3 stars, meh.
