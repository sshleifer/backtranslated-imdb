It's hard to find something worth praising with this movie. It's not the worst picture ever made, but it doesn't say much. The plot is quite discontinuous and incredible; It seems manufacturers wanted to make a movie in space, but they decided to do it underwater to make money for the success of The Abyss. In some scenes, the story seems to have initially been set in space; Sub has a chassis, technicians worry about a rip in a rubber diving suit at a depth of several kilometers, where pressure would crush a diver and suit like an empty beer. The movie starts fine, with a recovery plan for a lost naval sub. After that, the film merges with Siren 2. <br /> <br /> The effects are so-so. Navigation screens are all performed on Commodore 64 (remember, this is 1990, not 1983), sub is managed like no other sub ever; instead of control consoles, keyboard officers have a keyboard with which to enter long numeric sequences to control the various functions of the ship. The interior of the ship is not very convincing. The final scene jumps from awkward to absurd. Welcome to the fifties, you can check the suspension of distrust at the door. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see the enjoyment factor here. The film is neither a good nor a badly bad MST3k-style (until you reach the final scene), it's like eating a little bad apple.
