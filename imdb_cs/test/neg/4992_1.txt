This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Boring, illogical, terrible. Don't waste a minute in your life to watch this crap! I hope the directors will not do any other movie because this movie is going to go bankrupt. The film seems to be created in one or two days with directors' friends (if we can use that word for these two guys). They use only the camera in hand. Many scenes are in the dark and nothing is visible. Lots of scenes (80% of the movie) are just conversation. ! There are movies like Vampire vs. Zombies you can laugh at, but this is just wrong, there's no point in making such movies. Please stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel. Don't make more movies!
