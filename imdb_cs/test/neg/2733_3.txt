Terry Cunningham controls this original Sci-Fi network. In Washington and Oregon, everything is not right; Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to drop most of the Pacific Ocean in the ocean. An attempt to keep the world immersed in ecological confusion, a team of scientists led by Jake Rollins (Luke Perry) takes a massive earth milling vehicle called "Mole" to chew the way into the Earth's fire core to avert the impending destruction. In fact, technical dialogue does not help or accelerate this film. Behavior is lame, but Perry has always been postponed. You can only blame him for attending. Others in the cast: Michael Dorn, Adam Frost and Michael Teigen
