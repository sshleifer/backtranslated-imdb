MGM hodgepodge Jimmy Durante threw a big girl for everyone in Hollywood. No major stars appear - we get three Stoogs, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I didn't recognize anyone else - they were probably unknown (for good reason). The film contains unpleasantly funny jokes and some really awful songs and choreography. The only things that saved it from total catastrophe are the Laurel & Hardy "battle" with Lupo Velez and the wonderful Disney cartoon "The Hot Chocolate Soldier". It is a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the film a huge boost. Otherwise, the film is a colossal hole. No director is credited - what does that tell you?
