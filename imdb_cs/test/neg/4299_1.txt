I found this movie at a flea market for cheap. I was so psychic because I thought it was a skateboarding movie. I got him home, the rules for the previews and the opening scene with the old guy who was rolling down the street on a skateboard was amazing. At that moment I realized that it was a post-apocalyptic film, but I still had great hopes for it. This movie was terrible. When we watched him, my friend was stoned and even thought it was horrible and a waste of high. During the movie I fell asleep because it was so boring and the music was terrible. I do not know if all the good music and all the music that is just miserable and destroyed during the apocalypse and everybody remember how to play it is cleared clean, but I think I would rather die than have to bear that stupid thing. . And what the hell was the TV studio? I can only assume that this film was modified from an old Greek game, with titles and titles, but some games are not meant to adapt to a futuristic sci-fi environment. Or at least not by the people involved in this film. If you are forced to watch this movie, I can only suggest that you finish the handgun before the end and finish. It would be a good movie to kill yourself too, everyone will understand why.
