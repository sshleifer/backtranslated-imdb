After 30 minutes. The first Critters film was a confident fun, "conversation" among animals just before Granny blows them off the porch, for example. This film is limping together, waiting for someone to shoot him and take it out of your suffering. I can't imagine that anyone who worked on this Turkey would be proud of him. One of them was fun, four of them were terrible. Don't bother, even if the alternative looks at repeating the TBS "700 Club" fund-raiser, you'll be there at least a little bit (and "alien" makeup is more believable .. grin).
