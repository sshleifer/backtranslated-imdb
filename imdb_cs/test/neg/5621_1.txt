If you look at the extra documentary, you will notice that the director is totally inexperienced and actually was a co-worker of Quentin Tarantinos in the video store. Put together two and two and you realize that Quentin is doing his favor for his old bud, even though he is rather talented. Was it cruel? Check out this movie and you'll find it not. Too slow at the beginning, too pointless in the middle and too slow to finish. This is it. Eric Stolz and Delpy were the only ones who showed charisma. And Kemp actually said OK. But the rest was really bad. One conspiracy conspiracy was when a "lead robber" accidentally left his mask during a raid. So what happens? Well other robbers decide that they can also remove them too! What a great thought. Violence was inexorable and insane. But not a "cool" way. Rather rather in a colorful way. I wondered if it was a comedy. More crazy Tarantino for not having his good name associated with this garbage. I'll be more embarrassed for watching.
