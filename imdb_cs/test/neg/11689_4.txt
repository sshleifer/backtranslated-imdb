To begin with, I once met a director when he was preparing for World War II with a camera and a video recording of events that looked good. I really wish he could keep it. Because I applaud so much about what he achieved on the clear "next door" of the budget, when I jumped on the DVD, I wondered why I was sitting for almost two hours. There is no real plot to talk about, you don't care what happens to characters (maybe Italian troops and some Germans), and the end is another commentary on "artistic film" about the futility of war. I could tell someone how it would end once I passed the first ten minutes. I knew the Germans would have several heroic volunteers to fight against death, I knew most of them would be killed, it was just too obvious! And when I was on this subject, I was shocked to see so much that the Axis party did well, but the GI party did a comic. Character development was clearly designed for non-English speaking roles. The GI just got hit hard in this movie. And I can't help if I had someone on the scene, who would understand how the US military works? The phrase, terminology, action, was clearly written by someone who didn't know about the US military. If I knew who was driving this movie now, I'd swear it was driven and written in German ...
