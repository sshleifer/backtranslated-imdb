Killjoy 2 is a fantastic song that goes on how clowns are usually really nice and fun, but Killjoy is a killer. I don't remember the song in the first movie, but when singer Olimpia Fernandez sings 'Killjoy, yeah Killjoy 2', it sounds like it 2 could be added for this sequel. The film is much worse than the first movie and it was really bad. This time the cast, including Debbie Rochon's exquisitely excellent, gave up the effort and director Tammi Sutton creates no tension and is just a boring and stable movie. Full Moon images created it in the "Urban" phase, none of which were very good, but nothing as bad as here.
