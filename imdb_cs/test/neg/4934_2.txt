I was hardly sitting with it. Every rotation and rotation is predictable. You're just sitting there waiting ... waiting for it ... and yes, here it is! Just as you predicted at the very beginning of the movie. Or 10 minutes. And so on. <br /> <br /> Smart writing? No <br /> <br /> Torture Porn? No, no nudity. Other reviews calling this porn torture are most likely written by people on heavy drugs. Unfortunately there is no torture and no nudity (yes, no nudity). There is no tension in this "thriller". The only good part about this movie is over, but I won't spoil it. I give it 2/10. 1/10 would be a terrible B-movie. This film had a better performance.
