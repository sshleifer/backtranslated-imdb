The movie is on TV as I write. I just forgot how horrible I was watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the movie is wrong. The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans are stuck in the desert, forgetting all the notions of morality and civilization within a few days is ridiculous. The madness of the Lord of the Fly was longer in creation. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of details that are uncomfortable. One of them is a united African divine character who mysteriously survives the horrible climate and has done so for ages without losing his mind and appearing to have no supply problems. Ridiculous. Also, there is an attempt to rescue from the wizard, Indiana Jones looking similar, whose rescue attempt ends with tragedy and death 5 minutes walk from the cottage. Then there is the choice of Lear, which is imposed on the band by a guru-like guru. He reminded me how I learned a hippie college teacher. The worst thing, however, is Levrings' choice of Lear. It is, of course, an intellectual brain. As ever, it is clear to me that this is the time of passage. Positives are few and far away. It's a beautiful movie, but it's never important. High school intellectual. Weird because of the strange. It's a complete waste of time if you don't like useless art movies.
