This show had a promising start as a kind of opposite of 'Oceans 11', but evolved into a shallow depiction of T&A. Actually, according to my little brother it is the only good part of the show. <br /> <br /> The first season was by far the best, it was new and the interesting things went down after that time. The only point of this show is JamesCaan, the other actors have a lack of shine. The characters lack depth and seem to be incredibly selfish and generally deaf people. Quoting a friend "Las Vegas is like a Baywaych in the casino" In my opinion, it's a way to be generous, Baywatch was much better and more realistic.
