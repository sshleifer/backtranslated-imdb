Around 1980, the name Godfrey Ho was associated with a series of low-comedy action films, in which the unlikely actor Elton Chong played. â€œAlthough no masterpiece of the genre, they remain surprisingly entertaining movies for those who have high tolerance for stupidity. It is absolutely unclear why Ho (or anyone) would like to make a film that would attack Jackie Chan Drunken MAster, a film that legitimized action film production in Hong Kong. this is, a fierce attack on Chan film (an imitation of Chan who stars in this film learns to get his opponents laughing to death - a pointless trick in any genre). Along with all the mistakes one expects from Godfrey Ho's film of this period - no continuity, no motivation, an incomprehensible plot line, irrelevant and incredible characters - the film suffers from two unforgivable defects that make it unnoticeable: The fighting scene stinks and comedy is not. t funny. <br /> <br /> Nonsensical.
