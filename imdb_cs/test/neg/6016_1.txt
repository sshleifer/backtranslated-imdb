I wish all documents and horror spoofs would disappear. If you are going to explore loch ness .. this for real. Enough of the bull ****. Like horror and science fiction .. if you are going to make a movie and it should be scary. I hate watching horror and a character fighting for her life (or running or anything ... their life is at stake) and they're cracking jokes. This will never happen. I think horror and sci-fi really went down the pipe in the 70's. I long for those days when the horrific shock was scary. This film is also for birds. If you really want to see a good investigation or a serious interview here ... don't expect it in this video.
