Marlene Dietrich is magnificent as Concha Perez, the tempter who drives all the men into despair in the "devil's wife" of Josef Von Sternberg. Her performance has nothing to do with "acting" in any conventional sense, but it's a hot, true star in full command of her material. But it's the only good thing about the movie, (it's so good to follow you this way; I doubt any other actress could do the same). The story is horribly lame melodrama, (the novel Pierre Louys was better), in which Dietrich's cupid Concha destroys the lives of two friends who played Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero with stiffness bordering on petrification. And for Von Sternberg, it is an ugly looking movie (maybe in line with its rather ugly subject). Bunuel, on the other hand, thought enough to remake it as "that obscure object of desire" with a greater emphasis on surrealist aspects that all, down to the cast of two different actresses in the same role. Neither film is the most beautiful hour of the director and while the Bunuel version may be a better film, it is Dietrich's performance that you remember.
