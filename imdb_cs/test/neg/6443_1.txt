My wife and I watched this abortion from its beginning. I hated it now, but my wife joined him for a few years. My wife was tired of it and we stopped watching. Occasionally I catch a clip or pass when channel surfing. There is always someone screaming at someone else or doing something terrible. There never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind. I always did it with me when we first saw it - no humor. It seems that writers have no idea of ​​drama - they seem to think that conflict is a drama, and that is of course only one element. Light and shadow are very needed and actors who can bring something to it. I'm sure Eastenders are competent, but they have nothing to do with them. It has to be the most depressing showbiz work. I don't understand why the British public watches and loves it. What does he say about our psyche? I have heard that it is said that it is "just like real life" - nothing like my life or the life of someone I know, or we would have to throw ourselves from tall buildings or public transport. The topics that they are dealing with are far from watching the family, but they are still being shown. I love series like Breaking Bad or The Wire, but I wouldn't expect to see them at 7.30 or 8.00 in the evening. The program is garbage and should be avoided at all costs.
