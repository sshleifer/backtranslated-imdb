Today, when we were President's Day, my wife and I had a DVD, "The Notebook", which was checked in at our local library. It's a movie released in 2004 that fell under our radar because we're big movie visitors. I am a published author with the hope of a screen playing my first book. I have noticed the links to "The Notebook" in reviews of other films, which is why I took the observation about us and provided a perfect opportunity this morning. We both really liked it. That made my wife scream; We could contact him with many other things with our own, ongoing love affair, and even fought back with asphyxiation. <br /> <br /> This afternoon, after a lot of work, working in the yard and eating, we decided to really catch the matinees. When we got to the theater when we saw most of the contemporary movies, we decided to see "Victoria Day", which for some reason wasn't in the theater, even though IMDb and my phone movies showed it to play. So instead we looked at the poster for "Dear John" and it was written by the same writer as "The Notebook", making it a clear choice because we enjoyed so much "TN". What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same credibility or empathy as "TN"; and we were still commenting on all the similarities - two dozen or so quickly - which made us realize that this film was nothing more than, as another reviewer noted, "a poor man's notebook!" It had a real 'cash cow' feeling, which means that Sparks simply tossed the story together, based on a precise 'TN' template to simply make a quick dollar. Not only that, after the bug-eyed appeared unlikely, "Dear John's-John" for a chimpanzee cancer patient, we ridiculed each film, drifting through a soapy silly line to the end. There were only 6 of us in the theater at this 4:45 pm, and my wife even told me to keep it so that I didn't destroy the others ... it was so bad. When we see it on the heels of "TN", we make sure that the similarities to the rip are vividly recognizable and the Sparks blatant, inexpensive attempt to template stencil is obvious. We wish to see "Victoria Day" instead ... no matter how bad it might have been after we saw this bad movie entry. And oh ... in the last 30 minutes, I've always said "... don't give the cow coins ... don't they give the cows coins?"
