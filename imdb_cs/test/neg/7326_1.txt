Again such kind of zero budget digital video camera garbage. and again I fell into this trap cuz title had a "zombie" in it (german title: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) story: on halloween some people visit "museum of the dead", it's a trap, crazy doctor wants to kill people, all associated with some aztec cult. So there they fight against some zombies. ultra inexpensive scenery: some black tape corridors. a couple of artsy drawings and a pair of skulls you can find in every store. No actors, little quality models that wake up with the sheer idea of ​​what to do. no effects. ridiculous make-up, your local hobby-make-up-zombie-fan will do it better, some time it looked as if they didn't have enough money for enough colors, otherwise they just couldn't do it that way, man, have to realize the look of their "zombies" . Some laughing martial arts fight with zombies, slow motion. only when the director wants it to scare, does he use a standard digital-video-camera effect where everything is flacking. incredible! 0 out of 10!
