I saw both the MST3K version and the full version. I rather enjoyed it. Either way, it wasn't so bad from the movie. Certainly he moved a bit. I liked it. <br /> <br /> As far as MST3K is concerned, they only made films for which they could acquire rights. Not all the films that tore where the bad movies were made were so easy. Take SoulTaker for example. The characters of Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar, where they are so lifeless and boring stupid, couldn't help but laugh. I couldn't take them seriously. It's really created a unique feeling though. Vivian Schilling did a great job with the script. Today's world is better than 95% of theaters in theaters. Her role played well. Not too screaming to be male but just like that. The camera really likes this movie. After I prepared the script, I'd throw it in this role. Anyway, this movie deserves a little more credit than it is. If you don't see the MST3K version, please see the uncontrolled version. It deserves it.
