Formula story with all the tired clich√©s. I was shocked that the terrible scenario became a movie! What a shame! How many ORIGINAL scripts are scattered without being created? <br /> <br /> At the top I could predict what would happen in every single shot. Oh, and I don't even understand about the idiotic sexual tension between a beautiful female cop and a paralyzed cop who barely moves a finger. YES, RIGHT. I can BUY THAT. What next? Fingers porn?
