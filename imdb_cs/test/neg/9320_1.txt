I don't know about you, but I go to horror movies to be afraid, and this was something other than scary, the film had several chances to be really scary and unhappy. Several of these allegedly tense moments have haunted some of the worst cg you will see this year, maybe a decade! I think that when I say that cg looks like a daytime television, I give a bad day to TV, I've seen better things on the sci-fi channel. Who am really sorry are the actors (that they have their names attached to this movie), did a good job, took care of most of the characters and felt that their performances were pretty good, but that wasn't enough to bring this movie out of the eaves. What is really fun is reusing some sets, if you have seen "exorcists: beginning", it will be easy to reveal the reuse of some buildings. However, what I thought was the worst on this movie, even over the cg problems, was the main demon, just as scary, its form, the way he spoke, was extremely weak. All in this movie was a terrible experience and I would go out of the theater if it wasn't for my wife to see the end.
