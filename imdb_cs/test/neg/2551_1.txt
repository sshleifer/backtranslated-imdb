In the dusty town of Furlough, Texas, the animal slaughters cattle and locals. When Teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo) is killed, their friends Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), her Mexican-American friend Miguel Gonzalez (Gabriel Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) discover that the Mexican werewolf is Killer And They Plan A Plan To Kill The Beast. "The Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is an amateur crap and I've seen, if not the worst, among the worse movies. Nothing works in this movie: the script is ridiculous, with some of the most horrible lines I've ever heard. The direction does not exist and the camera follows the "style" of the Blair Witch Project. Amateur acting seems to be a joke for high school or high school students. "Special effects" are terrible and extremely poor, and "werewolf" is the cheapest I have ever seen. Ed Wood's films are iconic, but this "Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is pure waste. Eventually, Jill says no man can resist her teats (actually the most beautiful thing in this movie). But I believe the right quote should be "no man (or woman) can resist watching this movie to the end". I was driven by my curiosity to see how bad a film could be and I lost 88 minutes of my life, but I believe most viewers will stop seeing with less than 20 minutes of running. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas" ("Mexican Werewolf in Texas")
