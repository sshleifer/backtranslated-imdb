Very bad film, a mixture of clich√©s and historical inaccuracies. A few examples: in the early scene the Soviet infantry is invaded by the Germans; instead of staying in the trenches to shoot at them, they advance to open ground and fight against them, unlike all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the central figures, is reportedly the daughter of White Russian and obsessed with her Russianness, but she does not speak Russian; a German aircraft attacked by an attack on an anti-aircraft gun - but the weapon does not fire shrapnel bullets, but hits a direct hit on its plane, which does not look like a German WWII plane. In righteousness, if they could escape the absurd conspiracy and the subsequent absurdities, there are some really powerful moments - the depiction of people who are slowly dying to death is convincingly done and moving, but they only show the rest. A film to be avoided.
