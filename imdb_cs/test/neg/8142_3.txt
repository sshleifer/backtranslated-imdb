The film is a pathetic attempt to remake Ingmar Bergman's "Autumn Sonata" (1978) starring Ingrid Bergman, Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson.It didn't take me more than 5 minutes to find out.

I feel sad when potential good filmmakers lose their talent by making non-standard divisions of Hollywood and European films. But you have to give something to the filmmaker. The film he chose for copying is one of Bergman's classics and easily one of the best examples of portraying a tense human relationship in European cinema.
