I love musicals, all from joyful Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the touching romantic "Damn Yankees." And I know that most songs sometimes sing them spontaneously, with the crowd or the buzzing themselves. <br /> <br /> In a "real" musical that differs from this vaudeville show, every song is carefully crafted to get the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation - a natural extension where mere words fail. Thus, in Guys and Dolls, "My Day Time" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Each song in this brilliant display of the genre sets the mood, or develops a character, creating fantasmagoria sites, turned utterly believable self revelation of the song's evocations. <br /> <br /> For this Broadway Musical lover and their adaptation to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and cruel amusement distortion of the genre house. There, songs of these musicals have advanced often complicated, often wonderful, plot lines. While here, the songs, simply picked up from the collection, they just clashed with the shaky premise of the film. Perhaps most of those viewers who make this film into monumental success simply have no exposure. an artistic form of a musical of the 20th century. They have no idea of ​​the magic that a writer and lyricist would have written that could turn a ballroom into someone we know and love, as it was done in "Sweet Charity." Allow me to offer you an apology for the arrogance of this review. Maybe the next day, another mood, I could have gotten into it, and I wasn't so critical in this review. But I can't help but imagine what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others could do with this stupid premise. I'm thinking about it, while the memories of seeing this movie are fresh and I can't help but grieve at the big loss.
