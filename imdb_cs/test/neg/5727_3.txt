I built a company that wanted this movie to remember Conan movies, but unfortunately for those who did it. You'll think, man Conan movies were pretty cool ... this one is totally boring and sucks. The story, who cares? It won't help you make this movie more or less because it looks like a really cheap movie. Arnold, he doesn't look like this, why he agreed to play a role outside of me. Well, probably for money. I love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. Lame! This movie is simply plain and just awful.
