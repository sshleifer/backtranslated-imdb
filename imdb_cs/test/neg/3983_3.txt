The beginning of this film questioned me that it would be a little more than the typical science fiction film B. But as he progressed, I became interested and I saw the whole thing. The assumption is interesting, original and has the prerequisites to create a classic. Unfortunately, instead of the average movie, it did in the usual factors that turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie (bad play, low budget, etc.). I wonder how it would be if they were reworked with good actors and a great Hollywood budget.
