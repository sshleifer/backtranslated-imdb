I don't know if this type of movie was so clich√© as it is now. <br /> <br /> Given how many "Bad News Bears" movies were released in 1980, I think this kind of movie was a tired idea. The former footballer is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair. Chicago Bears offers him a PR job, but he wants a coach. His underage nephew is also picked up for armed robbery. We were told that he was already arrested more than a decade ago and now has to serve some hard time ... which will be less than a year! Of course, a boy is actually a good guy who only needs a solid male model in his life. The same applies to all children in prison. Yes ... even the one who is locked up for attempted murder! I'm sure you already know what will happen, so I'll try to keep the rest of this brief article. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist becomes the coach of the kids soccer team. It overcomes the cynicism of the offenders and gains respect. His team stood up against a local high school team (yeah!) And kicked their asses. Now he decided it was more than ever to prove he's a good coach. Will these disadvantaged children with the heart of gold be able to improve enough to win the match? The terrible execution of football sequences waives any excitement in this movie. "Coach of the Year" should be punished for roughing my brain. 1/10
