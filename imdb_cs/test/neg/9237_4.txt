This has nothing to do with one absolutely fantastic first movie. And of course, the Americans have to make everything into English, because the person with the headlines is SOOOOO Hard isn't it! From what I saw in new trailers with a cute now pregnant Jessica Alba (well that surely destroys all the teenage fantasy boys everywhere isn't it!) It looks exactly the same but probably w / double the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror / tension / mystery flicks I've seen in every language for quite a while. I would recommend observing the one and skipping all this together, there is no reason to look at it, because there is no reason why it would even be called "Eye 2", except for the perfection that was the first film. Do yourself a favor to watch "The Eye" with volume up and get ready for some likely jumping. I watched it with headphones and was pleasantly surprised by the perfection that was toward the Pang brothers. If "The Eye" remake does well, I hope it does because of Pang Brothers' career, but at the same time it seems a pity that people will not / cannot see the original, because very often / almost always the remake is not as good as the original. Watch this if you want to be a little bit boring movie, but the original is not compared to this sequel in just a flick title.
