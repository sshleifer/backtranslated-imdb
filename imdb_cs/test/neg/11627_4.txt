Mickey Rourke enjoys the renaissance ... and fair play for him. I always liked his painting and his acting skills in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you're going to have with Rourke - average, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it. <br /> <br /> First of all - it doesn't make any sense. Rourke is a stunned IRA killer who flees Ireland to London after killing schoolchildren. He's on the run from the police and his own army comrades. He also promised he would never kill again. Looks like it finally made a bus full of kids for him. But when he gets to London, he's being watched by a local gangster (Bates - he looked like his eyebrows and his hair came straight down). Burton's manikin killed his main competitor for Â£ 50,000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do this, but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses to him a crime in the confessional to close the priest's mouth. He says it's better than killing him. <br /> <br /> There are many things that just don't add up: 1. Why choose Rourke from your contest? As you can see on the scene where an employee is pinned to the wall by a couple of heavens with what looks like a set - these London guys are just as hard to kill themselves. 2. Not only that, but the gangster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness his own eyes killing. Why didn't this guy just kill a competitor and save all the troubles with Rourke? 3. Hoskins sees murder and the police let him go - without protection, can I add - accept the confession? In any case. 4. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to the place where he murdered) immediately after the crime takes place to confess. Why do the cops check the place? 5. Rourke hangs around the church, especially Hoskin's blind niece, a few days later without being harassed. What? Is he on the run and remains in the place where he committed another murder? Stupid. 6. The police actually meet Rourke in the church, where they "consolidate" the organ and have no idea who it is. Don't they know he's on the run to bomb a school bus? Don't even look at him? 7. Why does Rourke kill you and then tell him to wait for a few days to get to the ship? You think you want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? 8. Why does Bates's brother suddenly decide to rape a blind niece in the middle of all the waiting? Could he not stay for a few days? At least until Rourke is safely offended by states? Ridiculous. 9. Rourke suddenly has internal confusion after all his killing years and victory over a blind niece immediately - even if he knows he's a murderer, still loves him? Again - absolutely ridiculous. And besides, in "love" with him in record time - a few days !!!! 10. The whole bomb thing in the end is just stupid from the perspective of Bates. 11. Things happen in parts of this movie that don't make sense, or they're just there to help the storyline (and I say it jokingly). Bates' houses at Rourke until the ship is ready to sail, and Rourke suddenly displays a moral elevation to respect the bitch in the house - but still a blind girl. 12. Rourke asks a follower on the ship where Bates is - and the follower practically rips out his boss's movements in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy was telling Rourke much more than he'd asked. 13. Hoskin's priest is a former army guy and we see him defeating three followers behind the pub. A totally unwanted scene and another scene that is important to them. I will stop there in an unfortunate place 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so fake red that it is ridiculous), his accent (to be fair) sometimes not too bad, but worsening at barely audible murmurs at other times), his clothes, walking, staring into the sky, etc. I will not mention the music and the style of jerky style. Oooppps - I just mentioned them. Overall, the film's catastrophe with some obvious face-off religious ideas (Rourke on the Cross, preaching from the pulpit) that would plague a first-year student, star and director. <br/> <br/> 4/10.
