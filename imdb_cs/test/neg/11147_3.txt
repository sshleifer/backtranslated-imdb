The story is shrinking to Ah-nulda over Satan, and I remember most of the explosions, gunfire, blood, noise on the film and let's not forget the flaming Satanic urine. The story is nonsensical, absolutely predictable, and I couldn't take the holes full of seriousness. Stay with "Rosemary's Baby" or "The Exorcist" if you want to see a really good diabolical film and ... um, well, I can't think of any good "action" movies at the moment (probably because they're so far-and-away) -some-between) so you're on your own in this category. This movie gets me 3 out of 10 ratings for its camp value and quite good performance by Gabriel Byrn as the old Debbil Satan!
