We all know that the world is full of risky horror movies. Some of them can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, terrible effects and iffy dialogue. But the Raptor, who could be in the same league as the same nonsensical Carnosaur series, is not even trying to be happy with it. It's so badly done, it's really unbearable, even if you're just watching with the intentions of having no brain at home. Where do we start? Well ... the sets are pretty drab. My old dramatic group has created a more realistic phase. Genetic labs seem to be from the university, and it looks equally incredible on the outside (Even to cover why you would be close to civilization where people can easily hear the roar of dinosaurs), while department doctors just don't make it look plausible. More in the list of complaints are the effects of creation; What can I say? Absolutely pitiful. I also think it's worth mentioning, women's breasts should be mentioned as an effect. Both of the main female characters were apparently boob-working, bringing the characters down, with one woman being a respected member of the police while the other being a sweet, "innocent" daughter of the sheriff's cities. But negotiations are by far the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts may be excused for having at least a little bit of his role. This is where it ends. Corbin Benson was supposed to kill his costume designer to make his lackluster performance look even more pathetic, while the feminine leadership looks so bored (even if you could let go of that movie). Another character to draw attention to is the daughter who lets her breasts do everything that happens in the "exciting" sex scene (Ten minutes of endless re-run shots of her bouncing on top of some bloke). <br /> <br /> All in all and summarized as one. Don't bother, just don't.
