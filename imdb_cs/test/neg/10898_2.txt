I've never done it before, but this movie was so bad that I had to say something about it. I'm for independent filmmaking, because last year saw the worst (in my opinion) Hollywood shows, the mainstream seems to have lost contact with what makes good movies. The fact that they are films like this really give a bad reputation to an independent film. The characters are boring and stupid to empathize with them. The direction is terrible, the rendering is terrible, the plot is horrible, stay away, far. Only one short scene with female nude breasts, not even worth a second look. <br /> <br /> The most frightening thing about this movie is that it will sometimes have to watch again. I gave it 2 and not 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - earning one point for each of these qualities.
