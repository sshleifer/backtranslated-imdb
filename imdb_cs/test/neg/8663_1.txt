I agree with some of you that this movie was somewhat boring and boring. I have found that I do not like the main character and the following actors / actresses who came to the scene. Working with the camera itself was not pleasant. Random pictures and shaky movie scenes made me angry and I turned off the movie. I will make up my time watching the adaptation in 1999 and hope it fits together with sense and feeling; Emma; Being Jane; and pride and prejudice. In addition to these films, I just watched a few others, but I believe they were done in great taste. The music was a bit out of place with a movie reminiscent of another show I saw this year. It was called the Hex and Show from the BBC. I once found it on the web. I liked the first season, but the second season was dry and pulling things out of the air that should stay with the clouds. I found the main male character who was Henry in this movie out of place. Perhaps I don't like his way of speaking or his character. Well, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone if they didn't want to silence it and want to look at the fashion of that time, or the way the houses were held at that time. Once again I will look at the 1999 version and hope it is better and Jane Jane Austen's justice to her writing.
