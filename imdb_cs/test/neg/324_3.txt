In Halloween, three friends are looking for an ancient cemetery in the suburbs for fun and remove the cross from the tomb where Jack-O was buried many years ago by farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unleashed, kills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family for revenge. Cheesy "Jack-O" is a combination of a terrible story with terrible action. I was curious about the name John Carradine in credits and I can't imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive records in such a bad movie, which shows a complete lack of respect for the name of this great actor. It is impressive how bad it is to play, moving the film to comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. This is a type of movie that is good to see with a group of friends, drink beer, make comments and laugh a lot. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-on-Demon Halloween to" ("Jack-on-Demon Halloween")
