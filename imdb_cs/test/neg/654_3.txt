Okay, this movie starts and it looks like it's a cute comedy about a totally obsessed soap opera fan. She has no contact with reality at all outside the soap (a kind of main character inversion in "Pleasantville") and runs to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. It's a nice movie ... but at the same time it's also a dark, very violent two-hit movie to kill Betty for reasons of difficulty depicting. Either plotline would be enough for his own, but "sister Betty" contains both stories at once, and the effect is very annoying. I really enjoyed it.
