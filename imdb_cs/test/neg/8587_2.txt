This noisy, dizzying football movie by Oliver Stone seems to have everyone cast - well, except for William H. Macy, who could deal with Mr. Stone's role, team doctors or "fruit cakes" selling cereals. . If you are a fan of bad mouths, there are some great fake phrases that are laid out on a brawl, dragging, dragging, unloading phrases that you can try out on two-man friends and travel lovers. The film is sometimes good as a live party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; even includes some MTV-style music scenes. <br /> <br /> ** Any Sunday (12/16/99) Oliver Stone ~ Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid
