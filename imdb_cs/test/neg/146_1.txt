An exceptionally dumb braindead action player leads in a story that suits Spiderman's filler release. Action sequences never escape as they should, so some cool pieces are abandoned in the sea of ​​sound and fury, which means nothing. I was really wondering how they would release this in the West. Sam Lee is crazy, newcomer Edison Chan doesn't show any talent. The robot is clumsy and not too impressive, and the effects of CGI (even if American sfx-people are doing it) are ridiculous, totally destroying any remaining suspension of infidelity. I am not looking forward to Gen-Z Cops ...
