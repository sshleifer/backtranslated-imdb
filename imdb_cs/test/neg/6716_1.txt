Mr. Seagal has even lowered his (already low) standards and has now surpassed himself in making bad films. The alien has no thing in the script. He is a director who has done even worse work and music and score are so hot and bad that you don't know whether to laugh or cry. You want to turn it off for 10 minutes in the movie. However, due to Steven Seagal's past films, you think "Hey, there might be some great action sequences worth at least watching ..." ... you're WRONG! It's just getting worse as the movie progresses. It seems that everyone (with a few exceptions) kills all the people they talk to, good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about the movie is that it is over and has a relatively short run time. Film addition up two words: STAY AWAY!
