I am also an SF enthusiast, among other genres, and especially as those films from the 60s and 70s with their "effects ideas" that have created so many intelligent and sympathetic stories on the screen. In short, I totally agree with the scott-886 rating of this movie. I've heard about this movie, and what I mentioned earlier, the 60th and 70th anniversary of SF buff, with a penchant for SF stories with the touch of "Twilight Zone", I expected a lot and my expectations were strengthened by reviews of the effects of this movie "second best "Kubrick's" 2001 Space Odyssey ". What a scam. "Journey to the Other Side of the Sun" was an ordinary, intricate, half-baked, silly-looking movie, with ridiculous amateur special effects (and I remember I love movies of that time and despise CGI), and that can be fully compared to the more with the 60 SF disaster, such as "Marooned", which "Journey" reminded me very much. The idea behind all this is not so bad, but the conspiracy of the story of a double planet on Earth, on which the same world is turned, has asked the commander, like Kubrick, to drive. Needles say that Robert Parish is nothing like that, so he released a boring and stupid movie that looked and felt like a matinee television series of those days. It's not worth wasting time, even if you're an absolute fan of the genre.
