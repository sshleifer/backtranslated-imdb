This movie is a good companion to Blair Witch because it makes it so bad that BW did it right. Like BW, this one pretends to be a documentary of haunted events where each team member controls his own camera. Nevertheless, there is never a sense of reality there. Participants are poorly written clichés characters and events that take place are just as cliché (cat jumping out of the closet, falling chandelier, etc.). Also a moving dialogue and awkward work of excessively attractive cast reflects the dock feeling. And the worst of all is that supposedly participating cameras are recording too many events too perfectly to be remotely believable. Actually, with some re-editing, this thing could be Blair Witch parody. In fact, there is a scene in which a blonde historian is eating a sandwich with a huge roach on it that is actually quite funny as it is, reminiscent of a similar rough scene from "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me." Eventually, however, the action takes place straight, without a punchline. It's hard to tell what was the intention with The St Francisville Experiment other than a glom pair of stray BW bucks. But it is quite sad that the only real interest I could find in it was whether a blonde historian would have a tied belly shirt tied in a shot.
