You may think it would be an interesting show about regular teens with a superpower, but it's far from it. For example, consider the concept: the main character has a great secret to hide from his colleagues. It's like Hannah Montana and To So Raven. Furthermore, the negotiation is only moderate. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep in many scenes. Finally, jokes are either clich√© or boring. If they are not used, they are colorful but a special dialogue to make us "laugh" are throwing different props around the room. I really wish this exhibition to use more original and entertaining material. In conclusion, the Wisards of Waverly Place is disappointing.
