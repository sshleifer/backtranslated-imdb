This is the worst movie in the world. The only reason I gave him 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in "is it for real"? way. it was so cheesy and low budget ... they shouldn't even bother. there was nudity and violence for the pure cause of having nakedness and violence, and the effects were just so bad you wouldn't believe it (get ketchup like blood, and cabbage for separate heads). do not rent it !!
