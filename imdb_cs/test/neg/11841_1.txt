So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and the silver lining was that the SciFi Channel had a dinosaur marathon movies that day - "Carnosaur" trilogy, "Pterodactyl," "Raptor Island." Then I flicked forward on my remote control to find out which SciFi movie he placed in his charming, Saturday premiere slot. Some movie I never heard of was called "Raptor". I was quite excited. The film starts with some juveniles riding in a jeep as they chase and kill the Velociraptor. I was like, "Hmmm, it's strange that it looks almost exactly like the scene in" Carnosaur, "except being in the middle of that movie." Then I sat in some really bad acting and then a guy was pulled into the corridor to an underground research lab where he was eaten by a furious T-Rex. Now I'm glad, "Wait a minute, it was also a scene in" Carnosaur. "Then, when I saw some scenes that" Carnosaur 2 "shamelessly tore, I figured out what the hell was going on. Roger Corman & Co. tore the scenes from the" Carnosaur "trilogy to use as action scenes woven in The basic "dinosaur-running-amok" plot, and tried to pass it on as an original movie. I don't know who I'm upset with, Roger Corman or SciFi Channel for trying to pass it on as worthy of time. it was worth watching, it was to select the actors / actresses who looked like their counterparts in the "Carnosaur" trilogy and argued which scenes would go on, just as I was worried about being a dinosaur lover, I had no choice but to give the lowest possible evaluation because I feel totally ripped off.
