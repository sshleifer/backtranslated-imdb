I've been watching a lot of Asian horror movies lately, but this has to be the worst yet. It started interesting enough, but lost momentum after the first 15 minutes of the film. The added "dramatic" scenes, flashback sequences and serious plot holes let me hang. What actually happened in the tunnel? Just "something terrible" ??? Who started killing everything if it wasn't a ghost? What did she want to return to her ????? No answers! Overall, it's not very scary at all and filmmakers need to come up with much better ideas than this one ... <br /> <br /> One positive was a cute actress but that's about it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
