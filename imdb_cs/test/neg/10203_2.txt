Hulk Hogan and Zeus are terrible wrestlers and terrible actors. For some reason Hogan was popular enough to get a film deal that I never know why. If McMahon's money is not for the vince, this silly movie would never have been done. Maybe one day someone will make a good film about wrestling. No Holds Barred is not the movie.
