This film has a college project feeling that wants to make a blair witch project meets the saw theme. But it is not successful. Cinematography is poor and acting more. Characters, in my opinion, do not look credible at all. In fact, editing a movie doesn't work as intended. There are a lot of bad effects that I believe are put there to try to add a horrible effect. But it just gives me a sense of indifference. I'd like to stay away from this movie if you're not a devoted movie enthusiast who likes to watch "different" and indie "horror" movies. However, I believe that this film is not worth watching for the average person. You will not have any pleasure from the bad effects, and the handycam feel that this film gives to its viewers.
