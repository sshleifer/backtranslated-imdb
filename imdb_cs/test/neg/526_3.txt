Finally, I bought a DVD copy of this production and I was curious because I read so many people who praised it for the sky, especially the portrait of Angela Lansbury Mrs. Lovett. I saw a Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it was up and too bloody; Fortunately, this version is not so frightening bloody, but it suffers dramatically in too many other ways to be the least satisfying for me. <br /> <br /> To start, casting. George Hearn is adequate and at least shows some expression (unlike John Depp's endless wooden face in the movie). Angela Lansbury is, just plain unpleasant. At least she has enough strength in her voice to contrast Helen Bonham's Carter and the bland girl's voice, but subtlety seems just a word in Mrs. Lansbury's vocabulary. One cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main heroes spends his whole time thinking and blinking in "look, mom, I play!" fashion and is too aware of the audience. This is not something that is typical of stage productions, Heaven knows - I have regularly participated in many productions at Stratford Festial for many years and theater actors act in principle in this way (at least those who want to continue to find regular jobs are not!) .. . Betsy Joslyn. Oh, dear, oh dear. He noticed, besides me, that he could not sing this role even vaguely? And her playing daughter, George Hearn, is just scary, given that she was married to him at the time. Shouldn't she be sweet sixteen? Yes, I realize that this is what it is, but not once convinced me that there is any younger than about thirty-five, and the phrase "mutton dressed as lamb" seems to have been created just for her. Her cutting of "Green Finch and Linnet Bird" has crushed my teeth and was ready to shut down the DVD player at once. The song was so good in Tom Burton's movie and it was a sad shock. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960s and the purity of the voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano. Any vibrato kills him at all, and Mrs. Joslyn spent all her time fighting so hard that I thought she was about to fall off the ladder because she was so shaking about trying to keep the coloratura notes in a voice that is at best mezzo. Let's go through the show that it vibrates at least a quarter tone on at least three higher notes ... This is just not a coloratura role and maybe a demanding director might tell her - but the fact that she was married to a star may have tied the director's hands. Cris Groenendaal was adequate but apparently too old for the role again, and there is no chemistry between him and Mrs. Joslyn. the whole subplot is completely flat. I remind me of a bit of the past stages of Wagner's Ring series, where, given the vocal strength the singers need to switch to the sound of a full-fledged Wagner orchestra, they would have to build on the ability to penetrate loudly, unlike any appearance. or the acting ability or even a good voice, which is why you have a caricature of the massive Viking-horned Brunehilde with a triple chin and beard, where the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty that is eternally young and charming. The cast of "youthful" leaders is exactly that - if you close your eyes, you can almost believe in Anthony Mr. Groenendaal, but once you look at the screen, the illusion is broken. (And in no time can you ever believe in Johann ...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because three of the four main characters were so obviously wrong. I can't give a proper overview of something else, because it was so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can't understand why people are arguing about this badly filmed and self-confident shooting of the stage theater. Surely there is more camera work in the theater than just throwing the camera down in the front row? If I want to, I will go for a decent game, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where at least they work together to produce and do not stop for the camera. I only give it to three stars because the quality of production, apart from the antiquities of Lansbury and Joslyn, seems adequate, if not spectacular. Probably the best thing is when you buy a movie soundtrack and cast a recording of this game, and then join the two to make a bearable whole. That's what I'm going to do, and I'm trying to forget that I bothered to rent this totally unusual production.
