I bought this Chuck Norris DVD knowing it was one of his earliest movies and it shows. We all know that he will never win an Oscar for his acting performance, but that's not what we're watching. Although there have been several earthquakes in California since this film was made, there has never been any desert or hills between Hwy.99 and I 5. Billy was probably crossing from 99 to 5 along 120, a distance of less than 15 miles. I wish the writers, producers and directors of these films would at least look at the map. As a truck driver spending a lot of time in California, I could say right from the start that geography was bad. But there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. Grab your Doritos and adult drink and enjoy your trip back in time.
