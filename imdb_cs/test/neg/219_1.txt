This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The cast was fantastic, but the film itself was terrible. It was so bad, I had to register to say how bad it was. I watched this movie and wanted to break it every minute I watched. It could have been great. He had a great presumption. If you rob an armored car, and there is a homeless person who sees you, you have to do what you have to do. To make the main character decide to kill a cop and kill his friends and co-workers after the homeless is dead, it's just ridiculous. And yes, I'm sure there will be answers to how his consciousness got to him, but come on. The main character climbed from the bottom of the armored car, nobody saw him. He threw money into the air and caught the cop behind the other guards and no one saw him. He was able to return to the armored car and no one saw him ... This film had the potential, but fired it. <br /> <br /> You couldn't pay me to watch this movie again! DO NOT USE! Aggravating...
