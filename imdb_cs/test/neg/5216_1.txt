This is another of those fundamentalist Christian films that hit you over with religion like a hammer. You know you're in trouble when setting up a story is ridiculous. Three men fly to Mexico to deliver the Bible. It makes no sense because the Church is Protestant and most of the Mexicans are Catholic. The Protestant and Catholic scriptures are not the same. The Catholic Bible has books in it that are not in the Protestant Bible. It is also difficult for me to believe that churches in Mexico will not spread the Bible to them. I understand if they went to a place where Christianity is a minority. But Mexico is far away. If you can't believe the story setting, then not the rest of the story. A film about religion can be fun, but not this movie.
