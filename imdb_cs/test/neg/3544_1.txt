Watching this movie, you'll notice the kitschy features of a standard TV movie ... though the story changes over the picture (if you're brave enough to say that the movie has a plot), they are by book and non-original ... and with every other KEPT GETTING WORSE! Candace Cameron Bure, well known for her role as DJ Tanner on the hit series Full House, is not very convincing as twenty things we like. avenge Possesers Death. I believe he's a great actress .... he just isn't in the thriller range. Shooting was tricky, and as I said the plot conspiracy ... even though I watched it, I knew I was in automatic mode. cheese, I had no idea how much worse the movie could get ... <br /> <br /> I don't really recommend this movie ... unless you know that filming and bad writing is what you're looking for
