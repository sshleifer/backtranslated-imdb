Ealing comedies represent their own specific sub-genre in film history. They were wise, droll reflections on British life in the late forties and early fifties. They are always fun, but I feel it is misleading to characterize them as comedies. They are fresh and good humor, rather than laughing-loud funny. However, the best of them is laced with an undervalued satire and shot by an occasional dark stripe (especially Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers). I'm affectionate to all of them, but Lavender Hill Mob is probably the one I have the most trouble with. In comparison to others it seems to be somewhat perfunctory. For me, this is a sketch of a movie, but one that needed to spend much more time in development than he was ready to go in front of the cameras. Everything on it is a bit unfinished. For example, no one has any real context or background. Henry is simply an obedient drunk whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions are not recognized, while Albert is a frustrated artist who is forced to prostitute his talent by making a gift shop for life. This creates a motive for their crime, but nothing that happens subsequently is the result of either their characters or their plan. More characters are introduced, but they don't play any real role in the story. Elderly residents at Henry's Guesthouse could (with love for detective stories) be a staunch thorn in his side, but used only as a background for "color." Similarly, various police officers who get in and out of action are simply there to keep the chart in place. As a result, the film is driven solely by its conspiratorial graphics devices that find both frustrating and weakly irritating. The failed robbery is carried out with minimal problems, although Albert is prevented from doing his part (Sidney Tafler's Clayton). Gold is then smuggled into France without an accident. Everything would go smoothly if it wasn't because of a lesser hitch that was layly based on the French pronunciation of the letter "R", resulting in six gold Eiffel towers being accidentally sold to some English schoolgirls. This leads to a series of frantic persecutions, as Henry and Albert are looking for. These scenes are well done, but at every point the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of schoolgirls by a series of totally factual accidents. It is as if God has intentionally intervened to give them hard times. This type of drawing always grinds my teeth. When they finally track down the last Eiffel Tower to a police academy show and pull it out of the police inspector John Gregson's nose (why it's there, all the plots of plot logic are abandoned. to the framing device he started painting with. <br /> <br /> The film doesn't bother to tell us the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway), Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). <br /> <br /> This brilliant little caper has had the professionalism of the Ealing team, so he is far from a bad movie. I think most viewers will find it more enjoyable than I do (and why shouldn't they?), But I can't help thinking that there was a much better film waiting to be done if more time and effort was spent on the body. both characters and story. <br /> <br /> According to the standards set by Ealing, Lavender Mountain Mob is a missed opportunity. PS: One interesting footnote is that Audrey Hepburn gets credit for her single line early, but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution. I think she had a better agent.
