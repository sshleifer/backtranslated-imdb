This film seems to reflect the current trend of globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are increasingly associating with large conglomerates (American producer, Mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying valuable experts to help them "perfect wine" - and as a result, wines are becoming very standard and predictable. For some, this is a good thing (especially since few can afford to pay $ 50 or more for everyday wine) and it is terrible for others because the uniqueness of smaller wineries disappears. I can really understand the concerns of both sides and I don't think there's a villain or a hero in this business. Sure, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but just like what happened to beer (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European shopping centers are almost indistinguishable from American) and mega- shops (like Walmart / Asda) take away much of the "little boys" uniqueness. I was definitely ready and willing to listen to these filmmakers. However, with a product that is almost two and a half hours long A general lack of focus, the movie just became too big a chore to watch and I lost interest. The 80-90-minute film would be much more effective - especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile (a high-eyed word for a "wine lover"). At the very end, the positive aspect is that filmmakers are smart to not talk at all - and let those who are on both sides talk. In addition, the theme is so important and timely. However, despite choosing a good style of making documentaries, the movie simply goes the way, way, too long and ended up making a very boring movie.
