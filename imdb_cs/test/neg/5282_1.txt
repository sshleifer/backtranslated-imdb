First, I am upset that there is no "0" option out of 10. <br /> <br /> I was bored tonight, and when I was going through the channels, I see Dr. Chopper. With nothing else, I decide to watch it and expect it to be just another crappy horror, with a similar plot to Cabin Fever. The man was wrong ... Dr. Chopper made Cabin Fever appear to have won numerous Academy Awards. I can remind you that Cabin Fever includes a scene of a little boy who makes a carousel, launches a porch, screams, "pancakes !!", characters who leave their dying friend in a small hut to bleed to death, and Shawn of Boy Meets World mistakenly fingering a hole in the thigh of a girl. Needless to say, Dr. Chopper was a big, smelly pile. It wasn't even funny crap. It reminded me of the horror I had to make in grade 8, called "The Campout." Except that "The Campout" had a better script (we wrote it about an hour before filming), better actors, conspiracy, bloody scenes and working with the camera. I was hoping to get some laughter out of a badly made horror movie, but instead I could only watch in wonder as I thought, "Was it from the 8th grader?" The acting was terrible, the events and the various little fights were thrown together and made no sense and gore and violence were very minimal. I liked how it was from a small stab wound, people died instantly, and the only weapons the murderers had were small pocket knives ... if you make a horror movie, at least the killer will kill the device. Also, what the hell was that was what the girls did, that they promised their promises? A good way to bring some scenes of girls running around in bras, even if they have no relation to the story. And I have to say that my favorite line was when a blonde says Dr. Chopper, "I'd like to introduce you to someone .... my inner bitch." Her "female bitch" then continues to catch the garbage, throw it at Dr. Chopper, miss it and return to the horror of the killer. , but I felt I needed to express my feelings about how awful this "movie" was. I know that everyone has their own opinions, but if someone rated this movie higher than 2, they should be shot in hell ... <br /> <br /> ... seriously.
