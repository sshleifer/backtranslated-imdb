After just watching Acacia I find out that I have to agree with negative reviews here. I like Asian and Korean horror, and I had great expectations about this film. I was disappointed. As I watched, I was still thinking that they would definitely do it to catch me guards later, and for a moment I expected something genius to happen. However, I slowly realized that the film was so bad. It's the cheapest cash for the Asian horror market I've seen so far. The basic story may not be so bad, but the way it is shot looks like the most ridiculous plot ever. A tree as a "scary" device can be fine if used smart, but all the filmmakers give us different shots ... yes, tree, over and over. It seems he hopes the tree will do everything for him in terms of tension and growth, but it just looks like what it is: tree shots. For good! Slow compilation can be very effective, and a movie that only gives the viewer a few insights into what's wrong can bring good fear, but not Acacia. Sure, we will see a child on a tricycle disappearing around the corner, and again, meaningful shots of a tree from above or below, or from the side, but these scenes are simply not scary. They feel stupid, especially because you realize that the director is scaring them. They just aren't. In addition, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous. Especially "descent into the madness" of one character is ridiculous. But what Acacia really breaks is terrible editing. It's hard to see why the scenes were cut as they are, but it's bad and kills all the sparks they might have. I also feel sponsored because I see what they want to do with it, but I can't believe they think I'd fall for such cheap tricks. There are plenty of great Asian movie spirits and a lot of bad ones, but that's by far the worst thing I've ever seen. They had to go through the "what to put in the ghost movies" list and check them out all but they forgot to add a real movie.
