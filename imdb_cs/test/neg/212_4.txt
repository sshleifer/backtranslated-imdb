A really disappointed film of robbery, I was actually expecting to get pretty cool cats and mice into the movie, and that's just a few of those cats and mice, but it was pretty stupid. And it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer, in fact, when you saw the trailer to it, you basically saw the whole movie cause it to be just predictable. So basically, the conspiracy is about a few workers of armored trucks trying to steal $ 42 million that are supposed to be transported until one of the members gets a conscience. I thought the movie would be better if it was cast by famous actors, but I was wrong. I think it's not necessarily a bad movie, but it just wasn't that good, nor has it any depth. This is definitely a rental at best, just not worth seeing in theaters. robbery <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
