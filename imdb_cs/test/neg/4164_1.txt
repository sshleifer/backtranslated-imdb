The film disappointed me for a number of reasons: the image of the future, which seemed to me to be the first to be realistic, was well built, but only marginal. The story itself was a weak copy of Lost in Translation. Middle Eastern, a man with a family meets a new girl overseas, karaoke bar, camera movement and image - all very badly mimicking the excellent Lost in Translation that also had credibility. This film is trying to be something brilliant and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Tim Robbins even thought about doing this movie!? The main female actress is terrible - has she played prejudice in the Minority Report? And why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? Lost in translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes. R-Namely? This movie is not even worth watching from the videostore!
