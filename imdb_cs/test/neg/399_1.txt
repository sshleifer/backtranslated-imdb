I was amused when I found out that some of the reviews were finished here ** SPOILERS ** The joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that is not dealt on the back of the box is dealt in the title. Maybe I'm just a dense 17-year-old American woman who wouldn't know the art of biting my leg, but I prefer films that have at least some words. This film is the second half of 2001: Space Odyssey on the right. This film is so slow that it's not even art, it's just boring. We watch this scary guy who follows this boy around Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of the book. The film should not make a link to the book, it should be able to stand alone. This film has no way to stand up. They have no bones to conspire to lean on.
