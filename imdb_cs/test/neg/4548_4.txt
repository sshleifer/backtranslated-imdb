The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to make the movie a thrill fan. And once you see the cover picture of this frozen zombie movie coming out of their cryogenic chamber, you'll think you're in the sky of a B-movie. At least that's how I approached this movie. But boy, I was in shock <br /> <br /> I love horror movies. I also like B-movies. Nothing makes me more than just a nasty little movie about zombies, monsters, murderers, kind of stuff. But to say that this film is missing is underestimation. This film was pure waste. Do you think the zombie would look something like what is displayed on the box, but instead get actors with masks that are clearly sold on any Halloween display counter. What's more, the script is excited. Our main character, Joseph, suffers from the loss of his wife and son and seeks comfort in the heartfelt Mary, played by Blair. You will never see any signs of sadness or discomfort on the part of Josep's character. Instead, we see the head of cryogenic laboratories, a man named Dr. Miller, eager to get dead bodies and experiment with their organs. There are no emotions or anything to convince you that you should give a damn about anyone in this movie. There were all the elements to make a great horror movie. You had your zombies, your decent actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and little, if any sense of direction, this took the royal. Total 4 of 10
