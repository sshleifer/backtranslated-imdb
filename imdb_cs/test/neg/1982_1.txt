When The Spirits Within was released, all you heard from Final Fantasy fans was how horrible the movie was because it didn't look like Final Fantasy. This is another story for better or worse. Famous settings, characters, music, story and top action scenes should inspire fans of the original game. The problem is that it's just not a good movie in its own right. <br /> <br /> Direction during combat scenes is often sloppy, camera switching angles ridiculously fast in an effort to make actions seem frenetic, but only to make scenes look messy and confusing. CG itself is exceptional, but I can't say it's the best I've ever seen from Spirits Within. characters, though I have to admit that the Advent characters moved much more naturally. <br /> <br /> There's a black hole on the property. It is a huge deus ex machina intended solely for Sephiroth to return to the final battle. The old characters reappear, but they serve no purpose other than the pleasure of the fans. The development of the character does not exist, and the film does nothing to solve any of the conspiracies that remained after the end of the game. But it's full of neat combat scenes with magic, summons, and limit breaks, which is probably what fans want the same way. Finally, Advent children are very opulent but totally thoughtless. which serves more as a side story for Final Fantasy VII than for a real sequel. By the way, do not think you would hurt my feelings by voting useless. I feel superior to knowing that fanboys / fangirls hate my objectivity.
