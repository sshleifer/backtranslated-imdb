For the first time in the film review, I was immediately out of interest in this story. I don't know if it was the way it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but he felt unreal, exaggerated and totally unoriginal. In the first thirty minutes I found myself more apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt like I had seen this structure before, and Tart wasn't surprised by anything new. After I thought it might be just my mood, I stopped the movie and in the morning I decided it would be fresh, but the same feeling persisted. I just didn't care. This is not a good sign. The characters were bland. When I say lightly, it literally means you will never feel like watching them. The story seemed to be recycled, almost to plagiarism. Now I'm not saying Christina Wayne stole this story, but she didn't add anything new to the perspective. The cast was terrible, the basic symbolism and motifs were lost so far that no critic could find them (nor characters) and the stories were vague and careless. You didn't know anything about anyone or anything, and instead of putting more emphasis on the characters, instead of having drugs, less sex, and money that got in the face. These are the topics we've seen in every film since the dawn of film time, but in some way Wayne couldn't be captured creatively. What immediately turned me away from this story? They were mainly characters. I saw most of Ren Ren's work and honestly needs to redefine myself. Director Larry Clark defined it and cannot strangely get out of this stereotypical character. During the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen I was bored. I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was spectacular or impressive, just repetitive. He needed to bring some excitement or tension to his role, instead of just blandly playing this random socialite. The final climax of this film is without a distinctive character instead of a drop. Renfro has not shown the best of his skills in this film. While I'm on this subject? no one showed the best of his abilities. What happens to Dominique Swain, outside Lolita, I don't believe she really appeared as an actress, and subsequent roles like Cat Storm won't help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress I witnessed to try to bring something remarkable on the screen, unfortunately, because of the horrible behavior of everyone else, it was lost. At that moment I come here and there, and frankly almost forgotten during the second act. Melanie Griffith was a pointless cast, and most of the film's budget probably went to her two scenes she was in. Maybe the rest of it went to a random guy from The Kids in the hall, who desperately needs to be away from this place. My biggest problem, besides playing, was the stimulation of this movie. Nothing, and that is hard for me to say, but nothing has happened. In the course of the film there were so many sub-stories that no real substance was created. Dandruff, teenage "anxiety and fear", wealthy socialists who learn how terrible real life is, random kids in the hall, and even that end felt hurried and terribly groomed. With this awkward craft, the story has never been created. Family structures have never been defined, characters have never received any emotions and all we have is pieces and pieces of sincere remnants. Wayne did not finish the task at hand. Although I hate the director for the whole load, I stayed with this film with a small choice. With a horrible title that just cried out the complete opposite of what this movie was about, with amateur directional ability, it was often able to put all the emotions in every scene, leaving us with disgusting action and bad development and with a vague story to put "good" behind Tart. This was a movie I never heard of, and after the show I see why. Everything Wayne did with this movie is a random excerpt from other movies that have done a better job of defining all the above elements and editing them together to make the Tart movie. It's hard to tell me, but Wayne destroyed this movie. Even though I don't think that the story could be fully taken, all the remaining elements of excitement were exhausted when Wayne took the helm. While most of the time you can attribute some of the story, maybe a strong acting, or even music, you can't attribute anything to Tartu. From the opening sequence to the end, I felt like I was swimming in a very lumpy oatmeal. No consistency, no power. Overall, this film is a waste of time. If you're looking for some deep symbolic elements or maybe some joke at our company, you won't find it in this movie. While I know it was what Wayne was trying to show, the final product seems to have been modified to Etch-a-Sketch. It was an embarrassing movie to sit down and encourage no one to pick it up. Wayne threw all the teachings of his Columbia University into the air and destroyed two hours of my life. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Class: * outside *****
