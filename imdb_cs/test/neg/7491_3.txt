The C-Class cast and the badly changing scenes, accompanied by horrific action, also led me to believe that it would make him a good TV program, such as the FX presentation of smallpox. However, on my local blockbuster there are about 9 copies on the shelves, none of which were checked in when I rented a title (I wonder why…) The title of the “fear factor” of the director was almost ridiculous. it went. The whole "number of dead" at the bottom of the screen sometimes contradicted the plot, for example, when the helicopter passed through Angola, and the toll was accelerated at a rapid pace from 23 million to 24 years. , (maybe a few hours or even a day or so after a helicopter landing) the victim counter is also reset as it was when the helicopter approached the area. The end of the film left a whole whole in the whole plot, and God knows that no one is waiting for the sequel. By the way, don't rent it, I just recommend watching it if you got a title without a financial loss, and you're in the mood for a cheesy thrilling movie.
