I think you can't imagine how these people really work ... !! Before I came to the studios to watch the boys working there, I actually thought it was the same as you. Since I've seen and done the work that guys have to do on the TV show, I have to say that they really deserve respect for what they do all day. It really is not an easy job. And also the actors who may be terribly bad in your eyes are really great people and many of them can really act! I don't think the material given to them can really show it because I think this material is not very good. But they are really good! So I don't think you can judge them before you see those people doing work there! And I shouldn't have judged them before I met them, but I did and now I'm ashamed of it. So please don't let these great people judge you if you haven't seen them do the job there.
