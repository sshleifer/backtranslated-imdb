I'd like to write a little summary of this movie, but ... it's just not one! If you just look at the keywords for this title, you know the entire content of the movie: sex, breasts, exploitation, female frontal nudity and female prison! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more. The "Escape of the Island Women" clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial classic of a woman in jail, but he absolutely lacks brutality. WIP-flicks is meant to blend graphic sex images with shocking violence, but violence has just been replaced by more sex. Director Erwin Dietrich can certainly not compete with industry experts such as Jess Franco or Joe D'Amato, and should stick to the regular movements of soft-core. The only aspects that look slightly like cult cinema are the resemblance of the tyrannical president to Fidel Castro and the group rape (minor?) Girls soldiers. But the girls are furious and the place of shooting Ibiza looks very charming.
