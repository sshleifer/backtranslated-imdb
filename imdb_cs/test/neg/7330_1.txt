Well, there's nothing to say about this movie. its just garbage. very bad act, bad script and lame story .... well, actress (even odnt even know her name) who played mainrole, (not the blond but the latin one) acted fine but the blond boy who played the main friend Charactor, her acting level is just like high school play, just like most other actors in the film. Also, zombies ,,,, very bad behavior as well. and â€œthe story itself makes no sense at all. Well, if you are really bored and really have nothing to do, but you want to somehow kill time, you might want to watch this movie but event, there are still millions of better B movies than this crap. its wasted money and time.
