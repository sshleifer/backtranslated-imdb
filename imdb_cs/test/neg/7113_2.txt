Live action version of Dragonball over Taiwan. The evil gentleman comes to the ground to get seven magical balls ... er pearls, which when put together, cause the dragon to appear and give your wishes. Lots of action and bad comedy follow. What can I say that "the best way to watch this movie is a lot of drunk but funny friends" isn't it? I don't know. This is really bad, but funny that really bad movies can be. Come on, it's one of the few martial arts movies I've ever seen where you see wires. It's a live action cartoon and not so far from what I've seen at the show that it makes me worried about the big budget American version now filming. <br /> <br /> If you have some drunk friends and feel like filming in the movie to see this movie. If you see it, sober (like me) avoids it.
