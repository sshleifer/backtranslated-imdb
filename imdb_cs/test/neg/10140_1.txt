Reba sucks. It is difficult. It's about this terrible country singer trying to make a comedy. They could also call this show "Generic" because that's what it is. It's stupid and general. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your retarded show was canceled because you're sucking, and so was Brock, Barbra Jean, a redhead teenager, the jockey and the 12-year-old who was fired. You all suck, and none of you are funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil who worships Hitler and tortures animals. And on his show and in his "music" he gives subconscious messages to kill children and kill them! But it was just a rumor. By the way, this is the worst show ever, Reba is gay, I don't like her, I think Office is better than this show, and this show is upset.
