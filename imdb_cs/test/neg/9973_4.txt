I was looking forward to watching this movie, and so I was very disappointed to find that it was complete and utter waste. Akerman's direction is both heavy and cliché (how much more clichés can you get than Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been chosen exclusively for their resemberlance to Egon Schiele's anxiety of running self-portraits. However, the themes of jealousy and betrayal that were to be the primary focus of this type of film remain practically unexplored. All that remains is a turgid melodrama that begins with age to begin and even longer. The only advantage of this type of film is that you realize how good Goddard and Truffaut are.
