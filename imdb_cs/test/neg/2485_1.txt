I saw this movie on videotape with my younger brother long ago, despite the fact that I was a young boy with a hearing impaired. At that time, I didn't have a closed decoder (it was 1986, The Transformers: The Movie), but I could watch the storyline and understand what was happening. It wasn't my fault that I saw an animated movie for girls. My father rented a video to show my younger sister. Ten years later I borrowed the video for 50 cents to watch the closed subtitles again. My memories of this film were completely destroyed by anyone other than WRETCHED SCRIPT. I've seen a lot of badly written films (like COOL AS ICE and JASON GOES TO HELL: FINAL FRIDAY), but I've never seen (or heard) that dialogues are wrong, just flooding enough unwavering to make your head laugh in hysterics and yell out pain perseverance torture sit in this movie. Despite the good conspiracy and interesting story concepts, the SCREEN, BAR NONE! Inability Howard R. Cohen should never work as a screenwriter, professional or other. I can't believe they would even allow a horrible scenario to create such a movie in the first place. Did the Japanese producers read the script, in broken English or translated before they knew what they were in? Even crap like G.I. Joe The Movie and My Little Pony The Movie have redemption values ​​in comparison to this abomination. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of the 80's animation, or just embark on a nostalgia trip, ATTENTION ON WOOD BRIT AND STAR GOLD! It does not matter whether you have been elevated or traumatized by a carelessly animated film with a cruel script, or have not seen a film, STAY FROM THIS FILM. The movie should be seen with caution to learn how to write bad script!
