I watched this movie knowing it would be horrible, but damn it if it didn't break a new and revolutionary amusement-making environment. The story is Deep Rising with crunchy effects and HORRID. Lines in this ... well ... wow there really is no way to put this movie down because I think the words still have to be created in English. Sadly, the filmmakers thought they were actually doing something good. You won't believe your eyes when you see how many movies ripped off without trying to hide them. There are scenes / plot facilities directly from Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers, and the list could go forever. However, unlike any of those films, this just does not reach celluloid stools. The most distrustful thing about this film, besides trying to be competent but failing, is that there is Gimli-freakin'-self in it. How the hell can they afford John Rhys-Davies, but not decent effects, writing, actors or sets. Really awful ... and not the kind of bad thing that is good.
