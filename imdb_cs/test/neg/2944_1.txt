Identifying this movie as a vampire film would be technically correct. Simply because it will suck your life out of you. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is an insult to film enthusiasts everywhere. The story is almost non-existent. Make-up is just awful. And there is simply no acting. I have to wonder if Jackie Chan owes someone a huge favor to make sure he appears in this movie. My wife picked up a rental film because he had a picture of Jackie Chan at the front (as if playing the lead) and thought the good JC movie would be fun watching. This movie was interesting to watch the same way that you can't help staring at a car wreck when you're driving. You realize very quickly that the movie will not be better, but you will watch wonder how bad it will be.
