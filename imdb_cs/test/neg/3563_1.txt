Conclusion: very, but very, very boring, yet I watched until the end, hoping it will have some upward effect, but the end was worse because it was nothing. The old black and white game didn't help at all, usually it helps psychological movies, but it wasn't. Scenario, storyline, etc. They were linear, had no substance, nothing happened. When dealing with psychology, you are dealing with analysis, ie with details, with the formulation of unity and diversity ... there was no essence, no detail. Just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of the filmmakers ... well, this isn't the only one.
