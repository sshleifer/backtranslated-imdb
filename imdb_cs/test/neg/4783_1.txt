I saw this movie with very low expectations. I didn't know much about it, so I wasn't sure it was worth it. The story did OK work to keep you curious about these ruins that travel. Tensions continue when the Mayans appear and force them to stay in ruins. Then the film changes from somewhat exciting to nonsensical. The amount of gore found in this film was not balanced compared to whether it was really necessary or to use more for shock values. . They had a fire and didn't try to burn it, nor did they try to cut a knife with a knife to see if they could destroy it. They quickly jumped into the role of victim and their helpless attitude was not real. It reminded me of old horror movies, where people just shouted and shouted and didn't have half their brain to try to fight.
