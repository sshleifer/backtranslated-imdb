Wow !! I didn't even know about this movie until I was looking for the name of another classic Mark Hamill (Time Runner). Some things are better unknown. Mark Hamill's role is quite limited. I would compare his performance in this film with all these performances by Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in the bad horror b-films of the 1960s and 1970s. In these films they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the film. Mark's memorable action with lines as big as "Don't try to escape. You're under arrest." I mentioned that he says the thing is more than once. Bill Paxton fell into a Uzumaki drug-type spiral and drove aliens because he ended up in this film after waking up on the scene after partying. HAIRâ€¦ HAIR !!! .. An invaluable Bill. It really should be "GAME OVER" for Bill ... but somehow ... got treatment .. and went on for better ??? movies. This movie is blowing. It's more boring and boring than The Crazies. At least the movie was crazy ... that's just boring. DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILM SOBER.
