This is my birthday in a box called Broke Skull. Well, after I looked at the DVD and I was pleasantly surprised, I threw the fool out. It was worse than I expected, and I didn't expect much. This film is basically an intricate story about a man dying and returning to life with the crowd, and other crap. There were some interesting ideas that had never been established. Now everyone said there was a lot of gore, could anyone tell me? I have seen a bad effect of crushed head, brain tissue (or something ...) and blood that comes from the penis area twice. I have to say that the part was the guy who stroked his hood, which made me twist, that was the only good thing about this movie. And the homosexual sex scene was unreasonably thrown there. What was happening in it was Murderous, really fired. The Asian cat was annoying, then annoying Mexican girlfriend who would come to be killed. I say when you get it in a box, it's okay, but to spend no money on it.
