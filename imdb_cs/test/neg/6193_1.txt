Let me first say that in the past I was a big carlin fan. I think George is one of the smartest people and the best comics on the planet. what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way and give us his unique view of these things. it wasn't always funny, but you always respected his views because they were presented in such a smart way. But you are all sick is just a long brag. he gives us no unique view of anything, just gives us a long list of things p.o. There is no look or cleverness, only the old man complains one hour directly to the things we all complained about. and it wasn't even funny. You are all sick of appealing to stupid people who can't handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct. I do not mind comedy-driven anger, but George could do much better. I really hope the next George Carlin show will live in the quality that George has shown in the past.
