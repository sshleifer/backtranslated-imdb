I went to see this movie mainly because it looked so good in trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should be the same size. Instead, he has been continuing the bad movie of Williams movies recently. What's with the movie? Rather, what is right: the crew of the ensemble is doing pretty good work around Robin, and as usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. As has been said, this movie just wasn't good. I really just recommend seeing if you want to see what it would be like if Jon Stewart ran for president and won. To say he won is not a spoiler because it was in the trailer. The concept and idea are really fun, but that's all. Most of Robin's jokes are just recycled from old comedic pieces, and very little laugh out loud and most of them are just stupid. Like most comedies that turned out to be sucked, all the funny pieces are put in the trailer. Really no surprise, but come on! Some of the movies read like Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn! People expected it to be Robin's return to size. Instead, it's more Flubber.
