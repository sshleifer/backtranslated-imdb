Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I love a guy! His films give them a feeling that the director or producer does, but he! Recycled land ... check. Rip-off better movies ... check. The wood is ... controlling. It's not that Van Dien is a bad actor (he was effective in Hollywood glamor like Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow) that he wasn't really offered a talent-worthy script; And yes, he has a different acting talent than being an eye candy. This film offers a slight hint of what Van Dien can offer, but is involved in the production of everything. The script can be better developed (see Oliver Stone's U-Turn). Direction can be better used (see Robert Rodriguez From Dusk Til Dawn). DP could make the desert more exotic (see Faster Pussycat Faster Kuss!). This script is weak because it is something we have seen many other times, so a double / triple crossing is expected. The direction is weak because it offers nothing new and telegraphs many weak scenarios. Cinematography occasionally illustrates a beautiful autumn desert taste, but at other times it does not use burning light, and the initial sequence is terrible in blue. <br /> <br /> Now for acting. Van Dien shows his grace and charisma to his Jake. He does not get too methodical or too heavy in his role. Nice balance, especially since the rest of the cast seems too distracted as to how they should act in this movie (bad script or wrong direction ... you make your point of view). The only other person worth mentioning is Bryan Brown's villain, because he provides the only real credit for playing in this movie ... beginning actors forget that he is trying to learn how to act in a green screen, try to act in a terrible scenario, and make notes on Bryan Brown in this movie. It adds depth to its role and is a pleasant contrast to Van Dien's character. Jake always seems to be either one step ahead, or control of the situation if it's out of control. Femme fatale is weak (after all, it's a desert noir) and it's another nail in the coffin of this movie (you decide ... script or direction). Rosalita should be directed forward in the film instead of being pushed back into the back terrain to create room for a true femme fatale. So watch the movie for Van Dien and Brown; And for fun, try skipping the rock through the hole holes in the movie.
