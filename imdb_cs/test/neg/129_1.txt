I can't explain what waste is. Like I really can't. its just as bad. conspiracy = crap playing = budget crap = so low his laughter Jesus, his only good thing in this movie is the fact that the main character was quite hot. The only people I think I think this film is good about are those who took part in the film. I'm sure they're not the ones who financed it because no money was put into it. (HAHAhaha to the bit where the heads are shaved) <br /> <br /> This film has wasted life unnecessarily, so I won't waste any more time writing my review.
