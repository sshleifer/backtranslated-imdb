This movie is bad. Really bad. So bad I wanted to shoot myself in the forehead. I hated this movie. First, the plot went absolutely nowhere and something shocking about this movie was seen in the 30 second trailer teaser. Secondly, anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows it was a bad movie too and did not fit the remake. By far the best part of the film is the house in which it takes place. There were parts in the movie when the music gets very exciting and you are positive that someone is around the corner and turns out to be a maid or a cat, but when someone is actually around the corner it is impossible to be even surprised because you were waiting for it the whole film. So save money, save time, save yourself headaches and just watch the trailer. There is no point in seeing this movie, not in theater, not in DVD, not in television, never.
