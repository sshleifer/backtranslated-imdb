I finished observing this horribly depressing drama and realized that in light of recent dramas like these, the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing but tragic. I would suggest how this conclusion is recklessly defeatistic and counterproductive, although relationships and prospects like those in this film are somewhat anchored. But instead, I realized that these movies made the utter decision of a great "tragedy" trivial when the same boring situation, the same suffocating dysfunctional family and friendship continued to play just to be over and over again in some sort of attempt to eliminate earlier distortions of family life ( most of them existed in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations that are becoming so subtle, replacing them with "reality" instead of how things actually are. In fact, what we are watching is no longer dysfunctional, but in fact a normal existence and a set of circumstances that really existed all the time, but which we may not have known before, and that is why we ignored them or at least didn't recognize them. The only problem is that too many movies are attempting this point. And so in almost identical form. When I read the synopsis of the movie, I immediately thought of 'Ice Storm'. While I watched the depressing life of the Travis family, which seemed to endure repetitive emotional swearing, I immediately remembered American beauty. And in some ways, the interaction between parents and a middle child, Tim, I drew similarities from 'Igby Goes Down.' 'Imaginary Heroes' can be a new experience, perhaps refreshing, considered to be an honest portrayal of a character that, as has been said, is often not allowed to exist in family films (which is idiotic to think we were already seen in the 1980s) These kinds of relationships in movies like "Ordinary People" and which go even further, but these films do not offer anything new to a well-behaved viewer. In fact, they are becoming a rather worn testimony of too many filmmakers who might try to do what they can. succeeds, with a lot of trauma and apathy they can wrap into one family (and that also affects neighbors and friends), in fact, 'Imaginary Heroes', the latest in this genre (I think there were enough movies to say exactly 'genre') crams have so many disasters and surprises in one family that they would be priced findings for visiting talk shows. The eldest son, a talented and adorned swimmer who hated this sport with passion, the youngest son knew, his father was stunned and blinded by the pressure to compete in his star son. And it's not clear that mother and sister have a lot in common with a young man. It is true that this is a little less fun (to some extent, for those who have exhaustively depressed the material after a while), and the performances are pretty good, especially Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. However, I hope that in the future, filmmakers wishing to add a comment on the struggle for family relationships (which by coincidence or do not always seem to be white suburban families of the upper middle class) intend to offer something new through material and insight. I should not see the difference (and therefore no purpose) otherwise.
