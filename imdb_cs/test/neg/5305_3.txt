Chili Palmer is tired of doing movies and knows he wants to do some music. Being half the mafia half of the expert negotiator, he wants to develop on the music market. Knowing that everyone is like him, and making a good singer Linda Moon to record hit will be harder as expected. The first part is witty and filled with irony, it falls into easy jokes and has many less good moments. Only two women (Uma and Milian) are decent in their part. Most of the film is done with a historical character, excessively exaggerated (a little okay, too much is disgusting) and the only one that can be saved is a gay bodyguard that is at least coherent, the rest being too idiotic. The most surprising thing is that the movie is not boring, everything is happening so fast and so many things happen that you don't have the time to get bored if you want to watch a movie. It can offend your intelligence (a lot!), And the movie is bad (yeah!), But well, it's not boring.
