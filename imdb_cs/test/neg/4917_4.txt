At the speed that these movies go through the artifacts of Amityville, it won't be long before we get to the floorboards, but now it's a mirror that causes problems for more cardboard figures in this sixth series. The homeless man passes it on to Ross Partridge's artistic hairstyle, who then has strange visions and discovers several unpleasant revelations about his past. This secular horror stretches in a dark pace, so we are waiting for a build that will never come because the various "scary" events lead to a stupid final. Bland and lifeless, with rope acting and Partridge's big hair that doesn't help matters.
