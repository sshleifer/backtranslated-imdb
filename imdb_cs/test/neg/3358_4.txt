Below-average blaxpoitation action / melodrama in which beautiful Mrs. Grier plays a private eye to help her father (Rudy Challenger) and his partner (Austin Stoker of the original "Assault on Precinct 13") whose credit business is <br /> < br /> I will be honest - I agree with some other comments for the users of this movie. "Sheba, Baby" has a less than satisfying scenario, a direction that is not particularly different, action scenes that are fun at best, and one of the other indescribable litters of Mrs. Grier (although the supporting role for D'Urville is important) Martin , also known in blaxpoitation). I feel that this routine movie can only be linked quickly to pay off its huge popularity. Certainly it was when Stoker was great again. the role - or dialogue - as in other films, although it does what it does best, and plays sassy, ​​a sexy sister for vengeance. <br /> <br /> The non-stop soul / funk soundtrack is nice, to say the least. Mostly recommended to those who want to see everything in the film repertoire Pam Grier. <br/> <br/> 4/10
