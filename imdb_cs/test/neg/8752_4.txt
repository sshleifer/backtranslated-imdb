I love this movie. Although I rated it "4", it is because acting, conspiracy and budget were all passed on to the "B" universe before the film was released. But that's okay! It's a fun movie that has something to offer! I remember what Leonard Maltin said about "Plan 9 of Space": a film so bad that it's great! The Missing UFO - Alien Conspiracy, Thing could not die relying on the paranormal (divination, buried head seeking that body, hypnosis, etc.) to say that story. Behavior is calm, camera works in second grade and setup is limited but boy! what movie! This movie is available on the market. If you find a copy, buy it!
