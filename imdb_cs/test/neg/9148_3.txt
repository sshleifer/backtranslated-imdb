Positive: It's pretty good. He has some interesting peripheral characters. Likable's main character (though weak). Bad: Fence / Story. Adjustment. Unnecessary characters. Jessica Alba. I'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is ominously bad. I don't understand how this Guy Jenkin can hand over $ 12M. And before I go on, I just want to say that I don't like Jessica Alba - I really wanted to like it in this movie. However, Jessica Alba in her false accent and her model presents me miserable. She has absolutely no presence on the screen in this movie, and she destroys every scene she is in. No need to say that romance doesn't look plausible (not even a little bit). All I saw in the whole were the actors waving their wings, trying to get this thing out of the country with what was given to them - but unfortunately, all the movie is a sink. There is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict, and nothing is gained. It's a pretty empty movie.
