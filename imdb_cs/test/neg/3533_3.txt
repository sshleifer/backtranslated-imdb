A scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrong. The creators are trapped in a remote desert base, tirelessly and persistently persecuted by their own creation. James Stockton, a scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create a monster, called them a base to help return to the horror that is now lurking somewhere in the dark halls. James, along with his son and daughter, will soon be trapped inside with others who are desperate to survive. no way out ... "The Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is very unoriginal. The sets are pretty claustrophobic and there is a little gore. \ THowever as horror it fails miserably at almost all levels. That's zero tension, the script is weak and filled with big holes and the end is extremely predictable. The so-called master Wes Craven produced this one-wondering if he is happy with this trash.Joe Gayton drives without any style. Avoid it as a plague - it's the same old boring crap again!
