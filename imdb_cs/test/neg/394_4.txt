On average, it is the only word I can think of when you see it. The acting was average (maybe a little above average), the use of the camera was average (actually below average). so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurred.) The storyline was good, but it moved at a slow pace and was not used for good use. This could be a lot more if it wasn't a snail's pace and we saw more in the background of the characters. All we see are flashbacks here and there Alice and how her home life is so "bad" (her mother is a working class woman who tries to meet her and her daughter). ) We see a flash of her life when she was in high school and her boyfriend told her, "Tell your mom to do some better food" and "Everyone says it's your mom." Yeah, that's embarrassing, but why would you come from I could definitely find out if her mom was drunk or someone was abusing her, but nothing was wrong with her except that she was embarrassed. How immature! <br /> We are not even looking at the lives of a couple (except for making prostitutes and a woman for a while, forgetting her name, giving her a baby when she was 9 years old) It was really much more. who was abused by her drunk mom going to Florida with her boyfriend, but then becomes a prostitute or something that is in line with that other than the real plot of this movie (that is) Alice, a girl with a home life of about 90% of the US population (WORKING CLASS) on the run to Florida, but then reflected in a prostitute. I don't see why she won a prize at the Sundance festival (it must have been against some really weak competition that won the prize). It seemed to me that Alice is a Boston / New England accent. It didn't seem right. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now I live in Georgia.) <br/> <br /> 4/10 In my opinion, it's not worth your time.
