Two years after this short, the last "Our Gang" was created. After seeing it, you wondered how much longer it took. The quality of "Our Gang" nosedived soon after moving from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short is a perfect example. Gags are very rude and Froggy's last line of this happiest day of his life paints a bad image in your mind of what it is for him for the rest of the time. A very bad example of making a movie.
