Even if I'm not a woman, I can enjoy a chick if it's good. But this one isn't bad. You have the story from the book, the girl divorced, the boy appeared. The BOOM spell is happening and its demons are expelled when they realize that their life has a new purpose. Now that I can believe that this can happen, I'm not an idiot. This would not happen during the weekend of geriatric husky blisters. Still, manufacturers know that they have only 1 hour and 30 minutes, so they make two changes to make it happen, I suppose the night it will hit, and the night in grams and grandmother who walks like dogs in the heat, there may be enough if he believed that romance novels were gospel ... but most people didn't. Now that it's not enough ... the producers remembered that the chick is beating to make the viewer cry. Well, they tried to make us shout when the two seniors said they couldn't ... how could they hit you? Why do I know to let one of the characters kill for no good reason at all, except that accidental death will certainly bring a tear to the eye ... and now let a teenage daughter have a magically bonded heart with a broken mom for no reason except it would be nice (absolutely unreal, but who cares). So here you go ... girl finds boy, boy finds love, death finds boy and mom cries ... what movie - NOT.
