I'm not so old I can't remember Bobcat Goldthwait a couple of times. But some who have lost their sense of humor and brain cells in all their years of drug use. You can't have any female sympathy or empathy since this movie opens. You won't even find anything fun after hearing the opening line. Apparently, Goldthwait hates himself so much that he has to humiliate himself to feel better - even if he is his own imaginary character, which he degrades. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen Shakes the Clown, you know how unusual Bobcat was 15 years ago ... this movie is worse. It wasn't even fun by chance It's a sad, pathetic and total waste of time. May Goldthwaits' hands are rendered paralyzed so they can't write another script. Strike his tongue so he can't dictate another unreal scene. He is sad and pathetic and needs to create a space for dying new talent to get to Hollywood
