The worst of all is bad scripting, which leads to superficial gameplay. Dreyfuss's character is intensely repetitive and unpleasant, and Dreyfuss himself has an annoying face that matches him. Hunter Hunter's character is excessively self-centered, and Hunter himself is dedicated to serious overclocking, as usual. Brad Johnson was wooden. John Goodman made the best of it. Besides, the whole thing of death / spirit has been somewhat exaggerated since then and now seems rather lame. <br /> <br /> Hardly noticeable if you like old aircraft.
