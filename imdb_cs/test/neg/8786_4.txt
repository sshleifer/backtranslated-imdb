I rented it when it came out on a videotape in 1995. After rethinking it again, my idea of ​​it hasn't changed much. <br /> <br /> I was an adult then and I'm still grown up now! lol <br /> <br /> The illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers did not bother me. This is not a documentary, it's a fantasy story where animals can talk! Although I didn't care about a lot of songs, I liked it at the end of the picture where it was sung by barry manilow and another person. Some people seem to apologize for being a primitive animation by saying that CGI wasn't used frequently in animated features, but let's not forget that King LION KING was released for about a year. Previously, and that wrapped maybe more perfection than any animated element that came before him! But I think it's fairly fair to say that Bubble and PINGOIN was made for cheap, while The LION KING wasn't .... <br /> <br /> The highest point for me in 1995 and today, the tension is triggered by several dangerous (mostly) underwater scenes. I also liked the opening scene that takes place on the music notes page and a little love story. But most of the time, the story dragged and was boring. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look if you like animation, but if you're an adult and not risky, go get another Walt Disney instead of this!
