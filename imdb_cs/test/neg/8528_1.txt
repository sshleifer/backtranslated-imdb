This was one of the slowest movies I ever had to sit with. After the introduction, when we got behind the scenes of "something" killing a few people in a farmhouse, we are familiar with the white freer family that moves to the farm - and NEVER are looooong. Then they meet this wanderer who helps on the farm and NEVER has to rebuild for a very long time. Then finally the girl from the family has some plotergeist stuff happens. Then something else happens, the rogue with the nut and the movie is over. As the family had to move out, the girl got into some trouble at home and had no money to take care of these poor people. I can't believe I actually went to theaters to see it! Not only did this film suck, but some $ hole answered his cell phone, the stupid miserable did the noise and the film sucked. THATS WHY THE SUCK THEATERS - Bad movies, overpriced miserable food and idiots in the theater, I stay home and watch DVDs from now on, at least I could smoke when I was at home watching this silly movie. Stay home and bake some cake rather than go to the theater to see this piece of typical crap. Stupid stupid.
