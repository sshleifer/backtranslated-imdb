Solo is a bad movie that cannot be ignored. The biggest part of the game is very wooden (the only exception is the performance of Adrien Brody as solo creator Bill). This means that such movies are more about action than conspiracy / gaming and as such live or die action pieces - which is the end of such movies - to make a 14-year-old thing smile, adults watch movies of real fabric. And even this Solo is not doing well - what is little is poorly done, boring and uninspired. After seeing this trailer on TV, I was hoping for something in Predator with a Predaot robot. Instead, I got a pretty lifeless action movie with a badly built attempt in depth by putting on a message that robots can feel too. Watch Terminator II or Predator instead ... both of the classics that this film desperately wants to be, except they lack inspiration or make them fair, budget.
