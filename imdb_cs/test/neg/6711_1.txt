Two things have changed since then. At first I am not yet a child, and the second most new Seagal movies are just terrible. That's the worst movie he ever made with Derailed played by Jean Claude Van Damme. The plot in this movie, the plot is just an excuse to shoot some horrible action scenes that are painful to watch. in an annoying way to kill viewers love for action movies. I'm sorry but I have no respect for anyone who liked this movie. My serious news problem then. I hope Seagal will do some good new movies in the future. Good luck for him!
