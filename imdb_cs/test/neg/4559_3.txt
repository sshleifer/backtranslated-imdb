Ugghhh !!! This is precisely the kind of Pre-Code movie that could misunderstand the viewer that the movies of this period are miserable - and not - it's just this movie that's terrible. Horror, because while the film tries to be "hip" and "adult" very hard, it's also hopelessly old-fashioned, boring and hockey that I was torn between laughing at a movie or just falling asleep !! This is at least a unique combination. So why did I hate it so much? The film is incredibly slim but has no style and the film is designed to shock but lacks subtlety and takes too many ridiculous turns to be believable. The film begins with a clich√© - a hooker with a heart of gold. Dorothy Mackaill is a prostitute and she seems to have accidentally killed a man! Shortly after escaping, she meets an old friend who insists on marrying her. When he sees the innate good of this man, he decides to change his life and stop living a wild life. This is difficult when hiding on a fictional Caribbean island. Here, alone and waiting for her husband to return, there is nothing to do and the place is infested with super horny and utterly nasty men. In fact, this part of the film is so boring that the audience can have a hard time concentrating. The men on the island are so enthusiastic about the presence of Mackail that they constantly seem to be on the verge of rape - only to be rejected because they are no longer such a girl. Frankly, I am very tired of all those wild scenes - there is just too much eye bending and tongue-wagging to make it look anything but a very bad movie. And looking at all the nasty horns-dogs was just annoying and stupid. But wait, it's much worse. The man she thought she'd killed would appear on this little island (what are the odds?!) And she was also trying to rape her. But he must not be discouraged and end shooting to save his newly founded virtue. While the island jury is about to free her, she rushes back to court and lies - telling them she intends to kill the man, and that was premature (?), Because even though she is liberated, she knows that a criminal will have her with her when he is sent to prison for a fee for holding a gun. Given that her prisoner had given her a gun to build her, she hurried to the yard and said she was guilty, she seemed to be really stupid. Why didn't she tell them the twisted plan of the lender? She probably did it to preserve her virtue, but she admitted to killing someone so people would think you were a virgin? In order to avoid a short prison sentence (and again the threat of rape), she does not consider telling the court that she is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation (the creditor promised to rape her). when it is closed). And just before being taken to the gallows (to avoid rape), a friend appears in time to send him away and the credits come back. Impossible situations and coincidences - so often that the movie is just stupid. Combining this with all the sexual cues, it's for the bad and slim movie clutter that will only appeal to the most deadly Pre-Code fans. All the others, beware, it's very sticky and stupid from start to finish!
