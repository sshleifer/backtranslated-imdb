Caution: This could damage your movie. Watch if you agree. We think we as people cannot learn from the past. The futuristic society portrayed what Hitler believed to wipe out the race of men (in this case men) for the benefit of society. I was sick on my stomach. Also, the credibility of Y's bomb is crazy. Even in the war our instinct for self-preservation will prevent the extinction of mankind. We made mistakes in the past, ie Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 45, but that is why we avoided a larger error in63 during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
