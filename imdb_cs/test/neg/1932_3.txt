This film has more on the plate than the sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is indigestion. There are some good performances, but the subplots are foreign and largely unresolved. In addition, I found all the characters unlikely and if you can't identify with at least one character, not much to be excited about. All in all, it's a classic example of trying to do too much with too little.
