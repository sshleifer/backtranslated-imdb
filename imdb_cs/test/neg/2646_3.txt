Although it was a well-told story, I found it too annoying. The main theme is child abuse, which is never fun to see - a dark theme. Add to this a lot of the blasphemy of the drunk-abusive husband and the GD by a small child, no less - and this film deterred me again when I saw it again. There were also punk selections on two little boys, another unpleasant viewing experience. The story's realism lasts when one of the boys flies away on a home plane! Give me a break! The only positive, enjoyable part of this movie is to see a nice, loving and touching relationship between the two young brothers, who plays Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. He became known in the next few years for big roles in Jurassic Park, Shadlowland and The River Wild. Of course, the wood didn't last ten years later, but in the trilogy The Lord of the Rings he did it very big. These two kids and the storytelling of Tom Hanks are the only pages I liked about this movie.
