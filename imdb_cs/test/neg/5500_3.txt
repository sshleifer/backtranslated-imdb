This movie has great potential - it's a great story and has the potential to be very scary. But of course Tim Burton does not really make scary movies, makes crazy cartoonish movies. and I usually like tim burton. but I thought this movie was really weak. the best thing about the film (and that's actually worth seeing just for that) was the artistic direction - the film has an amazing intangible quality. the script was not good. It was boring in parts and confusing in other parts, and there was no build of characters. I never really cared for people to have a headless head. I thought johnny depp had a good thing with his attitude to the character, but since the script was weak, he couldn't go too far with him - and I was very upset about attempting a slight accent on his and christina ricci parts. anyway, it's not a great movie, and it's not worth seeing if you're not interested in the direction of art.
