Dorothy Provine here opposite: She is growing and growing. However, I did not find any overtones. "Incredible Shrinking Man" and other films of his ilk during the period were parables about radiation, nuclear war and other horrors. Provine's growth is the result of an inept computer / robot. And who runs this computer, but Lou Costello! I like some of his movies with Bud Abbott. But even if it's a pretty bad movie, he does well without it. And Gale Green is an excellent foil. Green plays a pompous city with a great shot. He is the father of Provine. He intends to be elected mayor. So when his beloved daughter starts having trouble, she throws her out. He does not postpone her, but gives up his fight against his longtime admirer Costello. This is very unlikely: Costello is a local garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Special effects are minimal. And the subplot, which includes the army, is extremely limp.
