I'm sorry I switched to everyone. A little about me: I love and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. It is true that I am a newcomer to South Korean cinema, but if it is the best of the best, I apologize. I just want you to know that I'm not at all narrow-minded when it comes to valuing foreign movies and I'm not sitting on the stereotype of "stupid American". . . well, not perfect. <br /> <br /> I can't believe the high praise that this piece doesn't give. This is a nasty and ridiculous film. Hammy playing - everything is badly done and exaggerated, like asking for an uneducated viewer's attention. Terrible camera-work, with an emphasis on senseless close-ups derived from MTV aesthetics. The action is full of holes than a huge piece of Swiss cheese. No one expects the thriller to be 100% realistic, and for fun, I'd like to close my eyes to tiny details. But excuse me, what's going on here, that * can * state a comprehensive check? This story of an incredibly complex and scornful act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story that can be read in line at the supermarket. (You don't want to spoil your "enjoyment" if it's a word, so don't get into the details of the conspiracy.) Battle scenes are violent, incredible, downright stupid (the main "hero" who takes tens and dozens of people) opponents at the same time After he just trained while imprisoned, punching the wall!) Really "excellent" features of this film are two: clear and incestuous sex (brother to sister and father to daughter, well, we are from Oedipus, right?) and graphic violence . Cut off body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - along with industrial amounts of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this film to be made?) They have no aesthetic function / motivation at all. <br /> <br /> A feast for S & M, of course, for those without a merit and gentleness. Heaven, even the recent and much-discussed work of Mel Gibson on an almost similar subject was not so bad. Undoubtedly, the good print of this pretentious, crowded, elongated piece of gratuitous gore from the Korean banks gets me wondering what's going on. I don't think it's the ultimate gust of appetite, and I am often ready to accept that a film I didn't like can be better than I could perceive. However, I have no scruples at all in calling this as I see it: bad, bad, bad. No redemption features. My 2c? Find something better with your time.
