I confess to the secret admiration of the original TV shows, Love Thy Neighbor - mostly because they show exuberant audacity and a bad taste that is synonymous with so many programs of their era - but I was lying in my teeth (very uncomfortable position) if I pretended that this great movie spin -off is something other than an abomination. The opening scenes of ruthless vandalism are not only meaningless, but also confused - it never explains why the film is being opened up by the surveillance footage of people collecting houses together - and from there nothing is improving. At a time when the film reveals the oldest joke in the book - the terrible dragon-in-law dragon unexpectedly stops - is followed by an unexpectedly apparent revelation that develops a soft place for the father of a black neighbor, moving the bigoted son of ever-deeper self-righteous rage, most demanding viewers will be turned off. Take it as a warning if you are not interested in a cheap spin-off with terrible acting, a static direction and an overall comic touch of a burning orphanage.
