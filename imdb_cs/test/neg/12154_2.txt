I am really impressed that it was 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and nomination for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. Evaluating 7.3 on IMDb ... it's not so surprising to see how IMDb users have voted recently. I can't get into a movie in which the real facts about his main character are clearly distorted and not at all so that the film is artistic, but rather that it is melodramatic and less boring. As it turns out, in fact, it makes it very boring for anyone expecting to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of Genghis Khan. The far appealing and exaggerated Mongol Mongol often reflects the likes of 300, a film that could not be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, the Mongol is taken seriously. It's a stoic seriousness, mixed with obvious inaccuracies, is what makes it the worst movie I've ever seen this year; maybe the most action or biopic movie I've seen. The characters were pathetically written. Frankly, I doubt that Genghis Khan was so boring and passive, as stated in this film. Which is funny for me, because if there was something that I think should be changed for the sake of theatricality, it is a boring person that is interesting. The romance between Khan and Borte is similarly boring, simple and stupid. Also, without giving anything away, the Mongol contains the only stupid scene I have seen in LONG TIME - where there should be a good 20 minutes of plot development, the movie simply skips without any explanation. It seemed like something that took place in a Saturday live parody that parodies epic action movies with terrible stimulation. (Did I mention how serious the Mongol is?) Meanwhile, it pulls like no movie I've ever seen. Even now, I could swear it was three hours. I checked the time for about 45 minutes, and I was sure it was almost done. In addition to some nice scenery and quality from Asan (naturally), the Mongol is honestly just a disaster. I was totally unable to entertain myself or refresh me. I would never give this film a second chance. And not to make it racist or patriotic or anything, but give me a bleak American epic over Mongol every day. At the very least, I know what I'm getting, unlike the Mongol, where reviews and ratings led me to believe that it was actually something worth seeing. The saddest thing about how much I hated the Mongol is that I have friends that I know, they just doubt it.
