Mr. Bean is just a bunch of unfair humor. It is the most shallow humor television series ever made in history. Scenes are often disgusting and terrible canned laughter sends chills across the spine. Mr Bean is a selfish and rude character, and one can only sympathize as pathetic. It is unbelievable that such low quality TV series can be maintained for 5 years. It is a complete waste of time to watch one episode and one cannot help but express disgust and regret why Rowen appeared as such a two-dimensional, indecent and ridiculous character. Or sorry why you bothered to watch the episode. Watching this is an aggravating experience.
