This is an unsatisfactory adaptation of James Lee Burke's novel "In Confederate Dead Electric Fog". It is somewhat badly acted mainly due to the miscasting of major players. Tommy Lee Jones, normally a great actor, does not capture Burke's "Dave Robicheaux". As Robicheaux's chief nemesis, John Goodman makes sloppy employment as "difficult". The one who plays Robicheaux's actor-friend doesn't look like a former "A" lister leading man. The rest of the film is mostly occupied by local names without a name who simply don't do justice to the grandiose novel. The performance of the movie and Jones' movie is too fast for one thing. In Burke's series of novels, Robicheaux gives a person the feeling that he fits most of his time into his environment, that he is retreating and moving slowly. It is like deep south and south Louisiana. Then, at times, Robicheaux is almost maniac in his efforts. Jones is just moving at a fast pace through the film. It does not change. Ned Beatty is useless. Mary Steenburgen is there. The only good thing about it is setting up. Overall, the film gives the impression of a television movie.
