All right, enough. Every time I thought I saw a movie that is so badly listed, so bad in every way that I think no one could find something to praise, I just came to IMDb where I am greeted by the usual inane " Undiscovered masterpiece "GREAT film" - I mean, honestly what movie you're watching because it's definitely not the mess I just watched on the new Fox / MGM / UA DVD. There are about three fun lines and conspiracies that give new meaning to incoherence. And then, after ninety-three endless minutes, it stops and credits begin to end. Then there's another scene. The DVD is rather pathetic, which fits the film. The source material is almost completely faded into ugly brown. It's hard to imagine this movie being followed by Get Carter. Critics and the public just got one thing - it was lambasted and a box-office disaster, rightly so. But you're trying. And I'm going to try to find a movie that doesn't have anyone who's bragging about it.
