How does such a thing like at home in the world? How is it possible for them to be packaged and distributed? Are there absolutely zero movie screenings (and I use this term freely) that have to go before it's on the video store shelf? I'm for making DIY movies, but come on! This does not entitle me to put together a group of my friends and relatives, a lousy camcorder, a terrible story, and everything together to create a pile of piles of crap and call it a movie. And I want people to stop using the words "India" and "Camps" to describe these types of movies. Nor are they. In no other profession would such a thing be considered acceptable. If someone tried to sell you a car that was as bad as this movie, you took it back and said it was lemon. If it were a surgery, you would have sued a doctor for neglecting to take care. I wish I could get time and money after watching this time. Shame on video stores that store movies like these. They're rip-off to the public. Want "campy"? Go to any of the fifth 13 films (even later) or Dead-Alive. At least it doesn't mean you want to kill yourself. This is because movies like this make people automatically cope with independent garbage.
