The person who wrote the summary and rave review for this movie is either an idiot or a passionate fan of shitty movies. From the beginning it was just about the cheap ass "The Descent", which is a much better film that will definitely not start slowly. From the first moments of "The Cavern," I was amazed at how bad it was, how uninspired and unoriginal it was, how badly written, poorly managed, and poorly managed it was. This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and it says a lot, given that I recently suffered from "Pulse". I can't believe that this piece of waste really won an award that just shows the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in Australia and other countries than in the US being badly directed, especially retarded "upside-down-camera", intended to show disorientation, but only leaving as an inexpensive effect which the first vintage film student would be properly gifted for their Teacher. Sadly, this "director" is likely to continue making other films, more than likely to be as low as this "movie" because I'm sure he hasn't learned from him. its errors in this picture were excessive. If I had my way, the entire cast and crew would be sent to the river for a lifetime without release. This film is a crime against humanity.
