I remember the first time I saw this mini-series in 1984, with a growing sense of anger and outrage. After reading the comments on this title, I have to agree with the comments of the people of Greece. It was made to coincide with the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, and it seemed to me that this was nothing more than a Jingist, American nationalism waving flag in which American athletes are celebrated at the expense of others. Some other nationalities should have the right to feel deeply offended in the way they were shown in this series. It may, however, help explain the way in which many American viewers behaved in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and television coverage that seemed only concerned with the events that the Americans were likely to win.
