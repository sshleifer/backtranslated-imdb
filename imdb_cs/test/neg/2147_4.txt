I don't know which one was first released in 1970. Cannon for CÃ³rdoba is "Europen Western" Made in Spain. This means it's somewhat worse than the so-called #Western Leone's Western Spaghetti and The Real American Masterpieces of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Huguss, John Sturges and Anthony Mann in my merit order. This order is not to be interpreted because all John Ford Westerns are better than all Sam Peckipahn. I think IMDb is 100 Sort them all pretty well. Worse about this company is Casting. George Peppard is suitable for the role of sergeant, Raff Valone for "Maffia Capo" and Giovanna Ralli "puttana" in "Piazza Vennezia" in the 1960s in Rome.
