The casting (and direction) in Undercurrent is more crazy than inspired by this noir clunker, which fails from the beginning to get out of the ground. Robert Taylor's wooden style is an obstacle almost immediately for the highly affected Kate Hepburn and it's bad chemistry right from the start. Naive and innocent Ann Hamilton (Hepburn) falls for a handsome aircraft manufacturer Alan Garroway (Taylor) and rushes to the altar with him. He soon discovers that there is not much about him. As Alan becomes more distant, he dives further into the dark past and Ann soon finds himself in a nightmare instead of an American dream. The undercurrent resembles several Hitchcock charts, but Vincent Minnelli quickly discovers he is not a master. Tension. Hepburn is not a shrinking purple and she is hard to sell for a character more suited to reticent styles by Teresa Wright or Joan Fontaine. Minnelli never really succeeds in letting Kate put her desperately into Taylor's limited ability as an actor. Her attempts run into a quiet Gish, while Taylor's wide descent into madness takes over Bela Lugosi. Robert Mitchum completed miscasting as a sensitive brother. Discuss accumulation. Cinematographer Karl Freund provides some stylized noir styles, but Minnelli and the cast use the atmosphere humbly and the tension remains lukewarm. With Minnelli far from his forte (musicals) and Hepburn's victim role fit her as a bad suit Undercurrent drowns all involved.
