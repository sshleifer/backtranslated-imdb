Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of cruel horror movies that are beginning to feel that he is making too many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his balls; it turns out to be a bad idea, because shrinking is actually a crazy killer who is responsible for lots of deadly murders. Catch the opportunity to make Fulci his fall guy, Loop Nut Doctor hypnotizes the horror hack into thinking he is responsible for the recent series of murders. On the surface, Cat in the brain seems to be a fantastically pleasing delicacy from the spaghetti-splashing god Lucio Fulci. The film is full of chain saws, ax attacks and various other bloody murders, the film surely pours enough claret for even the toughest gore-chases. But when one looks closer, it turns out that many of those horrific scenes are exempted from earlier films (mostly Fulci's "masterpieces"); Remove these from the equation and one is left with a handy basic plot idea that is utterly pointless, some welcoming nudity, and a terrible performance from Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as a psycho shrink. The film progresses, unfolds into incomprehensible mess, with "borrowed" gore footage embedded randomly, without attempting to compile it into the story. If you've seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Ghost of Sodom, or Mario Bianchi's Secret of Murder, then you've already seen the best Cat In The Brain pieces before. After a lot of bloodshed, the movie quickly wraps so the viewer feels confused and somewhat cheated. Watch the movie if you are a Fulci completeist, but I would recommend looking for movies that made "good bits".
