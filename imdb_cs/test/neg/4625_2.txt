This movie starts great, and sucks you in. Most games are good until Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang-everyone else sounds British-like and Muslim) shows and proves he can't act. With that you can live up to the first battle scene, where everyone falls to pieces. Why Patrick Swayze fights the baddies with his ax when he just pushed his sword into the ground 5 minutes ago. A few minutes later, there is another wrong placement of swords, and people who know about other people should not know about it. Other reviewers mentioned "Troubled Production" and it shows. At the end I didn't even worry about fighting scenes, of course, CGI Dragon was weak, but the story was the biggest delay.
