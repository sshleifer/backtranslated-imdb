OK, if I were in the rental shop and someone asked me if the film was worth three for rent, I'd have to say no. The story was unlikely. I came to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves could not act. Sometimes it may be painful to watch (even if my wife thinks he's cute). Dan Aykroyd (usually great) was even a little disappointed as a crooked policeman. On the plus side, rendering is unpredictable. Cameron Diaz was good.
