This film is an obvious rip-off from Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson. You owe it to yourself to invest a few hours and watch the original. I found this one discontinuous and hard to follow, with many scenes that made no sense. I disagree with violence in movies, but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to drop one person after another, many of whom were only marginally connected to the story. When everyone else was killed, I was wondering why Frank didn't just throw Johnny's brains. Surely he could have, and Johnny certainly didn't feel like someone to trust. Another thing that bothers me is sex scenes; why do these people have sex with clothes? Should that turn us on? They certainly didn't think they had a chance to score PG. Nothing in this film seemed to play naturally. as if a person was watching people in real life, instead it was done in a heavy and shallow way.
