That might be for those who were in the summer camps, but it's certainly not a fun camp. I went to one of them but didn't make me shout up and down for joy. Instead, my head hurt. The first thing you'll notice is that Bill Murray had some hair in the 1970s. Yeah, and he didn't mind. But to get him a lot, you would have to give him a woman to follow him. It's not that some of the stunts can't be funny. For example, a running joke with one of the councilors who always wakes up elsewhere because of their bed. Instead, the jokes and stunts were wrongly set and executed. It just wasn't funny. Someone who loves comedy is pain. Others are glued to it for life. I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6, but it didn't come close. "F"
