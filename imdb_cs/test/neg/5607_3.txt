Rutger Hower Fans are NOT FOOLED - just a portrait in this movie and it's IT. This movie loses an extra point for the scam. I think Rutger Hower has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voice transmissions. <br /> <br /> The female leadership of this film is over this bad material in appearance and talent. the film is a dog and it is wasted. The story is a lawyer hoping for a one day partnership in a company to get suckered into having to carry a niece of Boss' across the country. They have several encounters on the road with various oddballs and it is a vehicle for various parodies and dude who played Napoleon Dynamite is thrown into the mix as a side character for good measure. This is a road-trip where extreme circumstances gave our suppressed hero a test and he slowly relaxed to the end of the film, ah not a love, yadda yadda .. if you want to see a hot chick that's uncomfortable for an hour and a half.
