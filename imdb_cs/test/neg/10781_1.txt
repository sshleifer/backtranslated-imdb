Sometimes the film is so bad you just look in amazement. This is one of those movies. Of course I can't help being biased. I'm from Chicago, so I watched the scenes carefully for accuracy and I can't find Billy Crystal at all. And I can't stand this English-style photo (Tony Scott, etc.) with a smoke machine working overtime and all the soft light. I suppose we're supposed to believe Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and conspiracy. If you really think about it, these guys should be closed, not bad, because they are more dangerous. And of course there is a clich√© of police on the brink of retirement. But the funniest scene is the climax where a good and bad boy machine gun to death at the Thompson Center (state building!) Course, it's a great building, but it's equivalent to making the White House a huge drug deal.
