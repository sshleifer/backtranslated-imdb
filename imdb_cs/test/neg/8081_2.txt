That's the movie. Good God, special effects suck in this movie. It's hard to suck more than anything to plot this movie, but special effects can do it. Let me try to explain how bad this film is. There are four punk-ass teenage motocross who ride in the woods in Duluth, MN. One of them is a stupid ass and tries to make a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. The helper comes to his aid, but gets stuck with them when the helicopter breaks. All five then realize that there is a forest fire that we see being run by a guy who throws out a ton of gas all over the forest. All they show us are his shoes, and show the scene after the scene of this kid's shoe walking around dumping the gas and running the fire. Meanwhile, the teenagers are trying to escape the fire just to find out that they have managed to get to them when they managed to get ahead of them (while they were walking through the forest on a dusty bike!) To launch more fires. He does it several times and the rescuer finally catches it and starts it on fire. I'm not gonna ruin the end, but this guy will have to shout "WHAT IS HELL?!?!" on the screen. However, they are now surrounded by fire and their only escape is a mine that is filled with methane gas. Yes, methane. I will not even try to describe the end because it is too ridiculous and you will enjoy it more if you do not see it. What you won't be because you can't expect to happen. This is due to the second big problem with this film: consistency. Is there any semblance of consistency too much to ask you? It seems to be. I can't even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (holding hands and feet when breaking wheels). I think every character breaks at least one limb and a few more than one. Then they limp until the scene ends, and then they forget that they have broken limbs. There is one scene where three of those who have broken legs start dancing. But then their wounds come back when the conspiracy needs them. Finally, CGI. If there is hell, it lies in watching the fire in this movie. All they did for the forest fires are the lines of dirt with the CGI fire. You can clearly see that a single CGI fire is along the paths, and all trees more than two feet from the path are left intact. And then they move away and show the whole forest, which is flooded with flames. It's hard to describe how ridiculous it looks, but I assure you that ridiculousness is quite impressive. This movie is one of those bad types. There are some occasions where it descends into a painful-bad category, but for the most part it remains above the line and is ridiculously inept. I can't wait to see other movies that have appeared in this package.
