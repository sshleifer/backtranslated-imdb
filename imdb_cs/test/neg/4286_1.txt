The film's director is Martin Campbell. After a show of a few of his credits in later years, this had to be one of his first directing concerts. He had more than a decent cast, but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that made no sense at all. Where was his head ............... was he on drugs? I was looking forward to this movie just because of Oldman & Bacon. Maybe it was a short break and Campbell had to "go". I can't imagine that the story that Campbell directed was even closer to the story he wrote. Oldman & Bacon, along with the rest of the cast, had to slide under the chairs if they went to the screening. As one poster pointed out, Karen Young made a pretty good battle scene with Bacon. She really let herself relax. It's unfortunate that I have to fill in more space just to stay in the lead of what IMDb requires, because I really have nothing to say about this non-inspiring film. One does not have to be forced to be a "windbag" when criticizing a terrible swing and wishing IMDb to change words to fill criticism.
