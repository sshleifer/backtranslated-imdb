This is really the worst movie I've ever seen, right from the start, the film goes straight down the hill with its raw musical score, bad behavior and total lack or real story or plot. Even for movie B, it's wrong. After reading some good reviews I thought I'd have an open mind and watch it. But all the bad reviews were right. I can't understand how anyone could enjoy it. I am a huge Sci-Fi fan and it was much more than I could swallow. Do yourself a favor and go to another movie. These are many other better films that deal with this subject. YOU ARE WARNING.
