This film was nothing like a book. I think the script writer had to want the Gone with the Wind sequel to be written down. That was his way of getting his ideas in any case. The only similarity between this film and the story it depicted was the names of the main characters and the location of the main event. None of the events in the film have been repeated in the book. For Gone with a wind fan (both books and film) it was deeply disappointing. If you loved Scarlett's book, don't watch this movie hoping it will play on the screen. They only share the title in common.
