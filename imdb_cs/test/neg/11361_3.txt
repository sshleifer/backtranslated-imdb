I don't understand why some of you (or many) put this movie out of 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that for some reason there are lower ratings? Sure, it can be a zombie flick with some splatter, but that's it. I'm not hate for zombie movies, but it was horrible. Indeed, I should actually call it a zombie soap, because that's how it is. Production is ... well, well. Hardly an attempt to develop a conspiracy, terrible action, silly effects, clich√© and sudden termination. Continue and like zombie movies, but never give it over 5.0. Frankly, the only reason you should watch this movie is to laugh. Seriously.
