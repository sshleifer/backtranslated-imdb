This is a strong recommendation for anyone who reads this review, which has never seen the Total Reality movie, don't waste your time and money on renting this poor apology for the movie. This is, without a peer, the only worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Since I saw it, I had the nightmares of this movie. Acting was terrible, and every amateur filmmaker could make a decent film. The film is ruthlessly tearing far better sci-fi movies like TimeCop or Total Recall (where the title seems to have been derived from). I'm sorry, but I think it's more fun to watch the cardboard box for two hours. If you've already seen this movie, I'm sorry you went through what I did.
