Eugen O'Neill's play is 4 and a half hours 1927, which appeared on the screen in less than two hours. The combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama played in the game did not remain in a very good age, and the cast has trouble with it, especially Nina Nort Norma Shearer and Marsden Ralph Morgan. Clark Gable as Ned Darrell comes out better but mostly because his is a grumpy character not given to philosophical reflections by others which better fit Gable's line. As soon as the plot settles into a quadrangle of love and the audience adapts to the voice, the film becomes more enjoyable. Another problem is the technique we use here. On stage, the action froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience. Here they are done as comments. You think it would work better, but because the action doesn't freeze, the actors are forced to suspend speaking and grimacing for the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts. In addition, it is difficult for all movie enthusiasts to watch this movie and not to think of the cheerful parody version of Grouch Marx in "Animal Crackers". Added to these disadvantages are some cuts for censorship reasons (Nina promiscuity is soft-peddled and there is no mention of her getting an abortion that is more central in the game) and a poor score (uncredited) that sounds like background music to fortification music century. O'Neill called this film "a terrible hash of condensation and idiotic censorship," and although "Strange Interlude" is nowhere near as big as his later "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day's Journey In Night". than this.
