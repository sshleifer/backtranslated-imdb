IS exists some reason to revive characters 10 years after reality, when the only reason he worked for the first time was because of the actors who play them. Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz - or better yet, who can replace them at reduced prices, as most studies know that continuing does not yield the same amount of revenue as the originals, so they tear the corners out of the way. Where good movies are going to play if the powerful Hollywood studios can clog 3,000 theaters that open a weekend with any turbulent feeling that the public can be deployed. Enough people, this sequel has to stop and the people of Hollywood have to start acting together or start distributing much better limbo products abroad. Wake up Hollywood because people have woken up and they don't just buy it because it's new and shiny. Give us good things and send the rest to the DVD shelves because we take back theaters once and for all !!!
