The only good thing about this movie is his last twist. In 97 minutes of the movie, we can only save one thought that was totally useless in this movie! For over 90 minutes, this film is just a collection of clichés, bad acting, stupid ideas and information, total lack of tension, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; all this in a pathetic and non-original plot? until the last three minutes, where a good idea finally appeared! It is nothing exceptional or an unusually original idea, but at least it was a "decent" good idea, the only one movie has! I will not spoil it, but I must say that I think that the idea of ​​a better plot, better FX and certainly a better acting performance, would turn into a good movie. If you watch this movie and last until the end, will you know what it is?
