I'm sorry, but I honestly can't imagine why anyone would want it. It's stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers aren't anything like they were at this show! Personally, I'm glad he was canceled after the first few episodes. Such a show would certainly be fine if everyone knew that home trainers really didn't, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone knows about it. If someone out there who watched it actually believed it to be what's going on in the homeschooler's life, then I sincerely sorry for them. This reminds me of the image of the children's home in the "Mean Girls". It's really sad that people think this way. This is a complete waste, IMHO.
