How about this day and era, people are still so stupid that they think other stupid things are smart? Maybe stupid people like watching things that make them feel smart. Such as "War at Home". "It's even more stupid than stupid people watching it. There are no jokes, just half jokes and mild gags that barely require a small inner smile. Acting is your typical, indecent, idiotic, standard flailing-limb sitcom type of play. And why, why did this crap replace the arrested development? You have to give it to Fox. They know they have to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers. You see, the reason why Arrested Development was not massively popular was because he was so smart. It was so clever that it made stupid people feel that they were so stupid. And, of course, if a stupid man meets a clever man, that stupid man hates a clever man. Most of the time as well. Either that or try a smart person. If you like this exhibition and you are one of the stupid people, I can't understand what it has to be, not have open eyes and open minds. I can't understand what it must be like mindless, laughing drones affected by every little thing. People laughing at laughter are basically parrots. Trained, obedient, soulless parrots. Maybe I shouldn't insult parrots by comparing them to you. You know who you are. (If I looked like a bastar in this review, it's because I'm so angry that AD has been canceled.)
