I attended the screening of this film. Travolta came to do Q&A after the movie. It was a small projection room in Tribeca. I didn't come out of courtesy to what I wanted to do. This is the worst case filmmaking. Running the script was poorly written. The writer writes in one voice. The dialogue was great and clich√©. As this writer / director got Scarlet Johansen, John Travolta and Lions Gate Entertainment to support her, it's the only great thing she has done in this fiasco. In fact, I recommend this film to all novice screenwriters, directors and filmmakers. Because when you tell you that you are wasting your time and not being able to reach your goals. Hey ... just look at this crap and tell yourself ... if they do it after it's possible to make it possible. PS- Travolta did a great Q&A ... he was fine, he spoke freely and was a nice guy on the ground. The director / writer stood next door. When John tried to join her, she stood up like a piece of wood and never joined him. I looked at her and thought ... how this person was able to "climb" successfully to agents, studios, top talent ... when she couldn't open her mouth to project her own movie. The conclusion from several of us who attended was that they must have strong family ties in the family. After you look at it, you should follow him with Guy Ritchie's masterpiece with zero star "Swept Away" with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance of the Madonna's wife. She is so bad in the movie and it looks so bad that it was her way to go back to her for all the torture he took from her at home.
