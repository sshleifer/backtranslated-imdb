It could have been a good biopic, but what a mess! I had this movie when I was the theater director. When I put the movie together and watched, I thought I had some reels out of order. As it turned out, no, and if I did, no one would notice. I couldn't figure out what was happening! Anyone who has gone largely felt the same way!
