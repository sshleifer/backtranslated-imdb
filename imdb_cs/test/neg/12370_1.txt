Without a shadow of doubt, it is and will probably always be the worst movie I ever had when I saw my whole life. Take 5 wooden actors who were fired from the acting school because they were so wooden that someone was sitting on them and thought they were a bench. <br /> <br /> Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old VHS types that cost Â£ 20 on eBay. Add a horrible story with no effects and yes you have this movie. What a shock it was. They couldn't even save him by having a suitable girl in it. She was fat and ugly and was the worst of all. I actually watched it all because I couldn't believe this bullshit was ever funded. MISS AT ALL COSTS
