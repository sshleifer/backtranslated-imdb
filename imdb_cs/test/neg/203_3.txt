Armor <br /> <br /> The best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if you get some red light burns asking for money, you can shoot them in the face. Armored guards in this thriller do not use their protective power to purge the rogue, they use their positions to smear their employers. When an immigrant Ty (Columbus Short) lands with a polio trunk society, he feels like he has found his much in life. Unfortunately, when he finds out that his associates (Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne) are planning to take a $ 42 million shipment, you have to fortify yourself? and funds? inside an armored truck. A lengthy cabaret with a blazing fence and called performances, armored is a totally forgotten film. <br /> <br /> Besides, if you really want to jack millions, it's much easier to just disguise yourself as an ATM.
