I saw this movie without knowing about it. The split screen device was immediately irritating and things didn't improve for me after the title sequence ended. The storyline, the characters and the dialogues were all extremely clich√© - the poor of the reprehensible family would be thrown out of the house, wanting to get out of his 'lot', coming back, changing his voice, dressing in the clothes of others, being adopted by the gay man he continues to shame on his way up to become part of an international set of drugs to take British aristocrats. The property of Patricia Highsmith (talented mr ripley) should be sued by the creator of this film. Triple screen with me, along with more than 120 minutes duration, highlights almost non-existent editing. You can't decide which image works and it's the strongest, why not show three and hope you can do one of them. This trick eliminated any connection or interest I had with any of the characters. An important dialogue was repeated three times on each screen, as if to say "this is an important / moving / deep moment, ok!". <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. <br /> <br />
