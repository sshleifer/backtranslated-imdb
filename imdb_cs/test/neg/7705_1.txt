This fake document is wrong on many points, it's wrong, it has uninteresting characters, but the biggest problem I have with it is the basic assumption. This film uses the idea that H.P. Lovecraft traveled to Italy and that part of his work is based on real supernatural events he has witnessed. I am willing to go along with the idea that he traveled to Italy (only to suspend infidelity), but that part of his work is based on reality and that Insmouth is utter nonsense. First of all, Lovecraft did not believe in the supernatural, clearly states in his letters that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters, where they showed that people were not so strange after all. Another myth used in this film is that Lovecraft was an expert on occultism, was not, all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources. So we ended up with the film people joke a lot at each other and when we finally see a monster, it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it, you just feel the pain in your love of horror. After seeing the movie Frankenstein Lovecraft said he was sorry for Mary Shelley because he felt her work was defeated. I'm sorry Lovecraft.
