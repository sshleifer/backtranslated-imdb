I carefully checked if there was another movie named as this one and it wasn't! But I really don't think we've all seen the same movie! No way ! How can you vote more than "1" for this movie ?! Let's say the idea of ​​this movie is acceptable. Oh, and playing Dan Gordon (Chris) is pretty good. But these are the only two things that are acceptable in this project. Others are ... terrible? It's a very delicate word to describe the acting of other actors, directing, (so to speak) "special" effects, even the way the crew has filmed! I don't even like the way the moving cameramen moved to record the scenes! This may be the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I don't really remember a movie lower than this ... Maybe it is, but ... I don't think ... Ehh, what's going on, it's done ... That's the movie and it's too late for anyone to change anything. I voted "1" but my realistic vote starts with "-" (minus) in front.
