I just don't get these reviews! I can't think they're written by such a LOG fan who would worship anything he has ever done without questioning whether it's really good. this film was a pointless project. I could forgive the ridiculous conspiracy if I left the cinema when I laughed more than twice. At one point, I thought it might only be me before I realized that barely all the laughter had been driven from the rest of the audience. it stretched for 90 minutes), but he thought the odd piece of the classic LOG dialogue or visual joke (as at the beginning of each program) would carry the film. After 5 minutes of a 17th-century plot, I begged it to end (little I knew it would continue for the rest of the film). It wasn't just funny. <br /> <br /> I was just massively disappointed and I don't see history being too kind to it, though a few die-hard fans write enthusiastic reviews.
