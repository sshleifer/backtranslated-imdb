OK. I admit it. I'm a huge fan of b-movies. Back when Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens dominated the roost. And then the bad movies were still good. Unfortunately, it's a bad movie that's just bad. Even the small portraits of Brinke Stevens (reprising her role as Linda from "Slumber Party Massacre" 21 years earlier) won't help one out. A cheerleader group gets stuck in a luxurious cabin after their delivery breaks. Psycho watches them one by one and catches them in various states of undressing. Bad script, bad direction and terrible acting make this one bad! Skip this turkey and go rent the "Slumber Party Massacre." 1/2 *
