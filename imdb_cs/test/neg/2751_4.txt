I have read a lot of reviews on IMDb (well, all five that were written at the time I write it), and I am surprised by the amount of praise that has appeared on The Brideless Groom, which is undoubtedly one of the smaller Stoog comedies. I prefer the older ones, where it was Larry, Curly and Moe, although Shemp gained recognition for most of the funny scenes in Sing Song of Six Pants, another short Stooges that is only slightly entertaining, but far better than Brideless Groom. In fact, the movie is the only entertainment scene, a "no-hit-a-lady" scene that is barely entertaining and is 15 minutes into the movie. It's not very promising in a 17-minute comedy. Shemp is a voice coach whose uncle died and left him a $ 500,000 inheritance, provided he got married within 48 hours. it is, but when Shemp learns about it, there is only 7 hours left. This is a premise that has been made and redone before, but at the time this film was made, it was not a massive clich√©. There are a number of gags throughout the film, none of which are so close to the comedy level for which the three Stoogs are so widely known. Does Stooges seem to have gotten into the same problems that have plagued so many Shirley Temple movies? there is too little reliance on content and too much reliance on being there. The standard features of Stoogs are here, Moe is mediocre, whose mediocrity is certainly not used in this film, and the sound effects of slapstick (though with more exceptions than usual) are quite entertaining, but involved in standard slots in this movie. The line "Hold hands, you lovebirds" is immortal. The rest of the film isn't. Among the other people who have reviewed this movie, there is a lot of talk about being one of the best Stooges shorts that won't find one weak moment about how it's their best from the first thirties. It's just not true. Certainly I understand the level of automatic respect for milestone classics and giants of early comedy that are certainly three Stoogs, but this respect is damaged when poorer films are praised more than they should be. Brideless Groom deserves some respect because it's Stooges, but for the same reason it should be better. Three Stoogs were better than this.
