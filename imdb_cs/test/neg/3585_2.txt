Egads. I thought Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I'm not so sure anymore, Willy gives Keanna some tough competition with his performance "I'm from Plaster" in this movie. Combine it with the fact that there is hardly any conspiracy, and not the only sympathetic character, and it is quite hard to recommend this turkey. Natasha tries her best, but even Julia Roberts couldn't save this movie from the dark. <br /> <br /> Avoid if it's really late and there's nothing else. - Hell, just read the book.
