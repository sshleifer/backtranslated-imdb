"My blue sky" is boring. The land is erratic; characterization and dialogue stinks; musical numbers, although occasionally organized in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd but also lyrically banal, painfully bright and emotionally hollow. Leaders, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; however, despite all their talented efforts to lift rough and uncomplicated material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their proven talents in other projects, are more or less cyphers. It's really the only reason to watch "My Blue Heaven". One reason ... one star: Mitzi Gaynor, in his film debut. Its total screen time is probably less than ten minutes but so what? Her pert and promising personality on screen, her cat beauty and her exceptional charisma shine brilliantly and make these minutes the most remarkable, unforgettable and exciting moments in the movie. If you appreciate the opportunity to see a huge young talent on the rise, then look at Miss Mitzi Gaynor in "My Blue Sky". By the way, I despised (and urged you to avoid) Drew Casper's manic, obsessive-compulsive DVD commentary on this movie. His comments are utterly volatile, dire, discreetly challenging, often poorly timed with what is being played on the screen, and galloping with excess nerve energy.
