I saw the * star * of this movie at The Daily Show, and I thought I could tune in (the movie premiered at Comedy Central, then went to theaters). Oh Vey! This makes "Shakes the Clown" look like "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. No one laughs, no smile. This film will make your face come out in pimples and your eyes burst like last remnants of "robbers". I can't even think of a worse movie, whether it's "Manos" or "Ishtar". As Pythons motioned, run, run! Why did anyone like this if they didn't use their own money? Horror is that there is not one good line, not one good joke, and only one bad thing ... making this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel that if it were right, it would be nice. As it is, I need new pancreas to leap so loudly. The hell he was involved in this travesty.
