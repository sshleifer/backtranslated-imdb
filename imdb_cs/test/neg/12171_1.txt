When this series aired, I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long series in the "The Fugitive" and "The Incredible Hulk" genres, where the protagonist chases across the country looking for solutions to their problems. In this case, the hero's problem is his gradual aging in the opposite direction. I liked what I saw at these shows. Behavior was good especially the sad relationship between the lead character and his wife. The problem is: They canceled her before she had a chance to quit. (either it or I missed the last episodes). They never got a chance to wrap the story because they knew it was canceled. Poof was just gone. However, as I said before I could skip the last episodes. But my proof to the contrary is that I rented the tape. Where I stopped in the show. The leading character's wife dies in the fire, which began with the persecution of the royal famous business. While she's gone, the hero is kidnapped. It ends with his friends realizing he has to go save him from the store. End. Last episode. In the video: His wife will not die, but fire will escape with him. As soon as he gets into the store, he and his wife share a strange moment and then disappear from existence. Sudden, stupid and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video out and decided to mark it at the end, which didn't care about how bad it was. They could also show some footage of the first atomic bomb blasts. Almost Pythonesque. The show had a cool opening title sequence set for David Bowie's song of the same name
