Mad, somewhat moderate, lively, childish humor abounds in this urban boy who turned a wannabe farmer's story. He is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length. I can most praise the "Son of the Law" by saying that for the most part he avoids humor for toilets. The main problem is that all the characters lack heat and Pauly Shore is so harsh that he is the most dangerous hero. There are some fun pieces including farm animals, and that's about it. The story is so simplistic and predictable that "Jury Duty" seems to look like "Gone with the Wind". - MERK
