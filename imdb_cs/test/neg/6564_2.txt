No one expects Star Trek movies to be high, but fans expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this film had a confused, unlikely plot that left me crouching - that's by far the worst of nine (yet) movies. Even the chance to watch familiar characters in another movie can't save this movie - including goofy scenes with Kirk, Spock, and McCoy at Yosemite. <br /> <br /> I'd say this movie is not worth renting, and it's hard to watch, but for True Fan, who needs to see all the movies, hiring this movie is probably the only way to see it - even cable channels to avoid this film.
