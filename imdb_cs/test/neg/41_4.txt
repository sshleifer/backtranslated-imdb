The film opens a cult leader who attempts to resurrect a dead member with his followers who sing his rebirth when the sun sets in on the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) believes in his power completely honestly, so he develops that he collapses with what seemed to be a heart attack. They can't keep him alive, all involved, doctors and nurses are convicted of attacking the demonic spirit of Reanhauer attacking the damned body of Sister Sherri (.. Jill Jacobson's large-area), which targets anyone who uses it as a tool of revenge. Forced against her will, without recalling such damage, Sherri's host body kills the selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's colleague, Sister Tara (Marilyn Joi), begins a rather blooming romance with a blinded patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), once a stellar footballer whose mother was a voodoo practitioner. Through Marcus's knowledge, passed from mom, Tara discovers she has possessions and how she can save Sherri before they unconsciously murder everyone. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land) worries about her present state and well-being. Well, this was my first movie, Al Adamson, and I have to agree with his critics that just out of this movie itself, it seems to hold them along with paper clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is excited and somewhat ridiculous. A little soft nonsense like a fill, some demonic possessions that fit into the mix (actually, Sherri speaks a different voice when he's obsessed), with a naughty nurse's behavior (three sisters in the movie are all sexually active and free - spirited) and a little violence / gore. The film is basically shot in small rooms with boring dialogue from a somewhat secular cast. Sexual situations aren't as hard of a core, and Al often shoots them without revealing it. The film looks embarrassingly cheap and there is an awkward excitement, even though the score (... which sounds like something from Dark Shadows) helps a little. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (.. as Beth's sister, who seems to be a nymphomaniac, even screwing up a nut patient, always complains of a disease she really doesn't have, with enough hair on her chest to declare her Neanderthal) aren 't A bad looking, and Adamson story-line, though fragile, is somewhat coherent (.. it seems that rarely directs movies that are). Overall, the film looks like it costs $ 5 and Adamson just can't overcome budget constraints (.. or in my opinion, create an unpleasant atmosphere that is due to the story and the boring scenarios that make the story). John F Goff has the role of a hospital psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri, not believing in the idea of ​​being obsessed, and continually arguing with Peter. I looked at the unrated "lost" version, which in my opinion is the real version that looks at Sister Sherri.
