I saw this movie on a show that showed bad B-movies and tried to buy them. Basically it was just a long trailer, but it gave you a really good idea of ​​what the film is about. After seeing the trailer, I thought I'd rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but it could still be fun in a perverse sense. It's not in any sense of the word. The film has two (or I should say four) things that are going to be done, and that's not the number of deaths, women. They are very hot and naked and Mrs. Lovell could be a legitimate actress, but not in a film where the T&A and corny dialogues are emphasized. It is neither horror or scary unless you talk about watching actors trying to act. Production value is pathetic, acting is worse and writing is the worst. What was the point of doing this movie? Scare people? Tear off "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"? Trying to be funny? Show off women's breasts? To put a guy's head in retarded clothing, with fake hands and feet? To have a character just say the word "Snow" over and over again? To have no real violence, but to have enough nudity in an attempt to hide the fact that there is no real action? To make a sequel to the movie no one has seen or will ever watch? I made a mistake in picking up this movie, don't make this mistake too. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
