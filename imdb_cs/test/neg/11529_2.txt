Well, I went out with a few friends to see this movie, we went one hour before the show started to settle down. So you can imagine that we got there and saw this movie :). But this excitement soon turned into horror, this film is a complete failure, it's just hard to be funny, that its sad, script is badly written and relies on the actors to spend it on it ... good performance throughout the film was by Stefan C. Schaefer, who was great, the conspiracy was weak and even "funny" scenes felt forced and unnatural, given that the main actors are some of the best Icelandic comedians it's very special ... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say this movie to anyone because it will try hard and never really give it.
