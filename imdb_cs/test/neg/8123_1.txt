I don't care if this show assumes it will communicate deep news of human existence. The show is stupid ... how can anyone feel the pleasure of watching it? Yet it was so well received. This reflects the sad state of things for Joe Moron outside. I tried to watch this program when it first appeared, as friends talked about. Laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialogue, Inane made me cry. It is beyond the belief that people can watch this show. But I think the creators had the last laugh ... to be rich by being p.ss of those people who would watch a show like this. I bet they laugh all the way to the bank.
