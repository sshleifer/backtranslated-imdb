Seagal was off the mark with this movie. I am a fan of his and came to expect cool fighting scenes and sharp one liners, but this movie had none of it, instead he had injections and raw music. Even if you are a fan of his I suggest you keep away from this movie and watch it under siege or even on a deadly place instead.
