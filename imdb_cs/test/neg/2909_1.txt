And maybe I'll be generous. The vast majority of the film is made up of looped shots ... a charming monster, two women who rehearsed again, a charming monster, a lot of people in the pool, a charming monster again, nothing worse for wear, even though it was injured. You'll get a picture. I limited myself to screaming "GET ON THE IT ALREADY" on several occasions. <br /> <br /> And it doesn't help make the records used badly created. The sound is uncomfortably synchronized with the image. And in one scene, where they were trying to get "art" lighting and camera techniques, there is a clearly visible person holding a flashlight that only provides scene lighting. My hope is that production was the victim of some terrible catastrophe in which the original soundtrack and most of the records were destroyed, but they decided to release it as well, paved together from the editor's floor, in memory of the heroic crew members Their lives have been trying to save the real movie - the one that has a plot and an interesting dialogue. Unfortunately, this is no proof, and I am forced to conclude that in the immortal words of Joel and Bots, they simply do not care. <br /> <br />
