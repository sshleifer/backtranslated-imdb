Poor Jane Austen should be happy not to be around to see this horrible wreck of adaptation. So many of Jane Austen's great films have recently come to deserve to be permanently buried along with two other films that I despise â€” The Man in Gray Flannel Suit and 1969 Copperfield's. point book. Jane Austen has played in Gothic mania in her company and much of the novel is the tongue in her face. But the film is serious and very melodramatic. Lighthearted, a fun-blasting taste of Austen's writing is totally and strikingly missing in this cumbersome foray iinto horror meets the drama period. Catherine's imagination scenes are gratuitous and uninteresting. Henry Tilney is also terribly uncomfortable. Why, I ask, would anyone fall for him? If you're looking for a fun evening of Jane Austen, watch Emma instead!
