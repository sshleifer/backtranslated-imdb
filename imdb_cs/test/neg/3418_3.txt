Geoffrey Wright, director of "Romper Stomper", transplant of Shakespeare's "Macbeth" in contemporary, criminal underworld Melbourne, Australia. The result is a demigodic cinema. Sam Worthington is Macbeth and goes to look very confident and bored. Victoria Hill, who wrote the script with Wright, is Lady Macbeth and is neither terrible nor good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only cast in the cast who exudes any authority. The rest, including Gary Sweet, is unnecessary and incorrectly directed. The film shot by Will Gibson, a late film, lacks a picture. Everything is too clean and too deliberately lit. Wright's direction is, in extreme cases, uninspired and action sequences are confusing and awkward. The film, which is misrepresented as "Australia's strongest movie at all", is sometimes violent and reasonably bloody, but cannot bring a single moment of impact. Slowly moving and very conceited, this silver silver version of the classic game is the epitome of the misguided.
