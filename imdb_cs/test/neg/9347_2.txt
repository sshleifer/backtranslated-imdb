Having missed out on TCM UK in this myriad of times, I decided to look at it with regard to its science fiction / adventure / camp family tree: I knew I'd be in a totally stupid ride - but it was also terribly bad! Indeed, possibly due to the characters involved, the scripts tear off many sci-fi titles, then a recent year - SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976; to the point that it was filmed on some of its own sets!) , STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! The storyline is simple, but not entirely involved: it can be inferred from the title that water has become scarce on a planet where all this is happening - so our beech-heroes take on themselves to steal the ice blocks from the tyrannical Templar rulers. It is also a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing!) In search of her father, the deposed king; Incidentally, the cast includes other famous descendants: Anjelica Huston (daughter of John) as one of the pirate bands - fortunately, the actress' mistake in taking such a role would soon forget in the wake of her Oscar victory (under her father is no less) for PRIZZI HONORA ( 1985). Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as "Supreme Commander", filmmakers decided to have a legend of their own movie - 78-year-old John Carradin (who is seen chained to an operating table during one short scene!). <br /> <br /> The most notable bits (for all the wrong reasons) are: a stranger using a toilet; castration machine; clumsy antiquity (including karate style!) inevitable robotic companions; goofy slave / eunuch make-up wears a hero in one place; recurring attacks of "space herps" (anything); the climax in which the characters are aging as they go through the time warp (Crosby gets pregnant, gives birth and sees her son grow up within 30 seconds, while lead man Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford who is determined) Hank Worden for this scene!) - by the way , the jumps that have been accepted here (with the intention of marking fast time) are not only unsuccessful, but also totally irritating.
