Good cast ... Good idea, but it turns out to be wrong because hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in the courts. So many good actors and everyone's acting so bad! So why did everyone get to this mess ... And yes, it has good points like lighting, etc. But in the end I was thinking about two things ... How could so many talents lead to such a bizarre mess? What's the accent that Nigel Hawthorne follows? He's a great actor and so what's the accent? Can't identify? What was he trying to do? Maybe it's his gentle indication, as if he told us: "I got involved in turkeys, so here's the crap accent on how to go about it!"
