I will say one thing for Herman, USA: it will probably always play well Minnesota audience. I can't imagine there's another place in the world where a reference to a quick life of Bemidji or a line like "I know there's something wrong with Iowa guys" would bring a house. I actually enjoyed the first hour or so. Basically, a bunch of lone boys who take personal advertising and find out that their city is endowed with willing female suitors (is it a word that is gender specific?). It is not progressive, certainly, but it is charming in itself. Too bad the filmmakers felt the need to turn to a fancy subplot about a wandering goldsmith and her violent husband. Overall, it's just too much cloning for your own good, but you have to put some props on the movie with the guts to give a guy with Kevin Chamberlin to build a nude love scene. I will always praise the display of people who do not meet the usual standards of beauty as a sexual, caring human being, but that is not enough to make Herman, USA. To paraphrase Jella Biafra, it's nostalgia for an age that never existed.
