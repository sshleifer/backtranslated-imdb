First of all, I want to focus the big and middle mediator on the Tromo DVD-distribution crew, which was actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this killer movie pivot on the back of the cover! The synopsis only randomly mentions who is the person responsible for the Graduation Day Massacre, for Christ! I don't care how horrible or predictable the 80s can be; just a mention of who destroyed it! So, the word advise if you also buy a Troma double-function containing "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell", no ??? repeat NO? turn the box over and read it back! Watching the movie is a painful experience, but reading the back would really spoil everything. <br /> <br /> Now, just like a real movie? Oh no! Personally, I am a fan of Herb Freed's film work. Actually, I don't really know if I should admire him? All Herb's films are pretty bad and amateur, but at the same time you can say that his direction is lively and full of good intentions! Unlike "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil", he followed the current trend of the popular genre and tried to earn typical high school films. To offer a minimum of originality, all of the victims in "Graduation Day" are promising athletes and members of the same coach trainer George Michaels (amazing name! I think Herb Freed is a fan of "Wham!"). During the opening titles, we see a young girl dramatically dying on the field, moments after winning a 30-second running race. Discussing whether her trainer and team team colleagues have pushed too much to their physical limits is increased, but one particular individual goes a step further and begins to sadistically kill anyone he considers responsible for Laura's death. What a demented little movie! The script must be one of the most coherent I have ever seen, with lots of reds and parcels of land that go nowhere, and death sequences that are almost too cursed for words! Football, which is attached to the spear, is stray, others are tousled by the absurdly large sword, and the unhappy bastard of them even falls to his death on the masked bed of spikes! Herb focuses on the sophistication and fast pace of killing so much that he completely forgets the parcels he had previously mentioned in the movie! For example, Nurse Laura returns home from military training and an investigation into the circumstances of her death appears to have begun. In the middle of the film, however, her character in the film hardly appears. Also, stepfather girls are referred to as violent drunk, but this interesting given instantly gets ignored as well. Instead of carefully mounted tension and misleading red herring, we served disco and roller skating and? course ?? Numerous images of unattractive 80s chicks that undress their peaks. While it's really bad, "Graduation Day" can count on a serious cast! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "The City of the Living Dead") performs extensively as a demanding coach, Carmen Argenziano ("When There Are Foreign Calls", "The Accused"), appears briefly as a police detective investigating a growing number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dracula's Dog") has a very entertaining role as headmaster. Teen beauties include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Damn, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is reason enough to count the "Graduation Day" among the most quintessential slashers of the early 1980s. It's a silly movie, but fun and laughter are guaranteed!
