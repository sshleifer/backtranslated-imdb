CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a special documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. American-born George Greenough surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years. In the mid-1970s he joined Surf Mag and David Elfick, a filmmaker, to create this visually interesting story about life and photography. The result is a 75-minute CRYSTAL VOYAGER. Even in the 70s viewers were a bit confused by this film, not even surfing-film, nor surfing the movie, because George swims on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard .... it compensates for boring George blasting (sometimes so dry or droll that it was actually funny .. like almost igniting or falling over something) with a magnificent 'you' there 'sliding through the wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to Pink Floyd's music. In 1974, when the Sydney Opera House was opened, there was also a cinema. Crystal Voyager has been booked here as a handy sports OZ pic and has become a hit by default: since the opera tickets cost much more than a movie ticket, viewers have seen this movie as an apology for "were the Sydney Opera House" ... so The film recorded a trade as a low budget attraction for locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they saw the show 'there'. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd of tractor and reputation spread. As a result, he was associated with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy run across the UK and Europe as a dual function. In the 1970s I ran it in a coastal cinema and the crowd was dissatisfied with it all. Recently, George has reappeared in the Lord of the Flies style with another well-photographed DOLPHIN GLIDE marine adventure that offers diving and swimming with wild dolphins from Byron Bay. It's eccentric 20 minutes short with even more eccentric 20 minutes as George did it short. Each of them met with the collective yawning of both the media and the public in January 2005 .... all this makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER "the ones you had to be there years ago". However on Oz Surf's special night in the outdoor cinema last year 2000 people appeared .... but then 2000 they appear every night to see something out there during this summer movie season ..... so damn thing splashed another box office binge. How many people really enjoyed it is a very open discussion. Again, they were more than likely to be confused by such a crazy movie with a staggering reputation. However, since 1975, Elfick has embarked on a stellar career as a major producer and director of many award-winning Australian and international films. Look for NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear and simultaneous applause for its achievements. However, somewhere, somewhere, George is moving away, looking for something else that can be turned or turned on.
