As a flagship show, Show Attack (AOTS) is endemic of the greater fall of the G4 television; it is a show (and a station) that has gone so far as to overlook sex to try to cover its glaring mistakes. Its predecessor, Screensavers, was a place where technology issues are solved and the latest and greatest technologies are sought. It was a nice show with nice staff and it was fun to see some modding and other experiments that the crew could put together. <br /> <br /> The acquisition of TechTV by G4 bothered some long-term fans of the station. , but early returns were really promising. The emphasis on playing was a nice addition and I really enjoyed a lot of E3 coverage and other great fun events. Unfortunately, AOTS now stands as a shell of its former self. Those who oversee the channel have moved the focus of the channel away from technology and games, and everything that could cause the drooling of young adult men. As a result, AOTS spends so much time on a tour of Olivia Munn or on a tour of the adult film industry as it involves games. It's so bad that it's virtually unnoticeable. While some may enjoy the joy of this kind of thing, those who really enjoy the game may wonder where the good coverage came. Equally disturbing, young players who could tune into the G4 and think about getting games - that an active gaming group between 10-15 years old - is instead feeding, which is targeted at a more mature audience. Things like this are expected on a channel like HBO or Cinemax. The G4 is tragic. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another male-focused channel, has good CSI programming. AOTS and G4 have very few good offers. <br /> <br /> Damn, really.
