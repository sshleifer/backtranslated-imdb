I'm really surprised to see all these positive reviews of this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I don't like "these kinds of movies." While I can enjoy a good carefree Hollywood blockbuster like Die Hard 4.0, I like the 'Dogma' kind of movies, or 'real-life-as-it-is' -films anyway, are well done. A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special fx, no luxury seats. Just a good story combined with excellent acting performance and the result is an excellent movie. Is there nine lives without dramatic camera angles, special fx and fantastic spots? Yes. Is it a good movie? I'm glad you asked. The answer is: Absolutely not. First of all, everyone is worried about acting performances. I'm terribly sorry, but you can act all you want, but if the story and dialogue are not believable, acting is instantaneous. And that's exactly the case with nine lives. Not once did I feel when I watched 'Nine Lives' that I watched real people who have a real conversation. I felt that I was watching the actors trying to come across "real characters" when they said things they would never say "real man" in real circumstances. Below are some excerpts from the dialogue. If you think reading ten lines of (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your film experience STOP READ HERE. If you want a good laugh, continue reading. The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. Want examples? Lots of 'Nine Lives'. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 1: <br /> <br /> Read the picture. Couple visits their dirty rich friends in their new mansion. The woman sees this castle of the house and tells her husband: <br /> <br /> Woman: I could get used to it (that means expensive house). Man: No. Woman: Why not? It can be. Man: No. They are who they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound - we are who we are. <br /> <br /> Does she like sound? Her man acts like a jerk, but she likes the sound. Then there is an elderly couple walking around them holding hands. That's what a woman comes up with: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They're like kids after school. They lived so much. Share it all. I love you. Are they like kids after school? And then the most used clich√©s you've ever heard? Completing with 'I Love You'? Does it say while her husband is to her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, no. If anything like that, this kind of dialogue made me want to strangle some of the characters in the movie for saying these horrible, horrible things. EXAMPLE 2: <br /> <br /> Older mother, dad and younger daughter at a funeral. Dad: I didn't realize Andrew was religious. Mom: It's for comfort. Daughter: It's for strength. Mom: Life is ephemeral. Dad and daughter BURST OUT LAUGHING. Yeah, this liner will crack at any time, especially at the funeral! I'm sorry I was joking around here. <br /> <br /> And on and on and on .... <br /> <br /> How does the camera work? It's not even there. "Boring" would be a compliment. It is supposed to be "realistic"; instead, you are missing half of the actor's facial expressions (the only thing left to watch in this movie), while half of the time the camera is aimed at someone's back or side instead of the face. Conclusion? Don't say I warned you! It's a good movie to rent if you want a date or something to appear in the movie because they don't care whether the movie is playing or not after the first five minutes. Overrated and more boring than watching grass grow a little summing it up.
