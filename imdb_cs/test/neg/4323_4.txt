Lon Chaney Jr returns to wood and the Kharis mummy is looking for his partner Annan, whose soul now resides in the beautiful host of Amina's offspring (Ramsay Ames). Andoheb, Arkana's high priest (George Zucco) leaves Yousef Bey (John Carradine), who is in charge of Kharis to continue his criminal ways. Tom (Robert Lowery) has to find a way to save his beloved Ammin from a future mummy. The routine, predictable entry into the Kharis series proves that almost every film follows a specific format / formula. The city is threatened by skulking, a single-armed corpse camouflaging in a package that seems to have been gifted with superhuman power to choke the life of able-bodied men who are confined with relative ease by the mere chokehold from Kharis. Frank Reicher, who saw Kharise in action .. and knows a lot about Egyptian history .. in the previous movie (Mummy's Tomb), proves that anyone who happened to have survived a previous mummy is sure to die if they return in the next step. Well made, but lacking originality to distinguish it from other movies in the series. Sadly, Carradine goes through his role as the evil Yousef Bey. An embarrassed scenario has the Kharis error, known for wearing a crippled, lame right hand, carrying subconscious Amin with both arms long distances without any negative consequences. One aspect, a shocking climax where Tom's attempt at heroism doesn't go as planned, as Kharis holds his hostage in distress, is slightly raised by the film.
