New York attorney conspires to get rid of her senile mother after meeting attractive, affordable women. Screenwriter Robert Klane, who has adapted his novel (the kind of paperbacks he would buy for dirty parts), doesn't seem to have any knowledge of mental illness: for him it's just an excuse for sad comedies and scatological jokes. George Segal - who mainly played in war and spy paintings in the 1960s - became one of America's greatest sad sack comics at that time; his nutty reaction and batty reaction rival only his mother's inscrutabilities. Segal is well paired with Trish Van Devere, and their moments of joining (even when they are played for laughter) are really the only sequences one can draw to himself. Ruth Gordon, dear as she is, is just too much - and less of it. It's one of the worst directorial and editing films I've ever seen from so-called professionals. The promising scenes that do not play at full effect are accidentally disconnected from the other moments that are infinitely diverging, causing the cracks, torn film to destroy themselves long before it is actually over. * 1/2 from ****
