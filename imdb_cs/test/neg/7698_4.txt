These days, Ridley Scott is one of the greatest directors and producers, and can command enormous sums of command films - especially because he has films like ALIEN, GLADIATOR and BLADE RUNNER. So from this partial list of his credits, it's obvious that he is an amazing talent. However, if you are following this very early effort you have made while in a film school, you should probably hardly say it was designed for size. This is because although it has a nice work with the camera and style, the film is hopelessly boring and unwavering. However, since it wasn't meant for general release and it was just a training place, I'm willing to look at it charitable - that is, a score of 4. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, the film is part of CINEMA 16: European Shorts. There are 16 shorts on this DVD. Most of them aren't great, but because it contains a MAN WITHOUT HEAD, COPY, RABBIT and WASP, it's a great DVD for short film lovers and it's worth buying.
