I was sitting in less painful operations than I was watching this movie. If you try it, you think it's going to be something in Ritchie's veins ... ... Think again! Production, dialogue, gaming, screenplay, filmmaking and conspiracy were all about the worst I've ever seen in the movie. My fave part in all honesty was the final credits. In all the history of cinema there has never been a better excuse to turn off the TV and go out and do something better with your life. <br /> <br /> They were working with the root canal and did not spare this time and money!
