I watched this video because I love Malta and this movie was filmed there in full. Very unsatisfactory because it cannot capture any taste or beauty of the island - just hot, dry and infertile elements. The film was boring, boring, totally incoherent from start to finish, arrogant and without any conceivable plot. You had to be spiritual to follow the plot line or its lack. Surely he had his moments; but so it goes to the dentist. In short, I would much rather endure another colonoscopy before looking at this horrible mess again. It was so bad that I couldn't sleep. There are quite a few "Eurotrash" movies out there that were apparently made without adult supervision. That's one of them. Who is Nadia Cassini? I've never seen a more beautiful set of legs before. She is the only saving grace of this film. Worrying was also the cruel boar described in the final credits. A boar who has been released on someone's property (Malta has very few domestic mammals; all are small - rats, bats, etc.) And then the dogs are before being shot. Despite this film go to Malta - it is a beautiful, colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun.
