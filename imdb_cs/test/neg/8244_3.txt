Oh, what the hell am I going to reveal the secret: this movie stinks! Yeah, there are some handy dinosaur effects that for their time was probably really exciting to watch. They don't cut it now, but they're not terrible. They're just good enough to tolerate it without being able to laugh. So just sitting there and I'm sitting and watching, not laughing, not excited, just, good, bored. It stinks! If I can train my Jay Sherman for a while, she really does the movie. The box promises a cowboy against dinosaurs and in a very general sense adds. Boys dressed as cowboys fight several large dinosaurs. But really these guys are a bunch of sissies and the hero is defeated (more about it later) and dinosaurs are barely intimidated. The plot is gaping, and it's not technically too bad to laugh there. It's all just gray and bland. After some horrible night cinematography (filmed in one and a half of the color I called), we get a conspiracy that involves some people doing things. I caught that. Oh and they are at the turn of the century in Mexico, so at least dress like cowboys, even if they don't like it. So a bunch of these people who thought they were people go to the desert and hit these dinosaurs (after they find a miniature horse ... I don't know, let's go on). Then, in the closing act, the film breaks down into a truly miserable King of Congo. At that moment I lost my will to keep my eyes on the television level, and I floated into consciousness and consciousness. "Hero" is played by this guy from the planet of apes who basically played Charlton Heston's part when Heston decided he didn't want to be in the sequel. He was chosen to cause shocks, he looked just like Heston. That's about everything that goes for him. I was really upset when he was a movie hero, because everything he does is hot, snear, a sack of chick in the movie (Who's named TJ .. unfortunately not a prostitute or finally the origin of the name would be revealed). Meanwhile, his friend kills all the dinosaurs, saves them many times, and what will he get for it? Unrecognizable, nothing! And he dies, sacrificing himself for his friends! They won't escape him even when they run! Boring, long, slowly moving, with little pleasure, until the film decides to copy King Kong's script on his own, it's best to avoid this movie if you don't like the pain in the fall of the anvil on eyeballs.
