If you read the summary for "Mad Max", you just destroyed the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the movie. You also found that "Mad Max" takes place in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be useful because otherwise you will have no idea what's going on. The film, made in 1979, is really trying to be Stanley Kubrick's "Watch Orange" (1971) only that film, in all its strangeness, actually makes sense and leaves an impact. This film doesn't even end up being a car / bike stunt-filled romp that crashes like any vehicle in the movie does. The first thing wrong with "Mad Max" is that he's trying to sell himself as a revenge story when he doesn't seem to have a vigilante revenge for the last 20 minutes. If the first hour was shortened to 20-30 minutes and then the final 20 was added and then another hour was added, "Mad Max would be a great action movie with a great hero of heroes. Instead, Mel Gibson has to wait and wait to act like a sissy on 2/3 of the film and then suddenly appear to look for revenge, I was still looking at the sequel "Road Warrior" and I must admit that I am excited about it just because I want to know This was the first time wasted time. <br /> < George Miller is doing some great action things here, but his over-the-top symbolism is absurd and every time an unbearable cheesy sequence, the character discovers something scary, like a burned hand, or what makes these moments totally ruin you a terrible clichÃ© of B-film technology, and what you think is a great science fiction movie at least a point, but no reason to do it by random, strange bicyclists, says nothing of value. Those modeled by Alex "Clockwork" just uglier and utterly non-threatening.GP violence simply does not allow the violence of this gang to settle down and get a response from the viewer, it is just cheese if anything. <br /> <br /> I'll give credit for a number of things The film crew exploded and hit things and Miller does a great job, so you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is at best average and after an hour of mediocrity you get something good and a movie 20 minutes later. I'm just going through the fingers of "Road Warrior" to meet the expectations that this movie will end, otherwise it's more time unnecessary. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
