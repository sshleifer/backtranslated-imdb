Yes. Real Smelly. I saw this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me it was a big "psychological" movie. This film does everything to make it unclear. I realized that after the first 20 minutes I saw that I was stinking. I was expecting to see something worthwhile and the most important of all I paid for this movie. Waiting was unbearable. After seeing the film, I talked to my friends and learned that in the intellectual environment (they say under this title) Turkey recognized this "film" as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the stinkers category. I think the movie must be self-explanatory. This film is just the opposite. Stay away from this thing, which is called "film". Burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon". Rate: 1 out of 10
