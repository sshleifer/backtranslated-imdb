This movie is not a horror movie. There's Nothing Scary About It's More Torture Flick. And that doesn't make sense to me, there are several scenes with vanishing bodies. For instance, the woman in the beginning of the film. That Get Away Away Returns For A Scene In The Restroom With Nicole And She And She Completely Disappears. Then he kills a police officer to take him out of his disaster and disappears PLUS to shoot him twice in his head to kill him. At the End of She Sets Killer's Truck On Fire. But that's not in it. Standing Behind Her. Then it cuts the rest of the Stop was completely rebuilt and some people are resting on space and a new girl comes and Nicole in asking for help as the first girl absolutely no sense in this movie. Save yourself some money and skip this movie.
