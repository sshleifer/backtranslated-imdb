Although I'm sure the idea on paper looked good and appealed to me when I first heard about it, this movie often crawls and falls, and when I watch it, I want it to end. The start and end of Lou's film, which has to watch over a troubled partner, is at best invented, even though I found that a tall cop is funny. However, I found little to laugh at the bottom of the script barrel that was thrown together for these two big comics. I thought it was a mistake to put them in a musical, and it has a "Wizard of Oz" rip-off (with songs and black and white to color). I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone other than A&C fanatics. Anyone else will be disappointed and have many better movies.
