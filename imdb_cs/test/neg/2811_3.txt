I haven't seen any more movies from Antonioni and people who have seen it with me to share themes and images with the rest of his works. Maybe if I saw other things that would make him happy, I'd like to enjoy this and know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I saw it as almost complete failure for many reasons. First of all, the film presents interesting, profound questions about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is very often done in the most vulnerable ways in which characters speak as if they were speaking speech, hurrying on and on. rather than conducting dialogues. Screenwriters seem to be so concerned that we don't get a point that they prefer to point to instead. Second, the film has no rhythm, especially in its first half. It's not just that it's slow. Some slow movies have been made with a great sense of tempo and rhythm (El Sur by Victor Erice or Scorsese's age of innocence are examples I like), but to be successful, it is necessary to find out that the characters are so engaging or storytelling so mobile that we can adapt to it. This will not happen in the Beyond Clouds area, where the first episode seems to be endlessly drawn, and the relationship between John Malkovich's "reality" and "fiction" love stories is sometimes fluid, others suddenly, others confusing.
