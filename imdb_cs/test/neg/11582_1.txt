Probably the worst creature ever, boa vs python was a million times better than that, it wasn't great, bad playing, bad effects, and guess what a DVD is one with 3 hours of thumbnails before the main menu. Probably the least scary movie ever, no blood or violence, people are stupid and still use pistols when they have no effect on these animals, the only cool part was radioactive leeches that were pretty cool, the name of the island is just rip outside the boring boring boring park Jurassic Park and not worth looking at, but I suppose the characters stupidity is pretty funny, so it would be a good comedy movie, but certainly not a thriller
