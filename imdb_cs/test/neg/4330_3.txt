This movie has an amazing cast. MGM took some of his finest actors and played them in a movie with usually adorable Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same house. While they had accumulated wealth over the years, they were also selfish blockbusters. One of them has an idea to donate a property to buy a good name (like Carnegie), but the property they want to give turned out to be O'Brien. And because he is an orphan, they voluntarily become guardians, so they can give Him property and look like great philanthropists. There is also a goofy subplot involving fairies - led by the wonderful actor actor Henry Davenport. And since O'Brien is an Irishman (as shown by her outrageous accent), she and the little people form a large part of the conspiracy. Frankly, I totally hated this part of the movie and wished it was completely dropped. Instead, the story might be about sweet Margaret melting the average old men's heart - that would work. But ... "little people"?!? Sheesh! Overall, the actors try very, very hard, but the stupidity of the conspiracy and the deadly serious way they tried made me cringe. I noticed that many people like this movie - I think I'm just an old grouch! I found that the film is hard to watch.
