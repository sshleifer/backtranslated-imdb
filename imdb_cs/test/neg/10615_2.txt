There are movies that are leaders, and movies that are followers. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" was a leader. And here's one of his followers. "Party Camp" is about as interchangeable as any of his brothers who have plunged into the depths that the "Meatballs" have so benefited. Of course Bill Murray was here. So, what does "Party Camp" have? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked this question. Jewel Sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter, and what SHE provides! Even as an innocent (wink, blink) girlfriend to a rich twerp (Cribb), she provides this great steam she gives to all her works. And yes, guys, shows (if you know what I mean and I think so). My gosh, her smile could melt with titanium. <br /> <br /> What? Yeah, the movie. Nothing special, as I said; every cheap prank is focused and hit (about the crotch level). And the eternal teen Jayne is good for laughter or two. But instead of sense of humor, it's just nudity, lame sex jokes, more nudity, soft-core dream sequence, sex symbol sister just for (CLOTHED!) Leering purposes, even more nudity .... <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... Maybe it's a good idea Bill Murray wasn't in this. Two Stars. For Jewel, naturally. Lots of "camp" but not much "party".
