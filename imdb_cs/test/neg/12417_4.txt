"Wild Rebels" was probably a fun second movie on the disc in a triple feature movie 40 years ago. She didn't have a very good aging, but it should never be okay; it was apparently intended to be a one-time, forgotten pastime since its inception. At this level, it's a good example of a biker genre. Several elements help differentiate it from dozens of similar films that are stamped at the same time. 'Hero', 'Rod Tillman' (Steve Alaimo) comes as a rather bland 'Everyman' - not particularly brave, hard, talented or handsome (even if he wins a fight with a hard biker gang member halfway) film, and gang member girl decides to help him through her gang member colleague at the end of the movie). The soundtrack is pretty well done, with a nice bass / drum riff "Ventures" that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass charts that happen. And although the scenario is very shallow, all actors occupy their cardboard figures with sufficient energy. There are plenty of careless technical gaffes: terrible "day-to-night" scenes occur in broad daylight, whistle tires in the swamp, fire sirens accidentally stuck in the soundtrack instead of police sirens, banknote adhesive tape on ceiling the board, Luger, which sounds like Winchester 30-06, a shotgun that cut people down 100 yards away, the detective kills bikers on the 3rd floor landing with a 2 inch barrel revolver. There are a number of goofy stories: Linda (a gang member disables bank guards with a drug-filled syringe, the last shootout takes place inside the lighthouse (!), police roadblocks are not really blocking the roads, the police probably never heard of Tiles and police detectives have probably never heard of planting bugs or their secret guy ringing wire. <br /> <br /> But plotting bastards along with cameraman knows what he is doing, stimulation in most scenes is pretty good, and there are some nice, zippy one of the inserts and dialog exchanges here and there that keep the energy level higher. (My favorite: "Men, you're messing with private supplies! (I mean Linda)" So no, don't look for this or anything, but if you copy The MST version should have fallen into your hands, you should have some good, shallow fun to watch it. "The Hellcats" or even "Girl in Gold Boots" (three more MST covered anti-cultural films).
