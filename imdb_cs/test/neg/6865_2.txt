I can't believe I'm wasting my time - but this movie is weird. If 20 different directors were filmed in the film without any idea that other directors would make this scenario, it is to a large extent the result I would expect. I also think some of the scenes were out of order - things don't always look fine. The film behaves like we should know about half the characters. And Steve Guttenberg in this film attempts the comedy a-la-Robin Williams. Ewww. And the whole premise to give ex-con in charge of a lot of kids just doesn't look realistic in this day and age.
