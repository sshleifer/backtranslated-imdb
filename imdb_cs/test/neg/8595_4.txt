If you can watch a movie without worrying about plotting or playing, then Backdraft is definitely the one. But if I like watching movies you can trust, then Backdraft has some serious drawbacks. It offers nothing new and there are hundreds of action films of the 1990s that follow identical patterns, even if they are not so clumsy. After two shootings, I think it has to go somewhere else, I mean, how many big fires are in one city? Certainly firefighters do other things like getting cats out of trees? I was wrong and the repetition continues over and over, until the end. The good aspect of the movie is the fire itself, well shot and I have to say that I felt quite hot while watching. This suggests that two hours of watching a fire without a story or playing would be more appropriate for my taste.
