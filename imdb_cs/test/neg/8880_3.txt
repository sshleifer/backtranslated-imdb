I was supposed to watch this DVD, I think I'll see the type of biography about Goya, but the movie was about everything except Goya. This film is about a young woman the Holy Inquisition took from her family, allegedly because she practiced Jewish rituals (just because the poor girl didn't like pork!). The rest of the film is about torture, humiliation, driven by a bad scenario (can't believe it's JC Carri√®re because I couldn't believe this cr ** is driven by Mr. Milos Forman), aimed at a religious man and a young woman and that's it. Oh, and there is Goya, I forgot, plays a completely peripheral role - that could be the role of John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joaquim, Jose or anyone else. Very disappointed - one of those films that will be forever forgotten (if not yet done). Rent "The Name of the Rose" if you want a film about the Holy Inquisition. And I don't know what to rent if you want to watch a film about Goya, a Spanish painter. Maybe Director of Good Caliber, not Forman. PS: The Spanish Goya painter - the title role that is lost in the plot - is depicted by a Scandinavian actor, making this film even harder. Maybe next time we should send Javier Barden to play the biography of the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch!
