Jess Franco makes exploitation movies and he did tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking movies in cinema history and God bless him for it. Unfortunately, Kilominjaro diamonds are really horrible films that do not comply with its usual standards. The use of movies should be judged by story, sex and gore. What's next? This movie fails from most of these benchmarks. The story is a thin paper that places young girls in the jungle among the cannibals. We really don't get information about why their father was there first. As expected, her father is "Big White Chief" and she becomes a goddess, sitting on trees, naked. Add lucky hunters and gemstones, and you have your basic rescue girl for greedy plot plot lines. Characters are supplies, not adding an ounce of credibility to driving. <br /> <br /> Gore? None, or at least very small. This film is often mentioned in the same spirit as classical Italian cannibal films. Those looking for this type of gore must run in a different way. Except for one cheap number, this movie contains surprisingly small blood and intestines. As best I can say, the only reason this movie exists is Katja Bienert, Aliene Mess and Mari Carmen Neieto. around naked. In fact, "Lita" (Mari Carmen Neieto) makes full frontal heavy lifting, while two jungle ladies are bare chest all over. Yes, there are love scenes .... probably the most sterile Franco ever supervised. Women are beautiful but nothing here really makes this movie an erotic classic one. This movie just smells of a low budget buffoonery. The sets are ridiculous. The game is terrible and the cut is confusing. There is no real story to hold it together, not enough budget (or effort) to shock or titrate. I think Franco's fans have come to expect more of the exploitation master.
