First I have to say that I don't like the feature films so much! But there are some movies that I liked. This is one of the others;) Same opinion as some (most) here. The film is still in my back, but the few effects are not really enough to watch all the time .... I think what they did well are animated scenery with 3 suns and 4 months but its only likes. There are no intelligent dialogs (are there ???). But it's a great movie for anyone who loves Lara Croft or some other girls in HOT-PANTS ...;) <br /> <br /> For directors: "Stop trying again, PLEASE !!!"
