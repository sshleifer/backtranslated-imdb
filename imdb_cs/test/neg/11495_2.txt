I was just watching a DVD icon and despite being a great book, the film is a weak substrate. Writers should be expelled to Siberia. Why are they making a great story with all sorts of C-film subplodies that are absolutely irrelevant to this story, they're completely out of me. Yet the filmmakers and cast do their best to do something about it, but at the end of the day the film was not satisfactory. Can anyone do a decent movie to show how it is done. I'm sure the crowds will gather for such a masterpiece novel that turned into a book, not a cheap C-movie.
