This film was one of the longest film experiences of my life. Although I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, attempted revenge, the move as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is only charged for 1 hour and 55 minutes, but it looks like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell. I will say that English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easy to understand. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of dialogue was repeated. Also, if you have resistance to unpleasant voices, then avoid hearing Hye-jeong Kang (playing Mi-do) to speak. If you're looking for a movie that kills time and you feel morally superior to others, then watch. If you don't want to watch a movie full of incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary battle scenes, rough scenes of torture and confusing flashbacks, then this is not a movie for you.
