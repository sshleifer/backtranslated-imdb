Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to redo Psycho in color by bringing him to a modern audience who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see the film in black and white while they comfortably forget that both "" officials "and" Schindler's List "were filmed in black and white and are great movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, just as tight people don't want to see a great movie just because they're in black. like "Psycho" they didn't like it because they don't have murder or sex scene every two minutes, and murders are not cruel blood / gore / bone-cracking people are used to seeing "Halloween", "Friday, 13" and "Nightmare on Elm Street." That's why "Psycho" almost exactly as it was originally, was destined not to work because it's really just the interest of people who are fans of the original. others just watch them bring them in until the next "Scream" sequel, and they will be disappointed. "Psycho" relies on tension and mystery, not blood and intestines. (And so no one thinks I have to be a senior if I like older movies, let me tell you straight away by being 21.) <br /> <br /> So if the movie is in color, Van Sant wanted to change, why not just color the film and release it again? What is the point of remake of the movie if you don't want to change anything? The smallest he could do was to turn to his own director and not just copy Hitchcock - or better yet - to hire a new writer to edit the new script from the original book "Psycho". But it seems that Van Sant could not decide whether he wanted to remake "Psycho" * exactly * or not. It was supposed to be all or nothing of the project - either remake the movie exactly or do it differently - but as it stands, this movie is about 95% the same, but with a few touches thrown in that they have no purpose. Like when Norman masturbates while he spies on Marion, he undresses. It doesn't serve a conspiracy at all, and the only reason he gave it was because he could *. He wanted to say, "Hitch couldn't show people in 1960 that it would masturbate, so I'll do it." Whoopee, a big problem like I'm so shocked to see someone masturbate. And what was on the ground to show the individual shots of the clouds and livestock shots that alternated with the murders? And then he leaves an important scene where Lila and Sam meet the sheriff outside the church. In addition, using almost exactly the same scenario, the whole movie looks a bit like anachronism. Starting credits say the year is 1998. Then what's with Marion's 60-year-old clothing or parasol that carries with him? Why Marion and Sam must have their exams in a hotel room when no one is shocked by what they're doing these days? Why aren't there any air conditioning units in Marion's office? Why doesn't Motel Bates have TV in the rooms, and apparently no automatic door locks? Why does a sheriff have to ask an operator to contact him with Bates Motel? That was the reason why using the same script was a mistake - only a few words changed and it was not enough to modernize it. It needed a complete overhaul. While Vince Vaughn showed good performance as Norman, it didn't seem right for him. Part of what made the original "Psycho" so scary was that Norman had the innocent quality of a boy, anybody from the door, so no one could believe he was capable of such horrible crimes. With Vince Vaughn playing a part, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer? That means I understand that Gus Van Sant was probably a fan of the original movie "Psycho" and wanted this to be an honor. This is not a bad movie, but the problem is that it can be the only "Psycha" exposition. I really think you should see this movie only if you saw the original. Since I am a fan of anything in common with "Psycho", I bought a used copy of a remake that I can occasionally watch. The original film was filet mignon while the remake is a hamburger. But even filet mignon would be bored if you had it every day, so it's nice to have a burger for a change.
