Though the film has a pretty stylish look for india on a really low budget, it's not what I go to the movies for movies. There wasn't one character I found sympathetically, they all seemed like a totally blatant loser. Everything that goes wrong is too hopeless for me. The reviews relate to the Puffy Chair as a black comedy ... comedy? Brother Rhett acts as a refugee from the institution. When Josh talks to his girlfriend Emily about her brother, it almost shows how Rhett doesn't play with a full deck. However, Josh performs a "wedding" for Rhett and Rhett's wife met just a few hours before. There have been several interesting performances by some characters met on the tour. For me, however, it was most accurate that people left the movie ... and I saw it on the free screen.
