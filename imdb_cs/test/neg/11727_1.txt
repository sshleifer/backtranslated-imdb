He was badly shot. Looks like a hurry, the last cast is obvious. Writing is very weak. Good for the stage, not for the movie. I feel bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who has not recently gotten good roles. This role was not for him. Maybe glad it was still taken. This film will remain on the festival circuit.
