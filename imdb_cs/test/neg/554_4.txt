I'm really sad it's the first bad review I've ever done for a movie ... EVER.I could stand to watch this movie, and it's the second movie in all the movies I've seen is just. ..a downgrade. The first is Open Water, which made no sense at all. Another Karate Kid had no mention of Daniel (correct me if I'm wrong, please.) And the end line came as a shock. It was like, "If you have to fight ... win." Then it turned out that the bird flies around and the flute plays and I was like oh. Okay, so it'll take a while. AND THAT CREDITS REPLACE PICTURES. <br /> <br /> GEEZ MAN !! Hopefully I'll never have to review the movie in the wrong way, sorry for those of you who like The Next Karate Kid.
