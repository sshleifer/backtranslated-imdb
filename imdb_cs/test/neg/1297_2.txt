This film was a total waste. I sat and watched it absolutely furious that it was funded. They most certainly spent the entire budget on a special FX rather than a writer and director A on some of the actors. <br /> <br /> At first, acting was bland and trash. The story was not enough for the audience. Instead of being a storm-raging story, narration has been told more by government figures and the military, which is not a way to connect with them, just as most of us hate politics. The writer tried to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding a small subplot about the father and son who completely failed. As for directing ... oh God, his techniques to try to create tension and restlessness are repeated and are on top. Accelerated camera movements and then a sudden flash of lightning stop on the cheeks when something terrible happened, pathetic. The only reason I followed him to the end was to see a special FX. Which is a bad thing, because a special FX shouldn't make a movie that should only enhance the story and the experience. There was no story. I really wouldn't bother watching this, total waste and embarrassment for the British film industry.
