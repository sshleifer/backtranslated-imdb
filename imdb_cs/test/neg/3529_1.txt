Hi Y'all, <br /> <br /> I bought it on a DVD from England. See, I have one of those multi-regional players. I thought it would be fun to have a great movie with my friends. Well, surprise for Amy-Joon, barely in the movie. Even if it's on the cover. It's hard to imagine how this bad movie came first. Maybe someone has a trust fund. Oh ... It's about the Vampires who live on the beach
