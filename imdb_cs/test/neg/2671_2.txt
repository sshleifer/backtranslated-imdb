Most of this movie was fine, to continue the sequel ... <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the amount of tension there was; Actually, I was expecting to get out of the window in favor of gore, gore, gore. It wasn't, but there are a few ridiculous deaths. But the thing I didn't like was the whole plot conspiracy. You might be fine if the writers had time to explain all of them. But what was the purpose of a secret society in a psychiatric institution, specifically? Why were they protected from Michael's damage to a point? What exactly will they do with a child? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant? Why lock her for 20 years? Why did Michael eventually kill all his conspirators? Why were there fruits in the lab? The actors seemed to have "figured it out" once they saw the fruits. But it was never explained to the viewer. <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch this movie, you will see how people meet, then it will be fine for you .. However, if you can't stand the conspiracy it is thrown at you that remains unresolved when credits roll, you should go watch something else.
