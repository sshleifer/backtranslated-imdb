That could be great. Voice-overs is just fine and adapts characters to a small problem; the appearance of characters, mostly supportive or hosted characters, look exactly the same. Equally bored look at each face with only minor changes, such as hairline or weight. It looks a little strange to see him resemble a lifeless face like a big guest's voice. If I'm not mistaken, Kathy Griffin made a voice for this show and it looked too strange to be funny. There are several other issues, one of which is family. The Simpsons did a lot better when you could actually buy most of the situations they got into. Here we get too many unpleasant distractions, like someone who has a strange imagination, and then we should find the funny one, but for some reason the van is a bit gone. How can you say it's hard for me to put your finger on exactly what's wrong with this show because it's basically nothing more than a Simpsons clone or even more "Married to Children". <br /> <br /> If I should point my finger at what's completely wrong, it's probably repeatability. Peter Griffin is not really a clear character, but not one of the others. Lois was supposed to be named Lois Lame because he's kind of one-dimensional. Seth Green as a kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show, and that's the most stereotypical part of the show. So what more can I say. There is nothing wrong with this show, but in the long run, you have to admit that what the Simpsons have done for almost two decades requires a lot of work.
