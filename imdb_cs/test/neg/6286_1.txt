Wow ... <br /> <br /> Reading these comments, I see a remarkable socio-cultural clash of topic emerging between the US and the ... Dutch! US P.o.V. It seems to be a pretty good little movie, Parker is a nice hero, a story of a light representation of what might be a glorified form of reality. <br /> <br /> All three Dutch reviewers see the world through completely different glasses as it seems. Those categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree that film is a disaster. It's far from me to be in a dispute that seems to be a cross-cultural dispute. geographically separate. Yet, on the basis of factual observation, I saw the film with my own eyes - I suspect the Dutch are not too far from the brand: "Parker Kane" is poorly made, totally boring, and is not worth the celluloid that was undoubtedly useless in his creation.
