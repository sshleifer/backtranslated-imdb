"D.O.A." is a non-thrilling thriller from directors Rocky Morton and Annabel <br /> <br /> Jankel. Acting is fine and the script is pretty bad. This movie also has a few moments that will make you laugh as stupid scenes of violence are. For example, someone is shot at the window. Then we see from outside the <br /> <br /> building that looks like this person has jumped out. When it happened, I laughed. This film tries hard, but eventually fails. You can watch this movie only if you have no choice. <br /> <br /> My criticism: ** <br /> <br /> Rating: [R] <br /> <br /> Rating Reasons: Violence and Language. * <br /> <br /> * Because of his age, there was no reason for evaluation.
