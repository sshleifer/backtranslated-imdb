The first comment users are very detailed for a very vague movie. I'm not saying I disagree, but this summary can be written in several sentences. To get straight to the point, it's almost like watching a really bad amateur porn movie. There are a few funny points in the movie, but with things like this happening in today's everyday youth, it's actually kind of lame. The main actor in the movie is pompous jackass and both the guy and the girl in the movie are too modest to be in such a movie. DO NOT USE MONEY ON THIS FILM. The only reason I gave him 4 and not 1 is that they used at least a bit of an attractive girl in the movie and at the end you have to see the girl almost full of frontal nudity, that's because it's the only thing that's worth it track. end
