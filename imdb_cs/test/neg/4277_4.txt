This version of Mansfield Park, while being very specific to the novel lacking sympathy, I felt for Fanny who is key and central to this story of Jane Austen. This was due to the overall lack of acting skills of the actress, Sylvestra Le Touzel. She had no challenge, and at times she seemed to be lost in space or in depth. The scene she had with her uncle, where she was falling into hysterics, was hysterical. She played the crucial scene immensely, and I was actually sorry that Henry Crawford cared for her. The polar opposite is the portrayal of Mary Crawford Jackie Smith-Wood. What a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part, make this character humorous and self-centered, selfish, yet vulnerable to love. I've always loved Fanny. She is slightly raised, but with an irreconcilable sense of what is right and who thinks she is worthy of respect and admiration. Fanny in this adaptation is too humble and subordinate, barely thinking about her until the end of the series. Just like I wanted this Fanny ... I just couldn't. I recommend skipping this version of Mansfield Park as a real thing ... a novel. Fanny will not disappoint ... you will love her!
