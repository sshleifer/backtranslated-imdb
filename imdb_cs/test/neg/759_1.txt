This move is bad at many levels, nor do I know where to start. OK - Good Points - Peebles is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather. Some of the landscape photographs were stunning. That's about it. Oh, and it was a nice touch that had a buffalo's head above the bar door in Freemanville, I think it was a nod to the Buffalo soldiers. The movie starts a bit OK, but the characters are so flat, so comics, so 'much', bad guys are just over the top bad, I'm choking trying to describe them further. The Spanish-Cuban-American War was 1895-1898 with America being involved only in April to August '98. I think the movie said it was held in 1893 (I could be wrong, but I don't want to look at it again). Much of this film was based on KKK, which was killed by Daddy Jessie. Well boys, the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The clan was not even during the time of this film. Of course the ugly bass rds got back occupied in 1915 and the rest of it we know. But for the purposes of the film, this is historically incorrect, and that was the main part of the plot. I think I could go crazy, go much more, so here are a few blows and I'm done. I did not know that Boyz2Men and other bands got their inspiration from the street singers of New Orleans in the 1890s. I also didn't know that fetish necklaces were for Sioux women in the nineties of the last century ... ... but then I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic 1 "nails ... Such a waste of talent and money - it really had a chance to show part of American history that is not well known. http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/bkcwboy2.htm for some more information It could have been so good but it was just .. bad from 1-10 it gets 1 point of zero because Mario looks good in the hat and there was a horse of Appaloosa in the movie.
