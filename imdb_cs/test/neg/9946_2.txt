As Jennifer Denuccio said on Square Pegs, "Gag me out the door." I would definitely vote for this film on the list of the worst IMDB films. Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a guy from Chicago who goes to California to live on his brother's jazz records. It's supposed to be a barney located in the local community. But he behaves more like he is new to civilization (he just tries to get through his sex scene without spinning). There are also ongoing adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure. Duke (Seymour Cassell), a volleyball expert trying to get TT to act like a normal human being, is an unpleasant drunken surfer who cheats on his girlfriends and a guy who bet on another that he can live in the car. sixth month. California Dreaming is just a big old mess. It begins as a typical 1970s, complete with bad music of the 1970s (although this film was one year old shy of the 80s). And Dennis Christopher comes as the most irritated loser, it makes the film hard to watch (keep your finger on the button fast forward). Even if this film was about surfers culture, surf scenes are almost complete garbage. Surfing people look like they can't fall asleep. I think the only great thing is to see Tanya Roberts off her role as Midge on the sitcom. "And Cassell wasn't bad, he was just in the wrong movie.
