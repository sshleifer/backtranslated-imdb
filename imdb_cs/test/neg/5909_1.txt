Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor will combine in this comedy that nightclub owners are hampered by organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed this unpleasant ego trip and therefore has no one to blame but himself for his failure. It is a really bad film, so completely free of energy and humor that it only serves as an example of Murphy's contempt for his audience. It would be remarkably easy to continue beating on this movie, but I will show more mercy than it showed his audience and stop.
