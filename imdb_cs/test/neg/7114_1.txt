When you first look at this movie, keep in mind that you're going to see something you've never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie in which INSANE seems to have spent a lot of money on blasts and not enough to play or anything else. The crazy thing I noticed is that every character is totally overworked, and the movie seems to be mostly sped-up to make characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was also nicknamed?) I understand that it has a cartoon, but it doesn't work for live action. It looks just strange ... as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldn't afford a real actor. The English version is terribly dubbed, and the character's words don't match the mouth at all. . I'd like to have preferred headlines, but because it's a children's movie, and because some kids can't read well, I'll let it go. But there is something extraordinarily special about this movie. It is supposedly a children's film, but there is a lot of material on SEX, RAPE and STRIPPING, which is not exactly for a young Western audience. (In the Orient, they have different rights, and sexuality in children's films is much more accepted). But parents are warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, more scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insanely young Japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'maniacs' sex and shows him her tits! Who was this film made anyway? Oh, and special effects are ridiculous. You can say that spacecraft-like things that bomb villages are cardboard cutouts (or animations, I wasn't sure) that look unconvincing, even a child. The creators of this film missed a lot of great things from the cartoon, simply because they couldn't budget the kind of money they'd need. I didn't like how the names of all the characters changed ... I was wondering if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> I really don't recommend this movie to anyone. Kids, Adults or Dragon Ball Z fans. It's just a bad representation of the cartoon, and of course, it will be possible to say that this movie was rushed and no care what was put into it. I'm not even going to a cameraman ... wait until the end of the credit on a still image that sits there for 2 minutes ... most shots aren't framed correctly at ALL and the movie seems to be created by amateurs. Also the quality of granular film. <br /> <br /> Terrible all around !!!! <br /> <br />
