Inglourious Basterds IS Tarantino is the worst movie ever made. It is full of his usual ingredients, ie Humble Dialogue, Brutal and Sudden Violence, but it feels like deja-vu. The direction is typical of Tarantino and nothing seems new at all. It's almost as if he copied exactly from his only Pulp Fiction masterpiece. There's nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds to be honest, it's just a war drama that's not funny or brilliant as Pulp Fiction. Basterds allegedly is Tarantino's tribute to Leone's Spaghetti Western is but seems to be mis-linked and off site especially with the continued use of large sub-titles and throwing a balance audience.
