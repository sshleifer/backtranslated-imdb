ALL GROWN UP is basically a spin off and not anything but the original Nickalodeon RUGRATS cartoon that featured kids Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Lil and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Susie and (later) Kimi (Sister Chuckies) and Dill (Tommy's brother) . I grew up with RUGRATS and thought it was a great cartoon. She had excellent humor, nice stories and the creators of the show, Klasky & Csupo, were apparently very original and creative with the concept of children's adventures. The new ALL GROWN UP show attempts to capture the magic of the original cartoon. I was disappointed when I saw it. I found "all-grown" Chuckie just annoying and whole "pre-teen-acting-mature / trying-to-be-popular", which applies to (unfortunately) * all * characters boring and washed up. There are still some funny scenes and jokes in the new series, and it was interesting to see how artists would make the entire RUGRATS children's gang ten years from their original show. Overall, this exhibition is "just" and only traceable if you are a RUGRATS fan, b) you have never seen the original show, c) you are a preschooler who has nothing to do, or d) your so boring that you are somehow forced to see this show. This show is not so good. It's not in comparison with older RUGRATS episodes in quality, humor and all the rest.
