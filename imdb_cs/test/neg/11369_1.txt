If you thought 10.5 NBC was stupid, you'll be happy that FX reached into the bowels of a made television hell and stuck his fingers into this pseudo post-9/11 shit. Not only was the conspiracy stupid, it was an absolute afternoon of 24 years and a bad excuse. The shooting style was now an overused "docu-action" look, complemented by notches in grainy black-and-white rawcore shots. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it certainly sounds like something DP told the director before filming. I don't know what they went to, but it reminded me of a guy in the office who thinks that Powerpoint with "fly-ins" and "animations" are "cool". The story is that 6 "terrorists" are taking over a nuclear power plant in southern CA. That's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where security measures are up to jing. In the interest of reality, they put 2 off-duty CHiPpies into the mix. Because they could stop 6 people, right? Six. Even Bruce Willis had to deal with more terrorists in that stupid Nakatomi building. Leslie Hope (TV Teri Bauer) plays a cogeneration officer who has trouble making calls after shooting a bulletproof vest in her. Her voice was like Sally Struther's TV commercial, petty and monotonous. Her character is just a conspiracy device, and once she has done her little duty, she is immediately wiped out. Yes, Teri Bauer died! Bruce Greenwood plays FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, who is constantly alerting him to punishing foreign diplomats in the face. His boss is gone, so no one in the Inland Security Department believes his prognosis of the situation. It is reasonable from a group of paranoid public officials who are afraid to blame for any catastrophe. It's calm, it's strong, it's BORING. Meltdown is absolutely nothing redeeming or fun - OK, maybe Teri Bauer was pretty useless and funny - besides, nothing to buy.
