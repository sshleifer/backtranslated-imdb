This DVD lacks his call as a Heineken track .... This is a great example of why no one should go see a sequel with another director / writer than the original. Two hours of this turkey had me begging to repeat 2 Exorcists. No legitimate laughter. There is no decent fear. The script was just a mess, and I felt bad for the actors who had to perform it (they had to have sick relatives at home or monster coke habits or something). <br /> <br /> The original was a make-up effect. So naturally, the continuing producers thought it would be a great idea to scrap FX makeup and make CG werewolves. These werewolves of CG had to laugh at me much harder than any of the "comedies". It was a total discount. If you want night entertainment, borrow the original again. Or take a movie class and create your own horror movie. You have to do better than these fools.
