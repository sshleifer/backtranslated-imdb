Racing enthusiast Fabian (as Tommy Callahan) smokes, drinks, and suffers blackouts while juggling feelings for the seductive brunette Annette Funicello (like France Madsen) and blonde mainstay Diane McBain (as Annie Blaine). Complicated issues are Mrs. Funicello's tasted racing car friend Warren Berlinger (as Eddie Sands), and her father Jan Murray (as Pete Madsen), who encourages ruthless drivers. Funicell's cow performance is sometimes enjoyable; but her drunken driving scene is worrying. "Thunder Alley" provides marginally more excitement to NASCAR than its predecessor, "Fireball 500" (1966) *; Be warned, it's not much. A wild party scene, featuring some mild tease strip, is the movie's low accent.
