Well, first of all, who would change Hitchcock in their right mind and the other who would do it? I admit that I did not intend to watch this movie for that reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite movies ever and it seemed like a humiliating photocopy. I watched it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it with the original and we both agreed less than five minutes on that stupid thing that it was horrible. First, as mentioned, they shot it. Where is originality? Why remake a movie that is almost exactly as it was for the first time? Why remake such a movie to start? If you are going to remodel something, do something that doesn't work and do it BETTER! Second, they used the exact same script from the 1960 version. The dialog no longer works. It works well and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but it seems strange and emerging from modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch didn't write the script, you could rewrite it. This film had a very good talent and was useless by imitating the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman looked as if he had just played John Anderson as a car dealer in the original. All the actors seemed to be the only direction they got from the original movie. Perhaps Vince Vaughn seemed a little more stupid than Anthony Perkins, but you lose the sympathy you should have for Norman. With Norman masturbating while watching Marion undressing went too far and lost the character's innocence that I think Tony Perkins captured so well in his performance. Viggo Mortensen's accent was uncomfortable, and Rita Wilson was too old to play Caroline. Her line looked like someone desperate rather than young and entertaining as Patricia Hitchcock's performance. The only good thing I saw about the movie was that Gus Van Sant was able to open the film with the shot Hitch imagined. Hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot over Phoenix, but he couldn't at that time, so he had to settle for a series of cross-shot shots together. This film fulfilled this vision with a helicopter shot into a hotel window. After that, although the film became a worthless waste of cellulose. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering how to destroy a stunning movie, watch it, but DO NOT look at it under any circumstances before watching the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never shine green. Stick to the master movie, not imitation.
