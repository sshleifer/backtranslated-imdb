There are plenty of movies, especially from the 1980s, which are so horrible that you can't help them, but you love them. The last one is one of them. I hate this film so much, but it's still one of the most watched movies in my collection. I've been watching it countless times, and every time I get a huge laugh. It is a major example of how every film could have gotten in the 1980s. Our name is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles is a runaway psychopathic killer running around in medical scrubs and a doctor's jacket throwing on a man with a scalpel. He ends up coming through a house of girls who have a sleep party. One of the girls is the daughter of a doctor who tried to operate on Randle, and Randle ended up pulling him into some sexual position. (lol just watch the movie to know what I'm talking about.) Now I know what you gotta think at this point: It must be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like a party massacre massacre or Valentine's Day massacre, right? NO! This movie is HORRIBLE! First, the quality of the film changes during the film. Sometimes it will look like it could be filmed this year, but at other times it's so grainy and blurred that it's not even noticeable. The funny thing is that certain camera angles will be blurred and grainy and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and proves they didn't care about them at all. The director played the killer (as if it wasn't funny enough), but since he wasn't talented enough to act and act directly, he was shooting just one shot to walk to the camera with his scalpel And then just played that clip over and over every time someone is killed. The characters in this movie are absolutely ridiculous and unlikable, and these people who believe they are ages 16-18 look more like they are 25-45. I know that slasher movies commonly use adults as teenagers, but I've never seen a movie where it was ALSO. My guess is that the reason none of them are in the film industry is because they all died in old age ... Or maybe it was just because this movie was so bad they never wanted to show their faces again This is a good thing, because I doubt that they could get into other movies, even if they tried. All I can do is hope one day Tyler will make LAST PICTURE PAGE 2: FINAL CONFLICT and all the original actors will return. I'm sure everyone would like it. The film was directed by Stephen Tyler, (no, not a singer), who never came to directing again, and was released by B&S (which I am surely behind the bull and ****) Productions. Bull & S released just one more film, "Forever Evil", which was pretty horrible, but not as bad as the last Slumber Party. Terrible, terrible, terrible movie ... I highly recommend.
