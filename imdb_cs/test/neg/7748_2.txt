This film had a very intricate plot and a very inventive environment that I, frankly, could not follow, which is surprising given that negotiations and dialogue could only be the result of writing a kindergarten. If you like Kathy Ireland, you might want to see it. The movie was probably made as a vehicle that tried to get it to Hollywood, but if it was its goal, I must say that I hope that it has not invested too much money in its production.
