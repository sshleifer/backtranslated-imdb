With this movie, it would be possible to do a lot of good things using basically the same sets, plot devices and events. For example, why not enter Erica's seed ability before murdering your lover? Why not develop Erik and the cop's relationship slowly and convincingly? Perhaps it contrasts Eric's metamorphosis by including another aspect, relationship, etc. in her life, which now refuses? Why get the innocent observer injured to underestimate the iniquity in Erie's act. Instead, TBO uses the imagination of revenge to its maximum level, which gives honest lips to "don't do it at home" messages thrown just to make the film qualify as legitimate. I'm not a Jodie Foster fan. After showing some extent in films such as SILENCE OF LAMBS, NELL and one where he plays an ordinary mother of a child prodigy, Foster slipped into a succession of roles where the same hard-headed heroine plays over evil. . This is fine once or twice, but I'm too used to her "fight against flight" close-up. TBO could use a younger actress or one that would convincingly accept a woman in her forties (instead of a 40-year-old Foster playing a younger woman). <br /> <br /> TBO is a film with significant actors, funding, and resources that can go down to spam.
