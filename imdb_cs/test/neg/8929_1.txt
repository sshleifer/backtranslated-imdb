It's been 3 months now and you know what it means ... New movie Seagal. Seagal was really on the role of making a horrible movie after a terrible movie. Every time every movie gets worse and worse, it's really amazing! I don't know what to say about TYD at all, it's a bullshit first, the story doesn't make any sense, secondly, it uses stunt men in all of its combat scenes, and a lot of shots. from other movies! It stuns as this guy still finds work, he comes on set late and leaves early, and because his movies are full of hole and plot stunts. Why are we still buying his films, why do we still hope to make a great movie?
