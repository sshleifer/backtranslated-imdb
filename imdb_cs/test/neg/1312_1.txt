This terrible effort is just to show what happens when you not only use computers to generate effects, but also let them invent the storyline and write the script. Someone seems to have come up with a new piece of software that asks a few questions and then throws out four hours of loosely coupled clichÃ©s, miserable dialogue, and a collection of stock characters that they ultimately want everyone to drown in the first five minutes. br /> <br /> Tom Courtney takes the worst performance award. To say it's wooden would be an insult to trees. It is hard to cause Robert Carlyle to do almost anything he does, but the odds were even against him in this case, especially because he was for some incalculable reason necessary to accept the gor 'blimey accent in London. <br /> <br /> Full washout.
