Just as I hated the movie that this series follows, I can at least say that Zangief was fun. The animated series may be one of the worst things ever made. Animation is quite often inconsistent, although it remains consistently poor. The face of a face is even able to drastically change in the same frame. The screenplay and voice playing also leave something to be desired, since the majority of the cast seems to be as talented as the third-class cast of the dramatic play. Characters like Cammy and DJ are thus forced into the stereotypes of their nationalities, that the episodes that contain them are almost physically painful to watch, not that the show is not as painful. The conspiracy episode seeks to achieve new levels of lame with each turn and is so full of plot holes that it amazes me that they had time to show the ads. In truth, I am amazed that someone would pay for advertising. Besides being a bad series, it's a worse adaptation of Street Fighter. Many of the characters maintain unsuccessful adaptations from the film. Examples include Ken and Ryu being idiot con men (even though Ken is to be rich), Blanka being a friend of Guile Charlie, and Chun Li being a reporter. It takes a talent to make something as bad as a movie and make it worse.
