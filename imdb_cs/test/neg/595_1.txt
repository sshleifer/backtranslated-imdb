Let's see, cardboard figures like Muslim terrorists have forced cardboard scientists to do some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been dazed and kidnapped. You will certainly laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids only get their deserts! Drug experiments have shown them the ability to perceive another world. Everyone pulls away to hell except one poor guy who goes to heaven, where he can probably spend eternity with fools who created this masterpiece of Absurd. I think I'd decide for Hellfire myself. Go see something else if you're not stoned, in which case you might like it! I couldn't hurt!
