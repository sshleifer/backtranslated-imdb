The sound in this movie is a nightmare. This is the best I can say for this movie. Any chance of a good story is lost as soon as these movies begin. The film's assumption sounds good. Playboy, who copes with the people around him. The story is predictable and very boring. The wet T-Shirt can be the worst scene I've ever watched, and it's worth a look at Mystery Science. The sound is sometimes hard to hear and the main actor doesn't know how to speak clearly. His accent is hard to understand. The only clear sport is Penelope Ann Miller's work. Her role is underdeveloped but plays well. In short, don't waste your time.
