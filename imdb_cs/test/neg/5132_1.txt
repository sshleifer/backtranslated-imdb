My friend and I rented this movie for 3.99 on the blockbuster. If I knew how horrible this movie would be, I wouldn't even pay a cent. I had no warning about this bs. Acting cannot even be called acting, the inevitable sexual scene is embarrassing, and you can say that both girls feel totally uncomfortable, and the male villain ... a god who couldn't say he will attack emily A musical stimuli ... my lord . This film makes me cry. Never rent it. In fact, when you look at it, measure your eyeballs. This film is not about God - it's from hell. I'm just taking the last few lines to write blah blah blah shiz because I really don't want to continue this review.
