This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. I was ready to leave 10 minutes from opening. The clich√© slapped your face there, and the conspiracy was not only predictably stupid but full of more holes than Swiss cheeses. I'm thinking of suing for having lost 2 hours, and $ 6.25 along with the fact that I'm now stupid to watch this wasted movie. T-Rex must rotate in the graves.
