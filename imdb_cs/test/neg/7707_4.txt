A college professor is working on creating zombies and you don't know, things are going terribly wrong. Another thing you know is the whole area. Thank goodness, there's a couple of uber-commandos trained just for that. Too bad he has to be accompanied by a group of Moron commandos led by a rapper (he doesn't even bother trying to play a military guy, he just responds to his superiors as if he was rappin 'wit' da homies in da hood). The highlight of this part of the film is the dressing room scene. Moron-Commandos men and women share the same dressing room and apparently military regulations require all women to wear black bras and panties. Hey, if you can't make a good movie, at least you can have women in underwear. My hat is gone for filmmakers. So, after many discussions about how well these Moron commandos are ready for this job (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they all kill in relatively short order. It seems that their biggest fall is that they will never turn on the lights. A typical meeting is that she goes to the room and sees someone at the other end. Human or zombie? I can not tell it. Flip On Lights? No, the Moron-Commando protocol requires them to go to that person, make sure they keep their weapon in such a way that it can be easily ripped out of the hand and know the drill well. Loss of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is especially fun - my favorite rapper scene in every movie I've ever seen. Fortunately (and again, hats on filmmakers), the hottest child among the moron-commandos manages to survive. Her and the female uber-squad both end up in tight T-shirts for the rest of the film. This is how a military operation should be done! There's a lot of running, intermittent, humorous things like uber commanders who can't go through a simple ventilation grate (it's probably a thin piece of aluminum you could easily put on your fist). This requires a plan to smash zombie guts all over, and although we've seen nothing in the movie to suggest that zombies locate their prey smells, they're good enough to immediately sniff the zombies and let our heroes go. Several other funny pieces - Paris Hilton gag, "Can you hear me now?" gag, and the fact that although zombies instantly bite secondary characters, the main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being married to. Another laugh is Mr. Fingaz, who is unable to pronounce the word "turnstile" (toe-no-kit?). <br /> <br /> Overall, it's somewhat fun. I could use some more interesting characters, but I was slightly impressed for the original Sci-Fi Channel.
