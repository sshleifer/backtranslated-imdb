This film has a pretty decent FX Sequence for 1936. The reason you didn't see it is because viewers in the 1930s were in love with Jeanette MacDonald's; in which the star of the same name ran after countless songs while the land stopped. FX crosses time very well. MacDonald's songs are not, and the awkward insertion of these songs to show off her only typical talent is not good. The difficult equipment of two friends who grew up to become a priest and hoodlum is given the next ride (Manhattan Melodrama, The Departed). You've heard the song 'San Francisco' three times in thirty minutes. Entertainment in the 1930s is generally an accumulation of irritation. Only the Grand Hotel of the decade precedes harassment to the level that is listed in San Francisco, Dinner at 8, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, All Quiet on the Western Front, Les Miserables etc.
