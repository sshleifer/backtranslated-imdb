Well, for starters, this movie wasn't like a book at all. I read the book when I was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. When I'm waiting for another book to come out, it's a book I turn to fill the time. I have 3 copies for God. Anyway, I knew it wouldn't be like a book, but come on! They could have done it a little better than this. I mean, if I wanted to watch an American werewolf in Paris or London before watching the movies. They took a perfectly good story and turned it into a copy of a story that was told over and over again, and frankly I'm tired of watching him. I mean the best part of the whole story, f ***** g (sorry), to end up with Gabriel. He won't die. What was it about? And he's old in this movie. Gabriel is to be just 24 no 44 da ** it. Awww. And Astrid, who ** came up with the idea of ​​Astrid being Vivian is aunt no no no no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwww. Anyway, yeah, that was my little rage seriously pi ** ed off. I hope it helped.
