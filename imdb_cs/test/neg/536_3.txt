This film smells mostly. The only reason I gave him 3 was because the graphics were graceful. It is a total disregard for the conspiracy and the lack of even insignificant development of surface characters seemed like a bunch of nice drawings. This is by far the worse anime released from Japan. I can't believe they actually put their names on this waste. What is rip off selling this stuff for $ 20. If you haven't seen it, don't bother. If you have, I'm sorry.
