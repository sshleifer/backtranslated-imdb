I have seen this program several times and the more I see it, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears did this because she's a sister of Britney and I'm sorry for the show. They created the character Zoey to make everything people want to believe that Jamie Lynn is, smart, original, clever, handsome, popular, etc. The characters around her are there just to look better, by being smarter than them, more popular than them, more boys wanted. There is nothing original and it is poured with money, so every boy has the best fashion and stuff. I also have to say that for a 13-year-old girl (or whatever she is, she can't be much older) she wears very mature clothes, those short skirts are too short, young people want to wear them, and all that make-up, this contributes to growing problems why young girls get into so many trouble. All I can say is that Jamie Lynn sings the opening credits and is not bad at all because of her age, much better than her sister in terms of voice skills. Sorry, it's too mature and yet too dull. It's wrong with predictable storylines and there are too many stereotypes.
