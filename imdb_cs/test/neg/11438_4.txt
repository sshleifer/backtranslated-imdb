This film was bad and movies about how some college students stay in the house to raise money by refurbishing it, and then find out that there is a Deamon woman in the house and that there is a portal to hell. piles of stupid scenes like the beginning of the movie, how to clean the house and start dancing to a raw song and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes who are trying to make scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when a professor He gets his face ripped. Just hired this movie because I'm a big horror fan and his only worth watching if u are fans of horror movies. really bad one good actor is Roy Scheider from the big Jaws movie and through this movie he's got a lot of bugs and my rating is 4 out of 10.
