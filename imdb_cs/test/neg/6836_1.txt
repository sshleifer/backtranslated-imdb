It's hard to spoil this story. Great Book / GOOD Movie Version by Fred Zinneman, but this movie is amazing! First, casting was terrible. Richard Gere should play Jackal himself because Edward Fox was a similar type of cypher and didn't need to go wrong with the original script by adding so many worthless (fluffy) fluff. This movie reminded me of so many Bruce Willis movies as you see huge costs, with nothing film available to him. (It's his "conspiracy theory") It takes some real work to make the film so bad from such an original scenario. Every person from Michael Caton Jones down should be banned from making movies for 10 years; such is the insult of this film for real filmmakers. If Hollywood went to rehearse for not knowing what they were doing, this movie should be exposed to A. Shame on you ALL!
