I don't understand why people praise this film. I didn't like it at all. I look at him with several people. Neither of them cared. First. It's just that another low budget studio is trying to make a big name for the story. The actual shooting looks like a live TV interview. Make-up is bad. When you watch a movie along with DVD add-ons. You will see that there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people involved. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and parodies that have been added to it. I have read several books and followed a few appearances on this story. What I have always caught from this material is that it was a serious horror story. I really wish someone could make a good movie. That always fascinated me. The bad deal really destroyed the story. The situation of the little boys even pushed it even further. When you watch this movie. The little boy and his problem is what you and your friends will remember and laugh at. It didn't make sense why his brothers laughed at what had happened to him. It was as if the witch should be so terrible, but it was okay to throw her brother. It's an incredible story with him and his little problem. I can't get through a little girl who says, "Mom said tobacco would brush your teeth." Frank Fox's statement and facial expression is so bad. The scene in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid. It seems that the sound of its parts is from the psycho movie. Also, the girl hovering over the bed and her little "bladder control problem" are from Exorcist. This film lacks creativity. We gave the movie for a few minutes and we knew it was a mess. I also noticed that these were defects in film quality. Parts of it seemed like you could film on your home video camera. I noticed that many people in the credits had many jobs. This is probably the way this film was composed. Someone said I liked the story. I'll get all my friends and make a movie about the camcorder and the computer. It doesn't matter if we know how to act. As long as we get it on the film and say it's good. We got family and prepared food. Then he sat down and watched as this failed movie attempt.
