I had great hopes to see it because I always enjoyed Paul Bettany's performance. I thought he was very good, like Darwin, and he did his best to consider the horrible material he had to work with. Darwin's book on the origin of species was one of the most striking, controversial and innovative things. Publications never, but you would never think of this boring movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. For example, there is nothing about Darwin's five-year voyage on the Beagle to the Galapagos Islands that could be extremely important to the story, as he began to develop his evolutionary theory from his exploration of wildlife. Br /> <br /> This is just one long, rough, home drama when Darwin portrayed a slightly eccentric eccentric, saw the vision of his dead daughter everywhere and got a cold shoulder by his emotionally-constipated woman. Emma Darwin's Jennifer Connelly is nothing less than terrible and has little relation to the historical stories of a real Emma. There could have been an opportunity to present a creationist interpretation of life on Earth, whether from an Emmy or from a local priest, as Jeremy Northam (blink-a-ty-miss-it-part) played. talented actor) to act as a counterweight to Darwin's views but was not accepted. The story too focused on endless mawkish moods about Darwin's grief for his daughter Annie and too much time was also wasted in Darwin when he wondered if to write his book. In the end, I was so boring that it was hard to take care of him. All in all, it was a bit like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him when he struggled with his girlfriend and didn't bother to mention he's an artist.
