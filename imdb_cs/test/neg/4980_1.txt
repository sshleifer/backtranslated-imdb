I went through movies on demand and I saw Underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes so I decided to watch it. I didn't expect too much, but I overcame the expectation of being terrible. Everything that was on the film was good. The dialogue was harsh, including many terrible puns. The jokes were also terrible. I found myself screaming and waving from the TV screen when I suffered from this garbage. He hit his target audience very well, but I don't see how anyone else could enjoy this movie. This made me very angry and almost cry because everything terrible this movie went for it. The only nice thing about this movie was able to put 1/10 on display. I beg you to avoid it at any cost. I understand he did it for the children, but there's nothing sympathetic about it.
