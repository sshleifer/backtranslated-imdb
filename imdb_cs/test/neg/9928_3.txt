... before you can easily find the biggest film error. What was the motive? The details of the murders were used, but never explained. I think the team got into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely missing. There is no thread to follow. I think if it was done correctly, the movie would take a little longer, but it would be worth it, at least for me. Casting is very good, I love Wilson Vicky vulnerable. There's not much to say, really. But I really want them to focus a little more on the less obvious. <br /> <br />
