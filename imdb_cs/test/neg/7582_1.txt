That this movie was stitched on the chapel wall as proof that God was really dead. Am I the only one who really saw (rather sleeping) through this "movie"? This is the only movie I've ever seen in the theater that I don't regret not coming out and asking for my money back - it was just dull. And I even saw "Highlander 2: The Quickening" at the local cinema. From start to finish, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikely things that are linked by circumstances that ultimately work as best friends. The action (there is little) is goofy and as boring as the writer's skull. Thank you for seeing us at our deity when watching our "cinema" that there is no chance for "Air America 2".
