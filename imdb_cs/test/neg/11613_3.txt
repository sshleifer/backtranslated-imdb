While the prominent and excessive use of a game-like format is fully operational throughout the film, it's not what this image would allow. Rather, it is an unconvincing female performance and rather a boring scenario on which the film has so obviously relied. With an idea that has a potential, a simple drawing is diminished by the fact that Graham could not really express the devastation her character stubbornly claims. The use of improvised scenes by all actors would not be such a bad idea if only two leading ladies could use this privilege. As Downey Jr proves, as usual, what a talented actor is, he shades two actresses in their scenes together, which is constantly evident. The senseless but intense sex scene seems to exist only to prevent the film from being too verbally expressive, giving actors a well-deserved break from speaking. With an unsatisfactory conclusion, the two girls and the guy have very little to recommend otherwise than Downey Jr's impressive, if not out of place.
