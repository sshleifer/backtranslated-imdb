When my mom went down to the video store to rent a movie for the night, my sister and I learned a lesson to always get my mom to the video store! The only reason she chose was that Colin Firth was in it and she * coughs * thinks he's a good actor! It starts with some beautiful African Africans and then goes down and down and down and down. After this movie, I was very surprised that Colin Firth got as far as he did, because this pointless movie could ruin any actor's career. The story is about divorced women the son tries to deal with. a man named Matthew Fields whom he met while impressing his friends for his big house. Nimi's divorce doesn't like Matthew at all and goes out with a local vicar who doesn't like his son John. ... and the same with him! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if you disagree with me and I hope I insulted you, but I will leave you with one word of warning to all people who have not seen this movie, DO NOT FIND THIS FILM !!!!!
