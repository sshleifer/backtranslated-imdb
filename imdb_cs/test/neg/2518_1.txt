I, like most other people, saw this movie after I heard it from Patton Oswald. Oddly enough, it was easier to find than I thought it would be. Although it should not be surprising that I have found it to be used. The storyline is masterfully summed up in the title. It's the bed she eats. Nothing more nothing less. There is an effort to throw into the story, but not very good. Demon's blood ended up on the bed and as a result became obsessed. It absorbs everything that happens on it by absorbing and dissolving in what seems to be orange Fanta. There is an artist who has fallen victim to the bed, but has been sick and ends up in a picture in the room he occupies. This narration is narrated entirely through him. <br /> <br /> This movie will fail all in all, even with bad behavior. Yet it is not without its own spell tag.
