For director David O. Selznick, no director would ever do it. Therefore, we get two on "Farewell to Arms" (1957)? Charles Vidor and John Huston. Although both men were quite perfect in their own right, none could make the head or tail of this disastrous remake of the Hemmingway magnus opus. Hemmingway generally never translated well from book to screen. But under Selznick's zeal to turn him into his next 'Gone With The Wind', the excursion is both criminal and exhausting. At this point in Selznick's career, he was no longer Titan who could take the "box office poison" and turn it into Away with the Wind. Tired, fragile, minus his studio, and with the impending feeling that his second marriage to Jennifer Jones might have been a mistake, Selznick handed the creative governments of this film to Fox Studios? but he left enough to become a damn harassment on the scene. Now he is or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of Sister Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her hero hero, Lt. Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). It is believed that their passion will serve as a stabilizing force for what is essentially the story of a war correspondent with romanticism cast on a good scale. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both turgid and boring. In the last reel, Jones's facial twist is so bad at birth. Part of the problem with Jones is that at thirty-eight he is too wise to play with the optimistic Qatari with great conviction. Older actresses, however, often managed to forget the audience's irregularities in age. Not with Jones. One is consciously aware that he is not involved in the law either in actors or in the years invested on this planet. Hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly in contact with the stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken, but the head remains strong. The support cast is littered with luminaires such as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but they are unnecessary bits of nonsense that in no way reflect the hopeful talents of actors and are best shown elsewhere in the filmmaking canon. > <br /> The anamorphic image element for "Farewell to Arms" looks good, although there is too much film grain available for this reviewer in some scenes. Overall, the colors are subtle and subdued, even though they are balanced in accordance with the DeLuxe color processing used at this time. Some fading is obvious. The shape tones do not look too natural. Contrast levels are weak. Blacks are usually stiff. White is almost clean. It's not much to recommend this movie sonically. It's basically a scary picture with gun shots as a background. There are no add-ons.
