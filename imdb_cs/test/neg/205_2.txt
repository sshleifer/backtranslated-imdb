What a bad movie, that place was there, the actors were there. And yet, a believable plot, a good dialogue, the characters involved were somewhat absent. <br /> <br /> A typical robbery lacks the assumption that the system is built against every human being. The lead character Tye and his little brother were not lucky and their house would be put off, along with Matt Dillon (Who doesn't look much older than Tye, so he wasn't sure how it happened) to rescue with a plan to steal armored money on who work as guardians. Tye has a short flirting with her conscience, but decides to go with him. And so a really horrible 30-minute incredible waste hole begins. I will not list all the ways in which this film was unrealistic, but let me point out the main ones: <br /> <br /> Because Tye has decided to be a good guy because the homeless has become a side damage, all his close friends including his godfather are dying . His godfather, who is said to be a family and a man who brought him to caper at the last minute to help him die for Tye. Tye destroys all the money in the process of frustrating his friends and godparents. The money came from the same bank that returned the house. And yet he chose him over the supposed family of Matt Dillon. There are many more, needless to say, this film was rough and I really hope no one else will see it.
