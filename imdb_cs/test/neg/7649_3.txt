In fact, I do not consider myself a conservative, so I was not personally insulted by the film, but it was clear that the storyline and characteristics in this film were secondary to the message. And the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid (or both). The characters are one-dimensional - either good, loving Americans free, or helpless, greedy, evil conservatives. There is nothing clever or creative, just anti-conservative. I'm not really interested in political bias, but it shouldn't be the only purpose of the film. And it is clear. The positive thing is that the cast is wonderful and the impression of Chris Cooper is a funny first two or three, but then it's the same old joke that has been said, So if you really hate conservatives, you'll probably enjoy this movie but if you are looking for something with realistic characters and a story that is less monochrome then you should watch something different.
