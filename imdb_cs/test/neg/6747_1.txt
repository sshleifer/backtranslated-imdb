Only in the Hollywood audiovisual fictional world could anyone, including FBI agents, be so incredibly stupid. Good guys are stupid enough to pick up everything they're interested in, answer the phones, step up the stairs, everyone was looking for a demolition expert to get everyone. Oh yes, and then we get Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He can be shot, even if he has a vest, and then falls down a long flight of stairs and then still has the upper hand over his stupid pursuers. All the clich√©s you could imagine in thrilling movies were used. I just watched it because Yuki Amami is so HOT. Oh, but yes, it's great to see how morally superior the FBI agent is when she's sure there's a bomb in the opera house, and she can't hear the alarm. Who writes these scripts ????????????
