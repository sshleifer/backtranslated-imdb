L'Humanité is a murder mystery. These movies tend to be popular, <br /> <br /> and a 6.9 rating that currently suggests it was also. Unfortunately, this film has no redeeming features at all. Several non-pilots, for example, include a 5-minute scene where <br /> <br /> the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minutes <br /> <br /> where she breathes. <br /> <br /> If you're interested, it's not really art. It is not even a commentary on humanity, which seems to be trying to be <br /> <br /> to be. It's actually boring. There are numerous attempts in this <br /> <br /> movie to say something about humanity. One might think that he would say, "How would I speak to humanity?" Of course, obviously obvious, boring answers will be sex, love and death. Not that these options are uninteresting when it would be good - just <br /> <br /> they are canonical options. For sex, this movie does its best to <br /> <br /> to make it unattractive and disgusting. Therefore, in the first five minutes - <br /> <br /> it is not a spoiler - you will see a bloody vagina of the murdered eleven-year-old girls; it's a murder mystery, remember? You can turn on <br /> <br /> later, a couple of people fit and have what the director would like us to believe is "raw" sex, but in fact it is <br /> <br /> resourceful and too symbolic - but worse, uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I enjoy interfering movies. This movie showed me why: <br /> <br /> Disturbing movies usually show something inside someone, <br /> <br /> their humanity they didn't know existed and are a little bit <br /> <br /> afraid . L'Humanité tried to do this and failed, and I walked <br /> <br /> from the theater without being disturbed but disgusted because I thought I had <br /> <br /> useless time in the theater, though he saw a movie for <br /> <br /> for free.
