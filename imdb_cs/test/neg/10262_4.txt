I saw this last night and I was a fan of the first demons and I hoped the sequel would have the same fun, spooky spirit of the predecessor. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The arrangement is similar to the first, in which a horde of demon demons set off into reality by being released from a horror movie that is being played ... (The first was a cinema, this takes place in an apartment building and on television.) madness and mass bloodshed. This is largely in terms of plot development. It worked nicely in the first part because of FX ghoub makeup, fast pace and unpredictability. However, it does not cut the continuation. The first problem seems to be that there are too many characters who really don't care one way or another. If they were poisonous or idiots, then there would be at least some kind of pleasure when they are inevitably massacred / demonized / alive ... but these people are just waiting to be defeated. In addition, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and beyond) is constantly changing between them, which has torn me out of the story. There are some fun pieces, courtesy splatter FX and campiness. Like a constant stream of dripping blood that passes through her building one floor after another, as if it were an alien acid ... The first demon who has a girl with a crab's birthday leads to the destruction of her entire party and the haunted demon child who wobbles the tenant who is pregnant with a baby. However, this sequence parlays into a ridiculously looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts out of the chest of a human child that constantly flies across the room at his intended victim. I have some laughter from the scene, but I don't think it was Bava's intention. The scene would probably work better if they had a demon child attack a woman, but hey ... Other things like exaggeration of most characters and bad dubbing don't help things. In summary, I managed to see an unrated version on DVD and I can't imagine having to sit all the way through the previously available version of R, because FX and gore were all I got out of it. Also notable is the early role of producer Argento's future hottie daughter, Asia. In fact, she probably gives the best performance of the entire cast and she is barely on screen. Argento / Bava fans may want to look at it just to see it, but they will probably find themselves looking at watches just like me. Gore fans could get a kick out of some of the FX, but they will laugh out of their chairs at the most goofy-looking evil baby puppet from Little Selwyn of Dead / Alive. It could be worse, but it certainly won't live by the original.
