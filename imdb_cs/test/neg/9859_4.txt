As I admitted to being a chess addict, I was excited to see a documentary about the check-in between Garry Kasparov and the IBM Deep Blue supercomputer. I was hoping to see a deeper look at the match and a lot of what Kasparov had to say. The boy was wrong and misled me. This documentary is like many modern documentary films - there's a lot of flashes, but no real essence. After watching it, I'm sad when I said I felt I had wasted my time. One of the most unpleasant aspects of documentary film is that it will not stay in one place for a decent time. It has a typical MTV-type editing where the camera displays different images and fast sound every five seconds. It is very sad that filmmaking was linked to the attention of a 10-year-old. I understand that it's hard to make a movie about chess, but that doesn't mean it would be flashy. "Game Over" has some interesting ideas. This provoked the idea of ​​whether computers could think of human beings or not; whether computers have advanced to a unique new level. This is what Kasparov thought after the match, but this film is not enough for this idea. Also this film tries to bring a bizarre theory. He tries to indicate the paranoid that a human being has done with the help of a computer. Kasparov suspected this, but there is no evidence to this day. Towards the end of the film, he tries to suggest the bizarre that perhaps Anatoly Karpov could be a human being who secretly made moves with the help of Deep Blue. It is interesting to think, but I do not know how it is possible or realistic. Still, I wouldn't recommend this movie, even for chess-dependent chess.
