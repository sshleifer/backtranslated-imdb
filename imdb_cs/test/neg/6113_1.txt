One day I watched TV with a friend and caught the last twenty minutes of "Running Bananas". Believe me when I say it was enough to get a good judgment on the film. The first scene I saw was a monkey, the kid, the fat guy and a black man who looked like Dave Chappelle flying around in the corn. While everyone else was solemn on this journey, the monkey seemed to be on some sort of drug where he was still shouting something that resembled the English word faster. They then landed on a twenty yard long dock in Africa. After the heart felt goodbye, where the monkey screamed (Hahahaha), the "villains" of the film appeared. They tore the entire ass in their Cadillac year when the evil monkey took a jump on Air Jordan from the dock to a boat that was 40 meters away and made them sink their beautiful car into the Pacific Ocean. Having seen this film, I have a new purpose in life; find a dwarf who played a monkey and stabbed him with a fountain pen.
