Catastrophic! Depressing! Terrible! Ridiculous! Disappointed! Right, your trapped in "The Cave" with a few "hard" men and women or two, your being systematically killed "Something" and you still don't get to hear any naughty Adult words! A 15 Cert 'here in England, and you could say! Egos of "Macho Men" was too much to go through the bucket I'll be sick. This film should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the earth and forever forgotten. I feel that this description is not the first time you have denied your head from a hole in the ground. Like the Cube movie, it looked like a good concept, but it was just left down to the last post, well its own. <br /> <br /> This commentary includes Spoilers all right, its called The Cave. Thanks to Bruce.
