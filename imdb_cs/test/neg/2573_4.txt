Because I'm not a big fan of Steven Seagal, I thought it was a pretty good movie. Obviously, his fans are very dissatisfied with this drama, which lacks an abundance of martial arts and brute force. Gailard Sartain plays the leader of patriot patriots of the militia at a distance from ATF. weapons violation. He surrenders his plans to release a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who has contacted a provincial physician who is developing to find an antidote for a fatal mistake that has made a small town more difficult. His grandfather is an American herbal medicine figure to salvation. Remarkable performance of L.Q. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My personal favorite in this movie is Whitney Yellow Robe. She is overwhelming, and she seems to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role. Despite the fact that it was at the end, it was a decent movie that could have used much more action.
