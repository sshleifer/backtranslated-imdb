This critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch the Angels and Demons movie the first night when it came out, even though it was a school night because "Angels and Demons are worth it." Two out of four read the book. Of those who didn't, he wore pink skinny jeans. This was the least dangerous part of the evening following the hideous angels and demons. The film begins in a lab where antimatter is created during the next process. And apparently someone knows about it or something. Notice how much I am confused. I don't understand what happened: they were just doing antimatter. Vittoria finds her own father dead ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is PRINTOUT, not burning on one's chest. They select the X-33 scene. They pull Maxmillan Kohl. Mostly they take CERN and its associated symbolism. They pull Hassasin out and replace him with some religious, British guy. They pull out the Illuminati Diamond. They take out Vittoria's almost rape scene. They take Langond's fight with Hassasin (now a British crack dude). They pull out the press guy who's watching them. Death of the Fourth Cardinal. They reject the fact that Camerlengo becomes Pope. They choose the spectacular Camerlengo scheme. They pulled Langdon in the helicopter and landed on this island. They pulled out the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They choose Langdon's fun and, unfortunately, take Vittoria's sexual attraction. In addition to losing the focus of detail, the film is HORRIBLY. It must be admitted that there were some good things. For example, the Sistine Chapel recreation had to be extremely difficult and very well done. The explosion scene was MIND-BLOWING. Other than that, SCREW THIS FILM FOR EQUIPMENT BOOKS FOR PEOPLE NOT READING.
