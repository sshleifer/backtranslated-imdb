Blake Edwards tried to change the picture of Julie Andrews in this film. He tried to make her sexy unaware that she was already. I think they were both still a little ugly that Julie was not chosen to make her Broadway Camelot success and was dissatisfied. Unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to try to alleviate this belief. It gets to the point where it is almost funny to see Rock Hudson, who we all know was now gay, kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie. Looks like you're trying to convince you that Julie is a fatal femme, but that Rock is straight. Sadly, they have absolutely no chemistry and endless kissing scenes start grosing one out. Another mistake they made with this picture didn't know what kind of movie they were doing. It's almost three separate movies. There is a drama Julie as a German spy trying to get a military secret from Rock. There is an air war movie with lots of shots from WWI's historic aircraft swooping around and there are silly humor attempts that Blake Edwards seems to have to put in each of his images to see if it's appropriate or not, in this case, it was not. The only truly redeeming qualities in this movie are always looking at the beautiful Dame Julie and hearing her singing in crystal clear soprano. Of course, if you love her, you can overlook the weaknesses of this film for her. You can always say it was a lot better than sitting over STAR!
