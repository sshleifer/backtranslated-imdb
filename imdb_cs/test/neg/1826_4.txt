I had great expectations of getting into the movie, but unfortunately I feel left behind. I bought it for $ 5 on a used VHS site and the version I bought was an English dubbed version. Dubbing is terrible, so be careful. "Lola" just wasn't as good at this movie as in "Run Lola Run", and the bad guy just came out of nowhere. And "Lola" is beginning to grasp what's going on when he gets to college. It seems unrealistic to me. I was also wondering if American soundtracks were in American songs in the original version ... they seemed extremely out of place. Too bad for this movie, I really thought it would be rock.
