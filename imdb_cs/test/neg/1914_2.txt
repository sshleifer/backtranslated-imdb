I watched it on the cable because I was a big Leelee fan. Big mistake. What a terrible movie. You don't care about any of the characters in the movie. Chris Klein plays a guy who is a total jerk in the movie and steals his longtime girlfriend Josh Hartnett. If the writer knew what they were doing, this film would follow the proven formula, and Hartnett made his ass and Leelee as a girlfriend trapped in the wrong relationship that Klein was saved from. But Hartnett is a really great person who shows a lot of emotions and love for Leelee. You then hate leelee because he cheats on Hartnett and Klein, who is for everyone in the city trying to help him and really got stuck. It's also really campy, and the characters do everything but run around the kitchen dancing and lips synching, and using hair brushes and spoons and fake microphones (though they come very close). What a terrible horrible movie. You don't even care about what happens in the end because the director never cares about your characters.
