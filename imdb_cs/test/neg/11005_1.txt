I went into this movie with an open mind. I was too lazy to go to a video store to choose a movie, and my friend came back. I promised him I wouldn't laugh at his choice, but during the first five minutes I told him I'd have to take my promise back. We watched, hoping it would be better, but not; followed by continuous rape. This "movie" was probably one of the worst movies ever committed to film, and certainly deserves a place on IMDb Bottom 100. I really don't know how it has become distributed. Lighting was bad. I saw better playing at elementary school. There is nothing positive about that.
