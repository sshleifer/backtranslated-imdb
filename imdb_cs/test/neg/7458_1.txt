Everything about this movie is bad. all. Ridiculous 80s hairstyles. Ridiculous mustaches. Ridiculous action and fight against scenes where you can actually see that the opponents didn't even hit. Bad, bad, bad 80's music. Repeated scenes of people running through the forest. Bad guy with silver plastic hand and silly hair. Stupid dialogue. There is no activity. Everything looks extremely cheap. This film even surpasses "Plan 9 from space" in its utter badness. It's not "funny bad", it's just bad.
