What atomic bomb movie. The story goes nowhere. He leaves the viewer with his hands up and says "it's it". What happened to Redford. He was once a fair actor. Now he thinks he can show up on the scene and do a few scenes and that's right. Poorly. What is a novel movie. I don't want to be so cruel, but what movie. Incredible amateur bullshit. If I were in this movie, I'd be so embarrassed not to show my face. I'm telling you what, if I was connected to this movie, I'm in great trouble. This film will go down in the film making annals as the king of the bomb, with which all others will be compared.
