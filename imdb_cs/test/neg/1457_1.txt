It is a film that has received any interest or praise that it simply received on merit to be a lesbian interest. The performances are mostly emotionless compared to the better films in the genre of interest GLBT. The traceable value of the film gains a modest tension over whether and when family members of the partners say something that discourages their lesbian relationship. The best feature of the movie is probably the beautiful scenery of New England, although much of the film is set in. It's hard to imagine a viewer watching this movie and looking for confirmation of their GLBT lifestyle or wishing to see what others have confirmed, despite the poorly realized drama, could appreciate the water from the water. It's a horrible movie.
