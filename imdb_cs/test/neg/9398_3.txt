Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy, and Tuscany is beautiful, but this movie is no better than average and it is generous. The story is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolving. Set (say) in Newark's suburb, a conspiracy would be considered ridiculous. Everything that the film rescues is a Tuscan landscape and occasional scenes in Florence and Positano, and a film that is reflected in the sun and slowly, in the West, would better serve to show what it is. the most beautiful locations in the world.
