I've never seen such a story about talented pegs that their golden goose couldn't lie. These spunk monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. I was sorry for troy when he tried to connect all his friends to Hollywood concerts, but as things turned sour, everyone let them hang. Over night, the effort was made to confidently retaliate for a man who went against Hollywood forces to preserve the integrity of the story. The simple assumption of Overnight is to try out the message, "Look at this guy, he blew it all out" when he actually has a strong underground sequel, he dealt with cruel strikes from friends and executives in the name of getting a project done as he intended. Honestly, the only productive par that some of these guys played in the overall performance of Boondock Saints culminated in nothing more than the other bodies in the first bar scene, after all they did was whimper why they weren't bigger. based on bullying their violent efforts on top of the ramen troys.
