GOOD: Acting was great especially by Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon. BAD: I am a visible minority (not white) and have experienced some kind of racism in my life. But in spite of my life experience and the theme of the movie, I would not say that this film is the best of the year, in fact it is FAR. I have problems with this film both from the perspective of a film viewer and a visible minority. Some of my problems with this movie are: <br /> <br /> (1) Bad character development (or none at all). Just because we've seen extremes in character, for example Matt Dillon is a racist cop and is a good carer for his sick father, that doesn't mean the character is well developed. Yes, I admit that in a large cast of the file as in this movie, it is quite difficult for any character to be well-developed, but that does not mean that in any of the characters should be such. (2) Dialogue seems to be really created to the extent that I am really surprised that this film won for the best original script. They should show this film not in the writing script because it is good, but show students and future writers what to do. I felt I was struck again and again with the head of how bad racism was. I have it. (3) The story seems random, it is laughter. What are the chances that a black car thief goes over an Asian guy who also becomes a human trader when he enters his van, and that same black car thief ended up carjacking that Asian guy is picking up a few hours after bringing him to the hospital just to find out that several Asians who are trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black robber has a good side after all? Or what about the scene, where the prejudice white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudices and hatred disappeared into the air? If it were so simple, why don't we throw every racist in America down the stairs, so they'll change their hearts? (4) I think my biggest doubts about this film are an unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, it is a realistic view of racism that it is more hidden than on the face. I was refused to enter the supermarket because I'm not white. Did the store owner say because I wasn't white? No, he said the store was closing, though there were lots of shoppers inside. Screaming racial curses? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some drivers in the cabin are unlikely to stop to pick you up because you are not white, but that does not mean they will try to run you over or get out and say racial curses. If a Chinese woman closes me, I'm not going to call "Blake! Blake! Learn some English bitch!". On the other hand, if I were a Chinese woman and by mistake ended up with a Mexican woman, I wouldn't say "Mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her. Things don't work like that. Instead, I would give out my insurance information, say sorry and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. This is real racism. It's hidden and not in the face. In any case, unlike what some people say, Crash is not original. Intertwined and intertwined lines of stories, conspiracies, and characters were made earlier. "Magnolia" is a film that does much better than Crash, and has never been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. It had a star cast - Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won the best actor recently), Tom Cruise, etc. It really bogs my mind as Crash was even nominated for the best picture.
