I wasn't sure where it was going to the end. when it turned out to be a liberal conspiracy to convey the world to the European wimps and the UN. What is the load of the right wing! By the way, a bit about Canada, which joined the US, had nothing to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed. The only point that seems to have made the main character eligible to run for President (but they could only have made him American and surrendered it). In any case, it was a bull's load and not worth your time. If you can't see this kind of thing well, check out the brilliant BBC political thriller "State of Play".
