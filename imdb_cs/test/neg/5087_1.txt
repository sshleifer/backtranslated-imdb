In addition to beautiful pictures thanks to New Zealand cameraman Alun Bollinger, this film is not worth seeing. The storyline is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what's going on at a given time, and just when you think you'll follow, the direction changes again, just like a lost bi-polar puppy. The musical score is terrible, relying too heavily on extremely emotional pieces that try to force the audience to feel in a certain way as if the instruments are a queue of emotions? "Here is sad"; "I feel shocked here"; "You feel afraid here." In addition, repeated samples leave the audience on the verge of laughter again and again. Gone are the days of silent film where musical instruments were the only voice display? but while watching the Queen River, you wouldn't think so. Voice-over has been so overused that one has to wonder if this movie really needed any accompanying images. It could easily be a radio play, though it would be difficult to follow the story. And the stolen ideas from Jane Campion's The Piano are too obvious to overlook. Not only are the beaches and forest shots almost identical to those in The Piano? Maybe some of them come to work with the camera of Alun Bollinger on the other one? the feeling and level of voice are also remarkably close. And who could forget when the character of Holly Hunter has her wings trimmed, in the form of a forefinger that Sam Neill cut off. Does it remind you when Wirem has his "trigger finger" amputated and, surprisingly, with an ax? I thought so. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can't recommend this movie for viewing unless you wear some hearing protectors and just go with the landscape in mind.
