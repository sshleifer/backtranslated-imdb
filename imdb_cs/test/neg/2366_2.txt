A good ol 'boy movie is almost necessary to have a moonlight, a chase car, a story that has a vague resemblance to a "plot" and at least one very pretty gal country, barefoot with short shorts and a low top. Pretty girl is here (dressed in designer jeans) - but the resolutions stop there. Jimmy Dean is as natural as a sausage spokesman, but as a tough guy of a former sheriff he comes shortly. Big John is big but not convincing with the "bad" part of his moniker. Bug-eyed Jack Elam is as terrible as ever and Bo Hopkins has played this same part for decades; Ned Beatty also does his part in a small role ... but there is no STORY. It smells more like an episode of Warm Night than a feature film. Cornball cornpone with easy predictable sentiment. Perhaps the most vibrant problem with this film is Charlie Daniels singing the theme. You know it; It was famous ... Jimmy Dean.
