This is pure CRAP and probably the worst biblical theme film ever ... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, before the big flood they gave Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot described Noah as a friend, even though he lived after Noah. To make matters worse, Lot later became a pirate and attacked Noah's ark during the flood! And what about the merchant who comes on a boat moving across the water with a bicycle mechanism? And exchanging alcohol for food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as an alcoholic!? Mockers and continuous blasphemy one by one, and that goes on and on, and ... The filmmaker and all the participants have certainly secured the first row in hell with this garbage ... <br /> <br /> Please stay out of this crap, because you save almost three hours of your life.
