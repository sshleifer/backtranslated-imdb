I usually start my reviews explaining how and why I watched the movie I'm viewing. I just can't explain that. The next day I had to be awake, so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a movie I didn't know about. But something that kept me stuck to my comfortable futon when I watched this vehicle Heather Graham. Oh, that's true. Boredom. Graham plays Jolin, a bohemian nut who seems obsessed with his promises than the one she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her husband decides to go looking for better things (work, women and scripts, presumably), Joline starts a fanatical effort to find her husband and free him from the "spiritual cart". It sounds like I'm doing it, but I'm not. In fact, it's a little more than an acting drama for Graham, when Phoebe-from-Friends plays the role of an actor. Oh and Goran "ER" Visnjic is also there, for some reason. TV plans lost it as a comedy, but I couldn't find any laughter. It occurred to me that it was a personal journey for Lisa Krueger (director and writer), in the same form as "Girl, Interrupted", but even that it was more laughing than this. Graham's character is simply too focused to look after, and I was sorry for my husband, who had promised to bravely fight for his freedom from his brightly married wife. Very little of this film made sense because the characters just appeared in the story as if they were standing around waiting for Graham to appear as additions to "The Truman Show." In fact, the only positive note I can make from my scribes was "Heather Graham - nice baps". And that wasn't because I was too tired to enjoy the movie. In truth, it is very difficult to think of someone who would recommend this movie. The Graham purists (a very small number of all filmmakers, I think you will agree) will have to be determined to watch that these students who collect American dreams will take something from it. I was amazed that the average rating (at the time of writing) was 5.0 - that would make this movie as good as "Die Another Day" and "Gothika" in my book and that's just not right. "Committed" is an unpredictable strange mess of film that doesn't even entertain or lighten. It's complicated, pointless and just too boring for my taste and probably yours too. You don't even think about it.
