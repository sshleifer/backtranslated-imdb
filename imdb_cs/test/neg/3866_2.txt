The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS is a film that looks great when it plays but does not affect the viewer. The tame story of Dietrich, who is torn between two men, becomes a mammoth cabaret star and fights for the care of his child, is disordered and often feels like pieces of three separate films that are half-baked. Dietrich is steadfastly cast in a somewhat passive, reactive role for much of the film, and her character remains aloof from viewers, while Herbert Marshal is unconvincing as her ill-tempered husband, and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a great suitor who slanders in and out of the picture . The film contains some interesting pieces ("Hot Voodoo" is the highest point), which is impressively surrealistic for this Hollywood era, although it proves it has no benefit in such a dull, incoherent film.
