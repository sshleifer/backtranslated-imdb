This is by far the most avid, idiotic, madly stupid show that has always been in the air, and it comes from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bums". My wife loves watching a reality show - and there was one episode of this drivel where wannabes had to develop a "walk". The end result was straight out of Monty Python's "Department of Silly Walks" sketch. I couldn't laugh enough. And then there is the ubiquitous Mrs. Banks (as she laughs until ...). Since Rosie O'Donnell left "The View", she has to be the most interesting woman on TV. It is as if modeling for mankind has done great things. Please. I have never considered her attractive, and now I do not hire her intelligent to open her mouth. Someone has to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.
