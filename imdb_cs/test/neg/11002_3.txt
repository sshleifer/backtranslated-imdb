Fanglys takes place in the small town of Texan called Layton on the eve of Halloween, when the townspeople consider it the second coming of Christ or something I think Halloween is not so important? Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) was called to another murder because local boy Ned (co-founder John William Galt) discovered the body in the local forests. Could it be Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in the local legend of a witch who kills teenagers, who knows? Being a fun kind of guy is Mark (asisstant director and producer Robert Harvey) convinces his missus Kelly (Laurie Reeves) to ride out to the cemetery that his friend Steven (Josh Gobin) found the night before on a Halloween party. The idea of ​​spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to Kelly & she agrees, along with Steven and the girl he picked up on behalf of Camille (Natalie Woods) and their nerdy friend Jerry (Tim Boswell). Out for a night of fun as well as a lot of fun as you can expect in an isolated cemetery. Soon, however, he discovers that the legend of the Fang Lady is far from the bedtime story that many recognize ... <br /> <br /> Modified, executive producer, written and director Christopher Abram Fanglys is a nice horror movie garbage. The script is very predictable, boring and does not bring any kind of fun value at all, in the right hands and with a decent budget Fanglys could be an effective horror movie, but it is not. It moves at a fair pace, but the action on the screen is so bad that it doesn't matter, I don't know what else to say other than The Fanglys is a really bad movie and I don't see anyone who makes it any enjoyment. The dialogue is basic, the characters are cliché and lifeless, while as a whole the film appears much longer than 90 minutes. There are several lame attempts at humor that do not fit so well along horror elements and what was it retard retention in this cage? I would imagine that the budget did not allow the creators to show it. If you want to know what's going to happen to Jerry at the end, you'll have too closely monitored credits to reveal the lame truth, assuming you can do so far (believe me it takes somehow)). Director Abram does nothing special. Abram thinks that bathing scenes in neon light is stylish, I can tell him it's not when your movie is set in the forest. There is no atmosphere, fear, tension, excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror good. Forget about a decent gore, there's a little when someone eats the skin from the shoulder and fork stuck through someone's throat. sometimes having a commercial release, and being brutally honest it shows. What about the retarded guy and his fake jokes that look ridiculous? Terrible special effects, a cinematography camcorder and terrible gameplay from everyone involved, making it even more painful. <br /> <br /> Fanglys is a direct video bullshit, has no balancing features What is and what is a low IMDb user score is fully justified, it's one of those movies I've been watching for hours and wishing you get it all done.
