New Year 2006 and watching Glimmer Man again. Tell me what you like, I find Steven Seagal's fun movies. Like many comments, even good combat sequences - I especially liked that his phone call in the restaurant said how long it would be closed for restoration. A bit like Schwarzenegger's humor in earlier action movies - though it tended to be self-destructive. But the one I like is Brian Cox. One of the most versatile actors in the area. A pity for his hand and leg, but so much for enduring widespread questioning - he must have this class on the "farm." his movement?. Never mind, it's fun!.
