I wish I knew what to do with the movie. It seems to be divided into two parts - action sequences and personal dramas on the shore. It follows Ashton Kutsher through the Survival Swimmer School, led by Master Chief Kevin Costner, then to Alaska where a couple of magnificent rescue actions take place, the last resulting in death. I have to say that scenes on the beach hit me so stereotypically in many ways that they should be set in the barnacle. A typical bar room fight between Navy boys and Coast Guardsmen ("puddle pirates"). An experienced old timer, Costner, who, as the older employee calls him, says, "Married to the Coast Guard." An older boss who is "constantly trying to prove he's nineteen." A Neglected ex-wife Kostner attends a farewell visit. Seemingly sadistic demands placed on swimmer instructors, all in pursuit of a noble goal. The gifted young man was annoyed by a troubled past. The problem is that we've seen it before. If Kevin Costner is here, it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or else Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro. And the top scene has elements that were brazenly drawn from "The Perfect Storm" and "Dead Calm." None of them is fresh and none of the old stereotypical characters and situations are processed with any originality. He works best as a documentary about what's going on in a swimmer's school and what may happen afterwards, and that is a bit weak, because we don't have much in the way of teaching. It is mostly a personal conflict, romance and tensions about washing out. It's a shame because the U. S. Coast Guard is rather a noble outfit, its official mission is "the safety of life and property at sea." In time of war he is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles. In World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to win the Medal of Honor winner. But we don't know much about that. In fact, we won't know much about anything. The film turns into a sequence of visual images and not too much. Disappointment.
