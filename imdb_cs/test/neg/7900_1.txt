This movie was just awful. How he liked this movie and for those who like it because of jokes, they should really look in the mirror for a long time and ask themselves if the stereotypes are bad. Ignoring the face of racial stereotypes was just terrible. She had never had her moments to pay homage to the 1980s, "Airplane!" Terrible gameplay, horrible writing, even for a movie with Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. This movie was bad from the beginning, but people could notice the whole thing by thinking that the plane would crash. One of the worst movies ever, stay away.
