One day I rented this movie from a local video store, you know, the kind of box art movie that just gets out and tells you to rent me. If you see this boring movie in your video store, keep going. Fight the urge, rent your porn because this movie is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the intriguing opening, the film disappears with repeated murders and a depressed cop struggling with common problems (wife, bastard boss, etc.). Wondering if the VCR's Quick Play function works? Rent this movie and ask your test questions.
