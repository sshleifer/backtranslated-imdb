I disagree with 100% with the reviewer who disagreed with 100% with the reviewer who gave this short film "F" grade. Monetary deposits for political propaganda only hide the lack of Joe Dante's ability to pull another Howling out of his bag of tricks. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly scary stories, except for this episode. Despite gaining recognition from those wishing to promote his political propensity, "Homecoming" is the least effective episode of MOH one season. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry is a parody of the genre, lacking both horror and humor in that it is a hackney's hackney political supply. Dante can actually be blamed only by pulling this stinking from the shelf because it wasn't his creature. The zombie biography is very popular in this decade, and among the predictable crops of George Romero honors and empty fantasies are a number of works designed to promote political or (ir) religious messages. Such works are not written or intended for real horror fans. Maybe Dante isn't really a horror master either. What has been doing since Howling, after all? <br /> <br /> If you want lame anti-war zombie film with several pop culture links passed as humor, Homecoming can only be your thing. If you're a horror fan looking for something masterful, pick up ... most of the other episodes of the show. My personal favorite was Dario Argento's "Jenifer," based loosely on the classic comic short team Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson - really haunted.
