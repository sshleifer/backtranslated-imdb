'Snafuperman' Friz Freleng is one of Snafu's smaller private shorts. A warning about the importance of studying your field manual, 'Snafuperman' makes it point out somewhat awkwardly. The story in which Technical Fairy, First Class makes Snafu a superhuman to help him see the fault of his ways, is predictable and unfettered. Freleng's earlier Snaf's short "Rumors" burst out ideas and laughter, but here the director is annoyed with a somewhat boring theme and tries to make him a fun piece. "Snafuperman" seems to be around three minutes long, and unlike the best cartoons in the series, it seems to be the first and fun movie. Although they were phased out faster than the usual Warner cartoons, the Snafu shorts kept a surprisingly high standard. "Snafuperman" is a reflection of the quality you would reasonably expect from less talented creative minds.
