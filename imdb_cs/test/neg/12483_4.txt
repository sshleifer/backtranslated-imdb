The Touch Of Death is probably the most frustrating Fulci movie ever seen in 1988 and encouraged me to join the horror fan corps who generalize that his films are getting worse as you get back into his career. Given the plot's plot, I was expecting some goddamn fun, but for all her bizarre flourishing, she feels tedious even at runtime for only 80 minutes and is suffering from ill-advised shabby production values ​​and film crafts. (or lack thereof). El Story: The widow of the wine wines and inhales the rich (and strange) women she finds through the pillars of lonely hearts before putting them in horrible fashion - sometimes eating or feeding them. Animals - and steal your money to keep your debtors at bay. Sure, it is unlikely that just one person would host so many pathological conditions (addicted, psycho / sociopath, cannibal), but this is Fulci! Touching is actually the cheapest and weakest Fulci film I've ever seen. Almost no one is there, even in the background of the street shots. The reader, which is constantly appearing on television to draw attention to the non-existent cast of the latest maniac activities, works from the most patriotic television studio on the planet. He never even looks at the camera because he has to read all the subtitles from the uneven sheets of paper. Some scenes go on and on with the protagonist who mutters for himself what he has done or what to do, but acting is nowhere good enough to keep this sort of thing, so the main thing the result is spectator boredom. The film also looks generally and ugly. I read that it was intended as an Italian telemovie (did it ever screen in this place? With the amount of gore involved, it seems unlikely), and it has a reek flipping old telemovie production values. This is also Fulci's first foray into direct black humor, but he's just too headless a director to make it work. Sometimes there is a strikingly cheerful or "crazy" music used to play against a terrible scene, for example, when a hero / villain carves a dead body in a cellar. This effect is not really cool or funny or ironic, what you want it to be - it's mostly just hamfisted and lousy. There are, of course, some redemption moments of gore (that you will wait while trying to stay awake), including a possible murder by the oven (!) of a woman who simply does not leave her life, even after her face was totally overwhelmed with the bloody big club and the homeless who gets the car running back and forth over it about five times. The most nasty element of touch, however, is all the physical deformation of the widows that the fool has brought. Beards, hairy moles, messy harelips - it's not like looking for women with these features, it's just the way all the lonely hearts are widows. There are plenty of shots of Mr. Crazy, grimacing as he cleans these women. The black humor of such a gaudy misogyny might have some strength or resonance if the film was not so badly executed in general. Finally, Touch Of Death seems to be a really lazy, indistinct mess.
