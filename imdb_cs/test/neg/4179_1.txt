If you want to enjoy the money you would spend on renting this money, go buy an ice bag and watch it melt. This is more fun than this movie. Bill Cowell, shame on you. Or if you want to see this movie plot, go to the cornfield, bring two of the most annoying girls you can find, run for a few hours, and scream the girls as loud as possible. Then send me a few bucks you spent. I enjoyed the first Dark Harvest, after watching the sequel, I'll cry myself to sleep.
