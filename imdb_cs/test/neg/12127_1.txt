This movie was terrible. Behavior was lame, but it is hard to tell if someone was doing well because writing was so bad. This is one of Johnny Depp's worst films - I am very much discouraged from being watched. However, if you have to see Cry-Baby, I suggest you silence him and simply ogling for Mr. Depp in an hour and hour. half.
