Well, sit me down. I haven't seen a home movie bad because of the 13 SECONDS or HALF CASTE. Someone should take the Sony Handycam! This film proves that just because you can make a $ 20 movie on a camcorder doesn't mean you should. I remember that one of the things Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book, "Rebel Without a Crew" was that when you went out to do any budget function, you must use whatever assets you have to Rodriguez says you should take a list of all the places and props you can beg, steal and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was friends with the mayor of a city in Mexico, so the mayor had him shot. at EL MARIACHI, was a movie that seemed to cost a lot more than the real budget. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the director of this movie has a copy of this book and he took the heart advice. The case was probably friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they put a haunted house every year, it looks like a pretty good place for a scary movie, but it's hard to keep the cornfield interesting for 90 minutes. and the series of CHILDREN FROM CHICKEN spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield, and Hitchcock spent only ten minutes in one in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Help yourself, cornfields don't mean riveting the film. It would be good if the director had more friends with more locations because this thing is pretty boring after the first 15 minutes. This movie looks like $ 30. (or what it stands in receiving into the cornfield maze). Apparently, he couldn't find anyone to act in his film, so he did. Big mistake. Here's the idea if you really want to make a movie, get an actor. So in terms of assets, the cornfield maze seems to be the only thing a poor man has. Maybe he thought it was enough. In fact, I'll go out to the limb and say I know he thought it was enough because the film was simply MAIZE: THE MOVIE before it captured the desire to be a continuation of DARK HARVEST. Maybe MAIZE: MUSICAL or even MAIZE: MINI-SERIES is already planning it. <br /> <br /> Our Jack-Of-All-Trades (and yes, Master nothing that is part of this saying is certainly appropriate here) plays a psychic father who can tell when bad things happen. Think of a character from DEAD ZONE, but nowhere near a good actor like Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. The psychic dad has a premonition that his two daughters, who are in a corn maze with mom, will be killed. He rushes to save them. From then on, the whole film is dedicated to watching Pyschic Dad run in the cornfield, looking for his two daughters. Two little girls ghosts find in SHINING and help solve the mystery of their murder. <br /> <br /> He fired a $ 200 Handycam. The director lunged. Modified to iMovie. Improved story. If this is not enough to distract you from this a-corn-catastrophic catastrophe, consider it the last warning ... WHOLE FILMS take place in the cornfield, ulcers, and werewolves. Here's a Ghoulie Guru tip on how to save some money and still feel like you've seen this movie. Next time you see a corn field and stop the car. Take the flashlight and run there for about 90 minutes.
