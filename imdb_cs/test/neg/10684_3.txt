After double-shooting from the 19th century, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only has she become one of the undead, she uses her gotha, a personality of temptation to keep her talent as a cold-blooded killer. This is a low B feature that should go directly to the video. Violence is cruel and bloody, but actually quite mild. The story of the story is so weak and the dialogue is so random that it's hard to handle a lot of interest. Eileen Daly is the leading character of Lilith Silver. Also in the cast are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brook.
