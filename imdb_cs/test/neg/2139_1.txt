I'm not sure what the director and the editor thought when they edited this bad apology for the movie, but what they thought didn't help this movie, it just hurt, and the movie hurt it badly. Playing, for once, there's no problem, it's a horrible cut, the scenes will end for no apparent reason, while in the middle of an action sequence or people will be cut off in the middle sentence. I'm not sure what the story is, but it didn't matter, because what I saw was quite uninteresting. Just wrong all around, huge "Jaws" rip-off and not good at it. The MST version was funny. 7 for it, none for the movie itself.
