In 1989 here in NZ match was a somewhat mega-hype phenomenon, and who drove the starship at the top was an orange goblin himself, HULK HOGAN (one of my uber-heroes at this time), so it seems clear to me that now why am I he loved this film in 1989-90 when it came out. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is a shocking actor and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lister is worse !!! The story follows the standard WWE (then WWF) circa 88-91 story story culminating in the standard good guy beat, hulk up and then getting beaten down again by the story just following it a good guy calls on his entire inner strength ( prayers etc etc) to join the epic return ..... A pretty standard formula here. It is worth watching if only for the memories of your youth !!!!
