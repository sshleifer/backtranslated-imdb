This is one of the worst movies I've seen for years. The storyline has a potential that is never realized. Actors are a bad choice, but due to the on-screen writing, their talent is not wasted. I really wanted everyone to die as quickly as possible so I could get out and watch something else. Unfortunately, I stayed to the end and laughed at the muttering of people who were moaning about how bad it was. It wasn't happening at all, that's England, just a slight moan about what it was. Then I look at IMDb and see 288 people gave it 10 out of 10. I really can't see how these people are able to give that score. It must be a PR company working with a distributor. At the end of the movie, there is a hilarious set-up problem where, in the graveyard and during the hacking attacks, watch out for the unpredictable scenery that touches the rock (assumed to be a brick wall). doing spoof horror except director.
