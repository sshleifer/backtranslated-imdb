By the Underworld creators, we are by far the worst werewolf movie I've ever seen. It is basically a reconstructed version of the Underworld, despite the lack of vampires (not a big deal), great effects (BIG), and generally just about everything that can be done right to create a decent movie that deals with lycanthropy (the biggest store) of them all !). Lycanthrope, a 35-year-old Vivian, is currently living in Romania since her family was hunted and executed werewolves in America years ago. There, she belongs to a small company (or packs) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to associate with the pack leader, Gabriel, whose son - some toad with a British accent - takes it to hunt outside the box. Obviously they have been discovered in other countries and want to stay in Romania to avoid negative attention, so of course this is considered forbidden. Vivian ends up in love with an American artist who ignores his commitment to a group of bloodthirsty predators. When the discovery of a secret relationship ends, things get messed up when someone is killed and one is forced to participate in the deadly tradition of being trapped in the forest and hunted - giving a chance to turn into their "wolf" self ". All this consists of a big leap before it lights up and lands like a wolf. Very effective effects. The whole film is like a twisted world of the underworld with some drips, romantic photomontages and very little action. When I watched it in the theater, I couldn't wait for it to end. A devastating, boring disappointment. Avoid!
