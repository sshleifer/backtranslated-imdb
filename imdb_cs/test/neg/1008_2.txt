This film could be a very good propaganda film for a North American phalangist party - or a similar group ... A strong man (Kersey) places himself above the law (but not outlawed) and frees citizens without worrying about killing worthless waste. The only thing that made me think the KKK didn't do it was because the Jew was playing like a good kid ... Try to watch it again and think of it as a propaganda film for an extreme right-wing group - and I'll see what I mean. It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page actually made for this movie ... :(
