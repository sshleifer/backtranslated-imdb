Weak story of an evil warrior looking for a century-old satanic bible to make Lucifer's offer by abolishing creation. Hot in pursuit all the way is the 17th Centruy bounty hunter named Redfern and his reluctant sidekick Kassandra. Sounds like a cargo cell? It is. This drivel from writer D.T. Twohy gets a superficial treatment that director Steve Miner deserves (who helped that romantic nonsense "Forever Young"). Obviously, he knows nothing about the true evil. Julian Sands just flies around and rants, trying to look bad, while Richard E. Grant succeeds only in wasting rich talent. Lori Singer's career also took on himself with this one nosedive. The Special Effects crew has some fun and Jerry Goldsmith provides a better score than the subject.
