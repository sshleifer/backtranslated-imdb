A group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game, but as soon as they start playing, each one starts dying just like in a video game. When they become addicted to the game, they have to find a way to beat The Blood Countess's central criminals before killing them all. The assumption sounds a little silly and familiar, but the movie could still be slightly fun. However, this "horror" movie is not at all scary. It's actually more of a comedy than anything else. The movie is too serious and the movie is not very funny to watch. Sure, there is a laugh sometimes, but for the most part, the movie is very boring. PG-13 horror movies can still be good as The Ring or Cry Wolf. The ring and stay alive are not really the same type of horror movie. Staying alive is rather a slasher movie and because of its rated PG-13, death scenes are very tame. It was supposed to be the main movie selling and because it had an interesting concept, death could be really good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a larger audience and the film had to be changed. Acting is a complete joke and most casts do terrible performances. Jon Foster is not a very good lead man. He lacks the charisma to really engage the audience or take care of it. His character is not uninteresting. In fact, Samaire Armstrong gives a good performance, albeit a little too bland to really endure. Frankie Muniz probably gives the best performance in Stay Alive. This is the best player level on the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible as October. Her performance is so hasty and so fake. The most unpleasant character in the movie is Phineas played by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so merciless that you will take root for him to die. In fact, most characters are quite unlikable, so it's harder to be interested in film. It's hard to apologize for some of these annoying children and it's much more fun to see if you want the characters to really survive. The only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It's a little old, but it still works. The movie is also really short, so it's not too much pain. However, I would not blame the cast at all because they worked with an inexperienced director and writer. The direction is not very good and the scenario is not much better. To stay alive is not actually the worst horror movie of 2006. This honor would go to call When it's a stranger. But stay alive is still a missed opportunity. Finally, this cheese and lame horror movie is better on the shelf. Rating 4/10.
