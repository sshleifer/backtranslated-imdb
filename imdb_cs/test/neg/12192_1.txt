I love to destroy this movie. My peers always try to defend it, probably because of love for Quentin Tarantin or Harvey Keitel, but he never convinces me that this should be valued. Here are a few huge reasons why: A: The story goes from kidnapping a road trip movie to a vampire-populated strip slasher swipe without setting-up at all. Suddenly something really real turns into something very false, which is like sitting an audience on Thanksgiving and then exploding it with dynamite. B: That Juliette Lewis is infamous. C: Idle ideas such as real torso-and-foot guitars, brothers with the surname "Gecko", bad vampire makeup work, Cheech Marin plays three characters (?), And a crotch-based weapon that only fires when " erect "and belongs to the person who goes" Sex Machine ". If Robert Rodriguez hadn't tried his violence to be so innovative, I could have fun with this apparent popcorn. The whole project is like getting ideas by playing with action characters. The only thing that seemed to me as my favorite scene is the laughter that George Clooney laughed at, the loud cheese monologue after killing his blood-sucking, horny baby, the terrible actor who played. I swear they thought it over and over. This film is offensive and ends with insulting those who want the offensive. Terrible movie.
