The film was released in 2002 and was much anticipated for promos, but it finally released in 2003 after the producer died <br /> <br /> The movie is good in parts, but overall it's not big <br /> <br / > The scenes between Rani and Ajay are fine, but the other scenes are not well processed <br /> <br /> The film is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood and although it was planned before it was first released, originality is lost <br /> Milan Luthria overall disappointed with KACHCHE DAAGE <br /> <br /> Music is good, but too many songs Ajay Devgan looks tired and his looks give up that the film was delayed and his actor's appearance boring too rani's good sonali's good rest are fine
