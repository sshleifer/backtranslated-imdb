Horror. A film about the Nazis - the Germans. Killers of children, young girls of rapists ... Are they sorry for that? What are they interested in doing thousands of kilometers away from Germany? Don't you think that? The fascists are now good Samaritans? Think, killed, tortured, 27 million people. No, of course they don't. They were forced to Hitler, gave each of them, and were forced to kill: every fourth inhabitant of Belarus, all Jews, Gypsies ... killing Slavs. Facts: At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when a fascist (German) was a prisoner, they were defiant and impudent. We will kill you all and so on. When they were captured in 1943, they suddenly became anti-fascists and peaceful peasants who were forced to Hitler and personally. For such films, they should be imprisoned for life for the celebration of fascism. <br /> <br /> If you want to see what they were doing, they went to Stalingrad, then watch "Come and see" (1985).
