I found out before I wrote this review that "Komodo vs. Cobra" and another movie called "The Curse of Komodo" were both directors of the same guy, Jim Wynorski. This could explain why films are almost identical. They both have a military island, a colonel whose fears are more concerned with covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, the racers who enter a helicopter that lies comfortably in the field somewhere on the island, and the giant commodo gems created through genetic experimentation with amok. What are the differences? Well, island invaders are now capitalists who want to uncover government secrets, and there is a huge cobra on the island, including the name "Komodo vs. Cobra", although the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant. story.' "Komodo vs. Cobra" is more or less what you would expect with regard to its name and its channel origin: Sci-Fi channel. Although here and there you will find one that for some reason or another may appeal to you (I liked the movie called "Komodo"). It's not just a boring movie, but it's also one of the least excited sci-fi movies I've ever seen. Some of these films have air available that suggests that filmmakers give at least some effort, but I see very little. This is again indicated by the fact that it is just rehash "The Curse of Komodo." CGI for monsters look as if they came directly from video games with a secondary video game, cinematography and misc en scene is bad, acting ranges from open to poor, action scenes are boring, and then there are some parts that are honestly, unforgivably bad. I see a lot of movies where a person fires a gun many times without translating and I'll deal with it. But in this movie, where Michael Paré takes one thirty-eight pistol and fires it approximately 50 times nonstop without reloading it once? That would be an action. A monster appears, people scream, Paré fires nonstop without reloading the entire gun once, and someone is dreaming of it. "Komodo vs. Cobra" is a very bad movie. The only thing worth mentioning in a film that is worth mentioning is the actress named Michelle Borth, who is not only very beautiful but surprisingly strong. Michelle Borth, though it seemed to be a crooked dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the scenario she was given, managed to pull out a surprisingly good performance and I just like that actress as good as she can get stuck in the movie like laughter . I'm afraid she probably took it on the pay slip, but her career doesn't increase.
