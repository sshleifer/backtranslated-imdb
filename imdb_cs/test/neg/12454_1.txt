This film was recently broadcast by Turner Classic Movies. It could be considered racy in his time, and may have made money, but even the most dying fan of Jane Russell will be difficult to sit over this dreck. There are many film musicals since the 1950s that can withstand the test of time, even though dated by current standards, but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or amusing plot. "The French Line", however, fails in all these aspects. It doesn't matter that Russell was a gentle singer when she was given a lousy vocal material. The entire cast is drawn by boring, banal conspiracy and dialogue. It's not even worth recording and skipping to music numbers - they're confused.
