Please don't waste your money on this movie apology. The only way I saw someone watching it is that they are a fan of Erika Elaniak, but you should be better surfing the internet than watching this piece of crap. I'd rather look at the dry color than watch it. They attract you with Casper and Erika and lead you to believe that it's a science fiction movie Dracula, but it quickly happens it's a great great thing about Van Helsing) grandson, ironically here last show-down between himself and Dracula. The film is also trying to make a political statement, I think, when none of the characters in the future seem to know who God is, that they don't learn about it and don't understand when they see the cross. He could have done much more with this idea. It's a shame how it turned out.
