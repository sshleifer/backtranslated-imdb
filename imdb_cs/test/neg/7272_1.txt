Finally, I can combine the dots between the return of the Jedi and the phantom threat. Here we see where Lucas lost contact with what made the original Star Wars movies great, and began to descend into the plots of lesser classes that destroyed episodes 1-3. This film is more like one of those cheesy low-budget 80s swords and movie wizards than anything worthy to be associated with Star Wars saga. As with the Jar-Jar character, it seems to be aimed at children (and the toy market). Battle scenes are particularly bad. It was depressing to see the incredible talent of Sian Phillips that he would get into such waste after his classic performance in Claudius.
