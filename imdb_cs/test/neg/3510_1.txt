I think I was watching a different movie for most of the other people I know who saw this movie. It's not really that I found a film offensive or anything - just that the script was incredibly amateur for a movie that seemed to have a little money on it. I really respected Paul Haggs' work on the Million Dollar Baby scene and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this scenario was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be a "racist" version of Traffic, but I don't think Traffic was really a movie that was worth taking off in the first place. The worst feature of this movie is how unthinkingly it lies to its audience. Does Haggisreally think we're so stupid that we need to shoot those shots? Do I need to see a phone book that sits on board Farhad, with an address in black text? Can't we be left to do someleaps for themselves? I also had a big problem with the dialogue that was so "on the nose". I have heard that one critic says that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high, because even if people do not speak that way, they certainly think so. This is irrelevant. The task of a scenario like this is to use dialogue in a way that contributes to the characterization and credibility of situations that are highly unlikely in this case. All of these characters speak the same voice and racism is what they are talking about. The aim of a movie like this should certainly be to support the fact that the race should not be really a problem in these situations, but that it has become the sole focus of each scene, does not become inherently racist itself? The characters go past their philosophies and comfortably memorized statistics on racial relationships as if they were repeated excerpts from the research essay they had just written. It is absolutely unconvincing and obvious. The film should reveal its importance gradually, not slap in the face with it in the opening scene and then never leave it. I see that Haggis's intentions with this film were honest, but I dare to hint that he couldn't identify the direction of his own script and overcome his shortcomings. I really hope that the writer / director will be really careful in the future as he approaches this "mosaic" style of storytelling. It has done so many times, but achieving a balance between personal and political law is very difficult. And Robert Altman will not be overcome in this department.
