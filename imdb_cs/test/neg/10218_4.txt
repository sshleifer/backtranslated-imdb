This formal film (the hero's girlfriend marries the villain) simply didn't move fast enough due to some of the story's circumstances. Scott seems too old and too many times his character will move away from decisive action, deflating scenes. He responds to the death of some of his hands weakly; escapes from Knox's gang and hides in a full rain barrel; His escape to the high ground and the pursuit of John Russell look redundant as he does a lot of the movie. The story could be tightened. High movie points: see "Tennessee" Ernie Ford without a mustache singing "Man in the saddle"; Alfonso Bedoya is too short a scene as a cook; high country color photography and battle scene with John Russell.
