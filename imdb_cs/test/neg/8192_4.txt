It's schmaltzy, but then, what else did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister, complete with an evil mother, sister and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can tell him) is an ineffective putz; and the competing interests of love are full of melodramatic criminals. The cast, setup and wardrobe were very attractive and I thought the actors did a great job of how weak the material was. The film was filmed and boasted with a soundtrack that was carefully designed to alert the audience to what emotions to experience. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of his best moments. <br /> <br /> If you love Danielle Steel, you'll love this movie. If you love archetypal romance, you'll love this movie. I do not. I was able to sit but it was close.
