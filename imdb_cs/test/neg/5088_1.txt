The Greek Queen's sound recorder was supposed to be burned out, there is no excuse for bad recording on this day and age. The end result was a murmur of voting, and cinematography was the best on average. The story had the potential and I am sorry for the overseas actors who had to know they were shooting turkeys when they were filming. Obviously, the film suffers from el-lev syndrome and the scene in which Temuera develops in the house, while the outrageous fury is too stupid for words. I've noticed a few shortcuts accepted on the Maori protocol, but that was probably due to film length limitations, etc. All in all, I wasn't impressed by this film, the Whanganui River has many beautiful places, but this film gives us a cool drab and claustrophobic image, with no beauty. The film needed more sunlight and better camera angles, less screen confusion, better soundtrack, and more thoughts to put into what movie viewers would see on the big screen. Hats off for everyone involved though for completing what had to be a very difficult shoo. I have the greatest appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film, unfortunately I enjoyed it.
