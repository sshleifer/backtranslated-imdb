(Synopsis) In 2055, the rich are able to travel in time and hunt a live dinosaur at a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can bring people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has adopted this technology and opened a business known as Time Safari. Anyone who has money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team along with a big game hunter on a floating walkway to where they can kill a dinosaur. The excursion protocol is that they have to stay on the sidewalk and not disturb the earth or anything around them. Unfortunately, for a human race, one hunter enters and kills the butterfly. This insignificant act causes great impacts on the country's climate and creates new species of animal life. The evolution of evolution, as we know it, is now changing with time waves. Travis and Sonia are trying to stop the changing process before it becomes permanent, and the man disappears. <br /> <br /> (Commentary) The film was a bit slow and the concept of returning to time and changing things was small. exaggerative. The death of a single butterfly causing enormous changes in the global atmosphere and evolution is simply ridiculous. They changed the Chicago skyline to look modern, but the new cars of the future looked stupid. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run Time 1:43, PG-13 Rating) (4/10)
