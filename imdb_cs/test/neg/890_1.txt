If you're watching this movie, you have to ask: What did they think? There is so much noticeably bad part of this movie, you can get the feeling of its deliberately poor like some joke. I think the worst part about the movie is directing. There are so many bad uses of camera angles and other film elements that are ridiculously bad in this movie. The funniest example would be when the guests receive their invitations by e-mail - the same camera angle will be used for each frame (which lasts 2 seconds) and on the same computer screen with the same desktop / window / program will appear. that the thing always fires on the same set. The whole sequence was also completely silent, without music or sound effects. Overall, it was a bad way to convey the idea that e-mail was being sent around the city. <br /> <br /> If you listen carefully, you may notice that the music sounds very much like other movie soundtracks. That's not surprising - most of the songs, including those that open the film, are actually slight changes in scores from other movies (see if you can guess which ones). I also noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. It sounds like it was written and played over a low-end midi keyboard. If you're familiar with LucasArts SCUM Adventure Games, the sound of each instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE engine. Everything else about the movie just pisses them off. Acting is terrible. The script is derived (Ferris Beuller?). There is no remotely funny joke in the movie if you don't see the whole movie as one big joke that is played on a paid audience. Don't let it be rented. Don't look at it when it's on comedy again. Forget it - it's awful.
