I had a bad feeling about ten seconds into the movie because a few overworked tumbleweeds (probably left of the bad western) exploded all over the scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the mandatory opening of an alien-turned-man-victim for no apparent reason lowered his rear-view mirror to see the shadow in the back seat. For the next five minutes of the introductory credits, we took care of the shots of cars swinging back and forth, and only the dramatic music of the film made for television informs us that killing is happening, not as a session. For the next 27 hours, we will be treated by two idiotic psychotics who for some reason seem to be forced to go through the Southwest desert together and follow behind as the demented Abbot & Costello. Even with "shocking" twists at the end, we are just left to shake our heads and wonder if producers and director / writer feel as embarrassed and embarrassed about how to create this inconsistent, incoherent nonsense.
