OK from the American perspective, I suppose he doesn't know much about rugby, that would be a wonderful movie for them. First of all that has a heart, a good morale of a good good coach tries to change a bad boy. Although for us where I come from rugby, it is number one sport, it is a way of life that plays only the bravest and the winners are welcomed as heroes, as if Americans were doing for their baseball / basketball stars. I'm not really sure if it was a cheap budget or maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan all my life I see before some actors even knew rugby existed before playing in this movie. The census made this film horrible. If you look at it and thought it was great, take the time to go online and maybe Google "All Blacks", a new New Zealand national team and a team that made the haka famous. Believe me, the Highland boys look like school girls.
