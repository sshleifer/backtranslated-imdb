It's one movie I almost left, and I should, if my friends weren't at the movies with me. Normally, although I don't like the movie, I think it's still worth sitting through it to the end. This way you can really claim that you gave him every chance to redeem yourself. But with The Million Dollar it was so terrible that I just wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible. I think I might not be so disappointed if this film was made by a smaller director. But coming from Wenders was all the more shocking. I know that Bono of U2, a good friend of Wenders, wrote the screenplay for this abysmal movie, and I wonder why the Wenders left him as a buddy friend. "Stay that day, Bono" is a sentence that easily recovers when you look at this mess. Striking, incoherent, mish-mash of all possible contemporary film stereotypes, a naive and transparent attempt to appear as hoarse and brave, with the most irritating characters I've ever seen, especially about science, Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson , none of them normally like it. The happiest end I wished would have been if the nuclear bomb had been dropped on their collective heads to get it as soon as possible. The positive is that the first five minutes of the movie are extremely good, with an extremely strong U2 soundtrack. But the opening films make the rest of the film (which has taken a magnificent nose since then - plunge into it) all the more disappointing because it is a promise of film quality that has never materialized.
