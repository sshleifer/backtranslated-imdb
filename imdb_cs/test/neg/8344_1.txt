I saw this movie and I thought it was a stupid movie. Even stupid is who thought a volcano should be in Los Angeles? The fact is, there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This film should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it should be filmed in Honolulu, Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes, a fact that this film should be made in Hawaii. This film should be filmed in Hawaii because it's a real idea and not in Los Angeles. There are Los Angeles earthquakes, but there are no volcanoes. To be honest, it's incredible nonsense and very stupid. Finally, I wouldn't bother with this movie because the volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.
