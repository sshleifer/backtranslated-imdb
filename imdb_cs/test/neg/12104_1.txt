... from this movie. I'm sorry I said that at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have headlines, so I asked the festival crew if there was a problem with the received press. "No ..." I was told. "the director wants it like that". Again, I'm sorry that my French is hardly an optional college level (more than 3 decades). Much of the original dialogue is in French, so I'm sure I lack the nuances and much detail between my understanding of a few keywords. I rated this rating as "1", mainly because of the irony of the director who once worked on headlines who refused to put the headlines in a movie that an American viewer should see. Excuse me, even if most Americans don't know where Europe is on the map, film festival audiences should not assume they know the native language of the movie. Even if a few of us do not know Finnish, I would still expect the subtitles to have only a few "dolts" that are not sophisticated enough to have knowledge in 37 different languages. I'll deal with this ego from David Lynch, not Litvack.
