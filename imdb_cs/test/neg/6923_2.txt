Writer / director Brian Burns seems to have seen a couple of romantic comedies, and he seems to think he has discovered a formula for success: lots of shots in New York (preferably in winter), allusions to old Hollywood movies (especially musicals), a fun music soundtrack. Unfortunately, all this is just a substitute for Burns' lack of talent as a writer. (The great secret of many directors who make independent films isn't why they can't get to the main studios, but how do they manage to support their films in any way?) <br /> <br /> Usually our interest in romantic The comedy is motivated by leading characters, but the couple in this movie just doesn't appeal. This is not the fault of David Krumholtz or Milla Jovavich; their characters are poorly written. What we are responding to in such classics as Harry Sally or Annie Hall or older films, such as His Friday Friday, are jokes and shortcomings of lead characters. Burns, who does not have the ability to create individuals, gives us a special school inspired by men who are from Mars, women are from Venus. As someone sees Burns as the successor to Woody Allen, he's behind me. I wasn't once allowed to play during this movie and the screen is full of chamber echo dialogue ("I want to paint the city in red." "Do you want to paint the city in red?"), Which is the most sign of someone who doesn't have a business writing a living. In one of the first scenes we see a friend of Krumholz's actress who is making a mindless TV sitcom. It is the only moment in the whole film that the dialogue feels right; Maybe it suggests what Burns talents are really suitable for.
