Given the incredible reviews of this movie, I expected something really special. It certainly starts with a very funny and sharp dialogue and a fine cast. Robert Altman's series of stories tells the viewer about some compelling scenes. I found it fun to enter the second half of the film when it sadly falls apart like a deck of cards. A series of ridiculous coincidences and the right messages will accumulate until I am deeply disappointed and wondering what the fuss is about. Paul Haggis dealt with the theme of the LA race, and this seems to have raised the film to a new level of interest. As most academic voters live in LA and have experienced racism to some extent, this film will have some impact on them. This means the Oscar for Best Picture will go to a racing movie or a gay movie. Hopefully it's the second one because Brokeback Mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves credit.
