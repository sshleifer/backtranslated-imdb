"First snow" has an interesting start. A travel salesman has his wealth told by an old man whose predictions seem incredibly correct. From this point on the film plays as a bloated "Twilight Zone" episode. I mean nothing but car travel, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is something other than sympathetic, regardless of the welfare of other people for his own paranoia. The end is particularly weak, with absolutely no reward for a long-suffering audience. Do a great favor and avoid this. Not recommended. - MERK
