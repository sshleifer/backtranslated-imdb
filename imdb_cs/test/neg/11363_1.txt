This has to be the worst movie I've seen this year .. and I'm watching a lot of cable. The storyline is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you with no action, no beginning or end of any scenes .. it's just random idiots with makeup that shout in some plane .. off) are terrible, yellow eye contact lenses are cute though .. i have to admin that i couldn't bear to watch it till the end. The scene where the great scientist Bennett held a motor life for an expensive life was too big for me. I'm sorry about my bad English. I'm from Romania (and that's my first post). I had to register to comment on this film because I can't believe it was a movie released in 2007.
