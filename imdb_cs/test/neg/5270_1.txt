After the general, the film, which romanticized the life of the Dublin gangster general to such heroic proportions that it made the average Dublin sick person, together come Kevin and his attempt at portraying Mr. Lynch or Martin Cahill, aka General, acting is so bad that this Crime Drama Becomes a Comedy for Native Dub and Kevin Spacey's Tragedy. In short, the film is worth a look .... No if u like bad playing with cheerful "right Irish accents, ah sure be sure". The story is pulled out of the commercially successful "The General", which, despite the glorification of the well-known Dublin animal in Martin Cahill, is still worth looking at, at home, because it shows the real working class of Dublin and internationally because he truly is an Irish acting and murderer cast, including John Voight. All in all, "ordinary decent crime" is something other than a decent film. Avoid.
