This film tries hard but fails. Perhaps for a non-Australian audience it may have appeal as a travelogue, but to the native it is just tiresome. Anyone who lives here knows Broken Hill is a rough, hard, isolated mining town. If a few citrated fruits appear in the thrust, it's all so predictable. Where did I meet the well-dressed theme? Oh yes - City Mouse and Country Mouse. Free us. I was hoping it would improve, but after Broken Hill, I saw where it was going, so he turned off the TV and went to bed.
