I think this film lacks so much essence, nor is it worth discussing. <br /> <br /> In the first, the package is really disgusting. Especially stereotyped filming and photography. Sure, Joe Dante's movie stile was appropriate and interesting in "Gremlins" and "Small Soldiers", I mean the imaginative and visual nice story telling of Spielberg-wunderkind (I really loved these movies), but in "Homecoming" it was a failure. Attacks of soldiers and furry creatures are simply not comparable to attacks on zombies (dead, smelly, rotten beings that try to kill the living - without logical reason, just because they hate them). Zombie flicks are characteristic of simple, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. Don't see anything in Joe Dante's debut. The next point is annoying content: the really stupid dialogues between the two main characters, the terrible exploitation of the "older brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized" and bad behavior. And by the way, "Homecoming" is neither scary nor bloody - and even less fun. You see, it's not even a horror movie. Zombie movies in their decades of birth - that is the end of the 1960s / early 1970s - were revolutionary, provocative (mainly through its horrifying) explicit content) and subtle social criticism. ORIGINAL Zombie was actually a midnight movie called "The Night of the Living Dead" (1968). This was a low-budget film that covered so many controversial themes, it's hard to name them all: the Hitchcock / Raimi visual style, the 70's American lifestyle, political reserve, the upcoming breakthrough of black people's human rights, and even more upcoming racism as a result of conservative Americans (don't forget to shoot the black main character at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the creativity of the midnight movies and want to learn more about the most important, I suggest you "Midnight Movies: From Margin to Mainstream". So avoid "Homecoming" and even Romero's "Land of the Dead".
