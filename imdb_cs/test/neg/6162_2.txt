It is said that David Duchovny wrote the script for this film for six days. That sounds right. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I saw Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it's like saying that Saddam Hussein wasn't as bad as Adolf Hitler. Tom Warshaw lives in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. All the time he pretended to be a Frenchman. He tells his wife that he's actually an American. For some reason it is like shattering the country for her, despite the fact that she has always commented on her husband's American accent. Also, their son - remember that he was born in France and never knew that his father was an American - he speaks perfect American English with no hint of French accent. This is just one of several huge plot holes in this movie. The main part of the film is a retrospective for Tommy's youth in New York during the 1970s explaining to his wife why he was hiding in France. His best friend as a boy was Pappas, a retarded adult played severely by Robin Williams. I think Duchovny thinks "retarded" is someone who's kind of stupid because Pappas sometimes gets a little slower, while sometimes he gets lost just like Robin Williams. Yes, Williams actually fits into his tired improvised schtick, though he has to play a person who is mentally slow. the recent death of her husband. Leoni is doing a good job, but she smokes a lot and shouts at Tommy for things that don't seem too important. The script didn't give her much work. Tommy also makes friends with the lady (whom he calls "lady") who is in jail and offers him advice over her prison window (this detention house is called "House D" for in short, so title). Tommy has no remorse that would loudly shout his personal problems on the street in the city, so this jailed criminal can offer him advice and does so many times without care. I don't want to bore you the whole movie summary, but the plot holes are abundant in this movie, which is trying too hard to be touching, but going away like, well, bad. Really bad. Really bad. Near the end of this train wreck, the script gets a cornier and a cornier and ends with a ridiculously miserable end. Critics have torn House D apart and rightly so. I can't believe some people really like this movie. It's a painful movie to sit in and I felt weak afterwards - not from emotions, but from how terrible it was.
