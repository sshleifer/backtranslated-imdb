Talk about your wild life. Barely B-movie, but what hay ... spoiled Sci-Fi and lesbian sex. From the mind of writer and director Cody Jarrett, a cheesy piece of fun. The chemical company emits waste that causes mutants in the fish farm. Hot Kristi Russell performs as Dr. Barbara Michaels, EPA agent posted to explore this ecological dilemma. She just happens to enter into a lesbian relationship with Trixie (Ariadne Shaffer) and their love scenes are as good as the movie. Frog-sized frog causes chaos; It causes a car crash, rapes a chemical company of a boss's daughter, rape a girl under the tribune to a football match, stiff-shoulder tackle runner in a football match, rape a nun ... all before being shot twice in the chest after the antidote was ready. Special effects ... well, not special; guy in a costume of a rubber frog without genitals to prove himself. Heavy tadpoles, do you still want to watch? Go ahead, but bribe all the witnesses of secrecy.
