The most notable thing about "Talk Radio" is how bad it is. All caller voices have a fake, reader circle. The evening with an annoying loud voice at a Dallas radio station is told with a concise look at hell. Stone seeks existential revelation and instead gets an unintended comedy. Whenever a caller makes a "deep" (empty) point about something, the camera shoves the camera on one of his character's faces because they are hit by some traumatic realization that is never revealed to the audience. Bogosian boasts of one of the most exciting performances ever smeared on celluloid. An underrated classic? Give me a break.
