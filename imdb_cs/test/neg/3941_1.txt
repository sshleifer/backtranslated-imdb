Honestly, I was a big fan of "Staying Alive" trailer when he got a few months before. I told my friend how this movie has a great story - and maybe even a good one. By the way - this film is somewhat below my expectations. The story has great potential, but as the story unfolds along with acting, directing and bad CGI - this film is a disaster. The spirit makes no sense, including murders - all too rushed, creating a sense of "unrealistic" in the mind of the audience. This film may be frightening for some viewers - but fear in terms of shock (due to sound effect, etc.) rather than the constant fear of certain valid factors in the film. <br /> <br /> You should reconsider watching this movie.
