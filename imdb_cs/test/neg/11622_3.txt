The outline of this film is similar to the original. Someone is kidnapped, the prince is incest with rescue, Odet turns into a swan, turtle / frog / puffin first "bad" magician as possible, and finally .... There is nothing new here. Except for the lack of known voice talents. I'm sorry, neither Palance nor Cleese, so Jean-Bob was not disappointing.
