Terrible movie. Terrible playing, cheesy, absolutely unrealistic, embarrassing to anyone who played the game. For starters, this guy is not a hooker, he would be torn out in two. As for the '' score, that's my job '' no, it's not. For an uneducated American audience, it might look like a good movie. For me, well, that's a few hours of my life, I'll never come back. I read the reviews and came across one where the guy sounded like he knew what he was talking about. Then I read - <br /> <br /> '' And while American rugby never reaches the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa has, the third in the world is also nothing to hang your head on '' <br /> All I can say is LMFAO! Continue playing American football and baseball.
