My first extremely disappointing BBC / Jane Austen flicked. The tone is off, the costumes are gone, the hair is gone, the music is out of space, and Robert Hardy, bless, seems to be really upset to be in such a smelly. Even some castings are gone. No, I'll take it back, a good director can make a silk purse from a silk ear, so to speak. The performance in this matter is so over the top and melodramatic that it is almost a farce of Jane Austen's story, which is ironic from Northanger Abbey's kind of homage / send out an early Gothic novel. I wanted to slap the female leadership after a while; who made the decision that it should be such a ninny? I had to look immediately at Pride & Prejudice ('95) to get a bad taste from my mouth. Phew!
