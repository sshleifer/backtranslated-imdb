Oh, my God, so I was expecting something more fun than this when I downloaded this movie when I saw one of my years for movies at all in 1903, but that was sucking in! "Conspiracy", even if I like to call him, is about some stupid elephant. He slowly sets out on a platform and kills himself with electric shock. Lame. Even for a short film, the plot was too thin to keep my attention. Edison is like the worst director ever. Moreover, the elephant has no presence on the screen. And the end? Wow, that wasn't predictable at all. * sarcasm * <br /> <br /> Image quality is so awful. You can hardly say what's happening most of the time. The only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other scary horror flicks it wasn't spawning eleven sequels. Other than that is a complete waste of money and you will never get back 1 minute of your life.
