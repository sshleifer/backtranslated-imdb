You've seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondering how it could be in a shortlist of Oscars. The saddest things are: <br /> <br /> 1. It's very slow. 2. How can Ghengis-khan, the cruel and mighty Emperor of Asia play a good, good actor with warm and beautiful eyes - throughout the film except for one scene? 3. Lots of holes in the plot: nothing about becoming an emperor; nothing about where he spent 20 years between childhood and adult age. We see a former slave without money, power, friends or home. Click! - next second leads a huge army, without any reason to be a leader. 4. Ghengis-khan's spell kindly explains only with the help of one wolf / god / whoever it was. 5. Can you make love to your wife who hasn't seen her for so long? 6. Is it enough to win a sword fight when you are riding over enemy lines, sitting there with two swords and everyone dying around you? Does Ridley Scott know this way? 7. Why, after 20-30 years, Khan's mother doesn't look older? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the main character's motivation? (None. Literally.) <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Really. The work of cameramen is good; nature is excellent - but the film cannot be made without a director and script. The real Ghengis-khan would direct the director in a second. <br /> <br /> Best regards.
