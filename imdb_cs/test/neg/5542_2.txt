Sci-Fi Channel sequel to writer / director Michael Hurst's sequel to the classic horror story of revenge Stan Winston, who has become crazy, has his moments and some decent gore, but in the end he is not enough. I'm pretty sure the filmmakers didn't try to make a comedy, but I laughed all the time. The basis of this entry into the franchise is the family disputes that began after a road accident. The Hatfield and McCoy families live in a small town where there are dirty roads, pickup trucks, drink moonlight, and dig others. Jodie Hatfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) have decided to fall in love, which can hit Shan. One night, two lovebirds decide to go to the forest for some good time, while Ricky's sister plays a lookout tower, but it's just that the night of one of Hatfields randomly kills Ricky's sister and catches him together with Jodie. You know what happens next. Ricky finds her sister's body and decides to visit Haggis to take revenge through the powerful Pumpkinhead. You are Haw! Also, Harley (Lance Henriksen) is back to warn potential damned souls against the use of Pumpkinhead to alleviate their pain. Which really fits in the story because Harley was supposed to call Pumpkinhead years before this story unfolds, but the environment and characters look like dirty pilgrims who somehow traveled time to bring a pickup to Plymouth. Then there is the sheriff (Rob Freeman), who has his own ties to the demon and seems to be in the 70th place of revenge instead of the horror movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects were fine, but instead of keeping a man-in-a-way to think, Hurst used some horrible looking 3D footage for certain scenes. One particularly awkward shot shows Pumpkinhead jumping from tree branches like a poorly rendered 3D monkey. Cinematography was exceptional and slightly enhanced the quality of the film. Acting was also quite decent, with the exception of a few badly made accents. Family disputes never end well, especially when families involved in a dispute have to deal with Pumpkinhead. I didn't like every minute of this movie, but it was much better than most movies that Sci-Fi Channel spits out. Perhaps it is a sign that the channel is trying to bring the quality of its films to the quality of the original series. I wouldn't want to lose any coins to rent, but if you can catch that repetition on my chest, I'd say check it out. It's a not-so-killer-movie, but it rises slightly above the basket level that makes it on DVD these days.
