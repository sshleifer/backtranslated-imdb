I felt the film was rushed, and the acting was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the main girl was stupid and the one who played the devil was terrible. The story was confusing and stupid. The film was meaningless and incredible. The film is not the worst movie, but it is not too far from it. Overall, I was terribly disappointed, it could have been much better. My score is 3 out of 10
