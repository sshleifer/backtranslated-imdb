The woman casting this movie is amazing: you have Linda Blair (matured pretty), Julie Strain (who doesn't have too many talking lines - that's a good thing), Rochelle Swanson (as convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as a bad obsessive girl), Toni Naples, and the most beautiful of them all IMO, simply stunning Kristina Ducati (as the goofy male leader, Larry Poindexter, who deserves to be sexually engaged in one of these women, remains a secret). However, beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women, the film has little to offer. The plot is discontinuous and does not go up to the last 15 minutes; and when Wynorski finally manages to create some tension, there comes a ridiculous "twist" end and destroy everything. (* 1/2)
