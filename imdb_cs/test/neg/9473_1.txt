I saw Roger Moore doing it on scenes that require running or exercising. He was James Bond, who would be most comfortable sitting at a bar to tell stories with his British Knights colleagues. Nothing against the elderly in age-appropriate roles, but how realistic is it for a fragile-looking 58-year-old to fight on the wings of an airplane, hang on the side of a train, swim in swamps with crocodiles, etc. In addition to being incredibly stupid, vapid and moronic, the fact that the fragile oldster dealing with many stunts made it easy to laugh at James Bond. Apparently, Roger Moore looked at his age in 1983, and the time had come to look like he could fight the younger men. I saw this movie in Theater and howling laughter was a lot and very often. Any credibility James Bond built was gone after OCTOPUSSY. The only thing missing from OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his sub-cast. Another low point was that incredibly lame Louis was one half of the evil axis. Jordan helped make the whole concept even more ridiculous. And the Russian general was total. OCTOPUSSY works better as a comic spoof similar to SPIES LIKE US. Even the train scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes made by better actors in many other movies. Take the NORTH EMPEROR (1972), where Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine fought all over the top and bottom of the train and looked exciting and real. Roger Moore had a thin, fragile body in 1983. and yet his double was clearly a younger, taller, athletic and muscular man. Even the hair color did not match. This only made his combat scenes more comedic. Moore stunts looked like the old low-budget Chop-Socky Kung Fu movies, especially with bad cuts. The director seemed to be trying to make evil gambling and bad pieces better by providing a few glimpses of the same piece. This only highlighted the differences between Moore and his sensation. The fact that the scenes from the train with Moore were shot in the studio could be seen from the lighting when Moore was in the shot compared to the outside shots of the double on the real train. Although many of the Bond Movies must be the worst in terms of editing their stunt fights. Usually you can clearly see that Bond is actually fighting the actor. Overall, OCTOPUSSY has to captivate one of the worst films ever made, and easily the worst of the worst Bond movies.
