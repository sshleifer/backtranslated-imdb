This is the "Battlefield Land" mini series. With a few exceptions, it has all the catastrophic ingredients that have condemned the film and will follow it to the tomb in the turkey cemetery. They are both adaptations of books with an endless number of pages that the script writer and director turned to complete mess (they are the same people in this case), who clearly don't know what they're doing, they like both messiahs who don't really give as a hero ( He played in this case a guy who looks like Mark Hamill, but unfortunately the power is not with him.) And a bunch of stupid bad guys who like to betray and spoil life for themselves, they both contain scenes stolen from better production and are both inexpensive production who are Try to look expensive with some (often poorly made) computer animations. The exceptions that actually make the whole thing worse is a horrible piece of work created by a luminous man who doesn't even have the ability to turn on the light in his living room, the camera is working for no reason at all in a tilted position. The "Battlefield Earth" mode, but most of the time, is flat as a pancake, an extremely inexpensive and small desert set that only contains a pile of sand in front of a background painted like a desert that changes very quickly. because it appears in almost every scene, and the bad idea of ​​costume designer attempting to imitate the "fifth element" is the fashion of madness with the addition of the strongest hats ever made. Silly moments to remember: 1. Every scene with guys who look like MST3K observers, but with silly hats. 2. Irulan appears at a party dressed in her butterfly dress (Why the Butterflies? - was the stuffed parrot in the purgatory?) With the appropriate silly hat, along with a pair of boys with silly balloon hats. 3. Paul stand-up comedian. 4. Baron Harkonnen in the game of fast driving, shouting "I, alive". 5. Every scene with a backdrop, because the newer fits in the foreground 6. Every scene with Fremen's false religious cermons, especially the "water of life" cermons. 7. Battle scenes where the same guys kill several times and the same things explode again and again. It's much more, but that's 1000 words limit on it, so I'm better off than I kidnap away.
