Unlike other western spaghetti, this has features that almost make sense, and can be identified to some extent. It still has a goofy gunplay of other spaghettis westerns. Spaghetti, by the way, is another word for the West, no conspiracy, no characters you might care about, and a goofy gunfire that doesn't make a sense of era and reliance on great music to make the audience feel something. . This one is much lighter than the ones that made up Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. They were also superior to the junk produced by Eastwood and others that sado-masochists make their friends when they have a chance. It looks like everyone had a lot of fun making a movie. It was good to see a giant actor like Gilbert Roland, who wasn't even mentioned in the movie rental box, but who was clearly the biggest name. His character was very pleasant. There is a three way standoff at the end, which is much better than that that spoofs (good bad and ugly), simply because the characters are at least a little sympathetic and a little identifiable. It's not a good movie, but it's a little fun.
