Cujo is a giant, kind, gentle and gentle saint. Bernard, who belongs to the Camber family, during the opening sequence of Cujo chases a rabbit over the field and local wood somewhere in the castle rock, Maine. The rabbit disappears into the lair and Cujo pushes his head into the inlet. The rabbit disappears from Cuja's view, the angry Cujo starts barking, and inadvertently wakes up and annoys the colony colony, one of which bites his nose. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) has an affair with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, the real husband of Dee Wallace), whom her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh Kelly), who works in advertising, finds out. Of course, their relationship becomes tense. Fortunately, their young son Tad (Danny Pintauro) noticed it. Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) repairs the housing cars from his barn on his farm. Joe plans a weekend with boys with one of his friends Gary Pervier (Mills Watson) when his wife Charity (Kaiulani Lee) wins a $ 5,000 lottery and decides to marry her young boy Brett (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) with her on a trip. see her parents. When he arrived at Gary's house to pick him up, Joe finds him dead on the floor, goes to the kitchen to call for help, and his dog Cujo, who is now an angry attack and kills him. Donna and Tad go to Camber's farm to try to repair her car. The place is abandoned, with the exception of Cujo, who is now totally angry, foamy at the mouth, red-blooded hair and mad with pain. Cujo is attacking the car to try to get to Donna and Tad, fortunately the windows are holding tight for them, at least for now. Donna is trying to start the car, but she has completely broken up, both trapped with nothing but hope that someone will come and save them. Cujo is in wait, ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses his path. Director Lewis Teague I thought the movie was a little slow for my taste. The first half stretches, the other half creates the head of the steam, but I still felt that it was a bit unpredictable and not threatening. Negotiations are all right, I have no complaints. Technically, the movie is fine, photography, music, special effects, editing and it's generally well done. The big problem is the scenario of Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier, especially the first half, most of which seem to be a pad to extend the run. The approach to just under 90 minutes was longer. It's also a bit predictable. As a monster, Cujo never really scared me, I just can't find the drooling overweight of St. Bernards, I think so. I suppose there's nothing wrong with that, but I don't think I'm in a hurry to see it again. Average, not too bad if you can find a copy will be cheap or catch on T.V. free.
