Ha ha! First, if you've never seen a movie about the dimension you're in! Especially known for SUPER LOW BUDGET Horror / Slasher, "Beowulf" was no exception. However, this video was more ultra-cheesy. I missed the K-R-A-F-T label on the side. Consider Anachronism! (something out of place and time) <br /> <br /> We had: candles, armor, swords .... <br /> <br /> Yet we saw: binoculars, soled shoes, cigarette lighters, speakers, Electricity , Body bags, aluminum foil cans, spoons / forks. It's not bad for something that happens in the 8th century! It's not a horror movie, it's a horrible movie. It's very laughing. It's really a comedy to look like a horror movie! I couldn't stop laughing! Christopher Lambert ("The Highlander Series") - had to make a big fall in his career if he works for "Dimension Films". But I learned. I'll watch the movie studios for videos, LOT more right now. <br /> <br /> RATE NO FIVE REELS. If you want a good laugh, even if it's hard to pass on this piece of work! <br /> <br /> This step had some clippings in places - I especially liked the blond bimbette! Wayno <br /> <br />
