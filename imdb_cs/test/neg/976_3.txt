Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to give Robert DeNir and Eddie Murphy just to have a movie that they both teamed up with. Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the existence of a film. Not that it is not fun in spots, it is, but the concept is so ridiculous that it laughs somewhat dim. The thing that really caught my eye was Eddie Murphy's character. It seems to me that I don't think anyone thinks about me being a police officer like it was exactly the day. When I was working in the New York State Committee for Victims of Crime, I had to deal with all sorts of policemen and run on the border between really insider and some real slugs, but I can't think of who thought it was just something. I do until I get my career in the area far. Can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else who goes through the strict rules of a real police academy, not a screen just to find a day job? Anyway, DeNiro is a basic working detective who is on the trail of a big gun dealer. He is secret and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does showboating Murphy do, he calls a reality-based TV series like COPS to take action. So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky up high, but the show producer gets some good shots of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on the new reality television series. So these reluctant partners get together and try to keep working with DeNiro on all the TV cameras. Eddie Murphy is a funny man, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in Doctor Doolittle. He did better than Showtime and Robert DeNiro definitely has. I think Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have one hefty paycheck to do this movie.
