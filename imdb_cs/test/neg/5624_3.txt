I saw this movie 3 times. Mostly because I watched it, "I missed something here?" Is there any reason this movie was made? He tried to say something and I just missed it? After three glances, I couldn't figure out the answer. I think the worst thing I can say about a movie is that it bores me, and I didn't finish it. I admit that there is plenty of eye candy and quick editing and hip-music to keep my attention all the way, but is that it should be the whole movie? I'm not against extreme violence, it's almost non-stop, but there should be some inspiration. Something that is highlighted. The word gratuitous comes to mind, but it is worse than some. In the first part of the film, we all looked into the motivations of the characters. And yes, 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are absolutely incredible. So in the first part we get to know the characters and in the second part most of them die and use sadistic joy in killing others. It seems to be the whole movie. And the first part has nothing to do with another. <br /> <br /> For example. How could a nice clever guy like Zed agree to join a lot of drug addicts and amateurs who do the job? It makes no sense. He is depicted as clever, but continues this suicide mission. The fact that he survives is absolutely contrary to the rest of hyper-real violence and chaos. So what are we watching for a Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real, super violent bath? I remember having the same reaction to the other two films in which the director participated: True Romance and Reserve Dogs. <br /> <br /> Necessary!
