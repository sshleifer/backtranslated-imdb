I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie I've ever seen when I saw this monster. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half searching for a movie. We couldn't find him because we saw almost every movie created. We decided to look at the low budget section. We were looking for the most attractive cover on which there are women who are exposed clothes. Finally, we decided on the Last Slumber Party, The. Yeah, we made a mistake. This movie seems to have been shot by the cheapest camera found in K-Mart. The actors were picked up at the Salvation Army and for Steven Tyler. We'll just leave it to the imagination. The story of this film was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT There is no closure at all while watching a movie. Then come to find out all the events were just a dream. The film was also about 30 minutes long. It would be much shorter if all the cameras zoom in on still images and take pictures of walls. All I can say is that I'm glad it wasn't a sequel.
