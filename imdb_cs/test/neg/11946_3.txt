There is really only one reason to look at this barely adequate and completely predictable film about the excitement of chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones), whose life will change when she inherits her lone niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister kills in car wreck. And that's why to look at Aaron Eckhart (Nick), who, with his floppy haircut and attractive attitude, looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic Pannini and ate with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dip and a few gently chopped sun dried. tomatoes. It reminds me of Sean Bean. The idea of ​​taking off his shirt was the only thing that kept me awake until the end. He took off his apron several times, but to my disappointment I never went any further. I can't be too critical because I watched him on a paid view at home so it didn't cost me at least two movie tickets and I was raised to be grateful for the little mercy. But in reality it is Rom Com in its most appropriate formulation. Zeta Jones gives a very flat, monotonous performance, she seemed to lack her passion (perhaps because of the amount of time she probably spent in the restaurant's cold room? Thirty times there couldn't be fun) and her face barely changed the look in the movie. Abigail Breslin was pretty good as a niece, she was such an attractive little girl that she couldn't be criticized and I loved her at Little Miss Sunshine anyway. Patricia Clarkson always has a good value and I can't really do her job as a restaurant owner because she seemed too little used, given what a good actor is and how little she has to do. But the whole thing is just so cliché, much of the banal dialogue and the result so obvious. This is the film equivalent of color by number, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart generate little heat on the screen. His appearance in Kate's kitchen at 22 Bleecker (restaurant name) predictably ruins her feathers, but his miraculous ability to connect with her niece by boiling pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the living room, bringing Kate around, and over several stumbling along so, that he finally gives him his valuable possessions. No, not her honor. But her recipe for saffron sauce. I'm very unfair here, aren't I? I mean Rom Com is Rom Com, and we all know for what we are leaving when we sign up. But must it always be such a hostile mind?
