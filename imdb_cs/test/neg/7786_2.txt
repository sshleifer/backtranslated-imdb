When a BBC murder thriller is dissatisfied with heterosexual dysfunction, you know who must be the killer: Gay. Who murdered a sexy blonde teenager (who is also a pathological liar) on his way home from school? Let's see, it could be a mother who (against all common sense) left her teenage son to visit his father's serial killer behind bars? Could it be a whimsical son who is impressed by his father's insensitive attitude to women? Could it be a serial killer capable of manipulating events behind bars, la Hannibal Lecter? Could it be my mother's friend, a school teacher whose relationship with a former student led to her wife's suicide? Or could it be the daughter of a friend who goes blabbing into the secrets of everyone at school, causing countless suffering? No, it's not one of the suspects. It's ... Gay! The only mystery for the viewer is guessing who is gay. Of course, it can be anyone because the only characteristics of a homosexual are the shameful secrets and the tendency to murder and otherwise life complicated for "normal" people. Homosexual is the invisible cause of social ailments; only when this person is exposed and removed can the broken family return to themselves and things can return to normal ... what it is. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, both Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially expiring dates of their sales. The world could be amazing without seeing it again on the screen, but as long as it has BBC roles for The Aggrieved Woman and The Misunderstood Man, I suppose they'll be back in movies like this.
