I looked at it as part of a vampire marathon with research intent, otherwise it's not the way I see it all the way. The first scene in which a bunch of vampires in very bad wigs seem to get an electric shock through various slow-moving weapons controlled by even slower moving Van Helsing's likes ... in black and white ... with voice, adjusting the pace for the rest of the movie. The match scenes look ridiculous, the dialouge would be funny if it wasn't so bad that the plot would make no sense, and the production values ​​would bite (from the Spike Coat Button to the hero wearing the hero). kitschy cheap magic mantle their lead vamp swooshes around). I've seen some bad movies (check out Magic Sword with B. Rathbone, or Raven with the very young Jack N.) But this gets my voice worst of all time.
