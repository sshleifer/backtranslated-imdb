I went to see that I would hate it. Everything was bad about it; it was as if they were shooting another book. Allocated locations and houses very beautiful (if not a little miscast-yes even the house was bad for their parts) Keira was too modern, boring and frankly I found it uncomfortable to look at her. They would see everyone else Darcy as a sex god who saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and grim (he didn't want to be) and Bennett was shown to be helpless and for some unknown reason to farmers, it's wrong and ridiculous. The very idea that Mr. Bennett answers the door on the nightclub with the rest of the family dressed in his underwear in the middle of the night is stupid. They had servants. Mr. Collins wasn't nasty and greasy just stupid and uncomfortable, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingley was wearing a sleeveless dress, huh! As if! It is historically inaccurate and even the end is not satisfactory. I could go on for a few days. I hated it so much that not only was it nothing like a book, but I fear that for many people it will be their fist experience of this great novel and give them the worst possible idea. The BBC version is so great that it's not even funny and all about this version is an insult to her memory. In short, if you have to see that you are sure that you have read the book first, or have seen the BBC version you have, it will be that it is what it is, which is not!
