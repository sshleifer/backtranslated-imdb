I'm a huge fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie just isn't good. The reviewer listed below is quite right that the stunning Detroit imagery is the first and the last memorable scene in the movie. Indeed, I really wish I had to leave, instead of hoping for the whole movie. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt let go. <br /> <br /> The score is almost completely rehash from the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that made me look fresh. It was good enough, though I still think I'm going to try the soundtrack. But if you notice this movie, be aware of it if you realize that you don't enjoy, go on and split at any given moment - you will not miss anything because it will have nothing better. I will even give a summary here (warning! spoilers!): lots of shots of athletes who look good enough for Nike commercial advertising, shots of smiling people, inexplicably dull frontal images of famous people (WTF thought that here?!?), some giggling kids (cuuuuute), some "effects that should indicate a comparison between the flows of water, information, money and people (i think) ... and then a lot of fast unrelated scenes of mass violence ... and then bunch shots of storage space. <br /> <br /> I could make this movie in 10 seconds here's my course: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of a happy daddy with shaved head and cycling shorts with lycra playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with a string, 5 seconds of that scene in a "net" where one talks about playing with "elementary forces of nature" and how "money flows in, money flows out;" inu Reginald Denny was pleased brick, and then three seconds Alan Bean jumped over the moon. <br /> <br /> There you go - it's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life, I just saved. Of course I would buy a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two, so it would look like it was. If Steven Soderbergh read it, hey, I won't need much money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching a movie about "life as a war", I suggest "Bowling for Columbine instead." It may not have a pseudo-intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd, but at least it's funny.
