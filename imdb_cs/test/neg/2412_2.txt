The only good thing about this film is the art work on the promotional poster of H. R. Geiger. Against nuke protesters who all looked like punk rockers from the late 1970s, and somehow became non-violent, (except for their leader, "Splatter") occupying cities. Fraternity boys descend on punkers to do some violence on them and turn them into victims. Bad behavior and bad conspiracy then descends to a real sacrifice, you, the viewer. I put it "2" because a few sex scenes at least give MST3K potential. <br /> <br />
