This movie was terrible! Ashley Rose Orr, while a talented dancer and singer (actually a little better than the temple was in the second), is a terrible actress. She plays a character like Shirley, which we have seen on screen in her movies, whether it plays on or off the screen. So what we get is too cutesy, and completely unrealistic (not to mention the uninteresting) portrait. If someone wants to see her side, she can rent one of her movies. The only bright light is the depiction of the temple of Gertrude by Connie Britton. I don't think it was really realistic, but at least it was good. Save your trouble and rent a poor little rich girl.
