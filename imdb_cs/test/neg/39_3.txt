This is a hard film to be evaluated. Although he really deserves his 3 (or maybe two) for Al Adamson, it is exceptional - and practically the best Adamson. This is because, unlike many Adamson films, there are times when NURSE SHERRI looks almost competent. But since you are Adamson's film, you know that sooner or later the lousy head of your ugly head must be! The film begins with a bizarre cult leader of a giant choir (six) trying to resurrect a blue-looking dead guy. However, in this process, the cult dude has a heart attack and it took the hospital. Apparently he will die, but many of these hospital scenes seem to be missing, and a few of them appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see a movie, it seems he may have recovered - just to hear later that he died. Because this guy is b.f.f. But Satan's evil soul cannot die and he returns to both pursuers and his own sister Sherri. Now Sherri is clearly a very disturbed lady - demonic possession or not. Sometimes he acts like a zombie and in others he is violently murdered. So I ask ... "Why did her friend (doctor) not think it was a problem?" In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he won't even get an exorcist, or let her go bankrupt !!! Oh, and talking about goats ... this movie is NOT breast filled with sex, whose name and posters suggest. While here and there are a couple of bare breasts, they are irrelevant to the conspiracy and have seen only very short (1/2 second or so) in all scenes. So, if you perv, this movie is not for you - although a few places in the movie (such as a nurse undressing for a patient) make it look like the MIGHT movie has, at one time, been designed as a porn flick. <br /> <br /> If you are a bad movie fan, however, there is enough to encourage appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many actors to provide lines that are not like zombies - and I'm not even talking about Sherri. One of the very final scenes is particularly noticeable - I've never seen and heard some playful play and dialogue in my life - including Ed Wood's movies! There are also a few other cheap touches, such as poor animation of "green things", where the doctor found a murdered sister who was still researching in a house where the walls are covered with blood (get a cop ...) even better, an army of cops. So, despite these problems, why do I think it's good for Adamson? Well, the story is not so bad and it was able to build tension very well. Many false alarms have delayed my heart a little. Also, the car accident, though irrelevant, came pretty well and was virtually a big budget for Adamson. Overall, you couldn't watch a good movie and most people would be bored. However, fans of Adamson or inept movies will enjoy it - it brings some fun in a cheesy way that will provide some laughter.
