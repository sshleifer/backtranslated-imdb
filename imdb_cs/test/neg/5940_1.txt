The film shows the relationship between a dying mother and a son who is very attached to her and definitely loves her. What does it show? It shows their lives in very bad conditions. It shows how tenderly "walks" (really brings it). But what do we see further? She walks along the promenade alone in the same places where they walked. Not possible. A person who loves and cares for another dying person would do everything to make this life better. He wouldn't have a free minute to think about being with himself, and if he'd found a few minutes in a month, he would have escaped from where he was to be. Another thing. The author devoted this film to Andrea Tarkovsky. We see that he has learned many Tarkovian visual effects. But in Sokurov's film, it's just effects, they don't support any senses or mood. Someone compared this movie with "Zerkalo" ("Zerkalo"). In addition to these visual effects, nothing is common. "Mirror" is a great movie and this is just a bad imitation.
