By the way, this is how the script was sold much less manufactured and distributed. The dialogue was so bad that it was scary. It seems that scenes from the train and helicopters were made on flash cards of high school students. Lou Diamond Phillips must be hidden under his seat when this "movie"? was shown at a private screening, after which he most likely left the back door. The only emotion she woke up in me was a pity to cast, they had to "bite the bullet" to get through this. I couldn't look at it, it was so predictable that it was funny. Who knows, maybe one of the networks will pick it up as a sitcom.
