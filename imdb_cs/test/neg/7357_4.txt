When you get in front of a movie, you know you're wasting your time watching the movie. That's how I felt when I watched "Darkness". I saw anticipating every twist and easily turning around. It's a combination of "The Amityville Horror" and countless movies that deal with occult. It's so stupid that I almost found out how I liked his naivety. I can't say I was completely bored, but I found that the movie was too derived for my taste. Director Balaguer√≥ is trying to redo his morning Spanish hit "The Nameless", but he can't pull it out. I admit that a few sequences were pretty scary, but I'm just disgusting when I can figure out what happens next. I also hated seeing good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini sweat so much over this piece of dreck. Finally, Anna Paquina as a horror movie star? That must be a joke. She's cute, but he's one of those good kid actors who have become a very monotonous adult actor. You can live without watching it.
