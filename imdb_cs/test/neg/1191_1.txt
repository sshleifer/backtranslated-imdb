I'm right in thinking I went to see the same movie as everyone else .. this movie was terrible. I am a fan of all 3 series of gentlemen's league and I have always respected the originality of the writers, even though the format has changed to Series 3. However, this film was a reckless half-effort, the plot was extremely bad with characters going to the real world to see this film more as a last action hero. There were about 5 moments in the movie that made them laugh, but the rest of the time I wished it was over. That would be better than 10 minutes short on DVD. It was rather an explanation of what they were planning to do, and some writers seemed to disagree with the fate of the characters and that they were joking. Kill him in the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> If your real fan of the League of Lords ability to stay fresh then you will hate this movie. If you just watch because it was nothing better on TV then u'll love it. <br /> <br /> Somebody got me back up!
