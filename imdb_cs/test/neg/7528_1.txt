PE SQUAD is in a very low place with its confusing plot and terrible gameplay. <br /> <br /> Let's start with characters first. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) still holds outrageous, fervent anger throughout the film, which is due to her overwhelming passion to become the queen of the ball. However, viewers are becoming completely unknown why Cherry wants to be the queen in the first place. Before the nominations are even read, he breaks around the school with a constant lack of interest in being there and shows no interest in the place or his students. Why is she so old to be their queen? Brooke Balderson seems to be a "respected" performance, but in fact he just spends the whole time with an angry face, stomping, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but if you gave every young actor / actor a script that only requires him to act insane angry, you don't need much. Also, you will not allow the character to develop very well. Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling has absolutely no emotion and no connection to her nature. When her director intimidates her, she gets knocked down (after a few seconds) without feeling disgusted or shocked or anything traumatic. Her lines are read as if she were reading the details from the back of the cereal box. For the rest of the movie, students who were in charge of his kidnapping sound more than they plan to grill than deciding what they will do with their director, sitting tied up in their basement. Meanwhile, Cherry is gone to kill a few women's queen promenade candidates, and no one even announces or cares. (Yeah, I'll get it, I'll get it, the whole town is worried about the ball. Very realistic. At least you could throw some funny scenes with the cops, but that might be too much.) For example, after Cherry drives a school and a handful of students down, Beth is found to be interviewed by local media. The reporter mentions the "shooter" that no one knows who killed those innocent students, but asks a second later, "What do you think of weapons in minors' hands?" Or something like that. Where did the reporter jumble with such conclusions? At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the promenade of proms and promo, Beth simply adds that "she understands (Cherry's) needs to be heard" and reappears). he leaves with his friends, smokes cigarettes in a quiet, unchanged mood. No one is even interested in the fact that they have just witnessed the murder. Not to mention the fact that students are constantly parked in the yellow zone, and none of them cares about the sudden increase in violence. a city, Julie living in a big house without parents, and a bizarre party in her house (maybe a little off the scene, but the last time I knew high school parties didn't include nude women dancing in the water pool while the bob men marshmallows and everyone basking in their attitudes "I am so indie and mod"), Beth's horrifying acting parents with her mother who acted over her head, and her father just nodded at everything my mother had to say (and not in a fun way one), along with stupid scenes such as the new black main run after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic. The only compliment I can give to this movie is that photography is amazing. The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and sharp with every shot. Too bad playing and scripts are not.
