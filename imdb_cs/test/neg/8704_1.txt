As a Christian, I am indignant to see only the first half of this picture. The film's website says they explored the film before writing, but I believe they forgot to consult the final BIBLE source. I sat with two different versions of the Bible and couldn't find half of what happened or was said in this picture. It was as if what was not in the Bible had changed what was in the Bible to what modern movie viewers thought instead of truth. Personally, I am too young to remember the Ten Commandments of the 1950s, but that cannot be worse than this. I wrote in the net and I can only hope that they publicly apologize for this trip.
