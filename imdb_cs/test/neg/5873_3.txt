I bought this movie in a gentle store. Months ago my friend told me about it when we talked about the stupid movies we saw. As soon as I noticed the cartridge, I knew I must have it. I watched it that night. I could say that it will be very cheesy and cheap. . . That drew me to that. I pulled him up and laughed all the way. I knew Gregory (Ice Cream Man), but I didn't know his name and I couldn't remember where I saw him. Later, while watching Andy Griffith's show, Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) was featured as special because he is Ron Howard (Opie Taylor) brother. I saw the credits and gasped. I turned to my mom, who was also watching the show, and said, "That's the ice cream man!" She gasped as well. This movie is great, but just for laughter and criticism. It is a perfect example of horrible horror. If you feel like you're laughing, just like having fun in low budget movies, rent this video.
