My brother-in-law and his wife brought the movie overnight to watch the video. That should give me the first clue that it would be terrible. It was. It is terrible from the first film to the last film. It is also not recorded as a "B" movie. Maybe N or P. One of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. This free movie is from a rubber raptor and still-breathing carcasses to horrible closing lines. Skip this completely - if you don't play Mystery Science Theater with your friends, it will provide good ammunition.
