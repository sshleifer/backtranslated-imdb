Don't choose this. **** Spoiler Alert ***** The plot of this appealing bad movie's four friends are being spoken to make a shuttle from the airport a very keen driver. The shuttle with them is rather a milquetoast-looking business type. Shortly after his journey, the shuttle driver takes the off-ramp and some crazy driver tries to get them out of the way. The end result is that they get a flat tire. The driver gets one of the people on the shuttle to help replace the tire, and the boys slip and the boys fingers are crushed between the tire and the shuttle. It is at this point that the driver reveals himself to be a hijacker and he took all the people hostage. Now the movie is extremely slow and tedious, because the characters are doing one lame thing after another. One of the men is killed and tries to escape - even without any tension. Finally, it is found that the milquetoast business guy is in a caste with a driver when a milquetoast guy kills a second male friend by cutting his throat. There are several attempts to escape women. Milquetoast is beaten over the head by the iron of the tires - yet it survives. The driver is also defeated and somehow survived his head when colliding with a fence at high speed while kneeling beside the steering wheel. Somehow, he couldn't get through the window or even be seriously injured by collision with the windshield. But the woman driving the shuttle was unconscious - yet she had the steering wheel to protect her and he had nothing between him and the windshield. Finally, he is able to conquer women and get them together. an underground garage that is the front for human trafficking. One of the women is killed. The other stabs the driver in the leg with a good piece of broken mirror and shoots him / her into the head, but is able (in what should be seriously weakened - heavy blood loss, two head injuries and injuries). a big foot wound) to pull her off the shuttle, drag her onto a large crate, drop it inside, and keep it locked, fighting her all the time. Some people admire the news about human trafficking and how it happens today. This is a serious problem. But making a very boring movie about a topic does not justify a higher ranking.
