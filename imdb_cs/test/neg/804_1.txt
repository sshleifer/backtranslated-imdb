Where should I start? The story was so bad, it had to be written in a high school film club! The acting was so wooden that I felt sorry for the actors! One actor even reminded me of how a deer must look when looking into the headlights of a car! Another actor has this constant look at constipation! But it was the dialogue that took the cake! Our hero tells his prisoners - all who hold submachine guns - if you put your finger on a female prisoner, you'll be dead. A moment later, the strongest guard, built as a truck and the only prisoner, stands up to him. When our intrepid leader, who has this very annoying hoarse gangster voice, captures the wind from this offense, he calmly enters the guard while machine guns are trained on him, and in a fraction of a second this giant guy snaps into his neck as if he broke. tooth brush! Then they return to the queue, while all the villains with their machine guns do nothing but scream at him! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on! This film is a camp gem; and if you have any sense of humor, it is guaranteed that you will laugh so hard that your eyes will break!
