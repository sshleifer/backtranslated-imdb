My girlfriend wanted to see it (lol's so much) ... so I rented it. Then I saw how it was awarded for 10 Oscars. GREAT! it should be a good drama. This film had a lot of potential ... the direction and the way everything was pace was very good. But once the movie was over, I couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a movie. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was extremely uncomfortable, I just couldn't tolerate her character at all. Warren Beatty was excellent in acting, but again I found it hard to have sympathy for his character ... he just came basically as a stupid, devastated loser gangster ... life. How come, like Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano? This movie left me with a numb but unpleasant feeling ... what was the big problem with this movie? I didn't feel complete with Bugsy. Beatty's opposites, though quite good, seemed too random and illogical. I guess that was how Siegel really was ... but it was just too much. There wasn't much real story here. My baseline rating would be <br /> <br /> "hot-headed, playboy, underachieving a gangster falls in love with a loser, comes up with the idea of ​​'Las Vegas' ... but his unsuccessful attempt at the casino he builds along with not thinking about the money of his barefoot bosses, he'll kill him. ”<br /> <br /> What's besides that? The films as it were nominated for 10 Oscars for me (although the two that won are justifiable) 1.5 / 4 stars.
