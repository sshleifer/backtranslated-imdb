Before I sat down and watched this movie on HBO, I didn't expect anything but a couple of laughs here and there and all together a silly and common plot. That's exactly what I got out of it, except that I was a little happy at the end of the movie. I didn't expect it to be so, I thought it would be just another hour and a half I had on my hands to fall away. Well, it was, but it was still worth it. The whole plot was very stupid, cheap and some lines were very stupid. Other than that it was still funny moments, though not many. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're going to rent it, no. Watch it on TV. I gave it 4, I was generous because it made me laugh, but it was still stupid.
