This film seemed to lack direction. The plot created so many twists in such a short time that it seemed to have lost any semblance of what was the real story. There was a great deal of wasted dialogue and it seemed as if the writing was rushing and it was too wandering. The exorcist scenes and the story of the property began to rely on the back stories of the character (which were a little weak to begin). <br /> <br /> All in all, if you rented the rest of the horror section in your local video store, and you have a movie you've never seen before. You are much better off looking at Exorcist or Exorcism Emily Rose.
