I just kept this film to satisfy my curiosity. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever gone through. I am amazed that this film currently has a 7.5 star rating. Acting is terrible, the script does not exist, and the characters are so predictable and hollow. For a witty movie I can't remember once how I giggled and didn't see how it could be defined as comedy. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this stubble and take a look at some other convenient alternatives that would give you much more pleasure. Watch movies like vacation or 27 dresses, these movies would offer a much more satisfying cinema experience. I sincerely hope that more educated film viewers will vote negatively for this film in a way that they really deserve to give it a more realistic assessment that other film enthusiasts might have their judgment. Let's go to people, whether we are fair to all those involved, and give those who are involved with this film a real reflection of what they have created - an extremely average image that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.
