The English translation of the title on the DVD version of this movie is "a graveyard of horrors," but I think it must be a mistake. It should have been called the "Horribles Cemetery". Terrible gameplay, terrible cuts, horrible story and terrible music all make this horrible movie the best horror in a terrible cemetery. Awful.
