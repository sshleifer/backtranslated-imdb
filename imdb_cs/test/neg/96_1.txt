Seriously, I can't imagine how anyone could find one flattering thing to say about this movie, and much less it would be that he would write the glowing compliments contained in this commentary himself. How many methamphetamines were Bogdonovitch on during the filming of this movie? Did he give a bonus to the actor who knocked out his lines with the fastest and least inclination or thought? Dialogue is wrong, conspiracy conspiracy, even for the "screwball" comedy, and the claim that the film is a tribute to the classic film comedy is about what I have ever heard. Cinematography is under the quality and innovation of what the worst TV movies show, acting is terrible (though I feel that the mistake lies directly in the director's key) and which he talks about I mentioned that the direction is so unhappy and erratic that it defies definition of word? The whole thing is terribly unfair (even in a very troubled world so bad - it's funny clunkers), sucking souls, wasting two hours of your life that you'll never return. Don't worry, don't worry ...
