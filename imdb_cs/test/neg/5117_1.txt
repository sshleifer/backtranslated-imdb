What can you say about a movie that makes "The Erotic Witch Project" look like an "English patient". Again, the plot and the characters are secondary, but the plot is an almost exact copy of "TEWP." Bare girl leaves porn gear and throws out a doll, just like in "TEWP". Losing, doofus is lost and the girls return to their hotel. There they reenact the end of the "Blair Witch Project," as cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing hopscotch, a game integral to the thin plot. At least three sorority sisters here have unnaturally large breasts full of hollows and stretch marks, along with fairly obvious opera scars. The "natural" gal is here humiliated by the director. In a very unsuccessful and too long loan segment, the scenes where they could not get the line to the right will play again and again. bare girl. This one scene seems to be added later because no one could be credited with casting fire. In the background, like a female cavort and stroke, you can see someone's fence. That may be Jim Wynorsky's backyard. That's just a bad thing. Lesbian love scenes are kelvin cooler than "The Erotic Witch Project''s". Most of the lovin 'consists of four women who collect eight collective breasts together. From this bad career decision, no luck, if imitation is a sincere form of flattery, then the creators of "The Blair Witch Project" should be really crazy.
