Great actors, good filming, potentially interesting plot, and what was supposed to be a good dialogue. There's nothing good about this movie. Perhaps a writer or director thought they could create an encouraging film out of irritated characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee. Within 10 minutes I didn't like seeing Kim Caroleen Feeney so much that she became distracted. While Kim is supposed to be unsympathetic, I'm not sure I wanted to commit physical violence to her. The first (of many) bizarre things that happen is that Wes (David Strathairn) comes from "I Miss $ 50.00" on "Stole $ 50" in 3 seconds. It was quite unlikely because she (Kim) never had access to her wallet, nor was she a handkerchief - there was no rational reason to suspect her. Most people lost money and assumed that ... LOST it. The same goes for Kim later. All the unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (I think) look at real people. The character of Kim was at least suffering from a BiPolar disorder. Wes had tremendous deficiency problems, Nancy was just boring and Matt was misleading (especially about music). I actually turned off about 2/3 of the way. However, to write a valid note, I forced myself to come back in the hope that something would come together in this film. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make it a point that you should skip.
