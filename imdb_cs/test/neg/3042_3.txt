While babysitting at an isolated house in Colorado, a teenage girl is terrorized by an elusive killer on the phone. The 1979 remake of a semi-classic horror movie basically takes 20 minutes of the original movie and stretches to fit 87 minutes of time! So it is quite pointless to say that the storyline of this remake is pretty thin. There is little originality or interest in this film. There's a lot of Camilla Belle thinking over the dark house and wondering who's calling her and meeting all kinds of false fears. All this is repeated and routine after the first 30 minutes and never fails to gather much in the way of tension or chills. It will certainly never reach the intensity of the original film, especially because it is out of the way and changes one important plot from the original. I think we have a PG-13 rating for that. On the plus side there is an impressive scenographic design and some dark atmosphere. subparagraph. Belle's performance is also very average. It's just another bland remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
