I rented this movie because I noticed a cover in a video store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, a 40-year-old setting and thought "hmm, he can't be too bad." Unfortunately, when I saw him, my impression was "not too good". It's a kind of Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that the other team members didn't get enough screen time. But his decent movie to see once. And Melanie's role was so small that she didn't get a chance that it would be unpleasant.
