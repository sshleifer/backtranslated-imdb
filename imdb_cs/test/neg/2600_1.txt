Words can't describe how is asinine, juvenile and repetitive this pile series. It relies on 3 things: 1. Constant 80s pop culture references 2. Tired "stretch joke to the point of awkwardness" bit, and 3. at least 3 or 4 useless flashbacks per episode. The only reason I see this crap is as popular as it is for constant pop culture links that I suppose to trigger "OMG LOL, which is from SUPERFRIENDS! IT!!" the answer from the viewer. Writing is off the lazy and panders to its viewers, mostly in their 20s and 30s. In addition, there is a character who seems to consist of three identical characters with the same boring expressions that are drawn over and over again, but with different skin colors and sometimes a different hairline. Offensive crap.
