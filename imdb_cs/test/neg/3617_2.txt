Don't waste your time. One of those great-looking boxes that you pick up on the blockbuster, but it's not worth it. You won't say, "It's so bad, it's good." "It is bad." The greatest American hero is a writer who rents a cabin on an African island, called Snake Island. Some other tourists are on a boat letting him go but not on the island. They just stop there to let go of the writer. Then there is a ship stranded and - in real Hollywood originality - the only and only radio on the island is arrested. So they start walking and see a lot of snakes. Like hundreds of them that were really annoying and you knew the plot would not be anywhere. It's not as if he was one main snake at all. Like a giant mutant snake or an extra venomous king of all snakes. Instead, there are just a bunch of ham-and-egger snakes of all kinds of breeds. Their only goal was to escape from the island ... unlike the need to conquer the enemy. Because there were so many snakes, you knew they couldn't try to kill them all. I saw a similar film where snakes followed the city and led all the snakes into the cave and then blew it up. At least then you feel good guys have killed bad guys and it was a normal ending. In Snake Island (by the way, every character was shocked to see the snakes on the island ... duhhhhh, for some reason it's NAMED Snake Island), there was no other plan than trying to get gas for a silly ship. By the way, they never get gas. "Just happened" to find another ship on the island already gassed.
