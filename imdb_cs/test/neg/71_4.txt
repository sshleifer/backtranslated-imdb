There are many different versions of this that move around, so make sure you can find one of the unrated copies, otherwise there may be some gore and one scene of nudity. Some versions also omit most of the initial sequences and other bits. The cut I saw has the title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS on screen and was released by Shriek Show, which maintains the original title of US WITCHERY for DVD release. It's a nice print and seems to have all the shots, but it has some trouble with cropping / aspect ratio. In Italy it was issued as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two versions of LA CASA were actually the first two films EVIL DEAD (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film of the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To be confusing, WITCHERY was released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. With the exception of Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I'd better shut up now. I'm starting to be wrong! Whatever the name, it's a very horrifying effort. Some of them are good, some are not. Actually, I was the first half in this movie, but in the end it became a nonsense mess. A large, empty hotel located on an island about 50 kilometers from Boston is the setting of various people picking up a one-by-one German-speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture "witch light" and his witchcraft girlfriend, Leslie Cumming, is in the hotel without permission. Together comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who shows the property to potential buyers of Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Such labeling is their children; pregnant adult daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their ship's driver is killed (hung) and the ship disappears, so they are trapped and basically at the mercy of the "Lady in Black". <br /> <br /> So what can you expect from here? Lots of inconveniences! One of the characters has a tight lip and then hangs upside down in the fireplace and inadvertently roasts the rest. There is also a crucifixion, a witch eating a dead baby, a swordfish over her head, someone lit, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, a virgin rape some demon, a vein bulging boys and exploding due to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. Technically, it is a nice looking movie with very good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel / island is also nice. Blair (especially at the end) and Ross seem to be having fun and Knef is great as a bad witch. Although people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either. At the bottom, despite all the gore, the movie seems to be rather boring and monotonous after an hour. . Supernatural themes are also confused and confusing. When the characters are dragged into the witches' lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers decided to overlap the screaming actors over some silly-looking red spiral whirling effect. And the witch itself is empty and cheaply designed with unfinished wood. And although most casts are at least decent, several performances (especially "actress" who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and child) are so bad that they keep distracting.
