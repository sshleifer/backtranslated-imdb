It's hard to make a negative statement here after all about how big the poll is, how amazing the actors did and so on and so on. I didn't like the movie. it's crappy! there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex They seem to rule their world, I think the director desperately needs to be laid.) The story is just dirty and shameful. I wonder what made these people get up with this story. and above all: who cares? The technical stuff did not satisfy me. the sound is bad, so editing and "direction" are missing. The actors are undoubtedly fine, but guess what! it's their job! their job is to act! there is no need to jump from your seats if the actor has done a decent job. applause when the bus driver brings you home safely? saw? <br /> <br /> I gave it 2/10 because after all it had something I couldn't put into words. b movie magic? camp fun? nudity? I don't know.
