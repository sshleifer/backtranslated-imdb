The first 90 minutes of this movie I found it very interesting, though several of its parts were ridiculous (ie Philip Seymour Hoffman's character). The last 60 minutes were disgusting and I began to lose interest in the film. The last hour seemed to last forever. The film is nice and I see why Rene Zellweger won an Oscar because her character was so interesting. The film is also beautifully shot and the story is emotional. However, I found that the message was bad. In this story, "Inman" (Jude Law) leaves the Confederate Army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend is missing and wants him home. He is also disillusioned with the war. (Can you imagine that every soldier on a similar ship has left the army in two world wars?) <br /> <br /> Of course, everything is perfectly acceptable in this movie. And again, what had a liberal filmmaker ever had a nice thing about the US military? To join their leftist slant, they depict vigilants as perpetrators who go after deserters as cold-blooded sick killers. Well, in the world of movies, as we know: good is portrayed as bad and bad is good ..... and only liberals would portray deserters as heroes.
