There were only two redeeming functions about this film; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture and the way they portray the transformation from human form to wolf form. Forget the story or story from the book - it's completely missing in this movie. In fact, the only things transferred from the book are the names of the main players. Even then you can barely recognize the characterization. If filmmakers did a good movie, even if they were not related to the book, I wouldn't be so disappointed. Unfortunately, no. The storyline and storyline are typical of low budget horror flicks, acting is wooden, and overhead effort mundane. Oh yes, the way loup garou bows to his leader is pure hoke. I believe that recognition of recognition is due to the processors of the animals. The wolves were beautiful animals and they managed their roles well.
