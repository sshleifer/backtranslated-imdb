I bought this movie for a few dollars on the "Warehouse Clearance" one day when it just looked around. The cover looked pretty good (color), but the film is black and white, (I wish they didn't try to catch us with colored covers on black-and-white movies, but it's a common thing.) <Br / When I watched, I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out to be better than I expected. I was disappointed that it was BW, but its effects are pretty good, certainly better than, say, "Mars invaders" who have poor effects, and it's great to see John Banner in something other than Hogan's heroes. Overall, this movie is not too bad for grade B, and certainly worth two dollars in terms of nostalgia. It's not my favorite science fiction, but it's not my worst. It's alright.
