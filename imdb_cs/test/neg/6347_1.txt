One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Totally ridiculous. The story is bad. The animations are totally childish and relocated. The hologram physics is cheerful of how wrong they are. OMG, I even want to believe this movie is wearing Disney's label. Ugh. The actresses are somewhat beautiful, but there are so many good movies with astonishing actresses that are much more valuable to see than this. Final note, bad movie. Don't bother watching him. If you're looking for movies to see with your kids, consider other alternatives like Ratattuile, Monster Inc or Enchanted Story (on theaters). Seriously.
