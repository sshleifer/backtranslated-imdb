Slaughter Trail is a B western with some great demands. But it's in Hollywood history for the most vulnerable reason. Watching this movie with its musical score that can only be described as prevalent, I feel that Howard Hughes is trying to do is recruit singing cowboy for RKO movies. They already had Tim Holt, who was just as reliable a cowboy hero he had ever been, but he wasn't a singer. I think Hughes saw what money Herbert J. Yates had been digging with Roy Rogers at the Republic and decided to take it too. So Terry Gilkyson, who was a very good player and a much better song writer got recruited and sang some of his stuff that wasn't his best and worse, it looked like they got into the picture. But worse than it is an annoying chorus who sang a lot of the story and sincerely overwhelmed by actors, extras, even horses. Needless to say, Terry should never be a singing cowboy. But he wrote such classics as The Bare Necessities and Dean Martin's Big Hit, Memories Are Made Of This. The storyline involves an inner woman on a gem jewel store. That's right, outlaws who are Gig Young, Myron Healey, and Ken Koutnik Virginia Gray in the coach as passengers who receive the word carry some valuable jewelry. It's a great act of Gray and Young will kick off. Young takes her away from the coach, which is probably a fate worse than death, and they do a good scene in the earshot of the passengers, but what she does is slip. The last place the authorities could watch if they didn't miss it. But when they flee from the robbery, it's on tired horses, so they stop in the cabin to take some spare horses and shoot three Navajos who objects. That puts the Navajos back on the war, not that one of the victims was Ric Roman's brother. This is the situation when Captain Brian Donlevy in the fort has to deal with when a coach and coach outlaws come here for protection. How it all works is predictable, but in a gaudy kind of overproduction. In fact, it's a defeat problem. It's simple, no B western curls that got into something almost grotesque. The real reason the Slaughter Trail has entered history is that this film probably marks the official start of the blacklist. Originally Howard DaSilva was supposed to play Donlevy's role and perhaps actually completed his scenes when Howard Hughes officially fired him into communist sympathy. His scenes were completely re-shot with Brian Donlevy in the lead. Given what fiasco this movie has changed, I'm not sure if Donlevy or DaSilva should have thanked Hughes or kicked him into his private protection.
