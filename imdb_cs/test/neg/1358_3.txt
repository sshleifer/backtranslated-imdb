Every once in a while, indie comes to have an amazing cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can't-miss, but the movie sucks. Some recent movies belonging to this unfortunate category are "Levity" and "The Safety Of Objects", and now there is "The United States Of Leland". He said the amazing cast includes Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald, a teenage son of the famous author (Spacey), who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime (murdering a retarded child) but does not remember him and does not seem to have a motive. Don Cheadle plays a teacher in a teenage room trying to understand Leland (and also exploit him by writing a book about him) and Jena Malone is his ex-girlfriend. We see their deteriorating relationship (because of its heroin addiction) in flashback. Sounds like a wonderful little drama, huh? I also thought so. The fact is, this movie is poorly written. Dialogue and narration are painfully arrogant and burdened with irritating phrases about "life", characters are all two-dimensional indie clich√©s, and while he manages to make Leland sympathetic in some ways, he overlooks his crime. <br /> <br /> For the most part there is no acting problem. Gosling (who was Oscar-worthy in "Believer") is an extremely talented young actor, but the way they are written, none of these characters (least of all Leland) felt like real people, so there is not much he could. Do, but mutter his ridiculous lines and look sad. Jena Malone is the most memorable. She has one of the most distinctive faces I've ever seen. Even playing underwriting characters in a bad movie like this can break your heart with one look. When she has good stuff to do (like "Donnie Darko" or "The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys"), she's really amazing. But that's not good stuff. Maybe after a massive rewrite it could be something worth it, but as it is, "United States Leland" is cumbersome, inert, and for a movie that seems to love with how "deep" it is, it's really shallow.
