Norris plays a Chicago cop who hits a devil's disciple? who wants, well, create Armegeddon. Finally, he kills the creature by doing it, throwing a solid 24-inch gold tip, not too sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. Is it unlikely? Like the rest of the movie. Much of it consists of CN and its sidekick drive cars and talk nonsense. An Israeli (or Arabic) boy is there reportedly humanizing the CN. OK. It doesn't work, makes sense, and conspires, so-called, not one bit. Also, no cops get invited from the country to see other cops. It's ridiculous as a premise. The whole thing is wrong. Unfortunately it is not so bad that it is fun bad or campy. Just bad. But - we can see Norris trying to find his way to the successful Walker: Texas Ranger series.
