There are places for political commentary in the film, but "Masters of Horror" is not one of them. I get enough news from Newsweek and every other editorial in the paper. Now I have to watch it in horror? Come on! All I wanted was a good zombie schlock movie, not another "Bush is bad!" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his policy, let him go to Air America. And if you have to insist on creating a "message" movie, be a little more crafty about it. All this meant that we hit the dead fish face. By the way Joe, do you really want the left-wing vote to be linked to dead zombies? He might think about it before he makes another political horror (God will help us).
