I read and enjoyed the many secrets of James Lee Burke Robicheaux. When I read "In Electric Fog with the Confederate Dead" was filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was playing the lead, I was thrilled. After seeing him last night, I'm going to shut it down with about twenty minutes, I don't want to see more people being shot or beaten. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind blood and gore-I love "Untouchables" and "The Godfather Trilogy". Maybe it was just that I saw 'birth' and 'what happened' before I saw it. I know Burke's books are violent, lyrical, especially in the case of "In The Electric Mist", they can be like the Cajun swamps he writes about, full of things that are never fully explained. It's okay in the book. It's confusing in the movie. Many of the previous reviewers are also keen admirers of Dave Robicheaux, making him more understandable that they really liked the movie. Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all actors (and especially Vince) I felt that it was such a waste of their talents as a whole. Now I say I've only seen a DVD in the US and hoped Tavernier's cut would be a huge difference. On the plus side: the soundtrack was amazing. The Robicheaux scenes were perfect - just as I imagined the bait shop looks. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie, as was Walter Breaux as Batist. If you read the books, you know why Robicheaux is a balanced man at the beginning of the film, and then he starts to beat people with different instruments. Overall, I wish they would shoot more of "electric fog and Confederate dead" and skip large portions of Robicheaux's interrogation methods, explaining Elrod's gifts and his bond to Dave, as well as Dave's general. Then I wouldn't feel like I did it last night when I turned it off, "What happened?"
