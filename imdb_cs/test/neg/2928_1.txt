Can this film be considered a movie? Imagine a situation: someone fits on a tripod and in front of a sea promenade and movie people who go or run after it. Then he places the camera on the beach, buys some ducks in the animal shop, opens his cages and lets them run in front of the camera. Later, he only films the water surface and the sound of birds and insects in total darkness. Is it an experiment or just an insult to the audience's intelligence? What would happen if an unknown director made such a movie? Would we mark his work as 10? I've always disappointed directors who believe they can do everything they want once they become famous.
