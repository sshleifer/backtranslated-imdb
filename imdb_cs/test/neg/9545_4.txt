I'm the only person who thinks the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the US must hate this all-powerful slap on their faces. The novice cop is the first at the crime scene where her back is so slow to answer that she has time to send a guy who found the body to a local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time she gets back (still no older cops, SOCOs or other help for beautiful Jolie - that's New York, isn't it?) It started raining and she gets to work proofing after she stood before Amtrak the disturbing scene stopped. <br /> <br /> I want to know the name of this camera because the photos were so incredibly detailed that no enlargement of distorted images !! Horror continues: - Not in the movie itself (quite common I'm afraid) but in Lincoln Rhyme's character as played by Mr. Washington. This man is a highly committed criminal criminal investigator with years of experience, who entrusts the work of an untrained cop, a newcomer to the search for very obvious clues, instead of highly trained but invisible local criminal investigators. move them before you shoot them, contaminating each item and allowing DNA profiling to become impossible. Was that a clear idea now? I know that one should be able to suspend distrust to some extent, but those who say that this film is intelligent must completely deny their ability to think to believe it. I introduced this film 4/10 for the outstanding acting Denzel Washington and Miss Jolie's lips, which are the only things that require my distrust to be suspended!
