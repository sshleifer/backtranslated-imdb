Well ........ how and where do I start to describe this utter nonsense? Imagine the morale of kitschy Hollywood western hockey, throw in the richest assistant of the most weird story of soap opera, and try to imitate children to think that it is cool by dressing up in something "contemporary". This movie is a whole package and absolutely no stuff. It starts with a promise ... ... young men dream of becoming rockstars and dealing with excessive hero worship. After all, it goes downhill ..... faster than a bobsleigh track without brakes. The scene with the first Steel Dragon concert is one of the most beautiful pieces of 'cine kitsch' I've seen for a long time. The singer appears on stage for her debut and falls down the stairs ..... will get up and sing ??? ..... or there will stay on the floor and not sing ...... who cares? It's worse, but I don't want to be bored by having to remember it in all my excruciating details. If you look at this after this review, it's your own fault!
