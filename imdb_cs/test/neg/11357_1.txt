If you want to waste a small part of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie movie. It fails in the first place by not being scary or funny. It's a boring gray movie that I think went straight to video. Hammy and the tongue on the face have a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to watch the poor but still traceable recent zombie movie watch Diary of the Dead. Bad special effects, school-level script. Zombie movies work if they have moral or political significance. This film has nothing, it's not a worthy point that zombification underlines. This is as exciting and convincing as the Republican Convention, I am not sorry that the Republican Convention was a better example of Zombie.
