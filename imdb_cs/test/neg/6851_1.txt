Voor een verloren soldaat, for a lost soldier, is a sad example of not translating a film of moving, complex psychological study, the most beautiful time in a person's life when he is still a child, but a man becomes a man. The novel captures the real life experiences of Rudy van Dantzig, as Jeroen's boy said, during the waning days of World War II at the age of 11 when he deals with his initial sexuality, and his deep fears of abandonment as he was sent to the province. Friesland, north of Holland his parents due to lack of food in Amsterdam and heard of them in many months, because the postal service fell apart. The arrival of liberating soldiers in the film is presented painfully by Corny's way, with soldiers providing entertainment in the vaudeville style. Then one soldier, Walt, romance Jeroen and the couple is presented as two frolicking males.who consume their love in sexual experience. It took in step 11 yo Jeroen. The reality was somewhat different: Jeroen describes his encounters with Walt, a total of 6, in detail, but in oblique language. But their nature is not a misunderstanding. Walt is aroused to intense passion by Jeroen, during which he works him roughly, so that in their last encounter, Jeroen is bruised and suffering from a painful blow on the shoulder where Walt bit him. During this meeting, Walt rapes Jeroen, twice. Jeroen could easily have avoided Walt after his second encounter when Walt attacked him for the first time because Walt was clearly trying to keep his boy's cruelty to other soldiers. Why Jeroen is still looking for Walt out is the mystery of the human heart and it is not explainable to me. What the film leaves behind is the result of: nightmares, depression, frantic search in Amsterdam for a chance to find Walt, because Jeroen loved Walt, and none of it could shake.
