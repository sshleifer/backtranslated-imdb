This is a really bad waste of time. I would probably rather watch a document than this; It's really so bad. Acting is really horrible, and you can say that manufacturers had a low budget because of the terrible image quality. It's far from the lower end of the scale; Don't waste money on it. I am really hard to believe that the person who made this film would eat well. I had to look at it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the kids. Even the children (3, 4, 6 and 8) thought it was quite boring. <br /> <br /> I agree with another commentator, Spongebob would be much better to watch than that. <br /> <br /> Overall: Don't look at it. No. No.
