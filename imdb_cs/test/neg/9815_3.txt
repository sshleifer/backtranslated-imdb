This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an endless series of bad horror movies, I can say it's a little different from the many I've seen. Not in a plot, which is a fairly regular story of slasher, but rather the way scenes are carved. The Weapon murder gives us a lot of other dialogues, but they go on much longer than most movies of this type. Because of this, some of the victims seem to be slightly smaller than cardboard cutouts. Just a little. I had a hard time finding out exactly what was happening at the beginning, wondering if certain events were dreams. My favorite scene is when two guys are running away from the killer and taking refuge in the car. They will find a gun in the glove box. "Thanks God!" one of them shouts happily. The guy suddenly looks like a mannequin head and continued so long to wonder, "What's that? Where is the mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car?" Then BOOM! The head explodes and I figured it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car to get his head shotgun. I like the scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 3/10.
