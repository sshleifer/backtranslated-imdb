For years, I hesitated to watch this movie. Now I know why. Not only is it a comedy that fails to be funny at a distance, but there's also nothing to laugh about about the movie. It was even worse than I expected. I rented it and I still felt cheated of time more than money. I've never seen a movie that upset me so much. It's a movie about stupid people doing stupid and terrible things. I really don't know how a common sense could actually act in such a movie. I've used IMDb for some time, but I felt obliged to register only to prevent poor, unsuspecting people from renting, or, worse, buying this stinking !! Really a waste of time and money. I have to say that the storyline is terrible.
