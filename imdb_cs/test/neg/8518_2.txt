Eddie Fischer was just wrong. Maybe the worst scene came soon in the movie when it broke into a spontaneous song and a dance number centered around the piano and some comfortably placed staff. The song was totally stupid ... I think I could offer the drunk a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed her and probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculous scene, Fischer says something that results in: "Don't say (insert a guy's name. He doesn't like music" and he smiles). I can't describe how bad it is, I felt a little embarrassed. And this guy Debbie Reynolds is working and who's always beating her is so unpleasant. I can't even imagine anyone losing a fraction of the time on him. The jokes were delivered without any kind of chemistry between the characters through which the film went through. At least the baby had cute hair. Two stars are for Reynolds, who was like a swan among ugly ducks. Instead, look at the bachelor's mother.
