A vast suspension of mistrust is required where Will's "genius" is concerned. Not only in mathematics - it is also very well read in economic history, it is able to shrink several shrinkages, etc. No, no, no. I'm not buying it. While doing so, they could also wear a large "S" on the chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets. Among other problems ... currently the problem is what really is, and whether it deserves such a helpless honor, it simply does not appear (ex nihilo). It's never so multifaceted. This is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries. Better to make Will a basketball miracle. Except Damon's too short.
