One of the commentators is bad. This is not the only Pat Patterson movie and did not die two years later. He has made a film called "Electric Chair" in Pineville, NC. He shot it several years after Dr. Gore. Patterson died in the late 1970s. I know because he used my house and left the cat there !! It was also soaked. That was a big problem when the movie came out. No independent horror movies have been created in NC. This movie didn't help. Patterson used gore effects for H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His gore scenes at the Body Shop were really well done. The film was shot in a building that also housed 7/11. In some scenes you can actually see the tops of the walls. The budget was less than $ 20,000, and the screenplay seemed to have written it. Only Patterson understood that. Still ... it's fun and it's a classic.
