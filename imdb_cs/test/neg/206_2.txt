Heist movie with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... sounds great on paper? I think it had to be done when someone from this movie shed light on the production of this film, but the end product is terrible! The story is boring, the action boring and for the movie that is only 88 minutes seems to just drag on. I felt my life slip through and was sure there was something better I should do ... perhaps some color that could be dried somewhere possible? Sigh. I'm a huge Jean Reno fan, but what did he think when he signed up for it? There are so many other great action movies around ... go watch one of those and leave this movie best forgotten.
