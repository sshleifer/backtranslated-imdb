It was a full plot of hole, inaccuracy (not a time-clock stop for injured players or loss of helmets in Texas football matches?) And not so much redemption (so your dad beats crap out of you? Well, do something for once and then will love you and do it all for it). Either make a film about the team and its quest for the championship, or make a film about a team player and his personal life. But this struggle tried to do everything and lost more than a few meters. The book probably showed the whole story much better; The movie should pick one element of the story and get stuck with it. Instead, the movie jumped from one character dialogue to the flashes of the game and then another character of the dialogue months later, without actually saying which people were or why they were important - QB called her sibling to take care of her mother cared - what happened to it? Since the mother was coherent by the end of the final game, does that mean she is no longer crazy? His only quality was the soundtrack. Buy and then check out SportsCenter while Iggy Pop plays in the background.
