If rich people are different from us because they have more money, then filmmakers are different from us because they think the world cares about every thought. This confident piece of dragon seems to have been done just because the director felt it was time to make another movie, and someone would fund it. Not every trivial idea or reflection is worthy of a film (unless you are a college student trying to complete the course). When you have nothing to say, sometimes it's best to stay quiet. Visuals are not breathtaking. They are quite common. Dialogue is casual and incredible. He talks to words that no one would realize in situations that are beyond imagination. Germaine Greer with zipper f ** k is finally on the screen. Even if you believe in love at first sight, no one falls into bed as easily as these characters. They screw before they talk. Even more unbelievable is the aging, bald director who has found immediate sex with the most beautiful baby in town, even though gravity is already getting into Miss Marceau at a young age.
