This documentary tries to make a comedy, but I never get it. Camp? Ehn. Kitsch is the more appropriate word on which everyone agrees - and when it is hard to avoid every revision. Kitsch dripped. It was as if the filmmakers were afraid that their viewers would take the film too seriously, and so they leaned back to insert kitsch and said, "We're joking here! You see ??? ‚Äù<br /> <br / In short, I felt that it was trying too hard. For example, sock puppets that represented every scene were (for me) uncomfortable when I'm sure they were supposed to be fun - or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey. No, however, avoid this movie on my complaints. Just be prepared to rejoice in kitsch rather than prepare you for it. If you're interested in light fares, you can do it far, much worse. At the very least, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of Bakers make this interesting and worth seeing. At best, gagles like minded lovers of kitsch will hum and holler through the selection of pieces throughout the movie.
