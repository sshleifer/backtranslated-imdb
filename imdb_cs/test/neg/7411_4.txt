A big waste of time is that you get out of this bag. I rented this hope for a thrilling movie with maybe a few believable scenes, but the boy was sometimes disappointed. I think the title should be "Camping 101" or something like that. Well, stay away from the movie. It dulls you to death. Don't be afraid of big feet, don't worry about this crap!
