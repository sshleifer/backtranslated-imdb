ARMED AND DANGEROUS is not one of John Candy's greats. This movie about a fired cop who ends up working for a small security system led by a crowd is very weak and not too comedy. There are some moments that I enjoyed, as well as looking at Candy in a pilot suit, but it doesn't seem to matter. ARMED AND DANGEROUS is still a dangerously unsatisfactory bagpipe brought to us by the director of the equally stupid commissioner COMMANDO. What a sad excuse for comedy! <br /> <br /> 1 of 5
