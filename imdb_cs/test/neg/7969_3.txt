Lance Henriksen paid for something that might appear in it. I hope it was a lot. Former US National Gymnast, Kristie Phillips, starts as Charlie Case, a gymnast-turn-secret agent (because it's very common that munchkin gymnasts become government spies ...) ) <br /> <br /> There is a really hysterical opening scene where Charlie's uneven bars routine is sabotaged by a competitor of the Eastern Bloc. What follows is one of the most ridiculous scenes I've ever seen ... and want you to take it seriously! Don't worry ... she's holding her dismount. Everything after it's just a messy, pinch of spy movie. Watch the first fifteen minutes of what's in the gym camp.
