The only time it seems that I can go through the IMDb comments is when I saw the duff movie. I think I'm trying to make sure it's not just me. Lonesome Jim was a duffe movie full of incredible characters in incredible situations, limping and politely to a deciphered conclusion. So I look at what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim, out on a limb, estranged because a page of several star ratings and plaudits let me doubt their critical abilities. But maybe I should check the settings for commenting because the dying jets will die after a while and I am relieved to see that what reflects my own is recognition. I feel defended. It is a waste film, it MUST NOT hang together and it is a useless evening that sat in it. Praise your spirits.
