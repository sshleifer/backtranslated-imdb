This film was included in the six wives of Henry VIII's BBC miniseries DVD. I loved the six movies. They were well-acted, well-written, and historically accurate. Actually, I read Gregor's book and liked it quite well, though it is a huge historical inaccuracy (I mean the whole false homosexual angle with George Boleyn), but this film didn't even mention it. This angle was one of the key points of the book. <br /> <br /> He asks me "WHY?" Why do we see someone else aptly say "The Real World: Tudor England"? Why are camera angles so bad in general? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so bad? I know it was improvised, but come on! Actors in time stutter and stutter over their lines and it is obvious they are doing them when they go together. Why are sex scenes so embarrassing? The way they were made in the book is at least somewhat interesting. In the film, it's just bad, verging on being absolutely cheerful. At one point, the actress starring Mary Boleyn had sex with the actor starring Henry VIII. She pulls away and she has this look on her face, which says, "Hm .... I have to go to the store. Is it still done? Maybe when I finish, I can go quickly pick up some cheese ..." Why wrong. Why Catherine of Aragon plays such a small role in this movie? Her refusal to divorce was one of the main causes of the scandal that Christiandom shook. That's why Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn couldn't get married immediately. Why isn't he here? Overall, this film is bad.
