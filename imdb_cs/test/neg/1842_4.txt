Worst Korean Movie! The plot is ridiculously complex, incredible, and the film does not create a single shock. It builds tension well enough, then leaves it agitated providing no shock or nervous moment. Whenever there is a cool moment, it does not bother you because you are still trying to find out who is who and what is happening! It's something like this: a modeling company hires 4 people for a modeling career. But the owners are not what they seem to have a model doll each and a weird girl is seeing the walking spot and the owners have no recognition of the girl. It turns out that everyone is for some reason and that's as much as I could understand. The end is a confusion of murders and you don't know who the real doll is and who is dead! I do not recommend it to fans of Korean / Asian horror movies.
