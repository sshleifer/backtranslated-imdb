"May Contain Spoilers" Lou Costellos's last sad movie is honored for being a little better than Abbott & Costello's "Dance With Me" movie. This movie is not entirely in all terrible that is a fun misfire career. Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the film a little bearable. You can't blame Lou Costello for that because he was released by a big studio, which meant someone had to give him "green" light. In my opinion, Lou Costello overcame the problems of his own loss of his son a few years earlier and unauthorized attacks by the IRS. If you look at the last 3 - 4 films of Abbott & Costello, you may notice that the spell was gone. Check out "Dancing with Henry", now it's a painful movie to watch.
