This is the god of horrible Norris film, with one of the most annoying performances ever in Calvin levels and a weak script. The characters were terrible, and it has hardly any action, and even Chuck Norris stinks in this! Christopher Neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story wasn't very interesting and Norris seemed to be bored and I don't blame him because I was too! Calvin's levels give one of the most annoying performances in the movie ever, I couldn't stand while I was tempted to rip the tape off my VCR, plus Norris and the levels had no chemistry together!. If your looking for some great martial arts moves from Norris don't go near this, but if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, barely any action and bad gameplay look further! This is the horrible god of the Norris movie, with one of the most annoying performances ever of the Calvin level, Avoid it as a plague! The direction is incredibly bad. Aaron Norris has an incredibly bad job here, without tension or exciting camera work and keeping the movie at a dark pace! There's some blood and violence. We get 2 cruel impulses, a torn heart, an exploding body, and several gunshot wounds. Acting is really bad. Chuck Norris is not amazing because he is usually here and there seemed to be bored, his one liner is flat and his acting isn't so great and I'm a huge Norris Fan, that's his absolute worst! (Norris still reigns!) Calvin Levels is annoyingly annoying here, his lousy performance has taken me hard, I was so hopeful that he would, but unfortunately not. Christopher Neame is pretty weak as the main villain, his voice was fine, but he did do a great time!. Sheree J. Wilson is beautiful and fine with what she has to do. The rest of the cast is terrible. Overall, please avoid this not being tortured even if you are a huge Norris fan (like me). BOMB of 5
