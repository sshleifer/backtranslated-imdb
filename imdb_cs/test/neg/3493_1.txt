This movie is bad. Just wrong. In absolute terms, bad. The dialog jumps from the screen and throws you into the face with its thoroughly artificial joking, and then defecates your ability to uncover even traces of subtlety. Racism is wrong. Racism in Los Angeles can be especially bad. I live in Angels, I prove it. What is so terrible about bigots in Los Angeles is his insidious nature. It sneaks at you with a conscious look or swallowed word. Until he finds himself on the edge of a full-fledged fight, he almost never comes out and says "why he must have been black!" I see quite clearly that auto-jackers are black, Detective's partner is Hispanic, DA is white. As long as the projector is projected into the film, I can leave visual effects, music and words to bring me to that conclusion without telling me the conclusion. Emote characters, and we read between the lines to make connections and conclusions. This is a partnership and trust between a filmmaker and an audience. This trust is raped by this film. <br /> <br /> A good movie pulls you in the direction of the audience and directs you to drive into place. This film beats you with your point and insults you and your intelligence on the way. My unanswered question is why we, as a society, said collectively, "Thank you?"
