This is one of those harmless and slightly fun little movies that try to make you like more. But like many others, it is a material that is not strong enough to fill a few hours successfully. The course is promising: three trawlers ride the bus through Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They have a lot of problems - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their past. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is the real problem. Leadership is fine (although Pearce's permanent camp becomes tedious), but one-piece and epithets feel compelled to be thrown away at random. The characters should not laugh at their own gags. The writer / director Elliott also feels the need for a pile of pleasantly disparate shots of fantastic drag costumes against a crisp desert environment like so much cheap makeup. For a film of self-confidence and mere being, it all seems very uncertain.
