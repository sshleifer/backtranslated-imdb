The most valuable film of the decade. Responsible parties should never be allowed to film again. I have no words to describe the lack of entertainment this film provides. You couldn't pay me to watch the movie again. Frankly, I think I'd be a better person if I didn't see it. If I call it offensive, I would fall into the category of emotionally fragile extremists. I would say this film goes so far as to damage industry. There are movies that I refuse to watch, now that I feel like it could be so tasteless. I feel like an idiot that I had no good sense of going out during any of the many moments I had to do. Yes, I saw the end and I am ashamed of it, just like anyone else, including the writer. I'm in awe ...
