These rubber monsters failed to be cool, frightening or even comedians, looking like a Porkys or Animals House movie, but the sequence and history is not always clear and can not draw your attention. Taste, the only thing that makes you laugh is a scary rubber monster that has to cost one dollar because the work or never looks realistic, the movements and expressions make Muppets look like a Pixar 3D movie when compared to this. I hope Marie Carlton is the only thing that makes this scary movie, and when she dies in the movie, it's the worst than ever.
