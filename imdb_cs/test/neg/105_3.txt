The Forgotten (AKA: Don't Look In The Basement) is a very cheap and very old looking horror movie. The story is very slow and never reaches what could be exciting. Asylum patients are embarrassingly funny, especially Sam and an old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (Look at the bit when it gets closer to the camera, tell me you can watch without laughing!) <br /> <br /> Now gore is very bad looking, with blood-looking pink in many scenes, so It doesn't really deserve its place on video nasties list!. Overall, if you're not looking for a fantastic horror movie and have some time to spare then it's worth watching.
