I'm sorry, but I can't understand what people were smoking when they wrote how much they thought "Ethan Mao" was. I have seen better acting, character and plot development in pornos! WARNING: I will distribute a key "plot" element. After Ethan left his family hostage, left his disgust, evil, hated step-mom, go to bank - ALONE !!! - Get the jewel of his late mom, whom he so desperately wants. Guess what? She'll call the cops! Wow ... what a twist! I didn't see it coming. The only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes.
