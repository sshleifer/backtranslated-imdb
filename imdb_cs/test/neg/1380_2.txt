I'm a huge fan comedy show. Racial humor is always a bit risky, but great as George Lopez, Dave Chapelle, Lisa Lampanelli, and so on. Once overboard, unpleasant audience or cough * cough * STEAL JOKES! But I won't be harp. Carlos makes racial humor utterly useless. His jokes keep screaming racial humor to the point that it's not funny or clever, but it's offensive. I'm not one to cool down to racial humor. But his performance of these jokes is sloppy, causing people to return in his comedy. His humor is only overcome by his presence in irritation. I feel like he's constantly watching me! And he runs on stage like a maniac. It looks like annoying!
