Detective Dave Robicheaux attempts to link the murder of a local hooker to New Orleans gangster Julie Balboni. But during his investigation, Robicheaux is led into a series of unreal encounters with Confederate soldiers? What a terrible story and it was worse than I expected. It was real slow and had minimal skills in acting I couldn't watch over it was a waste of my time. Next FLOP, I'd put it under 1, if I could, please don't waste time 1: 42m full time. Actor Elrod Sykes and his girlfriend are under the influence. As Dave takes Elod to the station the actor tells Dave he found some skeletal remains while on the movie set he films.
