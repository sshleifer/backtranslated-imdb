New York's Alice Dodgson suspends her when she treats one of her patients with an unapproved drug, resulting in the patient's death. Without work, Alice is forced to go to Jamaica, where she cares for a rich brother's brother who thinks he's a zombie and is deeply involved in local community practices and rituals.
