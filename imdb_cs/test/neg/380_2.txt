This kind is like an earlier 1987 film "Masters of the Universe" based on "He-man". Basically you have a great old world and for some reason almost all the action of the film must be going on a modern country. Well, I think it's not such a modern country now, and it's an ancient world that is now strange and a day of good times gone. Well, I think I can find out why they actually put almost the entire movie in modern times in this and that movie. To save money on costumes and sets. It is much easier to recreate what is happening today than the strange world that is in Eternia in man or in the ancient world with cults and strange pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that will walk you to death. This movie is forgotten and not too funny, your first notion that it won't be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing this man has is animals that are not as prevalent in this as they were in the last. Marc Singer is back and sad when he seems to be in this state, the guy was a pretty good actor who tried to make a sequel to a movie that really didn't need him, even if it was five years old, it was late. .
