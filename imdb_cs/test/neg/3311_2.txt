The only reason somebody remembers this smoking load of excrement is that Pink Floyd scored him. (Or as they were then known, "The Pink Floyd".) Stefan, a really annoying tracker, Eurotrash, joins the American model Estelle and gets into the high and naked throughout the movie. is what exactly? That drugs are bad? Or just heroin (horse) is? The problem is that you don't talk about characters, so Pink Floyd wasn't at his best. When Steffan overdoses at the end, you're almost glad to get rid of him because he was so uncomfortable.
