This is a cheap movie! The stripper is still attacked and raped by zombies and nobody believes her. She goes to the police who also rapes her. Finally he finds a child who has also been attacked by zombies and is watching the zombies back to 'The Zombie Master'. The fact that Stephanie Beaton plays as a stripper is the only reason to watch this movie.
