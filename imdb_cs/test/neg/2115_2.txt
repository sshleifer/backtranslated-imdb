Will Spanner (David Byrnes, fifth actor who plays the role in the show) encounters another bizarre case, this time about vampires rather than the usual witches, warriors and demons (he's in the hospital to check his friend's son who was injured) . in hit and run when the bike girl who was attacked by vamp in). It brings Detective Lutz to help with a case that revolves around a secret vampire organization trying to get a business merger to allow them to legally own all the blood banks in the world or some such nonsense. The story of this film takes a great deal of back seat on nudity and simulated sex scenes. (As expected from this series, I think). So to complain about the lack of good action, or the convincing storyline, or even convincing characters, I think they would fall on deaf ears. If you look at this movie, you don't care about such a "frivolity" and you just want "action". Unfortunately, the film fails. All women are pretty attractive, but the way the scenes are shot is just cruel. This is more or less futility exercises in every conceivable way. Eye Candy: Both Kimberly Blair and April Breneman show everything; Ashlie Rhey shows a full queue; Aline Kassman and Mai-Lis Holmes are just showing their breasts <br /> <br /> My class: D
