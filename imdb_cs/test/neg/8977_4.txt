Deep Sea 3D is a stunning glimpse into the underwater world, with only a few of them able to see firsthand. <br /> <br /> In the opening sequence, when the wave rushes towards the audience, which is currently engulfing us in the ocean, the filmmakers take full advantage of the IMAX format. The gelatinous fish field seems to fill the whole theater, the power of sharks towards us, and the predators plunge from behind the rocks and devour their prey. It's beautifully captured under the sea clock for the eyes. Our ears on the other hand are not treated the same way. The film tells Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sounds are so ridiculous that they positively spoil the enjoyment of the visuals. Depp sounds somewhat bored while Winslet sounds like reading a fairy tale in an idiot village. I was shocked that the actress of her condition could have so badly built her performance. The script is quite stupid and contains very little depth. The soundtrack is full of strange, unrealistic sound effects that I suppose are supposed to be funny, but in fact distract from the material to be allowed to speak for itself. Danny Elfman has provided an excellent score that provides a lot of impact on the ups and downs of life under the sea, where it is allowed to play without stupid bubble sounds or peat hookers that make the pepper film. The film is a technical miracle, but it cannot be taken seriously with a childish script, annoying narration, and faulty sound effects.
