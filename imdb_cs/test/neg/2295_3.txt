This Swedish splash film is trying to parody / imitate American horror movies like "The Evil Dead", "Gremlins" and more. Writer / director / actor / cameraman Anders Jacobsson and writer / producer / actor / make-up supervisor Göran Lundström (something missing?) Was apparently inspired by Sam Raimi. However, working with the camera is a bad copy of what is seen in "The Evil Dead" and elsewhere. Some other users wrote that they liked the humor of this movie, but I didn't. The film is somewhat disturbed than I enjoyed it. He tries to combine tension and comedy, and the end product left me with a sense of oppression, though it wasn't scary or shocking at all. The combination of different genre elements made this movie very strange. I was never sure if it was to be scary or funny. The story is totally inventive, with the exception of hospital clearing, but I didn't like the reasons outlined above. . Gore & make up effects are pretty good and at least the "Loose Limbs" sequences were pretty fun, because in these scenes film-makers didn't try to blend terror and jokes. <br /> <br /> Everyone in all this weird movie that you either hate or love. Rest in pieces, Evil Ed. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10 (made me stick to American productions)
