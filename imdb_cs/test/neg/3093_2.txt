I was saturated with big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds and the fact that it was an independent film. Incredibly slow start: 35 minutes, two rough songs and choppy rips. I wasn't interested in characters and the story never tried to even pretend it could be realistic. I can't believe this is what it does on the screen. I loved this movie because it was so good when it ended.
