I rented it because I couldn't get a chance to see Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones in front of Hollywood glory, but it's definitely not worth it. The only reason I give him two stars, instead of being something, is a novelty when we see them before they cross the pond. Zeta Jones, who is usually entertaining, though not the biggest thesp in the world, is terrible. Owen seems to be really uncomfortable being in such a turkey, and wearing an absurd, incredibly bad-fitting chin wig (at least I hope it's a wig and not his real hair). And the scene where country jig dances with Zeta Jones is bothering you. Joan Plowright walks in the daze's entire movie - it's probably wondering how she got into such a mess. The actress who plays Clive Owen's wife isn't terrible, but she's all about it. Oh, and writing is also stinking.
