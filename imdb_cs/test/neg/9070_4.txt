Attractive husband and wife writing team Robert Wagner (as Joel Gregory) and Kate Jackson (as Donna Gregory) arrive at the haunted seat of actress "Lorna Love" (actually, the silent movie star Harold Lloyd House). Mr. Wagner and Mrs. Jackson have a contract to write a biography of a German movie star. Wagner has a personal interest in the project because his father was once a famous star lover. Mysterious events are emerging, and Jackson must fight to save his husband from the spirit of a beautiful blonde who is "perfectly preserved" in the crypt of the estate; in addition, the evil woman seems to have her husband in her possession and murder Jackson! It is a "Night of Dark Shadows" version of Kate Jackson's original Dark Shadows graduate who knows and plays her role. Robert Wagner lacks the strength of David Selby. Sylvia Sidney (as Mrs. Josephs) bypasses Grayson Hall. Marianna Hill is not a match for Laru Parker (or Diana Millay). Bill Macy (as Oscar Payne) is good at the part played by John Karlen (produced by Dan Curtis). Joan Blondell, John Carradine and Dorothy Lamour have smooth portraits. . Mrs. Lamour's delivery resembles Joan Bennett, who asks: why did producer Aaron Spelling not get more of his regular regular "Dark Shadows"? <br /> <br /> Director E.W. Swackhamer was the husband of Bridget Hanley; he worked with Mrs. Blondell on "Here Come the Brides" and with Jackson on "The Rookies". "Death in Love House" has, probably, a stricter plot than the "Dark Shadow Night" movie; varies at the angle of the movie star; and, in his "eternal fire of the father" ending, that more closely resembles the TVseries "Laura Phoenix" storyline. **** Death in the House of Love (9/3/76) E.W. Swackhamer ~ Robert Wagner, Kate Jackson, Sylvia Sidney
