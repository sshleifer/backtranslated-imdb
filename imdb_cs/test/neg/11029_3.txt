This film does not have a clear picture of what it is or wants to be. There are some good pieces when Stewart is on the screen and give him some lines to work. He works best as a romantic comedy, but the story is still moving towards a more dramatic territory and disappearing in the process. In the last fifteen minutes, the plot has been a series of dramatic clich√©s. The aircraft part feels like some residual footage from another movie in which it appears. The main reason I think to watch them is if you want to be able to say You've seen all of Jimmy Stewart's movies.
