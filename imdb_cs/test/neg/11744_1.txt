Not just why? "What did they think?" This must be some kind of return on Gus Van Sant because it is one of those special movies <br /> <br /> that should never be (re) made. This is supposed to be a Hitchcocks movie <br /> <br /> frame after frame but no spell or tension or big movie <br /> <br /> to do. Instead of renting an original instead of yourself.
