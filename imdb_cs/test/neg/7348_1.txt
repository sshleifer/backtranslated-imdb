I've always hated this retarded show. I liked Cartoon Network as "Dexter's Lab" or "Megas XLR. But I never liked this piece. Basically because it has stupid characters (good or villains seem mentally retarded) have silly voices (especially Bubbles. it be a "cute" character show, but it is incredibly annoying), story lines are very, very silly, some episodes could be interesting, but almost always the show has not changed to childish and oblique, there was no likeable character, the music was horrible and the animation is The worst thing I've seen, Evena's five-year-old boy could draw better! "The Powerpuff Girls" seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever, fortunately "Foster Home for imaginary friends" from the same creator was far better.
