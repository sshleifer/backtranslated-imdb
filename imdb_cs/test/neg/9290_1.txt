To paraphrase the comments of a previous reviewer if you are a Stooges fan, avoid this at all costs! My basic question is that they are experienced comedy soldiers who were Moe and Larry, why they insisted on trying to continue the law when it was so obvious that their Columbia home studio was not so interested in giving them serious writers and veterans comedy directors? This movie plays as someone who gives a pale imitation trio and you can see how much hard Moe and Larry are working on making every little bit of grotesque relevant. Despite his background in vaudeville, Joe De Rita is simply not working to replace Curly, Shemp, or even Joe Besser. If it were what Moe and Larry had chosen, they should just close the shop and enjoy retirement. We will leave our fans with better memories of the much better films they have previously made. Always let them laugh is a motto for comedy and always stop when you're on top. Since then, Seinfeld has left the sitcom, but up there instead of sticking to the inevitable decline.
