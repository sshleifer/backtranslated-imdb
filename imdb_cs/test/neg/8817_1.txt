(This review does not necessarily reveal the plot of the film, but it can change its expectations, thus contributing to a less enjoyable experience.) Did this howl in laughter on every stupid turn of the plot? This film had so many opportunities to impress and truly scare the viewer. He was badly cut and too much; It seems that references to the past are more of a reason why the plot is going in its particular direction. Writers were not allowed to think about how a potentially excellent land should be made, because the poor design of time across the plot is discouraging the viewer and the film is becoming more and more difficult to watch. Almost worse than writers who abused what might have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that they were gradually relying on cheap tactics for fear. Acting wasn't scary and the situation hardly scary, so a few dark scenes with things that jumped on you were needed to be worth it. Even they were predictable. Even gore couldn't save the conspiracy, not the gore rivals the successful Se7en thriller. Speaking of Se7en, I feel that Saw was trying to follow the incredibly fascinating psychological theme of Se7en, but he failed miserably. I was terribly disappointed by the lack of analysis and the conspiratorial structure surrounding the killer's psychology. Initial scenes irritate the viewer to think he is a psychological thriller; Believe me, it's far from it. Oh, did I mention bad acting? At first, Cary Elwes seems to be a compelling performance; however, this completely deteriorates at the most important parts of the plot. In this performance, which is worthy of Razzie, I remained in tears of laughter. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and too fictional, though not as bad as the Elwes performance, and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a film writer. The end of Saw has never been able to compensate for the loss of the whole center and that is what makes it a huge failure. It was a missed opportunity and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover have decided on roles in this film. I'm angry with myself for wasting my money on renting it. Definitely not worth $ 4, and in the future I will certainly not deal with anything to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that she lacks the foundation for his conspiracy, is that the great potential plot was fired and the bad deal added insult to the injury. I will avoid bad puns that relate to the title, and I'll just quit: don't watch this movie.
