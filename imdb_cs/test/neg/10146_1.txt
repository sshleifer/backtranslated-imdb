In my opinion this movie the whole video part of this movie was an absolute waste !!!! However, the soundtrack that was used contained the music of the big heavy metal rock band, I identified music as a band called Firstryke and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was very well written !! And I wonder what the rest of the movie enthusiasts think about it if you recall welcoming feedback, collecting old movie, and obscure movie footprints. It's a very time-consuming hobby, but it's very beneficial. I saw this band sold in Germany on the net for about fifty dollars per album. Isn't it bad Hugh?
