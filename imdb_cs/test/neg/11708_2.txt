I realize that the period piece is expensive, and that this filming style (close-up camera shots, moving camera, wide-angle shots, scrubbed images) allows these movies to be made at a price. As a style, it has advantages and disadvantages like any other, allowing multiple periods of pieces to be made. Like any other style, it has its critics and supporters - there are probably those who believe that this type of filming has an artistic basis. <br /> <br /> If only some money could be saved on the script, the film needs to write well and perform well for any style. The game in this movie is usually very good. Writing less. It consists of a collection of bits taken from the book and much that is relevant to the plot is omitted to create a discontinuous set of scenes with little or no continuity. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should you read the book if you have read it. If you haven't read the book, are easily pleased and have nothing better to do, it's not watching the attention, but be prepared to be disappointed. It could have been a lot better.
