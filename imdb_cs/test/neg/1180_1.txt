What is a waste of time to watch this movie. Poor picture quality, bad sound, bad behavior and definitely not based on real facts. The "girlfriend" deputy did so much as a sheriff that it was more comedy than horror. The MP is trying to dial an emergency phone call by dialing 911 ... THE PROBLEM ... in 1957 this emergency number did not exist. This is just one example of glaring irregularities. The "haunted" aspect was the way he was underestimated. I just didn't come across as terrible. I thought Gein's actor was doing the most admiring actor in the whole movie. I could see mental disorders in his character. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry ... it just won't get it !!
