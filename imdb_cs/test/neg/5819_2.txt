This show has no sense at all. Every week, two ladies go to real estate doing some gardening, and every week without failure, they somehow encounter a murder. Because anyone who owns a large house with a large garden is involved in the murder, right? But even if they came across murder after some murder, wouldn't it be smart to tell the police? You know, people who can do something about it ... But every week these two fools get around, pollute evidence, commit their own crimes, and in some cases cause more murders. Once the murders have miraculously resolved, the killer can never be convicted. All the evidence was sabotaged. And you think people who cover murders shouldn't think they should hire these two, do they? Yay! We solved the murder! Like every other week, let's face the killer alone and tell them without any advance that we know about it. It's not possible to get into any danger, is it? Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst shows on TV and certainly the worst.
