"Eaten Alive" is much easier than "Cannibal Holocaust Ruggero Deodato", but it's also a much stronger movie. I mean, sometimes it can be unintentionally cheerful, but the conspiracy is so insensitive that it wasn't possible for me not to lose all my patience to the end. The tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) teamed up with Janet Agren (the Gate of Hell, here with an unbearable accent) to search for the New Guinea jungle for sister Agrena, who was washed out by the brain leader of religious cult (Ivan Rassimov). Along the way, they fall to testify (sometimes real) animal torture and some kitsch provided cannibalism. According to director Umberto Lenzi, the film is so overworked that it's hard to take it seriously, but if you like a movie theater with more than a few unintentional laughs, it's not bad. <br/> <br/> 4/10
