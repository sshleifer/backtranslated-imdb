This was a mish mash of a movie that began to go nowhere, lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title title is finally introduced. There were so many ugly, mutton pieces in this movie, I lost track of who was the owner and who were the guards. But I have a casting theory; all the militants played ugly actors (and one ugly actress) and all the good guys / victims played beautiful actors. Indeed, the actors who played the ultimate sacrifices, slaves, were beautiful, just like the daughter of an innocent priest, while the plantation owner, his mini-lover, and his guards were all quite claiming. On purpose? You call. I hung up there until the end and some others could do it. If you just want to look at bare breasts, there are plenty of them and if you have a slave / master fetish, then you will love this movie. Otherwise, watch it once, vomit, shower, and never tell anyone about it.
