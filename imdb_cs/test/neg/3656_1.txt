My first thought of reading the back of the box was that it was probably Saw 2 knocking. I couldn't be further from the truth. It seemed to me that someone with a downsyndrome from a camera phone and $ 10.00 and told them to make a movie. The story did not exist, nor did acting. It was almost like watching a silent film about growing grass. It didn't surprise me at all when I found out that the whole movie was "improvised". By the end of this "movie" I lost the will to live and maybe I just got AIDS from the point of view of this piece of crap. It was about 70 minutes I could spend something that was less painful. Like jumping out of a building.
