Man, really? Did you read the book or watch this movie? Well, if you did, let me warn you, it's false. Mark Furhman was looking for a job because he lost his job with LAPD. You remember him, don't you? He was the guy who lied at the booth and gave the defense of OJ Simpson the support they were looking for. Since then he has written three books. I read all three. No, I'm not a fan, they got me. However, I will tell you one similarity in all three, grossly disturbing the meaning of Mark Furhman. He blatantly exaggerated his character in all three. In the movie "Murder in Spokane" he pretends to have had something to do with killer hunting when he had nothing to do with it. In all the books, he is very pleased to have reduced local law enforcement efforts. Something like his efforts was exhausted in the trial. In this movie, there is plenty of footage of slow motion ladies looking at Furhman and lust for him. Many other shots are at the center of his mind when I am really convinced that the only thing that people were thinking at the time was "hey, isn't that the racist that caused the Office to run?" This was an interesting real life story, but not a good movie about it.
