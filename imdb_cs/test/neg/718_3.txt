This film was recommended by some academics. I had quite noble expectations from their comments. But this film was nothing but disappointment. The director's goal is obvious - to use the interlocking of speeches / poems as a way to defend Bush's doctrine. But the director fails. I also seriously question the director's choice of the main character. It's an ass that is definitely not worthy of hearing. The Rise of Corporate Power, So What? Most importantly, this film gains a failed score in its compelling power; it is clearly intended for those who have already formed their opinions. It is true that the aesthetics of the film is quite pleasant. But almost everything else in the movie sucks.
