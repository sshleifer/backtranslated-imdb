I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I watched this show when she appeared on A&E a few years ago. The show was strange to say the least, but I gave her a chance because I liked these actresses. This must be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I'm not going to follow it again, and I'm sure I'm not losing money to buy a video. The story of this TV version is ridiculous and just stupid! "Kicker" (pun) comes when Ruth operates on the leg bones. Such nonsense is one of James Bond's films and Sci-Fi. If this version is faithful to the book, then I will not check the book from my local library! The American version came out a few years after I saw this original. To my surprise, this time the Americans got it because their version with Meryl Streep and Roseanne is played for laughter and is rather funny. The story is laughing while playing.
