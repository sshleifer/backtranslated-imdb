This is probably the worst of Ava Gardner's main films. Yes, it's beautiful. But it can wear thin over time, especially after the corny and predictable end of the movie. In this Turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend to be Eddie Bracken (which has certainly embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays Jane Powell (golly, gee) part. Dick Haymes plays a sidekick (!) And Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a number of other wise female comedians). Yes, the movie contains the main popular song "Speak Low". But look at other, completely forgotten pieces. Of course, Dick Haymes sings very well, as well as the uncredited voice singer for Avu. The sets are cheap, the script is full of clich√©s and humor has failed and Tom Conway looks like he has been fighting with alcohol (just like him). In short, if you want to see Avu at her best, buy a photo and stay calm with this movie.
