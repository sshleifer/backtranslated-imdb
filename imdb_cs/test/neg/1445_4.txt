I rented this movie for the first time on September 11, 2001, an infamous day. My only complaint is that it's too short. "Strangeland" would be a complete work of horror after two hours. As it stands, running time is only an hour and a half. He plays Carleton Hendricks, a crazy sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and love for near death experiences. Hendricks is no pushover, he is pumped six-foot "modern primitive". Someone who tattooed and pierced their body to the limit. When she first appears in the movie, it's a really scary look. Hendrick's main interest in life is to share his "spiritual awakening" with his kidnapped victims. He visits an internet chat room called "Captain Howdy" and then invites people to his home. They believe they go to party. Instead, they find themselves in the house of pain and suffering. Hendrick sow eyes and mouth and torture them by sticking blades and hooks in many parts of the body. If it sounds bad, it's because it is. One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve, the teenage daughter of detective Michael Gage. Gage can not only save her, but also arrest Hendricky. Four years later, Hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to community disapproval. Rednecks led by Freddy Krueger, actor Robert Englund, decides to kill him. They can't do it and Hendricks goes back to his old one. Except for Sniper, acting is not very good, but it is usable. Also, the direction is fine. There are some funny parts in "Strangeland" and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack, it's amazing and worth buying if you love rock. Overall, it's a movie that's worth watching. If you like low-budget horror movies with a sense of humor, check it out. You might like it.
