Obviously, the comments on the fact that she is swimming through the film is done by someone who is on the crew. I don't remember ever seeing a film that is more offensive to talented actors or viewers watching. In my 30 years of watching movies, it's the only thing I've ever left. Bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad conspiracy, etc. <br /> <br /> Note to the producer: It's never fun to hunt people on a race basis. Great that you tried to be politically correct by including all the races, but you still hunted people based on race, and that's scary.
