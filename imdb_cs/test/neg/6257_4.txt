"Based on the joke that Jim Wynorski once said" ... that's what I read at the end of my final credits. Well, Mr. Wynorski must then have a terrible sense of humor! This movie is really awful. I loved the first two chapters of the Massacre Party; The third film was totally useless but completely observable in comparison with this piece of crap! There is no killer killer and storyline, acting, characters, places, events ... everything is boring, absurd and ridiculous. The only good reason to watch this turkey are the girls: if this movie was porn, I think it would work much better! The film also doesn't have gore: the first scene (the one in the tent) could be more bloody and the scene with a headless guy knocking on the door lasted one second! Some moments of mild excitement cannot save a non-existent graph. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him the only bearable character in this movie! Oh ... there's a nonsense part with Brink Stevens playing "Linda" in the first slumber party massacre: the police bothered her to know more about the killer; but what we get is just a few shots from the first movie! It is not a dialogue, not a monologue, nor anything from this still traumatized adult girl who is forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says) and gives us no trace of the killer at all! > <br /> Watch at your own risk.
