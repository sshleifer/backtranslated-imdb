Terribly disappointed CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD. Lost is an exciting and unpredictable story, and instead of it, the lack of predictability with obvious attempts to manipulate viewers is a superficial, demanding production and distribution team. This story ended with the feeling that it was a thoughtful soap opera, rather than a bold indie feature that should be. This is what happens when distributors try to find a wider audience (ridiculous shots from the coast of Rio, etc.) at the expense of grabbing the story and the characters. I really didn't care about what happened to any character in this movie - they were so 2-dimensional. In short, the sad waste of potential that was supposed to be slam-dunk after the extraordinarily inspired City of God. Boo!
