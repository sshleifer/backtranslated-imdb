This film contains cockroaches as super body killers. This may have been the first film where cockroaches were primary killers, though not the first film where cockroaches are murderers. "Damning Alley" featured a scene with killer cockroaches and "Creepshow" had a story he had. There's a star in this. Not as good as he could be who doesn't have everything he kills in them. But I could be wrong about this point because I haven't seen it for some time. The cockroaches are a murderer, and this very strange research lady is in town to study. Yes, it is quite strange because in one place she has a hand in a killer cockroach box and she is like "They are biting my hand" and says it almost in ecstasy. At the end of this is also one super big crane, as in many films against insects. It's not a great movie, but it's worth a look at the night when you're bored of your mind.
