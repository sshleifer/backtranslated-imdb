This is a movie's waste, it looked really funny for previews, but I wasn't allowed to once through the entire movie. Do a big favor and don't waste your money on it, don't waste money on it. I gave her 1/10, believe me, if I could. I'm a 15 year old boy and I thought it was a waste to see a good movie and see how Jay and Silent Bob hit.
