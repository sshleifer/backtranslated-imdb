I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I watched a movie, but with Today You Die, I feel like it is a criminal waste of my time. So here's a five minute rant about how bad this movie is. In the mid-1980s, there was a time when one look from Steven Seagal was enough to break your ribs; full of frown could knock you down. If you did, he would deceive you like a twig. These days, although he is still able to do considerable damage, he is no longer looking at the piece. She's gone to seed and she just doesn't know when to call it. He walks as if he was thrown into his pants, but he still manages to look like a constipation, and he put on weight. His long long tail is gone, but his hair still seems silly. As this man still works in the film industry, he's out of me. Today you will die, it is usual Seagal a mixture of bone crispy fights, car accidents, weapons and pyrotechnics. Seagal mumbles his way through the blunt scenario, delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or credibility. In the third course, Harlan Banks, a thief who tries to go straight, is involved in a $ 20,000,000 robbery. He gets caught, goes to jail, escapes and seeks revenge. Yawning. There are some pretty good car chases and fighting with guns that break down boring stuff (of which there is a lot), but reading more comments about IMDb has shown that these were actually borrowed from other better movies. Seagal is also a double-powerful body. Seagal turns in one of the most horrific performances of his career? And it says something, considering the lousy "playing" in some of his recent efforts. The funniest is his utterly embarrassing attempt at Ebonics (African American street slang). "I'm a man, for 'sho' 'no, actually Steven, you sound like ass! With a ridiculous scenario and conspiracy lines that go nowhere, this film is a waste of time, money, and effort. And the last moment Harlan Banks rescues the children's home from closing is enough to get you kicked out. Damn, I just looked at the clock. I enjoyed trying to confuse this pile of dreck so much, I walked for five minutes. It's time to send this comment and see something decent.
