THE QUICKIE (1 outta 5 stars) Pretty poor movie ... old story about a tall gangster who wants to stop giving his empire to his underage son. Of course, it will not be easy for someone in this line or working just to end ... so the contract is unloaded for his life. After throwing a big side into the exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, whom I believe will never act in anything other than TV movies or a low budget on video), she is called to the scene. Our "hero" is impersonating her ... offering his big money for "quick" but refusing his offer, even if he needs money ... but also overnight he was brutally persecuted by an exaggerated son who thinks he was sent to kill his father. Ugh. The story goes on and on ... you can see every "twist" and "turn" for a mile away. The strange soundtrack of any band called "The Tiger Lillies" will drive most people nuts ... but I thought there was one kind of cool track to the end. Or maybe I was just thrilled because I could say the movie was almost over? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what the hell happened to you?
