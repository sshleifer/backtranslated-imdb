If the League of Unknowns would have guessed this scenario, the backers would simply turn around and say "no - you don't have the money - that's awful". As a League League fan, it's their poorest trip to date. It's not particularly funny, not particularly fun, there is little laughter out loud. They exist, but they are few and far between. I felt the format was tired and really pulling. The film refers to writers who are bored of characters and shows. As for the movie. I felt that the Christmas special has a better production value; FX is generally quite poor and it is clearly obvious that they did not film in the original Royston Vasey (they filmed this on cheap in Ireland). The musical score is weak and dialogue is terrible. Also, the accents of the characters were largely away from their television equivalents. Tubs and Edward, too little (again) just don't sound like them. Disappointment really because I was hoping something much more fun. This was a league that was the equivalent of the 70's comedies when he cast in Spain ...
