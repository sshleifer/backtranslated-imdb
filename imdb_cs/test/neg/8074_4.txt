The movie was a pleasure to watch if you were a Stooges fan. The story is told from the perspective of Moe Howard and his relationship with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also a lifelong friendship with Larry Fine. The film mainly deals with high-point cameras and Stooges falls for decades of career. The casting director and make-up artist deserved a good job in finding actors who resembled a famous ensemble. The actor who plays "Curly" Howard has done a great job of portraying Stooge's favorite Stooge on camera. Must see three Stooges shorts for every fan.
