One of the few reasons these pointlss movies are made is to give some actors a chance to play in better movies if they do well. The only good thing in this movie is acting, three female leaders are better than most of these horror movies. There are 2 scenes that can cause an unexpected jump. Small children are used to walk through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines. When one collapses and causes the cave to die in all the children, it becomes a zombie. Adults in the mine remain dead, there are no reasons why children become those who become flesh. When they are still alive, they looked scary in front of the cave, innocent, so they must be angry at all the adults who exploited them in the mines (just the reason that comes to mind). Mother and her two daughters move to a house near the mine, along with a land devoloper who wants to build a resort and another of those scary people who know exactly what's going on, but no one trusts him. Nothing new, you're used to clich√©, predictable, a lot of negative for this movie, very little positives.
