I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie. That's something I haven't done since then - I've never slept in movies. <br /> <br /> I love the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone. This may be a problem, but I don't think it because there were a few bright spots that showed up if done correctly that could make this movie work. Bette was under used and Anne ended up used and miscast. <br /> <br /> I don't know why he let it go in this state. <br /> <br /> Billed it as city sex, but better? It is not a chance that I liked Sex in the City very much and this film disappointed me. So don't waste your money on this movie - look at everything, but this one!
