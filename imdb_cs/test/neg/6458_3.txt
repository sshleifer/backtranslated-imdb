Buddy Ackerman's role is not for Kevin Spacey. Played version of this character many times, better movies. This is lucky because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all the other characters in this absurd little farce. The script leaves little time to develop fences or characters, reminiscent of a porn movie in a hurry to get to "good things". The difference is that "good things" aren't people who are pleased with each other, but cause pain, which is good for young adults. Of course there is nothing wrong with pornographic film if you want to watch people who have sex and I think there's nothing wrong with "swimming with sharks" if you want to watch people going through physical, emotional and psychological torture. But if you are looking for intense satire, interesting characters or anything else that tries to engage more than your most basic passions, you should probably look elsewhere.
