If there is no huge ironic plot, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this film; I can't believe this movie was even released, it's so bad. I admit that it's not my kind of movie, but I tried to pursue it equally objectively, you know, so bad, it's funny and was still insulted by its utter horror. Acting is terrible, they couldn't watch the rush and I guess one scene was one, that's really so awful. It's the worst movie I've seen in many years, in fact I wouldn't call it a movie, it's a tragedy. A gay black friend nobody says "gay" is just implied because he's so crazy? Homophobic. This is not good, in fact it is a direct vomiting. Jokes die on their poor asses, music is so bad that it defies faith. Essentially, the person who assembled the soundtrack chose the most serious songs they had ever heard and heard so far and put it in this film material waste. O my good Christ, I cannot believe that the 1980s brought such a waste, I grew through them and I can't find the one thing worth mentioning, it must have been a dark time to be a visitor to the cinema. /> <br /> If you even think about watching this movie, look at a psychiatrist.
