After simply watching the movie, I have to say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is my worst price for the Komodo movie, which is not easy. It is neither a porn nor a legitimate film and gives them both a bad name. Playing, working with the camera, plotting, script and sound are terrible. My favorite part of the movie is a duck asking the bartender if she has any grapes. Why was there such a joke in the movie? Did the director think? "I need a witty scene to compensate for great acting, so I'll use some lame butt of the joke I've read on Laffy Taffy's cover." Another retarded part is when Norman poured an invisible potion on himself as he tried to keep him from spilling. Why did they even bother to get the NC-17 rating for the film if they hoped to have as many viewers as possible? At least if it were rated X, it would be more sexual, so viewers would focus on overall low quality. I pray for someone who worked on this drizzle by wasting a quick response.
