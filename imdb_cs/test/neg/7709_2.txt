OK this movie was much worse than the first one and the first one! Zombies make up very fake! Behavior is very bad! And it doesn't really follow after the first! While watching, I still thought the first was a masterpiece compared to that. I'd say I'll catch it on TV, don't spend your money on it! It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but its list. I started watching him last night and fell asleep so I watched him today and almost fell asleep! The storyline was useless, I think I have the fact that a small military group is sent on a mission to get the blood of the zombies and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop the zombies, but they did it where you wanted it that everyone would die. They did a lot of bad guys who were really just uncomfortable. If you asked me, it was going to lose a resident evil and not a good blow. The story would do it if the acting was good and if you really felt scared when you saw what was around the corner. With these zombies my grandmother could go to that building and survive! from 1-10 I put 2.
