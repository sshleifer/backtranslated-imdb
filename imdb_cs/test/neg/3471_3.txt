"Imperium Nero" is the second film from a series of six productions entitled "Imperium". I've already commented unfavorably on the first: "Imperium Augustus". This second television movie produced and aired last weekend by the Italian state network has the same defects. In addition, it contains a significant amount of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child and Agrippina tells him "Nero, Nero". At that time his name was Claudius. Nero was named after his admission. Nero did not meet the Act when he was young in the film, but after his marriage to Octavia and his nomination to the Emperor. When his sons who are not adults become his emperor: Britannicus is one month old and Octavia one year old. And many others. If you like ancient Roman history, you can find more examples. The "Imperium" series will continue with four other films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantinus" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire". Finally!
