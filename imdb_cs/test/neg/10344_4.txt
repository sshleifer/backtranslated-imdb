Corben Bernsen directed a horror movie about a chemical weapon that was released in a sports event and turned everyone into mad monsters. We watch employees report on the radio station. But his moments are mainly what he plays as a lifelong horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas, but they just don't work. Actually, film ideas are better handled in Pontypool, which works to the end and creates tension by showing us nothing. That shows us things and it's just cheap. Given the choice, I'd rather look at Pontypool than the movie.
