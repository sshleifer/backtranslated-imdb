A pretty twisted horror movie that has a few good moments here and there, with some haunted scenes of blood transfusion, but it's just too boring for your own good. All the characters are fine and the story, which has great potential, is somewhat boring, but the blood transfusion scenes seemed horribly real and therefore very worrying. It's well done and decently written, and it started really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up, and I found the end to be disappointing. Linnea Quigley has no such small role in this case, I was also disappointed, and Stephen Knight has a good job as a leader because he was pretty twisted and I got it in a DVD Horror set called Evil Taste, along with lots of other horror movies. There's a lot of blood, but that's not all that is tame, and because it's a low budget, it was pretty good, but as I said, it just couldn't keep the interest. This is a pretty twisted horror movie that has a few good moments here and there, with some scary blood transfusion scenes, but it's just too boring for your own good, I'd go, but I think it's worth watching if you have nothing better to do. The direction is fine. Elly Kenner and Norman Thaddeus Vane are doing a decent work with the camera and doing a good job on their low budget, but the pace is too inconsistent for my opinion. Acting is actually fine. Stephen Knight is great as a leader, was haunted, twisted, sick and gave a very fearsome performance. Linnea Quigley performed well in a small role. Christopher McDonald is fine. The rest of the cast is also fine. Overall, I would go, but I think it's worth watching if you have nothing better to do. * 1/2 of 5
