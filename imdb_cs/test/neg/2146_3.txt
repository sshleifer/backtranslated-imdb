After a little over 50 years of passionate watching, I came up with some simple rules for making good movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Introduce your main characters early, certainly within the first half hour 2. Keep your characters to a minimum. If you are adapting a novel, combine the characteristics and actions of small characters into one person. 3. Make sure the actions of your characters are credible; if necessary, create additional scenes to create motivation. Violence may not be explicit, but it must not be confusing, either 5. Get the best music money you can buy. Often it matters more than acting, photography, etc. 6. Usually, when the film is not very good in the first 10 minutes, it won't be better. "Cannon for Cordoba" textbooks an example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the worst I've ever heard in a modest budget movie. This is surprising when we consider Bernstein's credentials ("The Man with the Golden Arm", "The Magnificent Seven", "The Great Escape", "The Sons of Katie Elder"). The direction of Paul Wendkos is bland and confusing. The performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to horrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with most reliable George Peppard falling somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising given the average direction and amateur scenario that violates Rules 1, 2, and 3. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. I gave `Cannon for Cordoba '` 3'.
