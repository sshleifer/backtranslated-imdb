The discussion took place a thousand times. Is the "Merchant of Venice" an anticemic? (I think it is.) Is it not unfair to always point out this little bit of anti-Semitism in an otherwise great work of art? (I don't think so.) Does this game have a Shakespeare reputation as the world's greatest playwright? (I think so.) Does he play a role if he didn't do it on a particular racist purpose? (I don't think so.) \ TMichael Radford knew all of this, and that is why he added a prologue to the film about the deplorable situation of Jews in Renaissance Venice. <br /> <br /> In vain; because the game remains what it has always been, and the new make-up gives only the first (but futile) hope that someone dared to give something right, which is a constant outrage, not because the degree of anti-Semitism was particularly shocking, but because the game comes under the name of William Shakespeare. Why spend so much time portraying human hatred - Shylock? Why employ a great and serious actor like Al Pacino when he eventually destroys everything in this offensive (but hey, I-not-responsible-Shakespeare-wrote-it) courtroom scene. And now I want to be very precise, just like Shylock himself. According to the treaty that - not too responsible - Christian Antonio, who has always sought, demanded the right. to him, signed in full awareness of the consequences. Sure, what Shylock's requirements are cruel and useless, but that's no reason. What we see (or we should see) is a man who has been humiliated all his life, to the point that everything that remains on him is his hatred. I think it's certainly a little inconvenient to recite such a person to things like compassion. But what the game / film (they are one and the same now) does at this point is to become a soap opera! A cruel freak with a knife, a horrified (but somewhat short-sighted) audience, a poor "victim" tied to a chair. It is true that Antonio accepted his destiny, but why can't he say one word, "sorry"? I think we don't have to lose a lot of words about the ridiculous verdict of Pete's young Dottore; it is indeed a "popular verdict" that does not differ from what it would be seen 400 years later in Nazi programs. From one minute to another, this Jew is robbed of everything he possessed, sentenced to baptism by a Christian and fired. Isn't it so disgusting ??? Apparently not. The story goes to the romantic intricacies of the rings and its happy ending. What can be learned at the Jewish Museum in Libeskind in Berlin and similar places around the world is that anti-Semitism often does not observe flesh. because what is so devastating for a minority or some individuals is anchored in the allegedly greater good for the majority. It should be precisely the task of each of us to develop sensitivity to uncover and reveal such tendencies. I do not accept the apology that this film was designed to create empathy with poorly treated Shylock (it just doesn't work). I don't think anyone can be compelled to be merciful. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie; especially not for the Oscar.
