It's hard for a lover of the Northanger Abbey novel to sit in this BBC adaptation and stay away from throwing objects on the TV screen - in fact, if Jane Austen were to see herself, she would be a little amused and maybe driven out. Maggie Wadey's adaptation made Northanger Abbey in what it satirized, a Gothic novel (and readers of Gothic novels). The role of Catherine Morland in adaptation is portrayed quite close to Catherine Austen, an open-minded, generous girl whose imagination just runs away with her. But Henry Tilney is not a proud driver who behaves like a juggler who acts like a cane, he is a clever, clever hero of the gothic novel - he is a joker, an almost handsome man with a mess and lively (that's true, Henry Tilney is a spiritual , a spell that is totally omitted from the script Some of the best scenes from the novel when Henry, completely dead, outrageous teasing literally minded Catherine on diction, journals, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., They are not displayed, much of Henry's personality is lost When these scenes are not adapted.In addition, Peter Firth's appearance is not exact-Henry Tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25, dark hair and brown leather, not 35 or 40 and blonde. <br /> <br /> There are many other absurdities in as part of the adaptation that provokes surprise and resistance - who is Marionka and what does she do in the story? Why is John Thorpe less fool and more schemer? Why is Northanger Abbey Castle? Well, with her romantic visions, she expects hidden corridors and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to find that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable, modern house - another element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as a drunk? Why does Catherine have those strange visions of Mrs. Allen who squeak her finger? Catherine's imagination just runs off with her at Northanger, with Henry there to fix her gently. Finally, why have so many facts about the Tilney family and Mrs. Tilney's death changed in vain? To make the story horrible? All these peculiarities and more simply are too strange to overlook. <br /> <br />>
