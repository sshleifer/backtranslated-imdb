This movie is interesting for fans of the famous rock band "The Band" in that singer / keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes. It seems to me that the film could have been shot 75 years ago, judging by Richard's views. Interestingly, Jones would later deal with the Levon band in a significantly better film "Coal Miner Daughter". By the way, you really need a special reason to survive this heavy film, Art. Unfortunately, the super-sensitive Manuel would commit suicide. I've never heard him end up in a movie. Four of the five band members would appear in another bad movie "Man Outside".
