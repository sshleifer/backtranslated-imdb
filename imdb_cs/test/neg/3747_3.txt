Sorry, but I usually like French thrillers - like Chabrol - but this was a shabby clutter. The fact that it was based on Harlan Cohen's book tells because, rather than a French film (strong on psychology and character), it's more like a John Grisham-esquire ride on roller coaster numbers with ridiculous plotting, flashbacks, updating previous flashbacks, predictable a villain (once he mentions his name, you think it's stupid, he'll be a bad guy!) and a set of mysterious stereotypical characters who seem to occupy different movies. To the end, I laughed hysterically at the inequality of the film's tone (scenes where two shadows are shadow leaders who are shadowy characters, unintentionally cheerful), utterly confused conspiracy, absurd coincidences and strokes of happiness ) and yawning uncontrollably (I thought I had to distort 1h 50min run as it seemed to stretch for 3 hours 50 minutes).
