This is a children's television series about Mary-Sue, which is both average and biting. I couldn't bring my self to sit in 3 Zoey101 episodes. Not to mention that Jamie Lynn Spears can't save her life! What message does this show bring to children? If you are not perfect as Zoey, you are unworthy of * rollseyes *. It is absurd that Zoey's character is exactly the kind of person who would be despised in real life, yet he can become so popular. Then there's Chase, who is basically a loving puppy who worships Zoey's country. Then there is the fact that all the other characters seemed disgusted to prevent them from overshadowing Zoey. I'm sorry, but the characterization in this show = extremely unrealistic.
