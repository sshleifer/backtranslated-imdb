Both Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 stunk, but the first was better. Special effects in this movie were not strange at all. Though in this installment the killings were better, they were not about anything they could boast of. One thing that was worse in Part 2 was the characters. Suddenly they changed emotions and some of their lines were just stupid. For example, he cited one character: "You should have some R.E.S.P.E.C.T. or find out what it means to me." I once heard that I found out that it was the worst I've ever heard. Another thing I hated about this movie was the fact that it was too short. A successful movie must go more than one hour and twenty minutes, as well as Killjoy 2. If Full Moon does part 3 of Killjoy, which would bend to the lowest possible level. Total 1 out of 10 <br /> <br />
