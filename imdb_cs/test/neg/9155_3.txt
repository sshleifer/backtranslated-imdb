Great book, poorly made film. Cheesy performances and fictional situations make this film a sentimental nuda-fest. Flat and uninspired work from most actors will leave this film in the After School Special category. There is no doubt that there are a lot of talent in this cast and crew, but something was wrong. A very talented Gretchen Mol tries to pull this film out of the mud, but even she can't seem to think of a stupid dialogue. They feel as if they're all called. Even make-up (Mulrooney's age of 20 during the film) looks amateurish and brutal. Don't waste your time on this clunker .... go read the book.
