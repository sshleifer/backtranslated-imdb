This is absolutely the worst show in Nickelodeon's history. First, no boarding school has a Sushi Bar, a flat-screen TV and a laptop for every student. This makes the show so unrealistic and boring. The land is nonsensical and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad that they make me take my own life. I really hate the fact that in the show Zoey is the most popular girl in school and the most beautiful and smartest, and gets the best marks without any work. He never has any real problems and everybody wants to give it. He's so perfect. No one is. I also hate everyone doing anything for her, and everyone chooses it for each team or club. It's so annoying. Quinn is so uncomfortable. Her experiments are pathetic, absurd, and false. Chase is such a werewolf. He says he loves Zoey, but if he told her, it would ruin their friendship. How pathetic. Michael tries to be funny, but never reaches anything. Nichole is so energetic and shouts a lot. It is never seen to do any work or study, but it is a direct student. Lola thinks she's an actress, but she pisses off (excuse the language). Do I need to say more? I think not. For your own good, stay away from this show at all costs.
