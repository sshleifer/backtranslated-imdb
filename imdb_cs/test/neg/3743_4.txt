The fact that this film is a good basement quality is a real shame, but back in the 1940s, it was probably the only type of movie made for theaters that provided a black audience for segregation. While MGM, Warner, and all the other big studios are making extremely polished films, small corded studios have been left to confusion with what they have. And when I see this movie, it's clear that there was a lot of energy going into making the movie, even though it's an aesthetically spoken film. Some actors were not particularly good (especially French), the sets were minimal and the story was stupid, but the film also had good music - various styles from classic to jazz to rhythm and blues. This is due to many talented but largely unrecognized Black performers. Now, as far as the plot is concerned, it was totally stupid and stupid, but still awake. I loved when I saw Tim Moore ("Kingfish" from the TV show AMOS N ANDY) in the move, when he made the absolute ugliest woman in the history of cinema (that includes the bride Frankenstein and many others) - this is probably due to the fact that when NOT in Thrust, it was a pretty ugly but funny man. If the man pretends to be a woman, she looked distant as a woman, I doubt this movie would work the same. When he saw this ugly, rubber-faced man with the shabby wig STILL, who was eagerly looking for three suitors, it was pretty funny. It's not a great movie, but from a historical perspective it's fascinating and excellent watching for young adults to know what America is for blacks in this era. Very interesting and fun capsule.
