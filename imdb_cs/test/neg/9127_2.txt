The problem with this type of lyrical filmmaking is that you either make a masterpiece or a lemon: there are few middle countries. Gently speaking, it is not "Berlin - City Symphony" or "Man with Camera". Unfortunately, it's not much to look at, either. The problem with this is that it's glib and half-baked like Michael Moore came on board. In fact, it has nothing to say or rather to show us pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses the images cumulatively to submit a dissertation. This is just a patchwork to find a point. (Although unintentionally, the film tells us more about Uncle Sam's mind than he intended. There is something deeply paradoxical about anti-technology, anti-civilization, an anti-media film that is so deeply filled with technology. ‚Äù Do what I say, and not like me. "You just have to love Yanks, eh.) Tonally, there's something sour and misanthropic about this episode. Both previous episodes had moments of lyricism and exhilaration; this time the tone is consistently glum. It just doesn't work for the duration, as Gustav Mahler tells you. Stylistically, Naqoyqatsi is a mess. Sparkling digital things are especially misleading. It gives the whole thing a completely redesigned, redesigned look and also undermines the "realistic" nature of the analog "found record". (I mean, a pity to guys. Part of the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a tribute to using an optical film. But now the optical film is a historical artifact, it has to "take on" a digital domain, but I Digital things often look like CNN or BBC World.) And with "found footage", well, digital manipulation is often ugly, and usually just silly and fake color, and solarization made me think of ... <br /> <br /> ... ahem ... <br /> <br /> James Bond title sequence. <br /> <br /> Ahem. Strange as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the film was simply stolen by Yo Yo Ma's performance; it's as unobtrusive as Lawrence Olivier's voice. Images would have to be cheerfully convincing to oppose all those charisms. Philip Glass himself is in a special form; he never expected to knock Verdi's prop! (I laughed, which of course is not a desirable response to any part of this movie). There's even one piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe they changed his pills. From our "idle questions" department, Geoffrey Reggio is actually a Hopi Indian? Or did he just dive in the Hollywood Hills? Oh, and are the various pieces of shots from earlier "episodes" in the trilogy commenting on how these films are also part of the global media?
