for me it is not a good TV show, animated or otherwise. however, it is uncomfortable up to n-th. There are several reasons for this, in no particular order. Annoying characters ever, Batmite.this character has no sense of show, whatsoever.maybe it is intended as a comic relief, but it doesn't work that way.next up, Joker.i thought it was really ridiculous to have his character with it loosened with that ridiculous laughter after almost every sentence. all this about repetition. this one is really really fast .. i also don't think that the right actor had the voice of the character just doesn't sound like a joker would have a sound. other than these issues, the show is not that bad. but these are big enough problems to drastically reduce the likability factor.for me, "New Batman Adventures" is at best 3/10.
