I really want Hollywood to come up with new ideas and fast. Instead they go around and again and spoil a perfectly good movie with re-make. This movie is terrible from DeMille. All the way through this movie I thought, Huh ??? - What ???? - I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie was the goodbye of the Red Sea. And in Heston's version - that was a hell of a lot better than this version. Did anyone else see that the atomic atom or nuclear bomb was lost when the Red Sea split? I think I did it. Anyway, I Might - Could - watch the last part tonight. <br /> <br /> I wish Hollywood to solve various ideas and themes when creating new films. Instead of re-hashing old movies. <br /> <br /> They should be left on their own. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: <br /> <br /> I've been following the last part well. Moses made a second copy of the Ten Commandments with his own hand - or I saw things - please someone - email me and let me know. GRAPES
