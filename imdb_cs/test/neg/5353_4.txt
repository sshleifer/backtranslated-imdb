There are other reviews that express similar views, but I still feel compelled to add my comments. The film is generally well made from a technical standpoint, except that it is too long. Acting is usually very good, though Kevin Spacey doesn't have enough space to explain his character's motivation (apparently ambition rather than racism) and Sandra Bullock's only function seems to be a feast for his eyes. At the basic level, the heart of the film is in the right place, contrary to racism, and I think he was trying to build on some definitive treatment of racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it. However, writers seem to have plunged much more than they could chew (I didn't read the book, so I don't know how much Grisham is). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up advocating the vigilance of justice. Apart from disagreeing with this opinion, I do not think that such an opinion really helps against a racist cause at all - it is more likely to be used to liberate white defendants who kill black victims. At the end, the prosecutor invites the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but she followed her and imagined that the defendant would be a white man who murdered black rapists ... eventually the message seems to be in okay to kill someone as long as you hate enough. It is also appropriate that the man killed is presented as absolutely evil and his guilt is by no means doubtful, which will remove any moral ambiguity that is likely to be in the real case. Samuel L Jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately it also undermines the conspiracy - coming as someone with a lot of integrity, but it's hard to believe he would be willing to hide behind the madness that is okay. It is believed that we think it is because he is facing the death penalty, but in fact he offered a homicide in one place, though if you blink you may be missing. Why don't you take it because it has to know that its liberation chances are slim? Or if he wants to go to court, why guess madness? There are also minor flaws. Medical experts allegedly rely on them are jokes - both discredited for highly unlikely reasons, and neither of them provides any real psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that experts will say what they said and we should not believe it. The fact that an injured policeman supports Jackson is slightly credible, but still a little comfortable (and what if he died?) It is difficult for me to believe that the KKK is marching down the street in broad daylight. Other obviously serious crimes (rebellion, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) go without a visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. And the scene where the dog is bounded is ridiculous. My last reaction is that I leave the feeling a little dirty - as if I had to be a racist because I disagree with the resolution. It is possible that the film intended to explore different aspects and let the audience decide, but if so, they seem to have forgotten it when they reached the end. The film thought about my views, read what other people thought and added their own opinion, so maybe at some level - but I'm afraid that in some people it might recreate highly illiberal opinions, which I hope is the opposite what he intends. <br /> <br /> Final thought - try to follow the law and order, covering such issues with a much greater depth in about 38 minutes of the screen!
