I don't understand how some people can play "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" when there are so many better first-person shooters available. "Counter-Strike" is a game that doesn't use any imaginative ideas in its arsenal. All weapons in the game are weapons in real life, but it could at least be a cheat that allowed players to access the "supernatural" weapon, such as the all-powerful BFG in Quake & Doom games. Another problem is that the player must reload the weapon manually. This can be very annoying, especially when you find yourself in the middle of a firefight when you're so close to killing an enemy. Overcharging delay also gives the feeling that the weapon is slow to accomplish its task. <br /> <br /> There are not many characters to choose from. As I recall, there are 4 types of characters for terrorist and anti-terrorist forces. This means that many characters look the same as others, which actually reduces the realism of the game. The game is very sexist when it comes to character selection. In the early version of Counter-Strike, there was a woman available to choose (in the Terorist Force selection) that was good for female players. However, in the latest versions, the female character has been erased and replaced by another male character. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed with the newer versions. Finally, the maps in the game are very small. The largest map appears as a desert map but has standard details. In fact, all the maps in the game have standard graphics. In other words, nothing new. To sum up, I think "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" is the most unusual shooter of all time. There are plenty of better and more imaginative shooting games, so why waste your time on this boring game? You better play Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom. Avoid this overly rated game. I give game 1/10.
