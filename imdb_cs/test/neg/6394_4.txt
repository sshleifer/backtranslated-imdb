I saw it in the theater a few decades ago, and fuzzy memories suggest I liked it. However, if we see it a second time, two things stand out: (1) very bad behavior by Michelle Johnson, and (2) very bad music around the world. It's not that the whole music was bad. Some Brazilian music was fine, but the thematic song and others who set out on the road were reminiscent of the worst pop music of the 1980s. Johnson's voice seemed to be bad, maybe dubbed. That was disturbing. On the positive side: (1) The story is not bad, (2) it's interesting to see so young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper never looked better and (4) Johnson looked quite attractive in different stages disattire.
