OK, I admit that I was still linking Sophie Marceau to La Boum. That was the main reason I went to see this movie. But it was so boring that I almost slept. Sorry, but her talent as an actress is not very convincing. In addition, this film was presented with excellent effects and CGI. Yeah, it's not that bad for B-movie. After seeing her in "Marquise" a few years ago (also a very lousy movie), I thought she would play more convincingly. But La Boum (and perhaps James Bond "the world is not enough") seems to be the only good movie with her. Is it her "talent", has a bad taste in choosing her films or just bad luck?
