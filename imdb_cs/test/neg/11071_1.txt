I agreed to watch this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme resistance to horror movies. However, it wasn't a shock of the monster that made me out of this movie, it was a terrible acting and absolutely disgusting ending. Inside or in the cave, it has no redeeming qualities - it is poorly made, ridiculously written, frighteningly bloody, and the inclusion of a gratuitous final scene discourages me. No, it's not my resistance to the horror movies that make me hate this movie - I've seen such amazing teen horrors as "The House of Wax", that the film leaves you with a terrible understanding that by renting video, you support the creator inside
