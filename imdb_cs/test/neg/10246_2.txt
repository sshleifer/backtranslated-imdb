I haven't had to look at STARCRASH (1979) - which is notoriously cheesy Italian to take on STAR WARS (1977) - but it can't be much worse than this misunderstood piece of junk that suffices to say that Mel Brooks is so-SPACEBARS (1987) Look Like a Real Artwork! In fact, the main reason GALAXINA is remembering today is the tragic fate of her leading lady - Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten, who was killed by her mad jealous estranged husband - even before the film premiered! Although Statten (who subsequently had two biopsies depicted by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, he is reduced in the first half of the film to lean back in his chair, who allegedly drives a spacecraft on a 27-year journey to a planet or otherwise; In fact, Galaxina is a versatile android that also serves the crazy crew of their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for Blue Star (cue choral music) as soon as they land! He said that Statten definitely looks brilliant in his white garment, and while her role barely requires great effort from any gaming talent she might have, it is not even humiliating. Yet, ironically, the film that bears her name, she is overshadowed by camps and wannabe zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (who gives you an idea of ​​the comedy level on display here) , long-eared, wing-colored guy, smoking, proverb-citing old quinaman, and best of all (relatively speaking), hairy alien creature that holds prisoners. The thief of this work is a metal-clad non-entity that, however, has the best laughter in the film, when he hears choral music after his every mention of Blue Star, shouts, "What is it with **?" t? "Hardly any sense lies in the enumeration of sci-fi classics that this smelly in his ridiculous attempts at spoofing the genre because they are not just lame but obvious; incredibly enough, chest-busting, but ultimately a benign alien seems to have played a Malinist Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto! <br /> <br /> For what's worth, the scenes shot on a planet they visit (which looks more like a western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish shade similar to sunlight and its inhabitants are "human gourmets ”(delicacies on their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan etc.) mention the motorcycle gang that serves their own special deity (Harley Davidson) and when our heroes escape on the back, they They dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their "Lord."
