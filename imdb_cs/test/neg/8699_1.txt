The reason why this movie sucks is to even read the Bible for these people? Everything in the movie was about Moses, God remained. THAT SHOULD NOT! God ordered everything, told them where to go and what to do. Also, people wandered for 40 years AFTER RECEIVING they came to Canan and betrayed God again! They did not return for 40 years and suddenly found it, it was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the movie first pick up the Bible, they would say no, that's bad, try again. Everything in this movie was about Moses. They did God to make him look like a blockbuster playing with Moses all along. NO NO NO NO NO !!!!!! God was their whole time and he wanted people to see that he cared for them. How dare they say otherwise even near the passage. And Moses was cut off because he was angry with the people and disobeyed God! He sinned badly and was told he would not be allowed to enter. When did Moses escape and shout at God for everything in the Bible? NEVER!!!!!! Actually, read your story before you figure out what you think is a good idea. Even this whole God has remained largely out of it and has made them alone, not true! God has done everything for the people, has provided them in every way, and God has told them where to go. He was there all the time. All we have to do ourselves is true in some ways, but then it's not how it worked! Yes Today It does not work directly for anyone who sees it, but actually killed people after a golden calf! God worked directly with people. Read the Bible Next Time Echo Bridge or Don't Make Another Bible Movie!
