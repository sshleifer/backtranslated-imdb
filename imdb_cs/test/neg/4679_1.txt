The use of the term "comedy" in relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and even worse is the pain that is caused to viewers of this production. Almost nothing was funny. This documentary watched a small group of stand-up comics while traveling from city to city and performing in small clubs. It is interesting to note that their stage and stage conversations and behavior are indistinguishable, but unfortunately equally rude. It is possible to understand the own delusions of grandeur that have a performance of "comics". but it is harder to understand the sounds of laughter that their audience hears. Perhas these are the same viewers for whom lame sitcoms on TV are intended. This was perhaps the worst movie I've ever watched in my 50+ years of movie watching.
