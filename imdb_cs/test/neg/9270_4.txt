This is a very strange movie that has virtually no information on the web. It uses an approach that is known to those who have followed the Creepshow as it introduces the so-called "Horror" trilogy and combines it into a connecting story of people involved in the segments leaving the bus. There is a narrator who meets on relationships, but his talking adds nothing to the mix and just adds to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well, I swear I have no idea why this movie was certified in the UK, which would bring it into line with similar Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist themes. Nothing here is even scary at a distance. There is no gore, sex, nudity or oath that could revive things, that is what you could put on children's television and no one would drown the lid. I can only think it would be a really well deserved review. Here are three stories in summary: 1. Man dangerously sat down with his telekinetic car to the point where he was alienated from his fianc√©. 2. A man who lives in a dirty apartment is, of course, terrified when a living organism evolved from his six-month casserole. 3. A woman thinks she has found a perfect man through a computer dating service .. that is, until she behaves strangely. And there you go. Some of them are quite entertaining because of their exotic spaces (my favorite is number 2), but you feel they have to be a) frightening and b) moral play, unfortunately, fail on both counts. To sum up, this film is a dark curiosity.
