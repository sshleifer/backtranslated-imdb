I guess I would like this movie to be zero, if not for the climax, which doesn't really include Snakes on the train, but rather the Train in the Snake. The premise was brewed much more than likely during the night of beer after hearing about Snakes on the plane in production (this, in fact, was released according to that film release). The joke is probably not lost to those who seek it; I don't think there is a soul that would consider it a serious - thriller effort (unless at the ironic level it exceeds the capacity of rational thought). It is about a Mayan curse on a woman who is damned by her family for leaving with another man, and is soon to see he's sick and coughs up green slime, of course with a snake. She and her beau go by train to Los Angeles, and very soon after they are more than character cliches dedicated to snakes overtaking the train - with the original woman becoming a snake herself. <br /> <br /> If it is worth mentioning the movie I want, but there is not enough time during the day. The only thing that can be said about a qualitative factor is that it is almost for existence; There are student short films with larger budgets. Maybe it was a wise calculation at the end of the filmmakers that there will be as many copies sold, just for the joke factor itself that would re-convert your budget on the first weekend. Since we are looking at sets (the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of the scene!), Actors (if you can tell them it's just one other actor - the one with very thin hair who hits one woman in the whole movie - who had benefited from filming to be produced), FX (also besides non-existent, making effects in Snakes on the plain looking Star Wars), and the actual CGI snakes themselves, with the final huge snake. something to look for in the sci-fi movie channel. All this basically means it's a laughter of riots every step on the road (especially harsh as it sounds when a little girl becomes involved in snake "attention"), with a very disrespectful good taste in his favor. It is said that it is also 100% disposable, like a B-film sour smell lollipop.
