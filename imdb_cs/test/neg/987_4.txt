*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER *** *** <br /> <br /> How Long and Most Uninteresting Movie! Who were these characters? Why didn't I care about them? If I watch a movie for two hours, I'd like to take care of someone or something. We know that Salvatore dreamed of wealth in the new world. In addition, we have learned about most of the hopes, fears, etc. They have learned little about his family because they have gone on an adventure into the unknown. And why was Lucy in this movie? She said little; Did we know little about her or what she was doing (was she forced to serve men in exchange for being allowed to board a ship?) Or what did her plans get to New York. For those who might suggest that she should underline the fact that a single woman, no matter how cultivated, could not enter this country alone, I say that this is not enough reason to give her so much time. This point could be done in five minutes, with Lucy as a current character. Other questions: Why wasn't the twin on the ship to meet the family? We have heard about my brother and some closure of this point would help the film to provide coherence. How long was the trip from Italy to New York? Due to the conditions on the boat, this is the difference for the viewer if the journey lasted five or 10 or 50 days. (Someone said something about seeing the country "week" in one place, but I think it was when they were on the way.) I needed these details to appreciate what they were going through. The only scene I liked was when the ship, full of passengers, left the dock. <br /> <br /> If you decide to rent this movie, do it with a remote control in your hand; You may want the Quick Forward button to be useful. Finally, I can suggest that with the right voice expression, useful information about the times and circumstances of immigrants - especially during the slow stretches of endless landscapes, people going, etc. - will be provided - this film could create an interesting public television document.
