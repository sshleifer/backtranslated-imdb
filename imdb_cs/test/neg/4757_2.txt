From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed to have released the PG-13 Alien / Predator movie long ago. It was not well received by any means. It is not exactly certain where to go, seeing that Anderson was the best franchise director and they created a true science fiction gem, Fox turned it into a small but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers. These monkeys were by no means sci-fi film veterans, but they saw Burton's planet of monkey monkeys and the House of the Dead. Their first task: to hire an actor. Fox gave them a reasonable budget, but the monkeys wanted to save money. Shortly after, they hired fifteen television actors. <br /> <br /> Now, script. Monkeys wanted to save more on the budget to write the film themselves. Leaving out important aspects of both concessions was easy. Thinking of big new lines for a general audience to remember years after the road - it was harder. They tensed for a moment and came up with a truly award-winning script with clich√© characters, idiotic choices, and gaping conspiracy holes. Fox has so far been satisfied with the results, but wanted to see what is supposed to become the centerpieces of the film - extraterrestrials and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget, so they decided to throw out the big robotics used in the otherwise horrible AvP original and go with the Alien outfit seen in old movies. The actors who played the aliens had trouble assembling them in their suits because their monkeys were not properly sized, so they flicked their plastic heads throughout the film with honest movement. As for the predators, the monkeys decided that this time, a predator (again austerity budget), had to fight the hordes of extraterrestrials who seem to come out of nothing. But what about the effects, you ask? Come on, guys. They may be monkeys, but they clearly knew that CGI would play a key role in the film. Without delving into the budget, the monkeys used the standard Final Cut program to cut out and embed very nice effects of fire and sparks. Putting red and green filters through the camera lens has provided the Predator with an excellent vision. The setup was something the monkeys thought long and hard. If it were to be on Earth, in Colorado in all places, they needed it to be realistic. That was where they admitted they could make mistakes. They saw the monkeys were not properly trained in this department, so they thought the lights would go out in the city and the movie would play at night and it was right in the rain. They just forgot about people who wanted to see creatures instead of looking at shadows and raining the whole movie. To add insult to the injury, the monkey accidentally shot all combat scenes incredibly close, so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, a newbie mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating. Fox told the monkeys to film R-rated. That was easy. Without showing how much injury or death actually happened, the monkeys used to show bloodshed after reality. It was simple: the audience got the gore they wanted, and the monkeys didn't have to shoot most of the action shots on the violence. Some actors originally had questions about the script. Why does the blue liquid that the Predator has infinite amounts of magically decaying what he wants and nothing else? Why is the ex-convicting ride in a police car the whole movie? Why did monkeys forget to show the whole body of foreigners? Why do clocks play a more memorable role than the main characters? The list of questions kept growing, but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. Fox was excited about his work. So excited to have opened a movie nationwide on Christmas Eve, and even spent a few dollars promoting it a week before it came out. Monkeys have successfully made another installment in these precious franchises. But some ask what happened to the budget when monkeys forgot to use it? They gave it to their next film: Aliens vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan. They knew that the public would be upset with this title, but have since made the statement: <br /> <br /> "For the people - don't worry about our upcoming film. He will be rated R and will have violence. And all lived happily ever after.
