I bought this movie in the garage when I was 15 years old. I hated it and I watched it again, just for what the hell is, it's even worse. You can hear the director and cameraman in the background screaming commands like "Zoom, zoom, zoom !!!". There are no special effects, just a raw piece of meat to be a brain. This is utter bullshit, and I originally thought it was one of a kind of home movie or something I bought. But it was distributed elsewhere and it's really weird to know that others have seen it. Whoops need 10 lines .... well .... it can be an interesting thing to watch as non-budget movies were made before the invention of digital cameras. That's shit. Actually, just watch it to see if you can sit the worst. If you can do it, you can do it through anything.
