Wow ... just ... wow. There are many reviews on this movie already, but I wanted to add some custom comments. I agree with most reviewers who said that this movie has terrible acting, writing and directing - whoo boy does it sometimes. However, I think there are some other problems. Why is the Christian faith and the contribution to extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? Does the film behave as if you could not be a Christian and also allow this possibility? Why? They briefly touch on the subject in the film (ie, "The Bible does not say there are aliens." Indeed, the Bible does not say that it is not, so how to deal with the question, instead of letting it go, or better yet, remember that this is the infinite universe we live in and if we believe in it in the infinite God it is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them. 2. How are the two two explanations of kidnappings that are valid, demons and scams? Night horrors that have been associated with acceptable experiences? What if it's completely different? Too bad filmmakers already have their minds. â€œ3. Filmmakers say everyone who has had kidnapping experience This is a big enough claim to happen without any factual evidence ll argue that they don't, but if you want to say something so asinine you should have the facts back up it. 4. Why does the other reporter (not Greasy Haired Blonde Guy, the other) always have their hands in their pockets? It's hard to take someone seriously when they're constantly playing in your pocket. I was the exploration of the phenomena of Christian faith and UFOs, but unfortunately the filmmakers were too concerned about their "Faith Message" "to make the film provocative." As a Christian himself, I am sad.
