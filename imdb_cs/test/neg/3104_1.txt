the worst movie i have ever seen or watch it all i just quickly passed it to the bits of burt and then the end !!! it's the only reason to watch it! I have to admit to owning a copy because I am a huge Burt fan (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection I wouldn't care if this movie came out I had a nightmare hire you like my local store had only 2 copies and fans of all the different stars Always beat, imagine my disappointment when I sat down and watched this movie !! ARE THE GREAT QUALITY OF REDEEMING ABOUT THIS FILM !!! Absolutely nothing that likes this movie! this movie became a running joke between me and the worst friend Burt !! Rob Lowe is the worst WORST HOUR AND HALF OF MY LIFE
