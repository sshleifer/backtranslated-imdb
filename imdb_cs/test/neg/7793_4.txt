This seems to be one of Noel Coward's lesser known films and it's easy to understand why. It's not a bad movie at face value, but there's nothing good about it. Nothing much happens during the movie, it's just a story about Chris and Leonora's unfortunate affair and Barbara's reaction to it. The only thing that keeps the movie interesting is the fact that we already know it will end badly for one reason or another, thanks to the first scene. The strange thing is that there are many perfect opportunities for conflict in the story, yet none of them are used. For example, it would be more interesting and more plausible if Barbara fell out with Leonora, but instead remained good throughout the film. The notion of Barbara, who betrayed her friend, was not explored at all - in fact, her husband did not even seem to betray her; he even encourages him to go on holiday with Leonora. Similarly, Chris's two secretaries in his practice, Susan Birch and Tim Verney, who also happen to be close friends of both Chris and Barbara, are never forced to take sides. In fact, Tim shies away from the conflict by telling Chris that he is terribly fond of both he and Barbara. Despite the strange lack of conflict, the biggest mistake of the film is the fact that it doesn't matter whether Chris ends up with Leonora or Barbara. The personalities of both women are equally indistinguishable, so we don't know which one is better suited to being with Chris, and besides, Barbarina's permissiveness gives the impression that he doesn't care about the matter at all. In addition, I found out that the relationship between Chris and Leonora is somewhat unconvincing. I can overlook the absurdly short timeframe in which they fall for themselves because it is so common in the films of this era, but even then the relationship seemed shallow. Coward's character was too austere and cynical to be subject to Leonor's affections. It reminds me of a socially awkward genius Sir Earnest Pease from "Very Important Person" - I'm sure the two would get well. Chris' coldness and asceticism seemed sincere to his love for Leonora. I think Coward should sit this one and give his part to a younger man - as it is, I was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a dark, mostly emotional, bald middle-aged man. Despite my criticism, the film is still interesting - just not very convincing. The fact that none of the characters is particularly well developed gives them a mysterious character that is somewhat interesting. Surprised heart is definitely worth watching, but it's a bad piece of cinema.
