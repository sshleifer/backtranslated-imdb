I took my family to see Barnyard last weekend. So we were looking forward to it, but the kids weren't there, my husband and I left. When we come from a farmer's community, we found that all the bovine males in the film that drew them on them were a little distracting. We felt like we were looking at cows or something. It was strange to hear that the male voice came from the female body. After reviewing some production notes on another website, I felt as if the animators could get this. I know it's just an animated, funny show, but by putting parts of a man's body on a man, I had to suspend my distrust so much that I couldn't enjoy the movie I could have. I know that udders can be found funny, but they were definitely over used. None of the other animals in the movie seemed to have sex-specific parts of them, and I would prefer that the bulls at this show have at least the right ones if they were to be used at all. However, the children still enjoyed the film, even though we took the time to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
