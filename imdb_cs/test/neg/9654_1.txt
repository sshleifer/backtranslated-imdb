I bought it because it was $ 1.99 and Harry Carey was in it and my friend was in it, and for $ 1.99 how bad could it be? Then I read some comments on the film and started to get excited - maybe it was a really lost gem, one of those amazing little B-movies that everyone forgot, but who deserved to be resurrected. POORLY! I'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing praise he got from some rooms, but I found it one of the most boring and reckless movies filled with bathos I've ever seen. And I'm not talking about the Texas accent of Richard Carlson (I think straight from the Georgian part of Texas). It's just stupid. No one in the film acts like a real human being. Nobody. And nobody does anything believable or interesting. It's not even a clich√©. It's just 80 minutes of shots. He even managed to make Harry Carey, Maria Ouspenskaya and C. Aubrey Smith boring. It's incredible now.
