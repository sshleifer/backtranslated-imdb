That was what he was watching on TCM today, where other reviewers saw it. I'm sorry that I was the only one who found Davies as a weak actress, with a really terrible attempt at Irish (Irish-American or otherwise) accent. As a star, it was a little hard for me to get around - especially since other reviewers said it was her best performance. Another particularly awful Davies performance was "Marianne" (1929), which I also watched today. In this film, which received a rating of 9 out of 10, her accent changes from that of the (correct) French woman to an odd combination of Italian and Swiss. Interestingly, in the hourly biofilm TCM Davies - "Captured on Film: The True Story of Marion Davies" (2001) - film historian Jeanine Basinger claims that "one of the things you'll notice about Marion Davies in her sound work is how good she is on making accents. "Of course this bio also includes a fan commentary (to do what you will be). <br /> <br /> Davies was a very attractive young woman, and in all respects a great real-life comedy. <br /> <br / And since part of her anatomy has added immensely to the real answer to finding the character of Joseph Cotten for the meaning of Kane's last word in the opening scene of the great "Citizen Kane", she has earned her place among the great stories if Hollywood history is. But I think Welles & Mankiewicz has for the most part interpreted it with the "Susan Alexander" facsimile of the actual article. <br /> <br /> Do not bother voting whether you agree or disagree with this post because I could not really care less.
