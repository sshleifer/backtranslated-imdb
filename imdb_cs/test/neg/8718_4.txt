While the David Lynch version of Dune is choppy, embarrassing and unfaithful to the novel, it is visually well designed and well functioning. The best thing to say about Sci Fi's attempt to make Dune into a miniseries is that it's ambitious. In fact, it is practically the only positive praise he can offer. Actors (with a few exceptions) seem to like to recite their lines with the least emotion and least appropriate accents. The costumes seem to have been designed by someone who has a large excess of Mylar fabric on their hands and an unhealthy love for the sticky headgear. Part of this miniseries suffers from the life in the shadow of Lynch's already well-known things. effort. However, it takes elements from the Lynch film, which was not present in the novel and copies them almost wholesale (ie Guild Steersman's Navigation Sequence), and this only encourages the encouraging negative comparison with Lynch's film. And for the effort. D for virtually everything else.
