It's hard to write 10 lines of copies about this so-no film noir. There's not much to say. It's not unforgettable to add to your collection, and I have a significant amount of noir. Paul Henreid plays the tough guy. It's not the one I think he will play such a role, but he's fine with him. Anyway, he's a great actor. Everything, including cinematography, is fine - but not unforgettable. One thing that stood out: a sudden end. That was a surprise. It was also a surprise to see it under the heading "Hollow Triumph." I've never seen the movie I called. It's always called "Scar". <br /> <br /> If you read about the "tight film noir", etc., don't believe it. "Tense" is not the exact adjective for this film.
