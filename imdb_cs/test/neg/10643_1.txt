"Hellraiser: Bloodline" must have awards. It's a full moon. It carries all the signs, say, your series "Demonic Toys" or "Puppet Master", without their dopey, uh, charm? A full moon can get rid of a stupid product because they know it's stupid. These Hellraiser things, man, are sometimes taken seriously. This increasingly stupid franchise (though not as stupid as I was watching) had once made its low budgets stylish. It's just ish now.
