Aaran is one of the movies where you can find loop holes in an Indian cinema. Here is a good example of how to show how excellent writers, directors and actors succumb to producers. Here is one of the most beautiful actors, Mohanlal, acting in a film about a real story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the film is defeated by sub-standard comic scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who is actually the son of the film's producer. He does not have his hair cut, though his officer asked him to do so. This guy doesn't know what he's doing and he's the "hero" of the movie. God Help the Indian film with such producers. This film is a pathetic example of what's going on in Kashmir. A sensible viewer can intuitively understand the limitations of such wonderful writers, actors and directors who want to share their real life experiences. But the unfortunate part is that the top-ranking movie in the Indian militia turns out to be a poor display that just makes one think the movie was stupid. We should expel such producers in the film industry and pave the way for a good cinema.
