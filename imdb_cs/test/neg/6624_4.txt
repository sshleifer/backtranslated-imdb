People seem to disagree with me that movies can be both bad and good at the same time. The same type of people who see the movie with Top Carrot on the cover, surfing through Frickin's office and continuing to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top Funny? Of course not. Was this movie something special? Of course not. It was a stupid movie, and they all thought they were so simple about what they knew about Mr. Top. Movies like this, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns from outside and almost any Pauly Shore movie ever were in not meant to be taken seriously, and because they shouldn't really be considered some of the worst movies ever made. You look at them either waiting for a stupid movie that is merrily bad or you're like six years old and really thinks Carrot Top is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Please people, if you're ready to know, Carrot Top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother to write a serious review .... don't look at it. Choosing this movie is like picking it up for 5 years because it doesn't know the alphabet.
