I can't believe the high marks people have posted on this site. Writing is incredibly bad when people come at the right time and reveal what makes a heroine try to escape. (Do you hate it when it happens?). And acting is so very, very bad that you can get the splinter into the eyes of all the scenery chew. Walnut is holding her hostage, the kids are out of the open screen, so she whines for help instead of screaming when she was brave enough to break the windows to scream at these kids. Finally, she is free and alone in the house. Her chance to go to help, so what does she do? He travels around the house and lies. It's in the basement, closed. So what does he do? A little nap. Come on! Most of the movie is a matrix wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when she wakes her up. Four times! What? If a writer is too bored to actually write a real storyline, why should we pay attention? I think the key is that it was originally a radio game, so they filled the heroine, just sat, rather than pretending to be a writer and actually write some action. And the end is terrible. The whole movie is totally unlikely, horribly written and almost comical. Beware of this movie at all costs!
