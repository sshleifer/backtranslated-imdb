I liked the movie, it's just that the characters run around with no real point for their madness. Like I said, a poor goat. The goat was nahing while the guy pretended to be silent on him. I would like it if the rape scenes were more graphic (not the goat). Jane Ryall, who played Celia, made only one movie. She was very naked. This crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places. I almost forgot about a couple of gay transvestites who are also chosen to be sinners. If you like crazy things, then it's your movie. 3/10
