I can't remember a more trivial, numb and shallow movie, in other words a real movie of the worst kind. How can anyone watch this movie and recommend it to others? Only if they don't like to admit, they made a mistake. It seems to sum up the worst female aspirations. No real essence for all this happy and shallow. Yeah, it will please the masses. Well, not this member of the masses. What trivial load on the drive. I wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start. And I think I paid Â£ 7 to see it! However, I believe that this represents a stupid decline in cinema as with most media these days. So I like a bit of reality in my musicals telling me sad or what?
