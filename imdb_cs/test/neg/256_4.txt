On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, he got his first leading role in this picture of B Love Affair. The first thing you should realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed. It's not even half as good as all of these movies. In fact, Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out that she lives her extravagant lifestyle with the courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial advisor. Hale Hamilton. It looks like quite a shock to Mackaille. He considers a business career as a way to achieve income. Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aircraft engineer and has designed the perfect aircraft engine and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do this, except what he likes to see in Bogey. Given the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty, it's a little disturbing to see him as this highly moral and self-righteous character in a love affair. Part of it does not wear well. <br /> <br /> Love Affair is your average second feature on B, there's nothing special about it.
