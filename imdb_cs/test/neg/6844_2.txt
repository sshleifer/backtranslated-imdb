A film theater with a bad past of the horrible murders is reopening. Of course, the bloody killings will start again. He wrote, directed, shot, scored and edited with a scary lack of taste and subtlety of the uniquely talented Rick Sloan (who later disgraced celluloid more with the utterly appalling "Hobgoblins"), this terribly shocked attempt at false strikes rotting in every imaginable way: unbearably lethargic stimulation , painfully static, grainy cinematography (there is a smelly excess of false master shots that appear throughout the text), annoyingly humming and redundant score of the hum'n'shiver synthesizer, flat (not) direction, lengthy talc and flawless script, sophomic inducing blade a low-voice sense of humor, bloodless pieces of murder, a pitifully grievous murderer (it's just a wrinkled old man in pasty make-up), uncomfortable and unpleasant characters, dissatisfied abrupt endings and lifeless performances from a remarkably uninspired cast ensure that sch Locky Swill is just as fun and rewarded as eating rancid raw eel covered with sour vinegar. This crud absolutely lacks the necessary raw magic and sleazy enthusiasm needed for a pleasant junk. Instead, it is just a bland, rugged and meandering stiff one that never catches fire or even remotely entertains itself in such a delicate way of smoking. Only the smidgen of nudity and the wonderful presence of always reliable Mary Woronova as a snarling, sardonic secretary provides some relief from the overall stupidity of this miserable loser.
