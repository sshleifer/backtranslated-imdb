The other woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and believes someone wants to hurt him. A girl who likes him wants to help him, but she is led to believe that his fear is caused by mental illness ... Interesting storyline, very good acting, but the result as a whole is bad in many aspects. The story is too simplistic, or rather presented in a simplified way (though there are some interesting twists). For example, people say they love each other after two meetings. I don't want to reveal anything else, but you'll see what I mean when you watch a movie. "Come on, it was fifty!" Yet I have seen several films from that time and I know that nowadays some of them seem to be not dated. Something that worried me was that some scenes were filmed in the dark, so it's almost impossible to watch what's going on. Okay, it's a film noir, but this is in some places too noir ...: o) <br /> <br /> Overall, the other woman is not a masterpiece of the time, but not a trash. Watch it if you have nothing else to do ...
