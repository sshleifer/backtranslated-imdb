Disney-like fun with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual links. Lousy comedy next to clich√©-ridden moralizing. Noah like Abraham, Lot as his evil friend. Mixed special effects. Excessive behavior with poor timing. Was Sodom and Gommorah destroyed before the flood? Strange twists and too many parcels that the Bible doesn't mention. God as a questioning father who needs to be whined before he decides that the world must be saved from disaster. films that seriously lack plot and direction.
