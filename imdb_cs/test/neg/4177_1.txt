My friend Zac rented this movie for free because his mother works in a rental shop. I still feel ripped off because I will never be able to get those 100 minutes of my life back. When I saw the first "Dark Harvest" on the night before watching it, I expected to see at least a lousy remake of the first movie. Erroneous. There is not a single scarecrow in the film (unless you count one of the box covers), nor are there any real scenes of death. The film got its R rating from an 8 year old girl screaming "god d ** n" with her father. There is no amount of tequila that could endure this film. Believe me, we tried.
