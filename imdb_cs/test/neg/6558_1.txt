Welcome to Plan 9 from Star Trek Universe movies. Come on, tourists, admit it. This film is so bad, so awkward in every department, it's something that is classic. Hi, Bones! It's not just Ham - it's a few big pig farms in Kentucky! <br /> <br /> "Special" effects. It should be done in accordance with trade names to use such a term. The company is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. Really! Even the TV show Star Trek was better. Bones, Spock and The Shat Sing! Yeah, Spock sings Row Your boat. After struggling for the meaning of words !!!! "Captain. Life is not a dream" Poor Leonard Nimoy, he must really want to strangle Shatner for it. Could Shat give us his release of Mr. Tambourine Man, or harmonized with Nimoy on the ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Very disappointed. Sean Connery looks like Spock's brother. Just because they couldn't get Sean Connery! Uhura makes a fan dance! That would be sexy in 1966. In 1989 it's like watching your drunk grandmother embarrassment herself for a Christmas party. Shat her swirling several times as a WWF wrestler and throws her away. Yayy The Shat! It seems Connery 2.0 was a bit of a Vulcan rebel. Which explains why Spock hadn't mentioned him in 79 episodes t.v and 4 movies before. Apparently, McCoy loved his father, but CURE appeared after him. Tell me it's not hysterically funny. Spock's anti-grave boots are greatly supported by Bones and The Shat. They should also use em on submerged-back whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner Meets God! Or what is supposed to be God, but I suppose it's really an alien being. God looks like Charlton Heston in 10 commandments. Sean Connery calls on God to share his pain and die immediately. Or something. God punishes Shat for questioning his identity. Therefore, Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I would like to know what Jehovah's Witnesses made from this scene. Shat, who killed God, immediately returned to his singing song with Spock and Bones. Total now Row Row Row Your Boat .....
