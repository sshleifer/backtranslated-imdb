The filmmakers were clearly on drugs. This is the only explanation I have. How else do you explain this adaptation of Jane Austen? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a Gothic novel. However, this film was created as if it were a Gothic novel. The bizarre musical and dream sequence suggests more drug-induced hallucinations than a na√Øve, innocent girl with exaggerated imagination, as Catherine of the novel says ... all the time bug-eyed. Peter Firth looks at least 10 years to play Henry, and in fact he seemed to be a little on the gay side. I don't see the attraction between him and Catherine. The image of John Thorpe was somewhat strange, but in fact Isabella wasn't that bad. But nothing could save this movie from CRAP! One more thing - this film invented a character who is not in the book, a French friend of General Tilney, "The Marchioness." Why did they add it to me. It must have been drugs. It's a scary looking faith, with a white base, red lips, and black lines painted on her face (wells?). <br /> <br /> Do you think it would be at least fun in so bad it's good quality, but unfortunately it's not. It's just BAD.
