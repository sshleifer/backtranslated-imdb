Here is another great movie critics will love. The problem is, it's not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie premise is simple. Nine convicts escape from prison after the tenth prison and tell them where the treasure is. The first half has a lot of grotesques, some of which are very wide, while the other half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy. Two halves just don't mix. The individual scenes work very well (the guys dropping friends who have a new Filipino bride are happy) While the later scene with a big guy who works in a restaurant pulls his heart. br /> <br /> The movie also lacks all the settings. One scene shows that the guys are desperately looking for a change under an abandoned slot machine to buy a snack. The next scene has the entire crew in the restaurant. Where did they get the clothes and wigs? (The crew includes both a big guy and a dwarf) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy food? And the most mysterious is why are they on the move? Apparently they are the guys in the move and let themselves face something that is more memorable to the witnesses than the big guy and the dwarf who eats food dressed as women? I mentioned a big boy and a dwarf, because besides the old guy, everyone else seems to be merging. (In fact they have matching white overalls in most of the movie.) The film has very little character development in the first half, and as a result the other half really lacks an emotional strike. How often we try to find out who is in their individual pay scenes. Speaking of dragging, the other half has all the amazing camera shots and great emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great movie. It is also unbearably slow, which is for a boring movie. <br /> <br /> 9 Soul is a great disappointment, gush reviews about a great movie and it's out there somewhere, good luck finding it yourself.
