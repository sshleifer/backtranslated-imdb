There is a LOT of repeated dialogue in this film about "cool places" (indicating the presence of a ghost), and characters pray to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the film's feelings, I will repeatedly refer to cool places in this report. I've seen worse movies than the St. Francisville, but this can be the most memorable * one of all ("it's cold!") Basically, about 20 nights she spends her night in a haunted house. This is filmed as a supposedly genuine documentary. This, of course, is not real, but the house has several cold spots. SPOILERS- (as if you were unable to predict most of the plot!). Not much is happening in this movie. We have a time-honored horror clich√© cat jumping out of hiding near the start, as a "practice" scare to warm up the audience. People roam with flashlights, sometimes reminding the house for a moment that they come in peace - that they don't mean any harm to ghosts (or cold places). Now and then the door closes and surprises someone. Of course, the ouija plate makes the look. He speaks with a spirit called "Charles". Girl eats sandwich with cockroach in it. More cold spots. The next door closes, and some guy goes to the door-breaking sound. Scuff, scuff, he says. My God, someone says. "Surround yourself with white light." I admit that there is a good scene in the attic (where the chair is flipped with a ghost) that really caught my guards. But besides some humorous bad dialogue, the chair scene (the actual fraction of a second when it is flipped over, nothing just before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this movie. But there are still cool places. Eventually the movie ends. Nobody dies. No further details are required. I wasn't a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, but it looks like a masterpiece next to St. Francisville Experiment. You may find yourself not discussing whether this is a real documentary, but whether it is funny. Still do not know. But whatever it was, it failed.
