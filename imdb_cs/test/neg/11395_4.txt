After watching this movie, I thought they really corrected Errol Flynn's life! The film is really a nice eye candy. They really had the atmosphere of the 1930s and 1940s in Hollywood. Costumes were great. All the women looked charming and all the men looked nice and no doubt. Is it a serious movie about Errol Flynn's life? No! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous things he has done in his life. Why did I criticize this movie? It is a movie that has had many promises but failed. Duncan Reagher was really good as Errol Flynn. He wasn't as good as the original, but he convinced you that Flynn wasn't just a nice playboy who didn't take himself seriously, but as a man who, though gifted with great talent, was a little disturbed and unhappy inside. Flynn's love life was a disaster because he had so many failed marriages. He also lost a lot of good friends during his life. He also suffered from the unrequited love of the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene of the film showed Errol the kind of begging for Olivia to stay with him and instead leave. He is shown in his tuxedo, looking really empty and walking slowly around the pool as he poured his drink into the pool. It was a sad way to end the movie, but some way everyone was aware of how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dispersed lifestyle. This movie could have been much more deep, I've been better written. They clearly showed all the scandals, but they never showed Errol Flynn's human center. Surprisingly, Duncan Reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of Errol Flynn even though the film wrote did not give any depth there. I probably never see the movie again but I can still remember you read this movie, "Gosh, this could have been a lot more .....! This movie I give D +.
