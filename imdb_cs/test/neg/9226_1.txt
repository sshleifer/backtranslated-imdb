If the following sounds enticing, then by all means rush to the local blockbuster and rent this movie post-rush: 1. Amazing 60 years of hairstyles, from pathetic perms to avoiding ducktails. 2. The worst child actor in the world doing nothing but screaming and saying DADDY in the most enjoyable voice imaginable. 3. Lots of footage of alligators and monkeys that don't touch the film. At all. 4. Stereotypical Indians who use blowers and speak gobbledegook. Oh, and that goes without saying that they bend around the fire. 5. Amazingly false aircraft crash mechanics, casting into the corners of the carton. 6. External shots 5 that look suspiciously like a toy flowing over a string of light around a studio lit by blue light. 7. The terrible special effects that make those that were used in the first Star Trek series look like they are. (Special mention: Little boy has blond hair shining. Oh dear ..) <br /> <br /> 8. Mixable editing and continuity where background items move between scenes, the audio track changes without any warning, etc. <br 9. Do you not have enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get every street lady to treat her like an idiot! Nobody notices it! Er .. <br /> <br /> 10. "Exciting" climax including bat, snakes (more from the archives) and a ton of fake blood. Don't forget to insert a silly "tribal" sounding song! <br /> <br /> But the more reasonable you are, wait for this inevitable appearance to appear on MST3K when this classic TV show is resurrected. watch it in the spirit that was intended. Any other kind of enjoyment to be derived from this crap is unthinkable. So don't even try. 0/10
