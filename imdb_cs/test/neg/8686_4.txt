Max Cash ship captain charter, which works outside the Caribbean island of San Sebastian, is hired by Sarah, who is looking for a legendary ship, El Diablo and his stolen treasure that sank in a cliff in the 17th century. But something seems to protect the ship's whereabouts because the people who knew about it are killed. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with those who had the impression that it would be a horror of Properties. Instead of having a low rent, b-grade set out on the 1977 deep-sea adventure film "The Deep" in the late 1980s, but with a lousy supernatural origin and a secret injection. The story is tame muddle (so many inconsistent angles don't make a licking sense and encourages blots to pace) and the technical side is clumsy. Nice exotic location and underwater photography. Though carefree performances were not too bad. Grumpy Wayne Crawford is pleasantly funny and June Chadwick is just beside him. Sheri Able is pretty eye candy. There are some bizarre developments that entertain and one or two scary sequences. But there is a real lack of coherence. Most dead dead are off-screen except for the bloody, fit opening killing something invisible. Again, just another thing that leaves you high and dry. The music is generic with its exciting allusions that warn us about impending danger, and POV shots get right. Tatty, but attentive.
