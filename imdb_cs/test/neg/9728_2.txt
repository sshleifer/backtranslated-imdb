Well, I don't know which of them belongs, but one thing is for sure: the descendants of Salem are boys. Can you divide them? I could not. If you can tell me what it is, I really appreciate it. These boys-boys look so damn similar! Really now. Is it a horror movie or a movie for hobbyists? Sadly, the (equally weak) horror genre was abducted by adolescents. And this is one of the most famous I've ever seen. The film is visually stiff, but the cast is so bland that the gameplay is so horrible it was an attempt to finish the movie.
