Lately, I've been watching a lot of westerns since the 1930s to the present. There are some large low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This film had all the elements of a decent Western: a good story with talented actors and everything else. Although it is a spoof of this genre, and for me the way it was done, it just didn't work and did for an unsatisfactory movie. <br /> <br /> This movie can be easily divided into two parts. > <br /> The first part is great; it has a great opening scene and an interesting story is being developed by a bounty hunter (a.k.a. alien) to go after a bandit who goes after a big banked guard, partly, banker. In the course of the film, the three characters make a shift in alliances in an effort to raise money. There is a subtle comic nod to the controversy of earlier films from this genre, but comedy does not disrupt the overall story. The second half of the movie is where comedy goes over-top-top. and basically destroys the film. The turning point is right where the barmaid causally grants the dwarf to stop shooting customers when it comes to waiting for other patrons who have apparently forgotten the four dead bodies she put on the spot. From now on, the film moves from decent western spaghetti to comic undertones to silly silly spoofs. There are three terrible fist scenes (one on the river, one on the market and one in the world). in the spa) that follow in quick succession, as if it wasn't bad enough. The fight is so fake that it is ridiculous, and because the sound is out of the picture, it's even worse. On the market scene, the banker bounces on the hidden trampolines and spins around on poles like the circus; he's a clown. Although the worst part of these fighting scenes is music; it is this cheerful, riveting mix that is more suitable for square dancing or kitsch 'Hee-Haw'. These scenes virtually derail the main story. Overall, this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western but comic turns only mucked it. If you want to see a good western spoof then see 'Blazing Saddles'. If you want to see good western spaghetti, then avoid this movie.
