This is one of the so-called "Hollywood Social Commentary" films that want both ways. And believe me, in this film both ways are cliché and stereotypical. STOP-LOSS is a 21st century film by John Wayne A film that deals with some anti-war sentiment, but clearly ends on the note that "If you are in today's society, you will get together and go to war with your friends." in many ways a great continuation of TAXI TO DARK SIDE, because he portrayed the army just as madly and without control, which is the quasi FRAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE. masculinity. This film had everything in one scene after another cliché. And then the rebellious military deserter Ryan Phillippe goes to "Road Trip" with his best friend's girlfriend, a man-made manipulation story to visit the families of dead soldiers, crippled soldiers in military hospitals, and so on. . But male honor and patriotism will ultimately win because everyone freshly scrubbed and handsome, rides into the sunset on a bus with friends back to Iraq and the world, which a few minutes before he assured everyone he would never tolerate. FULL METAL JACKET meets SANDS OF IWO JIMA. Eventually, however, John Wayne rides again! And the Hollywood blockbuster eventually gets to keep both sides of his audience in his hand, at least he'd like to think. As for me, take me back to a more convincing reality in ELAHU GARDEN.
