Okay, so when my friend told me to drive MM2 and MM3, I thought, damn, I have to look at Monster Man and find out what it is, maybe I can get involved, but when I came to my DVD players and tried to suffocate the first 45 minutes of anything but bad, bad I mean terribly annoying bad comedy from that fat ass who thinks he's funny, not to mention how the director looooong spent on a senseless desert trip I conclude that these guys had no idea what they were doing and missed the ship with a long shot. The story had the potential to be somewhat different from the usual BS you see on the Blockbuster / Hollywood Video shelf that the Lions Gate released these days, but this has certainly gone wrong. Why put so much time and effort in filming annoying bad games and bad jokes, why not shorten your trip and give more plot in the movie. Myabe writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of movie or maybe the director shooting the filming of horror and gore that they had to find the fill to make the usual 84 minutes ???? All in all, and I'm here easy, maybe because my friend is a bald doll in a bar scene who gets his skull crushed in pursuit of three outlets on the street, giving them at least 1 star for Trying and Scenes of Murder / Killing they weren't so bad they tried again. It is a pity that Lions Gate could create a cool license from this idea, but failed. I do not recommend paying rent, maybe you can find the cut version where the movie starts from the tracker track scene. CRAP!
