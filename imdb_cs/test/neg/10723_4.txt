I thought the movie was par. Acting was good, but not big, the story was funny, but it didn't work out. The director dropped the ball on this film. It wasn't James (them) or tea. IMHO was the music that killed him. There is a scene where things go down the hill and Jonny Cash plays music - a man was that depressed (not funny) killed my mood. Then the film was not restored. The deportation scene had a potentially funny situation, a good acting performance - I even grinned, but the music was again unsuitable for the scene. Music kept me from being drawn into the movie. I say it had the potential, but it was wrong, I would even say that I was in a hurry to final production. Prequel Reminder to Exorcist: Beginning. Theatrical performance was good, although I watched it, but the exorcist movie release: the dominion was much better. The same story just another director. The same should be done here.
