Synopsis: The continuation of the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a great budget production that cannot quite achieve; Not only is he not as clever as his predecessor, it is neither a splash or a thrilling or horror movie, just a boring time loss. Don't be fooled by the media hype, and especially the stories of people throwing themselves into the cinema and being scarred for the rest of their lives because of the brain scene: it just comes as a ridiculously bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum say that H is "not all bad" and "worth watching on the big screen," etc., He's behind me; and it's not "so bad it's good", it's just boring. I usually respect other people's opinion, but in this case I have to say that they can't clearly say from Shine-Ola. Perhaps they had fallen prey to media humbug, perhaps they had never seen Ridley Scott's movie and were amazed at his excessive use of backlight, smoke, and the ubiquitous AC fans. H is completely voltage-free; instead, we get endless scenes of Lecter who go through the English-speaking Firenze, which is a totally unconvincing and devious plot with more holes than the fishing net (after I saw H, I was actually lying in the middle of the night trying to find all the holes on the property , and when I wrote them, I quickly filled out 6 pages in a small type before I stopped to stop. Rather than wasting time and money on the big screen, I suggest you wait for it to come on TV in a few years; and then go to bed early. <br /> <br /> 1 / 10. <br /> <br /> Below are some other bones I have to pick with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - H _ is the sequel to SOTL, despite what some people say in this forum. And although SOTL was a very hard act to follow, there are sequels that take _are_ en par with their predecessors (SOTL himself was the sequel to Michael Mann's "Manhunter", based on Thomas Harris "" Red Dragon, and even though the first episode was a very funny movie, SOTL was even better, another example was the Alien series initiated by director H Ridley Scott - so much for the theory of shrinking sequels. This film has a renowned director, is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly A - list, great cinematography, big budget, first class writers, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is just fart in church I think a lot of guilt has to go to Dino DeLaurentiis, the producer of the film, here's my explanation: DDL produced "Manhunter", which, despite all its qualities Disappointed, he gave the rights to Hannibal Lecter's character Orion - for free, allowing Jonathan Demme to do SOTL, and the rest is a cinema history. DDL then had to wait another ten years (he is now 81) until Thomas Harris finally came up with the novel's continuation. I think at this point DDL has lost all interest in a good movie and was desperate to finally get his piece of cake before his cork appears. Another aspect that is totally unpleasant to me about this movie is that it is given so much undeserved humor in the media; It's boring, but one of the most distinctive productions ever, so there's no need to give him free publicity. And while most reviewers about how Dantesque scenes in Firenze are and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the simple fact that this movie is complete, utter, UTTER flop goes unnoticed. But there is even more: not only is Hannibal hyped through the roof, but it is also used as a media program for a number of "documentary films" (usually left over from similar productions due to SOTL) about serial killings, cannibalism and profiling. However, H not only pretends to be realistic; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (now only kills out of necessity, or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there's no need to create a profile) and there is no cannibalism: Lecter feeds his drug addict Paul Krendler your own brain, so it is (erm) ignorant - car - cannibalism. Try making a document out of it. Much has been said about acting: mainly whether Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays Hannibal Lecter's lead) is usually given a lot of praise. I think all these discussions are debatable. There are several of my favorite actors in this movie (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore) but the script just doesn't give them what to do. Same for Hopkins: his character has no development and is not attacked in any way. And by the way, he plays almost identical characters in all of his movies, just that he has to make a special bit of murder in H and pay $ 11 million to pay.
