The seriously disappointed performance of Brad Pitt and QT, the plot is superficial and lame, and if it does not indirectly reflect, this film actually celebrates the Nazis and portrays them as honest men and shows that the Jewish people are deceiving, failing to keep promises and bloody evil. Hitler (along with the most famous Nazis) attends a silly plot of less film about killing 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema in Paris is incredibly ridiculous. the Nazis are laughing and cheering for every killing in the film, as if watching a STUPID basketball match, the deal at the end is lame. What is really scary is that the film has made great reviews and is ranked here in the 1940s among the top 250 movies. will not be surprised if they reap many awards, including Oscars. The movie is simply kissing ass to Jewish people, but hey, rethinking, its not even doing a great job of doing. it really dwarfed the entire Nazi - Jewish conflict and pure insult for all who fought and suffered from the Nazi tyranny.
