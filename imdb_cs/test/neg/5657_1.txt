First of all, I'd like to say I'm a teenager, so it's all marketed to me, and I can confidently say that iCarly's very poor programming, and the fact that it's accepted between the two sexes, I'm sorry. It contains some of the worst attempts at comedy I've ever seen, with moderate performance. The supposed humor of the show is based on the fact that someone's lines again convey bad sarcasm, bad sarcasm, say bad individuals, and, well, you get the picture. I should also mention that I am still watching SpongeBob, which I know will get negative resistance, but that is good programming with some sincerely funny moments in it, less forgetting something missing iCarly; JOKE. The show is about a young girl, Carly, putting on a web show with her friends, which I can say is undoubtedly a nicer version of the internet. It's okay, but the show is just ... well, it's not funny at all, as mentioned above. If that's what kids, parents do today, show them something that is really funny; Spongebob or Rocco's modern life would work. Also, compared to his fraternal show, Drake & Josh, it's horrible, as suggested. Seriously, watch something worth it. Even for kids it's bad.
