This, in my opinion, is a very bad movie that advertises Arnold Schwarzenegger as playing (despite it being co-star) just selling more copies. Obviously, this film affects similarly motivated Conan films, but this film does not prove to be entertaining and eventually fails to entertain. Bridgette Neilsen plays as Sonja, a beautiful woman who has been given an incredible power by a ghostly figure after her village has been looted, her family killed and she herself has been raped by Queen Gedran's soldiers (Sandahl Bergman). Gedran is a tyrannical queen who wants to dominate the barbaric world and seeks a talisman protected by Sonja's sister. After finding out what happened, Sonja goes on revenge and at the same time has to save the world from the anger of Gedran. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, tries to protect her, whether he wants him there or not. The first big problem with this movie is the beginning. The events that led to the place where Sonja took her strength could easily make a good ten to fifteen minutes of fun movie. But the beginnings are rushing into what looks like a quick minute. segment of a television show. If they really did make these events part of the story and cut out some of the fill later, they might be able to start healing this movie, but unfortunately they didn't (I wonder why director Richard Fleischer was currently only directing two Red Sonja movies). This film also includes some of the most annoying characters in history, such as Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.), who is a stupid character and just adds a surplus of camp to a movie that sometimes works, but in this case fails. He was quite obviously written in a movie for some comic relief, but with the overall absurdity of the movie anyway it was another costly mistake for ?? Red Sonja '. For all the mistakes there was some good fight scene involving both Neilsen and Arnie, which are worth mentioning, but these aren't enough to save this turkey. Acting is about as good as it gets for films of this quality, and Arnie didn't seem too bothered by his performance. I do not recommend this movie at all; for me it's a waste of an hour and a half. My rating for ??? Red Sonja '?? 3/10
