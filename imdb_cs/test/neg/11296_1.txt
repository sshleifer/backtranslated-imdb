One of the worst theater films of the year, if not all the time. Anthony Hopkins bothered himself in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and the name of Ridley Scott are on the way. Jody Foster's best career career he has ever made turned. Julianne Moore was as heartless as Keanu Reeves's wife. Of course, Gary Oldman was his brilliant self. It's a crippled victim of Hannibal and the makeup is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars ??? Give me a break! They say he didn't want his name to be mentioned in the credits. And frying and feeding your own brain to Ray Liott ... I laughed at the absurdity, didn't do the stupidity of this swing at this point. I haven't seen so many people leave the movie because Who's the girl. <br /> <br /> Pay someone else to go to you if you have to, but skip it ALL COSTS !!!
