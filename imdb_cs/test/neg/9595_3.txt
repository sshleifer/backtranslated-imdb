I saw the movie yesterday on the public channel. They promoted it as a horrible video, so I was dragged to see it and I wasn't let go. A group of 18-19 years old go to the excavation of an old Viking castle in Denmark to try to uncover the myth of Berserker's Vikings. Strange things happen: something is in the woods, and people begin to disappear. The main thing this movie really worries me about is that the story should take place in Denmark, where it happened to me. There were so many places in the film where the Hollywood style overlapped with Danish reality. It's really done acting and drama look ridiculous in my eyes. You will never see characters interacting with one of their neighborhoods. He feels like a mini-Hollywood in Denmark and takes away the credibility of the film. When you hear at one point that someone speaks "old Danish", it sounds just like modern Swedish. Really bad research, due to the director's from Denmark. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie used GPS and maps, and that's really funny because Denmark is about the size of your yard. Nomatter, where you are, is never more than 50 km to the sea and 500 meters to civilization. And if you are in the castle, there will be tourists everywhere. We see a lot of forest overviews in the film and sometimes we see what appears to be North American vegetation (?) I didn't like the story, maybe because the action was so bad. When characters see swamps for the first time, they are not even scared. I think their acting skills were not enough to show realistic emotions. There's an unexpected twist at the end, but it didn't impress me because I didn't really care. Swamps are cheap but have the potential to be scary. Unfortunately, they will not do it because we look at them when they stand in the forest. Also, there are no really scary scenes because Bog creatures are mostly just standing around. Anyway, Conclusion: Regardless of the facts, the movie is your typical B-horror flick. People from other countries can enjoy it more. Until you know the reality, it doesn't matter. Just as I think the United States is one big action movie set, everyone else thinks that Denmark is a forest with a castle.
