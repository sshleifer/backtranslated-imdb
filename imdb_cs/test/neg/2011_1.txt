... and that's a damn shame! Please take the sun and let him burn all the copies of Dracula 3000. This must be the worst vampire movie of the new millennium yet (I haven't seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but it's not worse than that). Don't be fooled by the fact that the movie is cool H.R. Gigeresque cover. That's so bad, it's almost merry. I cannot describe all the emotions that this film has caused. I laughed at my ass, screaming at the screen, sitting there insensitive, nodding my head in disbelief, ... This movie has written "cheap and cheese". The best thing about this movie are introductory credits and introductory images that have more or less fine CGI two spacecraft. But when the voice of Casper Van Dien sounds, you start to do something stinking. And after all, he's going down really fast. The rescue ship crew finds an abandoned vessel, Demeter, which seems to be heading to the ground. She enters her, sealing their fate. Above all, this film is a shameless low-budget ALIEN-rip-off, mixed with vampires. Right after the plot, the figure of Erika Eleniak, Aurora, revealed he's a robot. Coolio goes badly over-the-top as doping-smoking, bloodsucking 187 (pffff, code from hood like name?!?!). The character of Casper Van Dien named Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) And looks like ... well, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Captain Varna, former Demeter Commander, is only displayed on the monitor screen and seems to have trouble reading auto-cue lines (poor Udo, what are you doing in this movie?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as Earl Orlock, one of Dracula's oldest and ridiculous ages, who should tune the silver screen. Just look at his clothes. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he's wearing a cheap old-fashioned fringed Halloween jumpsuit. Did you think Richard Roxburgh was not convincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance! Set designers went aboard. Demeter's interior looks like a cross between an oil tanker and an old steel factory decorated with terrible lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. Prop-master must have forgotten that this film takes place in the year 3000 because the characters use weapons that look like today's .45 magnum and "Prof" uses a non-motorized, inactive wheelchair. It must be pushed around to move. Apart from one dry corpse, several impalements and one breakage is absolutely no gore. And vampire fangs and contact lenses look fake like hell. Add to this the most glaring, stupid and sudden ends: the Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one last (bloody) showdown with Count Orlock, they lock up in the control room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was modernized and joined narcotics, she used to be "Protheus 3.2 PB", in other words, pleasure-bot. So he says, "So what are you waiting for?" Humvee says, "You don't have to tell me twice. Come on, girl," she picks up and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" the ship explodes and credits roll. No sex scene, no Erik will see her tits, no bloody climax, ... One more shot of Udo Kier who reads the line on the monitor and is over. So this film is a must-see for every bad movie lover, but I have to warn them: sometimes it is really painful. And anyone who claims that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD, or even QUEEN OF DAMNED is the newest millennium's worst vampire movie, is obviously crazy or hasn't seen Dracula 3000 yet.
