What can you say about a 16mm, poorly filmed film where the German Shepherd is the best and most attractive artist? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this travesty at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find, because bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the US. I strongly recommend IMDb to re-visit its rating formula because 8.8 ratings of this faecal material are absurd! I am by no means prude and have spent many hours enjoying classic porn movies of the 70s and 80s; but this is a worse product even with looser standards (then illegal) loops.
