First of all, how can someone with his creativity on the right believe in a movie like this. I saw this movie and after a few hours I kept scratching my head for exactly what the director was trying to say. <br /> <br /> If his thriller, there is no excitement if his action, there is no action preventing the chase sequence, there is no Drama, and a much reported love story, it never actually takes off. No passion, emotion is nothing. Actually, I never expected the miracles of the movie, but after opening the bumper I thought it would give a chance. I have no problems with Himesh Reshamiya at all and I am not one of the guys who would silence him on any given occasion. I went out with an open mind and came out with a closed one. Don't blame Himesh Reshamiya, he's just a debutant actor. But directing, script, writing, makeup, everything that was worth throwing. Himesh is very stiff and will take a lot of time before the curve comes. He can fulfill his roles. Hansika is just a kid and it shows on the screen with her baby fat and the way she walks. The only actor who was good was a friend of Himesh in the movie, I don't know his name, but it looks promising. Watch it at your own risk, it's not even good to watch it over time. <br /> <br /> ** We strongly recommend preventing this movie **
