I don't know about the rest of the audience, but I'm personally dead and tired of Steven Seagal's films. When it came out of the law, it was a great action movie. Wahoo. Now in Patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal from above law. I'm tired of seeing any changes in character. It is the same character from time to time. He needs a change. This movie was probably one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. Calling it an action film gives it almost too many credits because there are too few action scenes and are spaced far apart throughout the movie. I think they wanted to go to some kind of drama, but it was a nonsensical attempt because the film does nothing but a regular, top-watched Steven-Seagal we've seen thousands of times. Get a new look and lose a pony's tail is all I have to say, I definitely don't recommend viewing this movie in any form, going out to eat, damn, rent Barney goes to Vegas, but under no circumstances can you rent this movie under the rule that Seagal will do great performance.
