Like most I rented it after I heard universal praise. And despite bizarre, inexplicable moments along the way, I was very interested and entertained over 100 minutes of the film. Then the two women set off for a "show" late at night. The rest of the film (which is another 40 minutes by the way) is even weighed against the first part of A, totally contrary to what I have already seen. Then the movie suddenly ends. Confused, I went to my computer to see if I could buy a clue what just happened. Nothing made sense and I'm a pretty smart person. None of these other user comments made sense even when they say "SPOILERS". I still have no idea what they're saying. Someone has a dream? Is not real? So what's the meaning of a two-hour 30-minute film if it's not "real"? Or is it real? I'm forced to choose. Be: <br /> <br /> [a] The film is a work of genius at MENSA level and I'm just too stupid to understand. The movie is weird for weird good and just doesn't make sense. Everyone who loves tries to save his face and pretend to "get" it. <br /> <br /> I'll choose [b]. Screw you, I'm going home ...
