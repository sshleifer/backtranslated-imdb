I bought this movie for 99 cents on K-mart a few years back (along with "Hawken's Breed"), which is definitely worth something with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe. It was not. "Dark Obsession" (the title I bought under) was a slight cut over "Hawken's Breed" (IMBD rated at 2.4), but not enough to keep it in the house. I threw both movies in the trash. This thing fails on many levels, it's hard to narrow it down, but let's say it's inappropriate, unbelievable, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even 100 minutes, too long. <br /> <br /> I love Byrne as an actor, but this schlock really looks bad on his biography.
