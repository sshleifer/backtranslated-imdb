It's hard to believe that a film that is bad can actually be released. The dialogue was unnatural. Particularly poor was the picture of the relationship between the boy and his future stepfather. I think you could say they managed to create an unpleasant dialogue, but what was said seemed false and artificial. There was no tension. The music was as bad as it was. The only reason I watched this movie was that I was living in the Death Valley area and wondering what places would appear on the screen. Fortunately, the movie was on TV so I didn't waste money by renting this apology for the movie! I sincerely believe that most amateurs could put together a more compelling conspiracy than mentioned here. It's too bad that the time of the whole film crew was wasted on such waste! I think the only positive thing I can say about the film is that some scenery was good.
