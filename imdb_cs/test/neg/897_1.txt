A long time ago, back in the early 1980s, she came to ABC's late night television show "Fridays", which attempted to steal limelight from a badly ranked NBC "Saturday Night Live". No, but it introduced some outrageous sketches and semi-gifted "comics" in the world. Such as Mark Blankenfield. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the "Jekyll and Hyde ... together" at the roundabout. Which is disgusting in all its own ways. Blankenfield is as gentle as a bench full of black cushions that turn off after reception. And so tasteful. This is just his drug character, which he played for the unfortunate "Friday" show stretched in length. And if you don't like it, why do you read this review? Whenever it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, this is a bad sign. Then, when it comes to dunder-headed jokes that would throw you out of every improvisation phase in the Western Hemisphere and replace gags with a rough edge, things can only get worse. Robert's Comedy The Story of Louis Stevenson? Perhaps a good idea to make a Poe sitcom "Fall of the Usher House". In addition to a few (very few) gags that give a slight smile, this whole film is a trash in waste - a waste of actors, a waste of film, missed opportunities. No wonder Stevenson's original author appeared in his grave. What more attention could the reviews give themselves? <br /> <br /> No stars. No, not even for Armstrong, who should know better. "Hyde" from this.
