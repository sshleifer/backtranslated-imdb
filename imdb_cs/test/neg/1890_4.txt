I didn't find out what the selected title has to do with the movie. This is another monster gathering, just like HOUSE FRANKENSTEIN. It's not a masterful plot, but Universal needs to earn money again. Dr. <br /> <br /> Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is either very ambitious or at the top in the ego department. He's working on a medicine to prevent Larry Talbot from turning into a Wolf Man. Count Dracula accidentally falls apart to get vampire. And rounding off good medical experiments is restoring the energy of Frankenstein's monster. Along the way, kind medical blood is corrupted with that of Dracula. John Carradine plays Dracula again. This time it's more convincing. Lon Chaney Jr. as usual is the soulful Wolf Man. Glenn Strange is a monster of Frankenstein who has very little to do. Also, the roles mentioned are Lionel Atwill and Martha O'Driscoll.
