Imagine that GILLIGAN'S ISLAND is located in the African desert in modern times. Add people nowhere near yachts like Captain or Marianne - and anxious enough to fill a German psychiatric office. Throw in a conspiracy that can only be interesting in episodic and literary parallelism that never reaches deep enough to truly satisfy. A season with a really annoying theme that has been exploited because the world's first passengers have been very, very lost. If the King is a product of the ruling gift of the Dogme 95 pupils, is this film trying to get the most attention? Dogme 95 is for Hollywood as the Danish Modern is Rococo. The Scandinavian movement, which is a by-product of digital technology, is trying to - utterly dogmatically - get rid of artistic creation by filming, using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling. For example, PEARL HARBOR is a Dogme Antichrist. The director / co-author of the saga Kristian Levring thinks about interpersonal relationships and human nature when he is in a life-threatening life. Eleven people aboard a bus passing through Namibian sand dunes suddenly find themselves trapped in the remains of an abandoned city. A local African who does not speak his language serves as an observer and narrator (whose observations are among the most prominent). As the strongest heads set out for a five-day walk to the nearest village, the others stay behind, survive on dented canned carrots and bypass their likely future as a vulture. Former thespian Henry decides that this somewhat annoying crew needs distraction, and manually writes KING LEAR from memory. He assigns roles, and the group goes through many days of study lines and rehearsals, in an effort to divert his attention from seemingly inevitable. Gradually the cast begins to lose, and the savages of their nature? Or could William Golding say that human nature begins on the surface. If you've ever seen Mr. FLY, you know that these things can be ugly, that being in a lifeboat situation can turn Mother Teresa into a KMSK thermocatlant. The film was made using an international set of American, English, French, and South African actors who dictate, develop, and play their roles in Dogm's dogma. The King was also filmed chronologically, adding a sense of realism to the ever-increasing despair of his characters. After up to three digital cameras were taken, the results were transferred to a 35mm film. The performance that forces the majority comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Pop Tart boho and tries to strengthen the spirit in any and any way he can. Henry (David Bradley) is another subtly played character whose passion for his life work will ultimately save the gang from utter despair. It is difficult to apologize to other cruel wives and their slave husbands, hairy old women, annoyed French intellectuals, rich men who have more important places than to leave the Namibian desert. Beckett might hate this question, but why is this group first by bus across distant Africa? Life-threatening morbidity! Express despair in graphic details! An inexorable tiring pace! Enjoy.
