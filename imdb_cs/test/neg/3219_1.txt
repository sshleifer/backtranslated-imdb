I'm crazy for mob / gangland movies so I rented this movie. This film is a complete wreck of the train. With all the great actors in this movie, I can't believe how bad it was. It was so bad that I started laughing hysterically at the end of the movie. An actor better known as Zues or a big guy from the Ice Cube movie "Friday" does an incredibly redesigned work throughout the movie. The first thing I told the sensation when I returned the movie was to remove this waste from the shelves. Don't borrow this movie if you don't want to spend two hours of your life. If they go on with it, I wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first. I'll be more careful when renting "mob / gangland" movies.
