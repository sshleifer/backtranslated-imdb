Despite being inconspicuous, misbehaving and inconspicuous, the flight to Mars is still fun despite what it is. The flight to Mars is planned with five people (three elderly gentlemen, Cameron Mitchell as a journalist and one female scientist / apparent love interest) "crew" of the ship. they have technological advancement that would become a blushing Earth, but everything is not pink in the underground cities of Martians (shown here as some caves and several rooms) Martians are a dying planet and one faction wants the Earthlings to repair the ship only to take it at the last minute and then mobilize to attack Earth and another faction wants to talk about peace and see if they can persuade Earth to give them living space. Personal effects here are pretty poor even for the 50th sci-fi standards complete with slow rocket movement, pastel / neon alien clothing, where women wear shorts that would make many blush (except men of course), and little less offered. The motorist Cameron Mitchell is a journalist and is pleasing if nothing else. ite Chapman is beautiful in very short shorts, but adds a little assortment. The rest of the cast is filled with some older science fiction veterans, such as Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum, who perform repairable jobs. It is not a first-class sci-fi movie from the Golden Age under any standard, but is very vigilant and fast-paced zippers.
