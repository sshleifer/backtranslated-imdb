The main prerequisite for this film is the imagination of every woman: the vagina that kills and eats the man. At least it is a fantasy for every woman who has fought against a man. What is 99.9999% of women? But don't worry it's not a cruel kind of men's food. It's more like a comic that throws them like a drain plug. There's no blood or parts. So for blood, guts and gore fans, forget this movie, not much gore here. The two main characters in the film are somewhat unrealistic. Helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. Meanwhile, Dennis is a nice guy watching Helen. The story is somewhat stupid at this point, but then fits into two other equally stupid sub-stories that send the film to the wrong Territory of B Movie. The first new sub-story is about Dennis finding a new love with a pair of connected twins; and then finally murdered one of them and became a refugee banker. The second new story is about Helen finding a new love with a nice policeman who saved her from a bad date related to prostitution and decided to marry her. In the end, Dennis and Helen meet again in the incredible conditions at the end of the film and the magical murderous vagina of Helena is cured!
