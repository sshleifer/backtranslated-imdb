Umberto Lenzi will hit new lows with this recycled waste. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out that the sister is part of the Jim Jones religious cult in New Guinea. He hires Robert Kerman's rough guide to help her reach the iconic jungle blend. This is another (!) Cannibal movie, and I would probably like it if not for Lenzi padding this movie with scenes from his superior "The Man of Deep River." I think every cannibal scene is directly picked up from this movie, which is about as trustworthy as Al Adamson. I felt ripped off. *** SPOILER *** 1/2 star and that's for the dildo scene.
