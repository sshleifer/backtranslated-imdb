The incident on and off the mountain road is Don Coscarelli's entry in Mick Garris's Masters Horror series. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the Phantasm series and the irresistibly strange Bubba Ho-Tep; but it doesn't bring any of the features that made these movies great for this TV episode. The storyline is a mill run that follows a routine image of an innocent pursued by a lunatic. This time it's a young woman riding a mountain road. After a sudden fall, she found herself in a position with a white maniac. The whole pursuit sequence is really ridiculous when a young lady stops so often to set traps; just for a maniac to appear a few seconds later, and this is shortened by the scenes that show her with her husband - who just has a lot of information about how to escape mad kills; with lines like "expect unexpected". The only real highlight for me was the presence of Tall Manu Phantasm, Angus Scrimm. Coscarelli strives to make the most of horror films as best as possible; with things like the dead baby's corpse - but because it's all so stupid, it's hard to take this piece seriously. This is the first episode in the series and the first I saw; I really hope it will improve.
