The film begins in Latvia just after the First World War. Being a teacher of history, I knew that multinational units occupy much of Russia at this time. There were serious concerns about the spread of Bolshevism, and the soldiers reportedly protected their nations' interests. But sometimes they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army because the nations involved wanted to see the so-called "white" victory. However, whites were deeply factionalized - some want the Tsar's return, some want a republic, and some want something in between. Because of these mixed goals and the lack of real commitment from foreign armies, the entire expedition was doomed and left the USSR after a year or two. But what I didn't know was that German soldiers were involved. This surprised me because they had just lost World War I and were not in the best shape to mount such an expedition. lady and her unhappy love for a childhood friend who is a German unit. He plunges on him repeatedly, but in any case rejects it. He then sublimates these desires with various matters. While none of this sex is all that is graphics, this and the basic reason why one is not interested in making it a rather adult movie and one I wouldn't show a younger audience. This movie is interesting, the overall film is as gray and lifeless as I have seen. I do not recommend it if you are not an amazingly patient person or you are really overestimating German films. I especially warn anyone who suffers from depression because it will undoubtedly make it worse. The simple fact is that there are so many better German movies waiting to be visited - such as MOSTLY MARTHA, DAS BOOT, MOTHER KUSTERS ARE NOT, WINGS DESIRE or ALI, FEARS ARE SOULS (inter alia).
