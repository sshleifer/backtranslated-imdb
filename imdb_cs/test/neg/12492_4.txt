I expected a lot from Mr. Sarkara's role, Mr. Amitabha Bachan, but I am disappointed. Being in the direction of Ram Gopal Verma was not ready for this kind of film. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is too dependent on power other than his. Tamil Nayakan is based on GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan. The film is well directed and remains in the hands of Kamal Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the film and simply accepts everything instead of changing things. The film does not show the strong influence of God the Father.
