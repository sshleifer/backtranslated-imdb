This movie is about a couple who decides to take a vacation on the Everglades along with another couple and a family dog. When they get there for the first time, the neighboring service, who heats them to stay away from the cabin in which they spend the night of the week, is not welcome. After annoying with the old man, the three villagers also do not kindly come to their arrival when they approach the car and threaten to leave. After asking about some local dummies who can't speak or just don't answer, they finally find a cabin. After settling down, viewers are becoming weird things, including discovering crap on their car, the man who is the head of the road, is the idiot who shoots a family dog ​​who thought it was a killer who grinned at the door and a series of deaths later in the end. Adding a church group has not improved this story. Then in the end, an idiot who survives all the suffering goes around the city carrying a gun shot. Lame. That's what this movie is.
