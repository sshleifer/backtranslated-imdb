Let me start by saying how much I love TV series. The nature of class war has always been a subject that deserves fun, but this television series uses it better than most. Chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy has always been electrifying and writers have written almost entirely flawless episodes every time. In my opinion, is the best British sitcom in the mid-1970s, overcoming the RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEST, ARE PROVIDED? and so on. With the ON THE BUSES series, which was completed a few years earlier, GEORGE AND MILDRED became another pride and joy of ITV (or ITV 1, as is now known), and looks forward to four years of channel operation. But the film is terrible in every way. The general nature of the television series has almost completely got rid of the authors of this abysmal film (who immediately notices that they are not the same on the show). As one commentator has already pointed out, Mildred lacks the sharpness she had in the TV series and does not come across as it would happen anywhere, as if it were too big. On the conspiracy, instead of focusing on the four-mile class war, it was the very basis of the television series, actually writing Fourmiles almost after the first half hour. The storyline, if you can call it, consists of George and Mildred, who go on vacation to a hotel and mingle with the gangsters. The most important talent in the form of Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond are wasted here. Most of them are well past their flourishing, and all of them look very embarrassed, as if they knew very well that the only thing worth paying for was a payout (which probably wouldn't be much). The jokes and gags in the film (if you can call them) rely heavily on traditional British farce, including wrong identities, embarrassing situations, poorly timed grotesques, characters that lose control of what's wrong with them. and general confusion. And it all fails. As another commentator said, it seems that the writers of this film have never seen a TV series episode and instead created something that would resemble CARRY ON romp. The scene where George is stripped of Sue Bond's character is especially out of context. The secret that this movie surrounds is BBFC certification - 15. Why is it rated 15 when everything is visible Is it harmless, unvulgar fun art? And the company behind the film, Hammer, well-known for producing top-quality horror movies in the 1950s to the mid-1970s, soon disappeared in complete confusion. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is almost complete. . My advice - skip and stick to the TV series. You won't miss anything, I assure you.
