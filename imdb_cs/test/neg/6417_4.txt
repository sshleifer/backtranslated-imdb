This is the worst job Daniel Den Lewis has ever done ..... I can't believe that in the same year he made this horrible movie and My Left Leg ..... a movie just for the Argentine people as a curiosity ... The story is impossible to understand. ..... The writer thinks that in Argentina all people speak English ... Of course, Patagonia brings a very good framework for film shooting, but that's not enough reason to see this movie .... I repeat, only if you are a Daniel fan Day Lewis, or if you want to see the south of Argentina, part of Patagonia, and you don't have enough money to travel alone .......
