The Sci-Fi channel thinks it's IS Sci-Fi; It is a shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, he and he, they persist. Some of Universal's minds should include BattleStar Galactica (New, Good) and Firefly for a short while in their line up. I know they know there is a difference between total waste and extremely high science fiction. A few years back, they were about how everyone is going high and powerful, making productions that were not just for us, lame-o Trekkies. Thanks a lot, Sci-Fi! You know, you're making movies so bad that even Trekkies won't watch them, so you've reached your goal! Fire snake, ice spiders, Manticore, Larva etc.and a huge relentless crap-storm later, and they are still spewing out faster than the latest influenza virus! How they do it is out of my ken. Why they do it, I just don't know. As they can ignore these reviews, comments, blogs, and emails, I don't even know, but it is clear that not many people think about their opinions or care about our opinions! He seems to think that what sci-fi fans want! Do you think that one or two good productions with some sense creep up when anyone is green on this holiday. At least they use the Misfit toy collection; Many of the science fiction film weeks actors were in science fiction shows once and now they need money. I love people, and I hope you get a better job!
