The lives of Megan (Jackie Kresler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott) change in the Nevada desert between Reno and Las Vegas. They stop eating in a small greasy spoon where they reluctantly find out about the infamous space 51 at the cafe owner (Jonathan Breck). After returning to the road in their forty-year-old Lincoln, the radio gets a bit crazy about Hitler's speech at the 1836 Olympics and then later the 1958 newsletter Elvis Presley is drafted into the army. The car is slowly falling apart, and both are in the horror of their lives as mysterious, inexplicable things happen in the lonely deserted radiation; remnants of nuclear testing. Megan meets a lost girl (Channing Nichols) and a wounded World War II soldier. The nightmare doesn't stop there. Kresler is impressive and writer / director James Lay makes good use of Patsy Cline. All in all, moderately interesting Sci-Fi.
