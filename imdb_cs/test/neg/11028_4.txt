When I bought 4 DVDs for Â£ 5oo at a local store, it was supposed to be enough warning that this movie doesn't match the usual David Selznick Productions standard. With a cast that includes names like James Stewart and Carole Lombard, I was looking forward to real treatment. As many other commentators have said, it is a strange mixture of conspiracies and scenes that is not entirely convincing. But I am so glad to have seen this film because now I have an unforgettable saying "Never leave the seeds so that you do not want to enjoy watermelon." This should summarize everyone's life. Choose the seeds or spit them out or swallow - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.
