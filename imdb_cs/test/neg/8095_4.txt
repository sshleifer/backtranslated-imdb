I usually rent this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this film, but the plot was saturated. The film was about nothing but just trying to stay after the contract when one of Jerry O 'Connell's friends got married. Other friends have put together this money and who is always the last to take the money ($ 10,000) from all their friends. By the way the film just tries to follow by not since then and trying to make it funny then do it because. I'm glad I paid only 0.50 for this movie. It wasn't good at all. I rated it **** out of 10 stars!
