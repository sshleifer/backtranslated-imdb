Although I seldom flew myself, I am interested in aviation ... and this movie has added to the rare laughter in the aviation cinema. Why does the captain conduct ground checks? Why does he even measure oil levels in engines? With a turnover of up to 15 minutes in commercial aviation, this is not a typical pre-flight check. <br /> <br /> 2. Why KICK Captain Against Aircraft Tire? Special pressure control. Or anger control :-) <br /> <br /> 3. The cockpit has a crew of 3. All large, western, twin-engine jets built since the 1980s have a crew of 2. Now try to guess how old the movie script is. 4. The helicopter can fly along a crippled plane. It must be fast ... and the captain's words explaining the "maneuver" to the passengers are truly cheerful! <br /> <br /> 5. With the elevator lifted, it is always possible to lower the aircraft nose. This happens, for example, when any aircraft moves slower than the stop speed. <br /> <br /> 6. The elevator elevator has hydraulic drives. After collision with a commercial aircraft, this would most likely break the hydraulic line, and would be unnecessary to drive, but would not keep it in a certain position. 7. Fire in the back deck was a stupid idea. It was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for a fire extinguisher and fight fire, no matter who trained it? stewardess. 8. At the time of the crash, the aircraft lift would be in neutral. The movie could end here ... <br /> <br /> 9. An aviation engineer (third person in the cockpit) has three poles on his uniform. In fact, the flight engineers have two. 10. Why does a captain wreck a cabin cab with an ax to examine the damage behind him? I thought it would be a flight engineer's duty, because he should perform technical checks before and after the flight. 11. There is no unused space in any aircraft. At least commercial aircraft cannot afford the luxury of space that can be filled with tons of water. I could go on and on ... but in the end I laughed hysterically as the screenwriters imagine aircraft catastrophes! Woooohooo! Most air disasters take place in such a short time span that you simply can't make a 90-minute move. But you can always fill 90 minutes with stunning and crazy bullshit, regardless of genre.
