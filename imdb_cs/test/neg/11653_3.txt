Based on the comments made so far, every film seems to hate or love it. I think it would be fair to point out that even if it's not a great movie, it has interesting moments. For one thing, it was filmed on site in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I can't remember but it's in credits). The place is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful, even to me who lived in Colorado for years. Furthermore, Disney has a passion for amazing actors. Harry Morgan has never been in a better shape than playing in a Disney movie. He's literally hysterical. Also remember the beautiful Mary Wickes? Although she has a "bit part" in this movie, she is great as always. If you don't know who it is, think of the animated version of Disney Hunchback from Notre Dame (it was one of the gargoyles) and was also the most interesting nun in the "Sister Act" as well as the best nun in "Angels Trouble". She has always been a great actress and most actors never get the credit they deserve. In addition to the character actors and all the star litters, in the 1960s and 1970s, Disney might not have "The Greatest" movies, but if you really watch some of them from start to finish, you'll notice that every movie has a really funny or hysterical moment. The whole movie may not be funny, but there is always a comic book jewel (at least 1 or 2) made in every single live Disney movie. Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his loud voice tones, or Tim Conway, who was swinging around, or Joe Flynn, one of his invaluable glances of horror, it's all good. The whole movie doesn't have to be good, but in every Disney movie from this period I've ever seen, there are always hysterical moments. Disney has always managed to make a smile in spite of the stupidity of the film. Bsed on these comments, I disagree with viewers who say that every Disney movie at this time is terrible. This statement is not entirely accurate. Rather, it is easier for me to give merit to fun moments and overlook the weaknesses in the charts. Some live action Disney movies are a real classic (Old Yeller, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins), but for those who aren't, I'm able to appreciate them for what they were - good family fun in when movies became vulgar, crude and offensive.
