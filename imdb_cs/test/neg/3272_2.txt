This film has one of the worst leading characters ever. I say this because it is created to be a hero when, in my opinion, everything he does in the whole film makes people's lives difficult and causes problems. He can't do anything right, but the film makes him look like a cool dude everyone should watch. He has offensive bouts of anger at all bad times, he has all the bad attitudes to things that ultimately make people angry at him and how they kill people, he's too curious, too ambitious, too macho, too much, makes all the wrong decisions sanity. It is a private detective hired by a successful painter to find a woman and son he left a few years ago. The detective finds a woman and what she thinks is her son. However, all kinds of things happen to make this story full of crime, drama and twists. Is it made for television, what do you expect? Anyway, the movie is pretty funny. Johnny Depp is very young in this and has a terrible 80s hairstyle. He chews gum and throws a soccer ball about 5 minutes, and that's all we'll see. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the VHS version of this sells for $ 40 in online auctions. It must be for Johnny Depp's collector only. It couldn't be a conspiracy. This can not be. <br /> <br />
