I can accept the fact that it was the NEXT karate kid, so Ralph Macchio can be happily retired from the series, and while Hillary Swank is great for the role .... the plot to the movie is just awful. Mr. / Mr. Miyagi's old friend from World War II dies, leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious granddaughter when her parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline, but he's a hero, because the local ROTC ... who'll explain to you in a minute, has it to get her. You know the drill ... Miyagi takes her under his wing and finally defeats the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after. His shepherd, his cheese, his 90s. but it is neither long nor short. My first case "huh?" Why is "military division" in high school? I thought it was in the sixties, especially in the public school. Like Michael Ironside, he digs the prey in his role as the main heel because when is the army involved in high school? My other gripe is that during the promo scene, militanti bungee jump to scare the crap out of people .... why? The things I noticed in all four movies were at the very end, when heels suddenly turned over all the nonsense that the main character had built (Billy in Part 1, Sato in Part 2, Kreese in Part 3). This film is no different. After Ned and his friends basically sabotage the older ball, he throws out Eric's car and threatens Hillary Swank with the whole movie ..... Ironside tells them to beat her and they're like "um ... no" making poor faces turn around, at least make sure The characters didn't do anything too over the top, like blowing into a hot rod. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the love plot between Eric and Hillary Swank. ... handy, but nothing to melodramatic, which is the breath of fresh air from the garbage Ralph Macchio pulled in the first 3 movies. <br /> <br /> For my own movie, after watching the first 3 movies, I can accept it's more or less a spin off ... but I can't accept the whole military thing, too unusual to be taken seriously. So if Ironside and the crew were a match / football team and be a coach, it would be more believable. Ironside and Morita deliver goods, Swank is fine ... the rest is the same as anything, one of the highlights is when they blow up a hot rod that was cool 4 of 10
