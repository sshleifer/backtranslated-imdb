This movie shows what you can create if you have a camera, some substitute paints and cardboard, a toy ship, a few friends who have acted in a community theater, and a misconception, you can create a movie. The end result is an unrecoverable time you skip if you don't pull it out of the DVD player and let it go through the window first. Acting in the opening scene (especially Lee Rotunda as 'Captain') and toy ship 'crashing' into the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you are in for (with all the foam, it looks like This "special effect" was shot in I think Boyette figured out that he washed some money by washing the dishes at once). As for the bad cinema, the funny thing is "Dungeon of Harrow", it seems to have inspired (perhaps coincidentally) the twist of the end of "Manos: Hands of Destiny". Yeah, it's the same lame "I was a victim, and now I'm taking a mad villain instead" an ironic ending. The more irony is that two clumsy, talented filmmakers could make two equally pathetic, horror movies shot in Texas and get away from it. Monotone Nerd Russ Harvey is noble in a great family (why they were great is never open), bored us while lamenting the death of his family's line and crest before his ship even crashes (we are also healing droning narration through film). Unfortunately we are not so happy. His family's toy crashes into some styrofoam in the sink, and he rinses ashore with his inflated captain and some woman comfortably placed on the insane earl's island. Meanwhile, the Earl visits the evil spirit who, dressed in Blackstone's Magic Kit, attacks him with various puppets (spiders, snakes, batsâ€¦ all those tempting things). The Earl (William McNulty) is worse off than Shatner and has a visibly difficult time to keep his face straight with a typical madman who rants. I'd be angry if I had to be in this catastrophe. The woman is immediately killed by the Count's furious dogs and both jerks are captured by his servant. The Count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear), killing his servant a lot (apparently his greatest joy), Fatboy is tortured, there is a woman who is a servant and one who is a nurse, rotting leper hag in -A-wedding dresses Countess in the dungeon (she digs Nerdy Noble and is the only effective and scary thing in the movie), a lot of other dialogue at the dinner table, blubbery captain gets killed while doing a wretched escape package of lions). . . it's all a nasty haze for me. I spent most of the time on the fast forward button. Anyway, the twitch of a nobleman and sister will make a run and think they will be saved by three boys in the boat on the lake (yeah, we believe the lake is the ocean). They don't, because you stupidly grab hair and scare potential rescuers. Frankly, I think they just took the opportunity to get rid of this nasty movie when they had a chance. She goes back to the castle, the nurse starts rotting like a countess (and that stomach, this time) and ends up saying that the two are going to descend. . . DUNGEON HARROW !!!! Blech! I like old, lousy horror movies, but they must have some fun value. I feel ripped off, even at a low low price of $ 5.99 for this biscuit. Mystery Science Theater would enjoy this fun. I was taken by several nutty reviewers who claimed that this film had an atmosphere and some spooky moments. Poorly! Avoid this tripe at all costs and don't waste a buck if you find it in the dollar bin somewhere. This film makes Corman "Terror" a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
