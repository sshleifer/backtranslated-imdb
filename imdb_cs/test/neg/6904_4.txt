Let's see ... a few dozen Gary Larson's gags, as well as his illustrative style, perhaps the legally difficult wholesale appropriation of Aardman's character, more than the generous sprinkling of artistic direction from various Pixar movies, positively the lion king-esquire villains living in what amount in the Elephant Cemetery. THE MIDDLE COUNTRY OF THE COUNTRY, oh, and the smelly Riverdance joke ten years of any possible importance. Children (three and five) liked it, but the boy, it was a move for dad. Just another weak attempt from Nickelodean Films to capture the explosion of animation. I truly want them to spend a little more money on character design for drawing a director on the script.
