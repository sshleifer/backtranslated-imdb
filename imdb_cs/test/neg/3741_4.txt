There was a lot of praise for Farscape, but I don't think it's that good. It certainly has a distinctive appearance, but it has almost everything else: story, purpose, direction, excitement; you name it. I'm a big sci-fi fan, and I'm doing a place to watch all the sci-fi shows I can do. I almost finished four seasons of Farscape and I'm not very pleased at this point. The show has several good things - most notably Claudia Black (who is unfortunately missing from the first few episodes of season four) -, but they are very few and very far between. As a whole, the show is marked by a lot of very stupid things (such as Fantasy elements rather than SF ditto), and many other episodes, especially. in season four, they are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured. And a man feels he won't go anywhere. They are mostly non-directional adventures with thin, long-running lines that develop very slowly. Sometimes it's a little tighter, but it takes just a few episodes at a time. Effects-wise, there are a couple of impressive things here and there (especially in space, at times), but they seem to show the same style of effects that sincerely ages quickly. Extraordinary and unconvincing puppet extraterrestrials mar show show, and I've come to prefer (by far) episodes where regular character-looking characters are focused. I think peacekeepers are by far the smartest and most interesting characters in the show; they succeed in being a convincingly foreign culture, despite their human appearance. There are several really cool episodes with them, esp. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton masks as Captain Peacekeeper and attacks and eventually destroys one of his secret bases. These episodes can score 8 out of 10, but I can't award the show as a whole more than a "4" rating. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Mierkeepers (which are too unambiguous in their own right), totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced, the show simply doesn't offer anything important or important you need to know or want to see. OTOH, it contains some good ideas and it's not a total loss. Of course this is my opinion, of course, but as an experienced sci-fi fan I think it counts something, it can help others. There are not many good sci-fi performances; but Star Trek (some series) and particularly the new Battlestar Galactica are definitely better than Farscape. But if you are a big fan of average science fiction shows, you can also like Farscape. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 of 10.
