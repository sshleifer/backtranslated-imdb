In this horrible mockumentary attempt, Blair Witch goes to Africa with a lot of people to investigate a creature called Half-Caste. Obviously there is no scenario and everything was improvised. This can work if you have good actors, which this movie didn't do. This film seeks to gain points for originality by exploring more dark myth and exotic culture. As a result, there are plenty of scenes in the bushes where characters make "weird African things" like eating elephant manure. There is also some pretty good shots of lions eating (from National Geographic perspective), but it's not the only fear in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you saw the Canalibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this movie will not have any surprises for you and you will probably be able to watch better lion shots on Discovery. Definitely half Aste effort. Note for filmmakers: guys, do us a favor and next time save your home movie "How I Spent an African Holiday" for your family and close friends. No one else wants to see it.
