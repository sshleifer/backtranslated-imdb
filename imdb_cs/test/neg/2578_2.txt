This is a known fact, Mr. Seagal can't smile, he can act, he can kick his ass, there are faint smiles, no real smiles, no laughter loud and no real point to watch this confusing movie. We see Mr. Seagal's overweight as Dr. Wesley Maclaren, who is in dire need of a haircut, and his real daughter Ayako stepped out as an assistant to his office. Story: Okay, so Wesley lives in another damn hinterland with his sweet daughter Holly. They sit and enjoy red tea and omelets, and at the other end of the city some overweight militia leaders decide to get the whole city sick by spreading a virus that travels through the air and kills in two days and thinks it can survive. he had an antidote. The problem, there is no antidote, and the one that exists holds the virus for a while. The CIA is being contacted, and neither can they help and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter Holly. And so it is hunted that the medicine is in her blood. Wesley manages to catch his daughter and take her to his grandfather, who is a Native American. Together with her sister in the Ann Law, they go to the base where the lab to find the cure is hidden, but even the soldiers are slowly dying there, and so are the others if they don't find the cure in time. And shorten the moment, neither Ann nor Wesley are infected with the virus ... hmm. One weak battle scene. The horrible movie and all the men in it desperately need a stair master.
