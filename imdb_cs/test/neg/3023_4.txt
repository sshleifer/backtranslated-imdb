At WASTED I hated two things: directing and script. I know I'm opening up to ridicule, but Stephen T Kay's direction is too much like .... like ... like MTV pop video. It is a picture (I think) of a digital video against a disturbing soundtrack, often out of focus and often with a fast cross-section. If you're not a teenager, you'll find that many WASTE segments are unavailable due to stylistic approach. Just as bad as the director was the script that tore off my chain. The story is told through Samantha, a poor little rich girl who spends most of the film speaking through her voice (Strange how voice over never seems too eccentric to come from the same character) and tells us the pressure of her tests, the pressure of her home life, her social loneliness and all this has led to her taking drugs. It's for similar reasons as the parental break that her two friends (I thought she was supposed to be lonely?) To start using drugs. Oh, poor little Sammi in her nice house and her problems, how my heart and heart hurt you - NO. It is not said that no matter what someone is addicted to, be it drinking, drugs, nicotine or chocolate, which one has to work to become addicted, they are not victims of external forces, they commit the law of free will. Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING have handled this point very well, people have become addicted because they want to. Rendering them as a victim is by no means a bad sponsorship and very likely dangerous <br /> <br /> By the way, if MTV is a drug substance, will it stop playing videos from stars that freely accept drugs?
