We saw it in a convenient local Asdy basket: £ 1.50 per DVD. Reading all the hype plaster all over the cover says "hillarious" it is, and it also had a really good, established cast, we thought it must be a great movie. So we bought, took it home, put it in a DVD player, sat down and waited for the funnies to start ....... and waited ....... and waited. .... and waited a little more. 90 minutes later, even though it was more than 3 hours, the credits were rolling, and that was the end. <br /> <br /> What a drop - even paying £ 1.50 seemed to be. God knows what Caine, Richardson and Gambon thought when they said "yes" to this count. And as for Moran: as I enjoyed the black books, Shaun of the Dead and his comedy tours, I felt he was beyond his depth in this film. He tried to play too much for laughter, probably thinking that if he kept the features of his book Black Books, he would work here. Unfortunately it was back. After a moment, the gags fell apart, and then he became an irritation. Which is a shame, because I think it's the right part to be a very good film actor. Anyway, to sum up: the actors in The Actors couldn't act !!! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
