I think I finally saw the worst movie I've ever done, and it hurts me. As a big fan of indie cinema, gay or otherwise, I had great hopes. But a few minutes into the film, the sheriff appeared and has my voice for the worst actor of this or another century. His appearances and the dialogue he had brought to me caused me an unusual step to stop the DVD in his track. A few hours later, when I resisted the courage to press the play button again, it was no better. In addition to the sheriff and his Christian racist MPs, the film has an attractive cast for which I felt really sympathetic because they had such a pathetic scenario. The idea of ​​the film is fine - by lynching homosexuals in the "New South" in the same way it was applied to blacks in the Old South, leaving "strange fruits" hanging from trees. We may have had a film with an excellent writer and director. Instead, we get false detective work, false reports of homosexuality and clichés with one good white man trying to save the day. I have no doubt that racism continues to flourish. The FBI is currently investigating a white school bus driver in the back forest of Louisiana, who forced the black kids to get to the back of the bus. But this city is a cartoon and it's hard to believe everything you see or hear. There are several subplots in a weak attempt to make the main character more multidimensional. Most of them, they also fail miserably. <br /> <br /> For a truly masochistic, DVD contains some deleted scenes that allow you to run on the cover. It's probably the first movie I believe writer / directors have to pass the test and get a license before they can make a film. Although I would be looking forward to seeing several church members in better films, I would be a strong witness to this director.
