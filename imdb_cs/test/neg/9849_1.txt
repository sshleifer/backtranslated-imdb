There are so many things wrong in this movie, and I don't know where to start. The story is not coherent. I guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will scratch his head. Here's what I remember from the movie before I was bored of unconsciousness: Quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters across the house, but turns out not to be so offensive after all. In the next scene, the girls are about 15. They go with their parents and hit the deer. The deer must have been explosive because their car exploded, one sister pulling the other of the burning debris. Then the girls drift in the boat on the lake and make a huge plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the next scene, the girls are hitchhiking towards the military base. And what is the military base. Actually, it's more like a pig farm transformed to look like a military base with a lot of confused compars playing "soldiers". The Base Commander's office is particularly amazing because there are random things on the wall like the AK-47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat attached to a plaque, so the audience certainly knows it's a military office. . Then there is a random dude who pushes the motorcycle and the base commander orders him to go "to the city" to buy some porn magic, and to make sure the soldiers don't think he's on the "pink team". So our character takes the pickup transferred to look like an army car "into the city" and loads a box from an indescribable "bookstore" with a front door blown doll. The girls are hiding in the car's car as they stop and watch through the porn stash to find things inside like "anal striker". I think it's enough of a plot to scare most people away. Fence aside, sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy symbolism attempts, as a radio preacher talks about forbidden fruit during a scene when "slutty" a nurse first encounters a main character, or how the camera persists for too long to try communicate "message". <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen it for sale or rent or anything, stay away. In both cases, it's not worth the money.
