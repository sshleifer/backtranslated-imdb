This is by far the worst "horror" movie, no, do the movie I've ever watched. Shame on Block Buster for carrying these stupid things. Never ask for a refund for any movie, but I think it will be the first. The movie is so bad that I had to stop after just 15 minutes of watching. <br /> <Br /> I had more fun watching one of the fuzzy movies on YouTube than watching this piece of fall. The marketing dude for this movie must have some sort of silver language that will move the thing to the device like a Blaster.
