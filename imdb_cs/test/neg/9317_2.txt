Help! Once again, Paul Schrader re-enacted his own intentions with a boring, pedantic narrative. I regrouped the holiday to see this "world premiere". What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an exorcist film? Noble intentions are fine, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological murmur, I would visit my son's Sunday School. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith as presented in his younger days is a potentially interesting topic. But Exorcist needs more! An unrelentingly rough presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, creates weird production. Who is this movie for? I didn't bother to see Harlin's version, but at least they tried to bring some visceral excitement. The Exorcist series was quite strange. The first movie was excellent, but every sequel was unpleasant and unnecessary. Why are they still doing them? I suppose Schrader did it so he could get a lot of money. But why should we go?
