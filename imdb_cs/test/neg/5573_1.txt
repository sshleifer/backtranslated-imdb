I can see that most of the comments have not yet been very positive, then at least positive. I do not understand that. The only explanation I can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the film because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It makes "Boggy Creek II" and "Mutant" look like masterpieces of horror. The activity is at best insecure and largely terrible. The whole movie is almost black, probably so that they can shoot it in the same place. The monster looks like something of Roger Corman's worst movies. And the plot ... well, the less it was said, the better. You have to avoid it at all costs.
