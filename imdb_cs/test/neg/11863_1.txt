I like dark humor and things other than PC, but not if it's purposeless, but to rise. Bashing a group of people without any trace of self-irony is crap. There are people who could make the concentration camp jokes funny, but who did this movie unfortunately failed even in a very easy task of making fun of the Turks in Germany. It is a very easy task, but if you are the equivalent of an inbred reddish breed in Germany (= inbred Southerner from a village where virginity is often lost to livestock), you will certainly fail in this and in your life. I have heard and seen so many funny things about minorities in Germany, but this "movie" (this piece of crap that is mentioned here is an insult to the next worst movie) sucks like a calf that the creators of this film met a few years ago.
