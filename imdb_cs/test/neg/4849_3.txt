This is the type of film that challenges your previous admiration for a director before you stop and recall that there are very few people whose body of work does not contain several clunkers. The cast in Lelouch's films is of the utmost importance, as it gives the viewer the form of characters. Actors have to bring the real magic of the screen to fill the intensity. Otherwise it's just hollow. None of the actors in this movie had any of those on-screen magic in my opinion. Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas have fallen far behind the lead. Irons is a talented actor, but he was wrong for that part. The dear wanderer didn't suit his powers. His spell mark also hit me with a false note. Iron's personality is too decadence-teded to fit into Lelouch's love story. Although I hesitate to pass any opportunity to hear the English accent, I also think that an American actor would work better. role. So many of the songs Kaas sings are so closely identified with a particular songwriter's Americanism that it seemed a bit disagreeing to Jeremy Irons's interest in love - even if it didn't matter. It still spoiled the flow of the movie. At least for me. Of course, it would have to be the real American. I think George Clooney would be great in that part. And it would bring the magic of the screen in spades. Brad Pitt could also do a really good job that brought him a special combination of charming and nervous. Patricia Kaas was also very disappointed. In reading about her I learned that she has a very successful career as a singer and many fans, so what I know, but I found her presence on the screen as a very boring singer. She was in fact a much better actress in her talking scenes than she was a singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell the song. Nothing she sang moved me. She was pleasant, but unrestrained. By contrast, someone like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and has only voice coach French, would have done this a million times better. Not to mention the amazing French talent that could be used. Patricia Kaas started watching the screen when there are so many charismatic French actresses who could be cast. <br /> <br /> Music was so important in this movie that it couldn't work without music. And because Kaas added so badly, the film never had a chance. Lelouch closed the fate of this film when he cast Patricia Kaas. JMO.
