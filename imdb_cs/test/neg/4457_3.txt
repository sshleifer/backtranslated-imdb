Evidence to prove that Hammer should leave his vampires firmly in Victorian age. After all, vampire is about suppressed sexuality, so the concept is irrelevant in London in 1972, with its thirty something that pretends to be rude teenagers. Remember that at this time Hammer went wrong. The public was tired of the horror in the salon in the fifties and sixties, so the studio tried to return everything, including enough nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, et al.) And updates of their characters - none of which seemed to be Hammer Two years later it there was a grave in it. Shame ... <br /> <br /> But I still have a big favor for the classic Hammer period in 1957-1965.
