"De Dominee" is based on the life of a real Dutch gangster Klaas Bruinsma! The film's name is Klaas Donkers! I have doubts that the events in the movie have something to do with what really happened! But it does not matter! Because I couldn't catch my attention! This movie made me bored! She lacks essence and style! A substantial part could be forgiven if it were good and if the director tried to do something original! Without this substance you have to bring at least some style or decent action! Don't we need to have fun? It would help if the director saw more gangster movies! Obviously not! Otherwise he wouldn't do it the way he did it! This film received a lot of publicity due to the small scandalous surroundings of Klaas Bruinsm and a member of the Dutch royal family! This scandal has nothing to do with film! Without it, "De Dominee" would never be successful! I'm sure of that!
