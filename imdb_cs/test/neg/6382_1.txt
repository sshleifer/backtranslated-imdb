I got this movie from the library and saw it has a lot of actors in it (John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc.), So I saw and watched. I expected Cleese to have a big role because he had his first billing, I was surprised to find he had about five minutes of time on the screen, like everyone else I liked. This film is incredibly pointless, the characters are nobody, the story is non-existent and the end is one of the worst ends I've ever seen. There were some funny parts, but that's about it. Stay away from this movie if you want to prevent "What?" and "Huh?", a lot. And if you don't want to waste time. Ignore people who say it's a very funny movie ... it's not. Stay away from her at any cost ... please.
