This was the first feature film for almost everyone involved, including director Teck Tan, so he deserves credit for his pull. However, this film was unpleasant in its direction, preaching in its style, exaggerated and too politically correct. The plot was everywhere to prevent any aspect of its development. The gangsters got involved in the story, even though I'm not sure what their presence added to the film than to make the film even more unrealistic. It could be completely omitted and the result would be a film. The story is about a young ethnic Chinese Malaysian returning to her home country after studying in the West. His studies brought him back with skills he thinks he has to fulfill his dream of driving a rock band and taking them to the top of the Malaysian charts. The beginning of the film points to a conflict with his traditional father, but as soon as the gangsters engage, this part of the story is dropped. Unfortunately, the way these aspects have been put into the film either seemingly terribly invented or downright disciplined. There is a nice scene of Malaysian women doing a beautiful traditional dance on the beach, but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems to be forced and unnatural. Acting was somewhat amateurish, and the male leadership was particularly unconvincing. Malaysian lead female was a remarkable exception that left the most positive mark. The film is also openly gay in character, and although it is a bit of a cartoon, it provides some of the most entertaining moments in the film. But the film was barely a notch over the typical local TV soap drama. Sadly, this film, which is not in the slightest attack, has been banned in Malaysia. 3/10
