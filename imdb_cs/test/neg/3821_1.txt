I have read recent comments and I could not wait to see a movie. However, after sitting over 80 minutes of predictable "weirdness" that neither made me jump and unrealistic villain, I was left overwhelmingly disappointed. I thought cartoons were the only films that were only 80 minutes long. I thought it might be because of the adjustments that the "R" rating was rated, but the original contained only ten minutes of another "Kill Bill" blood. When blood sprays like a hose, reality loses its attraction. Add in a killer to be a "ghost" but he can rip someones head off his jaw (ala king kong with t-rex), he lives through everything and has an end similar to that of sopranos and you quite possibly have the most exaggerated movie last year. After watching the movie, I felt like I saw countless movies with the same chart and method and also felt very dissatisfied. I don't know what everyone else has seen in it, but if you want a good horror this weekend, see Halloween, it's definitely worth $ 10. When it comes to Hatchet, hopefully another one will be based on the book.
