Hey, I'm a fan of such bad movies, but nothing so bad-so good about Rise Of The Undead. It's just so bad and that's it. No redeeming cheese, no unintentional humor, nothing! - Boring Apocalyptic Zombies ("Undead": a few people with almost no makeup) Nonsense with lame special effects (if you can call these effects), stupid plot and annoying actors. They also have the courage to break away and quote from other (better) movies (Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Comet) and have managed to sleep on my side. However, it was Rise Of My Eyelids once the end credits rolled though. My advice: save money. It's not even worth hiring if you want p * ss off and / or put some people to sleep, then go ahead and give it a spin. You have been warned;)
