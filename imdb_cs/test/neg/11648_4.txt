The story was not good. <br /> <br /> No special effects. Acting wasn't ... very good. others, I felt that there was a lot of holes in the conspiracy that you could fly with the shuttle. I thought the end was incredible. By the way, guys, about "burner in space." Blow burners have their own source of oxygen (hence the name "Oxy-Acetylene Burner"). Two hoses run from the lantern: one to the acetylene bottle and the other to the oxygen bottle. <br /> <br /> So the "blow torch" would work fine.
