Abysmal pulp adventure use in the women's jungle genre. Fortunately, lousy audio conceals a stupid dialogue. And it's terribly blunt for a movie about people who don't speak English. There is no adventure; It's a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wild animal attack that happens in flashback. Three pale faces travel across the African wilderness and meet the warring men-hungry tribes of the Amazons. These wild women have advanced from the Stone Age to the point where they have made makeup, shoes, and armpit hair removal technology. Despite their desperation for "hus-bahnd", ladies insist that they will fight with men and burn the weaker ones. The only thing of interest, as if it were a question, is the assortment of a young woman dressed in animal skins cleverly designed as a 1951 swimsuit. No nudity or significant violence. On the other hand, you can be buzzing a catchy native song for days.
