Just as powerful as the real story of Phoolan is that this book is based on came out before she herself was released from prison and had a chance to say it. She is allegedly based on her diaries, but is illiterate. How does it work? That means some areas of the movie are accurate and acting is not bad, with some sensitivity. Indeed, although this story must be old in the TV series. Far it happens to drink for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Read her autobiography. Highly recommended. It's a fantastic story.
