Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "Zombies") is a rare finding? a movie that promises one thing, but brings another. This is one of the few genre films produced by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for producing various action films and class B thrillers, some with action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. Karen Tunny & her two daughters Sarah & Emma arrive in Pennsylvanian Addytown to move to a big house Karen's late wife owned after finding a mining action in his house. Once they arrive, they find that the house is very old and needs repair. But the state of the house is the least of their problems because they find that the area is prone to disappearance and Karen is confronted by the owner of the area and ordered to move out. Once the night falls, Tunnys finds out why they died: a group of zombie children killed in a mine breakdown in the area more than 85 years ago, comes to kill anything that goes into the forest. With the help of a lousy neighbor, Karen tries to end the curse before her children become other victims. one thing: the film is more like a spirit story than your usual zombie movement, while dead children are the epitome of the curse that chases the woods, taking revenge on anything that moves at night (although the inner logic is somewhat defective? Only by sacrificing animals and being repelled by blood on the door in the same way that vampires are repelled by garlic & mirrors? aren't these kids supposed to be zombies?). The storyline itself would not be a problem and would be really fun, but the main problem is that the producers have modified the script with the intention of making a zombie film just to fall on that face. As such, such a film would be fine as a ghost story, but due to a bad script it becomes nothing but a routine effort. The greatest strength of the film is performances, while cast gives better performances than the film deserves. The peculiarity is Scout Taylor-Compton, which has its role quite well? it's a shame to destroy his genre credit with a very bad performance in HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombie's script).
