I had to be in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie 3. What's wrong with it? Let's start with gratuitous sex, even though I admit that the rotating style of bonking was something I had never seen (or experienced) before. And I think they also saved a few dollars by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are discrepancies. The "Oakville Tribune" seems to be in the green part of any city to be. Yet in the rooftop scenes it seems to be in an industrial zone with a steel mill that spews smoke and flames. Also, the interior of the building - editorial staircase - appears to be much larger than the exterior. SPOILERS HERE Afterwards, when our intrepid reporter finally fires, he returns to the building several times, once in an hour. Hardly likely. The end is also woefully predictable ... a classic bait and a caper switch in which a good guy turns out to be bad. But my main objection is that it is another film funded by the Canadian and Ontario tax breaks, which is ashamed of settling in Canada, but again demonstrates that the Canadian film industry is cowardly and opportunistic. Country films must do more than just provide jobs. They should reflect culture. It's bad enough that American studios use Toronto as a stand in New York. But it's embarrassing and angry when Canadian producers (in this case CanWest Global) do this with the help of federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BAH!
