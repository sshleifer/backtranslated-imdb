In 1936-1939 Peter Lorre created a number of very successful films by Mr. Moto. While technically B-movies, they were much better than the typical genre films. However, Lorre tired of making these highly repetitive films and told friends he wanted out of the series. When he was canceled in 1939, Lorre was thrilled, but his plans to get more complex and satisfying roles didn't happen when he moved to Columbia Pictures. DOOMED MEN IS ONE OF THESE FILMS AND IT'S pretty clear that the studio doesn't put much in the movie because I think the storyline was written by penguins. Talented penguins, maybe ... but still the film didn't make any sense. It starts with the fact that one agrees to be a secret government agent. It is supposed to infiltrate the island in the US where something strange. Now they could easily get a search warrant. But as the penguins wrote the film, the agent takes the rap for the murder he didn't commit and spent a year in jail. Apparently he hopes to be released on this island because there are so many parole sent when he finishes this term. <br /> <br /> There are some serious problems with this idea. Firstly, they only have him one year before it is afternoon - but he was convicted of Murder, and he refused to tell who he really was. In that case, they would never apologize to anyone. Second, what if he wasn't on the island? He would spend a year in prison for nothing! Thirdly, why not only divers or paratroopers or cops on ships come to the island?! Talk about a conspiracy plot! Once on the island, the agent discovers that the evil Peter Lorre has set up his own private prison and cast him with the boys for release as slave labor. What about the men who must report to their officers? It has never been explained, but Lorre used them to extract diamonds and was abominable. Another question I had was that if Lorre discovered huge diamonds, he was a very rich man. So why not just PAY people to my diamonds?! Why set up your own version of Devil's Island and wildly defeat and kill a man?! Finally, Lorre gets what's his and the island's slaves are released. Until then, I really didn't care. Overall, we can observe, but rather stupidly. Lorre's career just turned for the better when he moved to Warner Brothers the following year. With films like the DOOMED MEN IS, I saw why his stay in Columbia was short.
