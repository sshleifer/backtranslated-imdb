The Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of murdering their daughter. People are beginning to wonder if they did. The police are investigating and finding suspicious evidence. The couple is angry with the public and charged with the press. The police speculate that they are satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. They are charged and brought to justice. They are represented by publicity lawyers who give them bad advice and charge them for $ 100,000. The evidence presented against them is distorted or hidden by the police. Information on sexual abuse is presented. Their next child is taken and placed in a children's home. Dougherty is pregnant and gave birth to find her baby. Verdict, she didn't, but she did. He goes to slams with a sentence of 45 years. In the last third of the film, with Dillon in jail and Dougherty wondering what to do next, we see people who were antagonistic now slowly coming to defend the pair. Witnesses admit they lied. Other facts are brought to light, which ultimately leads to Dillon's release. The killer will never be found, even though the film gives us a thorough whacko as a credible perp. <br /> <br /> This is a reflection from start to finish. Nothing seems right to the couple. There are a couple of happy moments, maybe a party where everyone is happy to be together and tear with joy, or some evidence to their advantage and people are hugging. But it never takes long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all faces are frozen by tragic mistrust. (Usually follows a fade to block.) There is not necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies, although I cannot imagine the pleasure of seeing people. There's also a lot of tragedy in Shakespeare. I assume that what we find interesting on tragic stories lies in the way they are told. "Oh, but I'm a fool of Fortune!" Romeo cries after killing Julia's brother. Here's Dougherty running in her robe across the hospital corridor, shouting "Where is my baby ???" There is no ambiguity or irony in the story - as I am sure it must have been in the real life events it is based on. People are either good or bad here. Or otherwise they are bad, then good again. The film is not focused on exploring human unpredictability, nor on the way things work. His goal is to tear the audience away. Actors provide first-class role models. I don't remember the last movie I saw so many tears. There are tears. Showers. Their cascades. Real Niagara of them. Lake Lacrymose of them. Well, I'll give you one example of the effectiveness with which the movie is created. Dillon and Dougherty hired a Chicago policeman who works as a private investigator (Ed Asner). Asner likes them, but he doesn't really do much. He seems to be in the film not because of his importance for the case, but because he can provide the victims with a few philosophies - "He will learn to live with him," which is fine - and because he is suffering from colorectal cancer, so we can see how he marries medicine, doubles pain and eventually disappears. What is frustrating about the film is that when it focuses so hard on the suffering of a couple, it overcomes one of the more important issues it raises - the gossip function in regulating private lives. Gossip is a really special thing. If we call it "gossip", it's bad, but if we call it "public opinion," it sounds at least to say the least. Of course we all have convictions about matters that may or may not be justified. (As I write, Michael Jackson is brought to court again accused of harassing a young boy, and I wonder how many of us are excited about this report and immediately thought he was a pedophile.) But gossip isn't bad either. It's like water. When properly managed, it is a community asset. We need gossip to keep each other in line. It helps us keep public order. But like the flood water or the tsunami, it is devastating for the village when it rages out of control. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that's fine if you're not looking for too much. understanding human nature. It's so clever that it's hard to argue with his goal, given his goal.
