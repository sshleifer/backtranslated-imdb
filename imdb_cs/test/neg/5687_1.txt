I knew it would be a bad movie when I rented it, but I was hoping for a good bad movie. Well, she had fun making fun of endless sand trudging, eating camel dung (well, actually aubergine) and strange grimaces that I thought were about five actors. The DVD needs a director's comment to find out what he thinks ... or if at all. I can't believe they actually went to England, Australia and wherever they did ... it could be done. It would be better if she managed to get naked. Best line movie? "Waiting for his upgrades." "Yeah, you're still waiting." Now that it was great! If someone had more than 3 pages of dialogue (behind the storyteller .... TURN OFF), I'll see it again.
