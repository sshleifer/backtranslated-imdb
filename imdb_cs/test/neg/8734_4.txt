Although Embryo might be a potentially provocative examination of bioethics, it would degenerate into a stereotypical parable of Frankenstein, somewhat somewhat somewhat lessening that some areas were intended for entry or study. Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent aborted children from dying. Upon success with a dog, he jumps immediately to a medical ethic violating a person and any sense of credibility - with the same unrealistic help from a hospital administrator. His experiment works too well, with some definitely unpleasant side effects. Although Barbara Carrera is reasonably good in her role and some of the animal training is spectacular, the movie is too fantastic. Although the prologue report assures viewers that it is a contemporary technology, the scientific work described here looks far in the 21st century, let alone in the mid-1970s. The scene where Carrera is able to find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering by simply questioning the computer is ridiculous.
