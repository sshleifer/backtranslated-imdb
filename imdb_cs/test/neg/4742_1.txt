My qualifications for this review? I own all Alien and Predator movies and I have and have read almost all the books I can find in this series. <br /> <br /> I can safely say this movie is Stinker. Save your money and don't waste your time. If you like mindless action, mindless gore, no plot about how to talk about Hollywood, check out the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a reputable fan of the Alien series, send a message over stuffed, over paid suits in Hollywood and 20th Century Fox and don't give them a penny. This film has so much plot holes in it that you can sift paste through it. Read other negative reviews to get a big picture, that's all, so I don't have to repeat them. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are cardboard. You want everyone to be dead. And the film won't disappoint, almost everyone will die. Even the hot, bubble was blond. Are you sorry? No way. No land, no character development ... who cares. Predators are now also idiots. They scan everything except their own dead warrior. It's supposed to be a high technology company, right? In Predator, they searched the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. Trophy kills. They watched Charles Weyland at AvP and let him go because he had cancer. Major Plot hole! Rating R is also because they have children in a movie that gets a hugger face, lots of gore and violence and there is one hospital scene where very large pregnant women are injected with a bursting chest. She is implanted with a Hybrid Alien with 4 or 5 eggs in the mouth-to-mouth love-scene-orgy and they all hatch, say, 30 seconds. Stunning gore a lot, nothing more. These scenes are ridiculous, not serious. It's almost like violence and Alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, thumb up or some nod. Foreigners in this film are all on performance-enhancing drugs. It develops quickly and spreads rapidly across the city, tons of them, everywhere in record time. Pathetic because it does not stick to the story series and adds nothing to aliens, Aliens Predator continuity. I've noticed that positive reviews are written by people who love gore. Ridiculous. As a film, as a sequel to foreigners' franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator series, this film is in the best case a curd with curd. If you followed this series faithfully, all the rules are violated and the aliens and predators are reduced to comic characters. There is no fantastic, unforgettable action scene. There are almost no special effects worth remembering. There are no game tags. The plot is as thin as the onion paper, which finally ends: "We have two ways to get out of this mess ... Hospital or city center!". I am wet myself. The city center means every brother gets into battle with the Big Brother, who somehow knows that the city has been infested because he has AWAC in the air that can see radar infestation in special Red Spots effects. I just got out of my chair. Special Effects Red Spot Extraterrestrial Radar on AWAC over Central America. I split my intestine with laughter. I have to get into the Pad helicopter by choking on popcorn. Did anyone play a game called ZOMBIES!? You have to win your playing pieces into the Helicopter Pad. I almost laughed. The end is enough to shake your head in amazement. Who has 20th century Fox rented this script!? Oh, OH, ask me ... a class 5 student. There can really be no other answer. Yes, there may be another answer ... Low Budget Cheesecake Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> End? "Col. Stevens takes the Predator pulse rifle to Mrs. Yutani (Francoise Yip), tells him that the country is not ready for the technology it represents. Col. Stevens knows that Yutani doesn't want technology on Earth to be used." You're kidding me, aren't you? Mrs. Yutani? Who is Mrs. Yutani? (forshadow: Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She is exactly 2 seconds in the movie and yet, in her infinite wisdom far east, she says the world is not ready for this technology. Seriously??!! Dweeb Brothers (Strause) as Directors? Who is responsible for this bleeding-abortion movie? They are Doug and Bob McKenzie's directors and yet Fox entrusted the slacking of Alien's franchise to them. They are offered as special effects experts, and yet the film is all low budget special effects. Hmmm, I see the pattern. Laughter. <br /> <br /> This film is only made to empty the wallet. It has no other purpose. He has no conspiracy. It has no main characters worth mentioning. It's incoherent. It does not follow any of the character principles set out in previous films. He will do nothing to make progress. Special effects are lame, minimal and low budget. And that's not the end of it. It's a low budget and is strictly designed to make your hard earned money. Nothing more. <br /> <br /> Save your money. Either watch TV, where it ends very quickly. Buy a smuggler or skip this bleeding ulcer completely. There is a reason why Fox did not preview this film to critics. Critics would feed this mess and no one would go to the theaters to see it. JR Giger, the original creator, is at the moment, leaning on the toilet that spills his lunch. 20th Century Fox, This Movie Is Smelly. It's so bad or worse than Alien 3. You insult us. <br /> <br /> Start now ...
