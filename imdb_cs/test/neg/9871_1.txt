Whether this adaptation of the Marvel comic book was done? and peeled ?? so his manufacturing company could retain the copyright of the characters, it does not change the fact that it is utter waste. Doom Doom and (especially) costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else suffers from a lack of cash or talent. Director Oley Sassone can't even point the camera at things without including such backdrops as POV blind women, the dialogue is totally restless, team costumes are not right and the effects are frightening: the human torch seems to be drawn on a felt-lipped film while Mr. Fantastics are revived by using a stylish blue glove with a glove at the end. Joseph Culp compensates for the necessity of wearing a mask by waving his hands wildly, Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hits different levels of horrible, and while it's hard not to love all these people who thought this movie would get a release, that's just as difficult Imagine that any of them believe that it was actually some good.
