Well, it was very good ... but the best picture? Please, not close. Munich was better, Capote was much better, Good Night and Good Luck was much better ... Broken mountain - well, it should win! The Academy voters seem to act as the current Democrats - please just a little bit of everyone, but don't dare to take concrete positions. That's why we have a complete moron in the office in the US. This was a WORST AA presentation ... and forget about 1987 ... ever since. Hollywood is so afraid it can't be "straight". Many voters did not even see the Broken Mountain. Be real and get on with it. Since I was watching in the mid-1960s and I was only two, it was the most miserable year. <br /> <br /> Wake up wherever you are. Hollywood IS mainstream, and that's what happened with the Box Office in 2005. King Kong, the latest movie Star Wars, another Batman movie, re-make or anything from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and much more to come in 2006 . <Br /> <br /> At least there were original best photos, ie Munich, but the one heard, Capote - great; Katherine Keener should have won, though now we know that Reese can sing like Cash / Carter, etc., Syria was much better than Crash. The movie has been done since the early sixties and we have to do the best movie? What is a terrible Oscar night and a terrible year that will end in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. At least BAFTA for Best Picture went to Brokeback, and what about the horrible song she won? Pathetic. I think there's only about 20 years left as America or the US before anyone comes and changes anything. Maybe it will be China because it owns so much of this country ... or India because they have all the high-tech jobs and are the largest democratic country in the world. America has become a land of fat, pathetic and stupid. Waste can be found in more places than Florida, West Virginia, South Dakota and mid-West. Drive local McDonald's or Burger King for good. Order everything you want until you get a heart attack. Get out of your misery.
