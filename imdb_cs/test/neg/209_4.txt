Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, should get together with a much smarter effort, as this one slips into category B and could be done with unnamed actors and a much smaller budget, as well as 2 armored cars and waste stock couldn't run around too much. As writers failed to come up with an intelligent robbery plan, they focused on the drama of the situation, but there wasn't much. Fishbourne and Reno don't bring anything in this movie except media interest, it's just expensive advertising. Dillon's fine, but this was a walk in the park. The main character choices, Ty Hackett, are quite uninspired and the final, with "reward" is pretty childish. Wasting time, money, actors and so on.
