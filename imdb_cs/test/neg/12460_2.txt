SPOILERS! I gave this movie 2 out of 10 for 2 scenes I will never forget ..... by the way, my husband rented this surprising non-blow 'em up almost chick looking in quick motion. but I guessed why, when I saw the cover .... girls in school uniforms .... duh .... lol .... ah well, men when ya can't beat 'em connect' em. .... ;-) <br /> <br /> Bijou Philips, one of my favorite on indie screen ... too cute ...... not only gets into the bestiality (her dog is the best lesbian in town by her lively character) ..that would be the first valuable scene .. <br /> <br /> Then she enters the toilet in a beautiful robe and goes to the booth ... after a while, she goes out to the party she and the pathetically sad 'Cat 'the character are on, & the hands of a shiny silver ice bucket on the party host ... the guest is looking into his precious bucket of silver ice and says, "oh my god is that poo." <br /> <br /> for her creativity and unusual selection of films, that would definitely be one of them ... and um, I'd rent it for the poo scene if I was you ..... I'm not a big fan of poo jokes, but it definitely puts on " party people ‚Äù. look like they have a good time as well ..... lol) ... you will never forget these two scenes ... hmm, but is that what we want in our databanks? .... maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all .... lol <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain is a kind of squirrel & sad in her confusing nonsensical role in 'Tart'. I don't know, I can't decide if I like her because it's so in the independent movies? India movies are amazing & everything but couldn't choose a few good ones? I'll look at some of her movies and reserve trials .... but this was (sorry for the animals link) the dog .....
