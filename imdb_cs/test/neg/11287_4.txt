I don't know about real Cobb, but I have a clear impression that the goal of the filmmakers was to try to alleviate his jagged edges and reputation, not to give us a real portrait of the man himself. In the film, in addition to several racist remarks, he is shown to be just another hard-nosed, cantakerous old coot (he is so full of life!) With a heart of gold (more or less). This is also the worst acting I've seen T.L.Jones it (he won't bring anything new or subtle to his stereotypical character). He just doesn't do Cobb to pull me into the movie. Not for one minute I forgot that it was Tommy Lee Jones pretending to be Ty Cobb on the screen. Robert Wuhl didn't even impress that. The "comedic" elements in this movie were just annoying and didnt ring at all. Bloody waste of time, that is
