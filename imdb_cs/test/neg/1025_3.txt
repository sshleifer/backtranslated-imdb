Although not a big fan of Coen Brothers, I am an admirer of their dark humorous films like 'Fargo' and 'Miller Crossing'. I was much less impressed by their next comic regime, a goofy camp (or is it Goofy's camp?) Unfortunately, 'Oh brother, where are you Thou?' falls into the second category and is not as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'The Hudsucker Proxy.' 'O Brother' is basically an episodic series of in-jokes without a big point, and not everything that is too humorous or clever. As most reviewers have noticed, the movie's plot is very loose? and, as I could say, completely arbitrarily? based on Odyssey. His main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an 'adventurer' like his Homeric namesake and has as his 'real' goal a return home to avoid his wife Penny's marriage to a suitor. Of course, we won't find out that this is what Clooney / Ulysses wants, not long after we stopped caring. And what Homer has to do with "Cool Hand Luke" gangs, Ku Klux Klan meeting la "Indiana Jones" iconic meeting, disbarred lawyer dictionary, talent for blue-grass country singing country music, association with Baby Face Nelson, hairstyle Clark Gable lookalike and other random and different character traits and encounters? I'll let the others recognize it. The allusion to Preston Sturges 'Sullivan's Travels' in the "About Brother" title is just as absurd. Yes, viewers who are familiar with the classic Sturges classic comics might find it slightly beneficial to recognize the title of a socially conscious film, Depressed Sullivan, who leaves Hollywood and the comedy she hopes to do. And they can even be slightly amused by several riffs of shots / scenes (eg Hopping trucks and chain gang shluffle in the movie). But what? It seems that the Coen brothers have nothing to add to the critical debate about art and moral high esteem about the function of art. Apparently, they fall into a former school, but that doesn't seem to motivate them in the least. Is it an honor? If so, why? I like postmodern pop culture link and text games as well as another person but it's much nicer when it means something at least tonally, if not thematically, consistent ?? and not just an arbitrary mixture. This scenario is simply a stupid mess. The only consistent and consistently pleasant feature is the soundtrack folk / country. It doesn't have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but considering the rest of the movie it's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I would recommend using the audio CD entry price.
