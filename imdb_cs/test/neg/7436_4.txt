The problem with this movie is that it can't use Bill Murray to the best of its ability, simply because it's a co-star. <br /> <br /> If it was a road movie with another comedy actor, it could work. Even if they both tried to get an elephant across the country, at least it would allow them to share some fun dialogue. As it stands, Murray is left talking to an elephant who can't answer back with a humorous joking. Basically, that means Murray talks to himself, and that makes the movie more boring than it might be if he had a different character to bounce. Children would enjoy this movie, just because an elephant, but anyone who wants to watch Bill Murray biting and enjoying a great script has to look elsewhere.
