Nothing ever happens to be a COMOD with the beautiful Jill Hennessey as shrinking (!), But KvC is not as bad as I expected with the SYFY quick channel. Just make sure you're watching it when you're drunk or stoned, or when you're trying to sleep. The unique name basically says everything: A group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a governmental attempt to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. Giant creatures who came into contact with vegetables took over the island and all ate. So now the government is preparing to blow up the island, no matter where people are. Acting is a wonderfully appalling, especially mustachioed general directly from the TV series INCREDIBLE HULK, but this is typical of this kind made for the schlock cable. CGI creatures are at the TV level, which means that you know you are watching cartoon monsters. However, two of the gals in the group are very cute, and it's worth watching how they run here and there in their tight little clothes. You just want to eat them!
