Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity! I wasn't surprised to see that the woman had a hand in this dreadful "woman woman" and I mean it in the worst possible way. The problem is that it might be so good if they missed Jane Eyre's things and got stuck in much more interesting scenes with Spanish / Portuguese Jews in London in the early 19th century. When a soundtrack is better than a movie, you know you're in trouble. You get even worse when you quickly advance the video because you can't build the movie, just to make sure you don't miss anything. This film will end up on the Romanesque TV channel where it belongs.
