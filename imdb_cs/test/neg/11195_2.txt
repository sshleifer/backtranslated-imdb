This show started fine but then turned into a nightmare. The worst was the contestants. Most of them were strange. They did stupid things to keep and also made special hobbies. In the second season, one guy said he was talking to his pants. It is sick and repulsive. Also, nobody cared about winning money. All they ever wanted to do was create an alliance like "Survivor" or something. Men were always afraid that women were going to get together. The women were the same. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to stop watching it. It was really one of the worst exhibitions ever.
