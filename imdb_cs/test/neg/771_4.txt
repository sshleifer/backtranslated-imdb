Someone else has labeled this movie as "fable-horror" and I think it's pretty good. This is at least a concept. A group of teenagers, each with their own bad habits, catch the attention of a twisted side jester. He decided to teach teens a lesson by becoming a part of them. A great idea, but it could have been done better. Fate for some teens is put too obviously in the face, while other characters might be added more. The end was also serious. No resolution or big twist or anything. But as a low budget horror, it's pretty fun to watch. If you're into cheese spookfests, you should laugh at watching this. But I think one of the mistakes is ... he's taking it too seriously. It's a silly movie, and if it were a little more confident, I think it would be better. But at least there are enough neat carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to watch you.
