I was disappointed with the continuation of the Princess Swan. I see what they were trying to do with the story, show how married life went for Odette and Derek, but the story wasn't interesting enough to impress me and seemed to cover the same basics as the original. It's not funny. The only piece I found humorous was when Jean-Bob was transformed into a prince and then back to a frog and nobody saw it and tried to convince them that he really did. The villain is waste and animation is not as impressive as the first movie. The queen is a very irritating character, and instead of cheering on Derek to save her mother, you hope the villain puts a spell on her voicemail to stop her talking. It's a shame, because I really liked the first movie, but in my expectations I didn't see it.
