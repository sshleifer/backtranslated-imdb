"War is in your blood" Rambo says it is "don't fight" in the movie. Say, what? Is the screenwriter with Mickey of Sly? It is impossible for anyone who has a primary school to miss a joke. Stallone, however, voices no irony. The same lack of humor concerns the film. Rambo IV is an exaggerated, idiotic action player who would be entertaining without intent if it wasn't terribly violent. Redneck's fantasy the most basic kind, where villains are so villains, is not enough to just kill? you have to chew them with pleasure. Stallone stops in a blue collar clich√© to comment. It is not enough for the main villain to be fed-to-the-pigs, throwing-kids-to-fire kind of sadist. He is also a pedophile homosexual. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with IMDb? Will the Rifles take over her? How can this disgusting excuse for gross exploitation be so high? I like a good action movie just like another man, but isn't it fun? this is a pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denies the true tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly doesn't wear a shirt. I'll give him one star ...
