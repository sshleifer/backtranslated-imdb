Many negative reviews focus on the historical accuracy of this film. OK, it had about as much to do with the real NFL as your average war movie has to do with real war, or Western has to do with the real "old west". So I think we should give them an art license. The problem is that the director (Clooney) seems to think that doing a comedy with a screwdriver means a) doing stupid things, b) a camera mug, and c) taking silly scenes full of ambushes and stretching them too long. Screwball comics need a fast pace, not necessarily frenetic, but constantly moving. Here, things are dragged and dragged and dragged. After you look at this movie, it will appreciate how brilliant Mack Sennett was when he nearly pioneered the genre with his Keystone Cops. After 90 years, you would think that directors would study old masters and learn something or two, maybe a little better. But no, it's like watching a car pioneer build Duesenberg, and paying tribute and nearly "tweaking" this concept by putting together a car with a square wheel almost a century later. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed a few Clooney movies, I consider him a gifted actor. However, very few actors can competently follow; Clint Eastwood took a while to get the hang of it. Clooney is clearly on the bottom of a very steep slope. The film becomes more observable within a few moments when it is out of frame, but when it is pictured, it becomes the center of attention. In battle scenes, his ambush is so unpleasant that someone wants him to be thrown away. <br /> <br /> If you are doing a screwdriver comedy and want some romance to be introduced, you need to develop some chemistry between the man. and women leads. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry pair of dumpsters sitting in the parking lot. No spark, no sizzle, no post-mortem jerking. Zellweger, who also made some nice movies, had to replace his botox injections with oak tannin, which gives a tremendously wooden performance. She could just tear off the "tough broad male world" to act if only once while trying out-testosterone guys, she looked into the camera with a little-half smile and flickering in her eyes. But no, she kept her brisk shoes at the end. Of course, the biggest sin is that the movie is just not funny. Doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick. Doing stupid things very resourcefully, like Stooges, or very athletic, like Buster Keaton, can be hilarious. But otherwise it is boring and, stupid. I think I made one good laugh from one movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. I saw it for free on the cable and I still wanted my money back.
