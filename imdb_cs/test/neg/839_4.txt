There is a lot of money behind this production, so the look is very good. It includes some interesting performances by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns and a short portrait at the start of Christopher Lee. There are a few exciting shootouts and a funny bit or two - the satire on Django, The Man with No Name and Sabata is fun, especially when they get the names of the failed presidents of the revolution in Mexico. The problem is that there is no purpose in satirizing the Spaghetti Western as it attempts here. The key element of Spaghettis is IRONY, which is easy to mix with comedy; in fact the source of all Spaghetti's Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time, and most Spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into a real comedy of highly sophisticated variety. Perhaps the best proof of this is the Trinity movies that are openly Spaghettis and openly slap-stick comedy. So why bother satirizing the genre that satirizes itself? As a result, I was basically unconvinced by the whole business. None of these characters cared about people, the story was generally cliché, and production values ​​reflected only the money, not the director's passion. Despite all the trivial and futile efforts to make money for a phenomenon that mocks.
