I finished Mandy Lane about an hour ago and felt the urge to go straight home and get up to warn anyone to spend the DVD. Shallow, the failure of acting is higher than that of Matthew McConaughey movies, and until the end of the twist, the plot is all but obvious. In nine out of ten you can see another scene that appears 5 minutes before it starts. The whole film is more or less without a motive or message, and a half-way that reveals a "killer" just kills what little interest you could leave at this point. What could save this shallow, boring movie is some decent splatter, or at least gore worthy of the genre "Slasher" - it also fails there. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie for a party that you can jump in and out without wanting anything, I recommend you buy All The Boys Love Mandy Lane. <br /> <br /> If you want to sit back and focus your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds, I don't.
