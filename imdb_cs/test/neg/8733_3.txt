After his career as a romantic lead man ended in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson played in a number of different projects, including television shows and smaller films. However, I believe that "Embryo" is his only corner as a mad scientist, and that's probably a good thing. I think he needed work. Riding one dark and stormy night, brilliant Dr. Paul Holliston (Hudson) strikes and injures the Doberman who brings him back to his lab (which looks somewhat like a dancotive Midwestern basement). Then he manages to pick up the unborn puppy dog ​​outside the womb, so he naturally decides to do the same with a human being. Likewise, he invokes Victoria (the beautiful Barbara Carrera) of the fetus. Victoria grows at an amazing pace and soon blooms into a gorgeous young woman. <br /> <br /> Predictably things happen very badly. After the start of halcyon, Holliston's sister-in-law Martha (Diane Ladd) begins to wonder where a young woman arrived and Victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence. The final sequence is one long ride straight from "Smokey and Bandit", after which Victoria is, which has a shocking aging just a few minutes ?? Angry Holliston is attacked, trying in vain to destroy his mutilated creature with his unborn child. All of this is accompanied by tire whistling, roaring engines, car fire and lots of sirens. A limp end? A bunch of medical workers furiously working on Victoria while Holliston grips in regret? is more strenuous than creepy. Although only in 1976, this film is very old. The only difference between this and many mad science films in the 1940s is that Hudson plays a leading role rather than Boris Karloff. The kits are relatively inexpensive and outdated for today's audience, to the point that the Hudson Reel Reel has a refrigerator size. Much of the action takes place in a poorly lit lab. Hudson sleeps over his sordid role and gives the impression that he is a real movie star, while Ladd and Carrera are much more believable. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowall appears briefly as a chess player. <br /> <br /> Passport Video is very non-standard and looks like it was made from a poor VHS copy with home equipment. If you're nostalgic for 1976, watch it once, just to say you did it. Otherwise, watch a football match or a soap opera instead.
