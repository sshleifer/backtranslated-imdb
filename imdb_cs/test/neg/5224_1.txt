This is perhaps the worst movie ever made. I know people talk about how awful Ed Wood movies were (Plan 9), but this movie makes Plan 9 amazing. Chuck Norris makes a portrait of which I have no idea. Maybe destroy his film career. In addition to Chuck Norris, the film's cast consists of accessories in Daily Soap and Mike Norris ... that's right, Chuck's son. This director doesn't even have a resume and I have no idea where conspiracy or script. That must have been lit by a terrible South Baptist minister who had a third cousin who owned a studio (which I am sure has been shut down since then). I really don't know what else to say about this movie. I'd like to give you a summary, but I'm lost. There's something about Jesus and Satan ... some eternal battle. Other than there are Indians. And a lot of weird kids who don't know how to behave ... are just awkward and shouldn't be on the camera. I don't know what's going on most of the time, but I know the movie was a big laugh. Mike Norris somehow pushes his daughter (on the bike) on the street ... but in the shooting he is in the middle of the park. Somehow, he learns to ride a bike with the speed that is the same as The Flash's speed and gets a car or a bus ... I don't know. But she's dead. This is actually the funniest scene in the movie. I know it sounds bad, but once you see, Mike raised his hands in victory and then held his head and shouted in horror ... you understand. It doesn't mean the daughter gets a hit or anything ... you just have to assume that someone hit her. But the film is not clear. Maybe it was completely unrelated and died of cancer. Anyway ... after the movie it's really confusing and I have no idea what's really going on. I am a Christian and have no idea why this film was made. I see no value for this film in the religious or religious sector. This is probably the first thing students show in Film-making 101 ... that's what you don't want to do. You just see it ... you'll hate it and I suggest you see it.
