MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> How did these talented actors join the mindless retreaded <br /> <br /> drive? Robert DeNiro plays the Dumb Hollywood version of the standard <br /> <br /> violence heavy cop with violence (ie, defeating the coward and throwing his <br /> <br /> eyes on the cops who prefer to stick to the book), and Eddie Murphy plays <br /> <br /> is not that hard a cop who would rather be an actor (ie, he screams out, <br /> <br /> "Freeze, police!" His "hard look" down pat). Of course, there are <br /> <br /> partners when Bobby's free cannon tactics get him into the hot water <br /> <br /> with the media and he is basically blackmailed into the game at <br /> <br / > "Cops" - a similar reality show. Inhale, cuz, which is as fun as it gets <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> No energy has been inserted into the script - it's like a pale opposite. each copy of a buddy movie threw in a mixer with "15 minutes" to play, yes, DeNiro himself, largely the character he plays here. <br /> <br /> Jokes go straight, action seems helpless and nobody feels good <br /> <br />. He's dead on screen. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Although you have an overhanging affinity for one of the actors, avoid it and do them a favor. If it does money, these scripts will be perfectly acceptable for actors of their quality. <br /> <br />. And Mr DeNiro. You did serious movies. I remember them - <br /> <br /> were good. You were nominated for them - remember how was it? Now after "Analyze This", "Meet the <br /> <br /> Parents" (which was also good) and "The Adventures of Rocky and <br /> <br /> Bullwinkle" which wasn't good), I think we need to see you parody <br /> <br /> yourself less and BE MORE. "Casino" feels like long <br /> <br />. And no, I don't count "15 minutes" as a serious Bobby. Anyone who has taken that media satire seriously must get their weekly news from the world
