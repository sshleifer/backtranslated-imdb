A young man who never knew his parents' parents is getting an old farm in an isolated part of West Virginia to die his natural father. He visits his estate with a cross section of potential victims including a black man comic and a fashionable lesbian couple. (Hmm, there will be skinny dipping? Take a guess.) Unfortunately, the party will come to an end when the ghost drifters killed its evil grandfather and used it as scarecrows return for revenge. This movie starts well. The art set of photographs of depression and fake newspapers against the FDR speech - this is, in my opinion, his first appearance in the film of the scarecrow killer - he is in the mood. I have developed several hopes for a film that has been partially realized. The story was practical enough. The setting was bucolic enough. The photo was mostly in focus. Playing while no big shakes, he was slightly above the par for the horror movie in this budget range. In fact, the film would work in narrow genre requirements if the scarecrows were scary. But they weren't looking cheap. They weren't scary at all. The better the monster, the better the film. These scarecrows wouldn't scare Dorothy, let alone This.
