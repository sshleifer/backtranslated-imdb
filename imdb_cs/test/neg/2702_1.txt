As a fan of the old series, I have to say that it is at best a parody of many beloved series. The first series would at least try to follow some military structure. Me in this P.C. it's not the thing you do, but hey! In the old series Beachead was a tough soldier, now he is a teenage turtle. Another thing is a flying tank, ok flies off the cobra base and bounces off the helicopter and both are okay ???? Keep it, unless another is better, it could mean the end of G.I.joe.
