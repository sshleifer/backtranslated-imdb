I just finished watching this movie and found it a waste of time with little or no redemption factors. I really do not understand where all the positive reviews come from - animation is clumsy and unrefined, the plot has no meaning at all from an objective point of view, and there is no sense of intrigue or tension in what it seeks to go through. as an interesting and exciting film. I've never read a book, so I can't tell if the movie was faithful, but like most movie adaptations, it's trying too hard to cram as much information as possible into the shortest possible time. The result is a discontinuous and illogical story that doesn't really let you understand the characters or actually anything. Overall, I felt totally separated from the characters and the plot to the point where I couldn't take care of what happened to them, and the only way I can see how this animation can be considered beautiful is if your normal standard is Animation is a Scooby-Doo cartoon.
