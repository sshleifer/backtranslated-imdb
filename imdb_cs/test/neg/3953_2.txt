It was a videotape in the Ring; the site was a problem in Feardotcom; the danger in Pulse came from computers; and a phone and one missed call featured ?? The technology that causes all sorts of problems is to keep the game alive online: those who play it will soon be dead. How smart! Directed by William Brent Bell (Who?), And featuring an unlimited cast of twenty-something you could have seen before, but you probably don't remember where or what the hell their names are, that's an extremely derived piece filmmaking focused directly on the PG-13 horror film; seasoned scary movie watchers will no doubt find Stay Alive extremely tiring, highly predictable, and not a bit scary. The poorly developed drawing follows a group of players with extremely stupid names (October, Loomis, Phineus), Hutch, and Swink!?!), trying to decipher the secret for a deadly game before they become victims. Finally, he discovers that he is the evil spirit of the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who kills anyone who dares to play and that their only hope of survival is to continue the game to the end. <br /> <br /> With a story that's so stupid, viewers should expect a free ending movie, not one iota of logic (who did the game, how, and why it's never explained), very little in the way of scare or gore, and the silly closing scene left the door open for God to forbid the continuation.
