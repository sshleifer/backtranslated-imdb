I happened to happen to this movie when I was looking for something to observe while eating lunch. Actually, I turned to the WE Network because I said it had the last 20 minutes of a movie about the importance of "sticking" to some gymnastics team - I figured it was cheap goodness. Well, I'm fine. <br /> <br /> At first I missed 20-40 minutes at the beginning of the movie. Fortunately, most of them were recapitulated relatively quickly, especially in the bedroom where Crystal admits she was responsible for the death of her rapist. I love Jenny Garth and watch her in anything. She's just so pretty and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as she does. It looks great in this movie, and it's not really the age of what seems to be more than a decade. Overall, I felt bad for the actor to watch this movie. Everyone was trying to sell their parts, but they were all so badly written that it was a constant fight. Frankly, I was surprised to see Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (Greg's dad from Dharma & Greg). But writing wasn't the worst part of this movie. About half an hour before the end, her mother dies, and when she shows the foundation stone, the date of death is 1979. When I skipped the beginning, I was impressed by the closet that it was happening in the 1980s. Neither a loose suit or a bell in sight. Shame on who made the wardrobe for this movie! Don't get me wrong - all the clothes in this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong all the time. I almost wonder if they told the wardrobe that it was a period piece. The Bottom Line - Good for laughter or feeding fix by Jennie Garth. :)
