This is the candidate for the worst movies I've ever seen. She wanted to be as shocking as "The Silence of the Lambs", but she has neither the style nor the joke of the above. Make-up is excellent, acting is pretty good, but the story seems to be dragging years and murders are so terrible they're more intrusive than fun.
