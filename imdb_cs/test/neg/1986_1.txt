This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The problem is that he does not know if he wants to be an intelligent political film, "artistic" or exercise is erotic. As a result, all accounts will fail. Acting is terrible, telling off and supposed symbolism meaningless. Klaus Kinski is probably the best thing about this movie but it's not a good thing. Of course, it has an intense and "unique" appearance, but it cannot actually act. Just look at how he reacts when his mistress leaves ....
