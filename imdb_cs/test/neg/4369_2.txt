I've never seen Killjoy's first movie and I've never heard anything good about it. So I see Killjoy 2 in the local Blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back. Starring Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon. Now he's a huge fan of Troma that I'm not there any way I won't rent this movie out, how can it be wrong with these two in it? How wrong I was. Even Trent and Debbie can't save this movie excuse from being so bad as it really is. Trent quite frankly stinks like Killjoy, though this is probably more of a writer's fault giving him some of the worst single-inserts in film history. Debbie has a good performance but not enough. Kills are terrible, as are the effects of gore. For example, look when this guy is supposed to be loaded with something or something. And just to put it all, it's just one of the worst I've ever seen in film history. The film doesn't work at such a bad level that it's a good level. Avoid clapping. <br /> <br /> 2/10
