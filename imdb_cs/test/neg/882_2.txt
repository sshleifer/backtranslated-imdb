My husband brought this home from a video store so I could watch something when I got stuck at home. Such a disease where you could never concentrate on a book, but a stupid, light, romantic swing, it sounds right (that, and a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he meant it well. <br /> <br /> My first thought (as well as some others post here as well) was that the house MUST be fake ... it's not just isolated on the beach, but is set to anchor into free sand, and so close to the ocean that surf waves go right under the house! This looks so obviously dangerous (in the hurricane country, at the FALL), so potentially catastrophic that I was sure that the filmmakers just had the CGI thing (or used film magic to set off a cute B&B to surf). But I have to tell you that thanks to the "interwebs" of that time, I can say that the "Serendipity" house is very real, it is really close to Rodanthe, and besides some window dressings and shrubs it appears mostly as it does in film. You can rent it yourself, off season, for $ 1710 per week (or about $ 3850 in summer)! Go for it! But ... interestingly, the house has serious problems. The second thing that hit me after they "washed" was "what about plumbing / electrical?" In this surfing? ", And certainly enough" Serendipity "was doomed for a break in the sanitation caused by crossing the ocean. (They're remodeling.) <br /> <br /> And the house isn't from a "civil war." Not to mention that Viola Davis, playing the "best friend cliché" (an ungrateful role for a great actress, most recently seen in "Doubt"), isn't old enough for her GRANDMOTHER to build anything in the Civil War! HI! it was 150 years ago! Try great-great! (In fact, "Serendipity" was built in 1988, ridiculously recently.) <br /> <br /> The basic film is built on the typical Nicholas Sparks of anger, which means a lot of coincidence and trite of foreseeable circumstances. It is also focused on a very pandering way to "women" - you know us women who love B & Bs, fusty antiques and knick-knacks ... who dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and dance in the moonlight . Don't give us a plot or thoughtful evolution of the character; just set up some mechanisms and bring to the love scene! Gere plays a plastic surgeon who, in a routine operation, lost a female patient to a benign cyst on her face. Of course she died of anesthesia overdose, so you're wondering why the surgeon is sick and not an anesthetist! HI! Where's the guy? Why is a bad doctor feeling guilty? Gere came on a pillow and faced a woman's husband and stays on the remote B & B ... who should be there, why ONLY OTHER INN ... Diane Lane! It is a lonely divorce, with spoiled children and former husbands who want it back. While deciding to do so, the best black girl cliché has her subbing as a hostess at the B&B. Now, in the real world, if this setting ever happened, the doctor would look like Ernest Borgnine ... and a lonely divorce like Rosie O'Donnell. He spent his vacation horndogging 22-year-old girls on the beach while she mumbled and thought about going to a diet. But this is not the real world; I turn. A couple admit all, fall in love, hurricane hits ... they make love, fall in love, must go away, he dies and she cries a lot about it. End. There I saved you from this; Now you don't have to torture yourself or other male friends (husbands, sons, lovers) to meet in this trio. Very tired. Someone else asked why Diane Lane, the perfect little woman (whose filmmakers seem to love cast because she's pretty and skinny, most women want to look like her, but she's 45 and not overhead, so it is not threatened) is constantly covered with large sails. That would make sense if she was plump, but she wasn't. Anyway, somebody throws a nice, paisley shawl over this movie. So we don't have to watch it. Conclusion: Read the book if you are not too ill. If he is too sick, go to sleep.
