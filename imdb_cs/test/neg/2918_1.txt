If someone returned to the dawn of the talking image, a clear future would be foreseen for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, the comedy actor was trained on a legitimate scene, not in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice that matched his image. In addition, since 1924, his "silent" films have included sequences based on sound grafts lost to the audience (eg, Fringe Sequences in the Frolic FRESHMAN and Monkey Sequences in KID BROTHER). But Lloyd's sound functions failed at the box office as soon as the new WELCOME DANGER appeared. Lloyd blamed his downfall on many external sources, but never realized that the enemy of the glass figure was not a sound, but a Great Depression. The audience before depression, the envy of optimism, may be rooted in this ambitious go-getter, in which they have seen their alternate; The depression audience despised him as a person who could expel them from the mortgage and throw them into the trough. This problem of character selection is Lloyd's perception as an infallible mentor. Of course, honesty is a subjective assessment, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing descent. Maybe it's because he was afraid he would return to this state forever. CAT'S-PAW is failing for these reasons, but is suffering from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the FDR's presidency as a dictatorship striving for soaking rich and soft on crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille conducted this day and age, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by exiled tax protesters and is still motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because he treated fascism lightly in "comedy" and given that his release was particularly badly timed due to the events in Germany that year. The 1934 Code of Conduct would ultimately limit the celebration of welfare justice and reaffirm the law of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. The ideal of a benevolent despot, the good intent of an omnipotent leader who brings utopia as soon as he gets rid of the controls and balance of this omnipotence comes from classical antiquity. Therefore, totalitarian regimes fear laughter, even when acting as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film that demonizes the democratic experience of its country of origin, shows that FDR America was safe enough to accept criticism. We see no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the gallant humor of the waiting fascism? Lloyd's unfettered film is biased to the right and could have been written by Dr. Goebbels himself if he had of course a sense of humor. It represents an alternative history in which the chosen one restores order and loss of honor to ANY NECESSARY MEANS, with good character and fun. The approaching fascism, which is approaching the left, is, of course, Chaplin's BIG DICTATOR. This second film has the advantage of being set in another country and based on a thin veiled personality and events. BIG DICTATOR today produces little laughter because it has underestimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its lackluster and improper expression because it has the clear advantage of being defended by history. However, Lloyd should be credited with two things: first, he has not made any other pro-fascist films, nor has he created any other hypocritical pro-Allied films during the war. The world after 1945 saw the face of fascism and was not entertaining.
