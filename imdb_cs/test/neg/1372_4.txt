This show reminds me of the episode "The Simpsons", where Smithers just fired Mr. Burns and was forced to live an unhappy unemployed life. All he did was when the clock had to drink and watch Comedy Central. As a result, Comedy Central was a pathetic television channel for miserable people who had nothing more to do than take their time. "Mind of Mencia" is slightly better than most Comedy Central programming, but still serves as an example of why this channel for people with absolutely no life is a poor fill. The truth is that Mencia is a fairly competent comedian who throws trite, soft-ball ethnic jokes, and money to bland stereotypes of people based on their race, gender, or economic status, or a combination of two of the three characteristics. If you've heard one of these jokes of one of your friends at the bar or at work, believe me, you've heard what's going on like a comedy on "Mind of Mencia". Carlos is also trying to make fun of current events, but lacks creativity or originality. That doesn't mean Carlos is still being washed out. I found some of his fun pastimes, such as his rap video as an oil sheik. If you find that your aisle is in a picturesque comedy, you can enjoy "Mind of Mencia". For those people who are tired of repetitive, walkers comics trotting out the same old time-worn jokes, stay away.
