Kinda funny how comments for this movie went consistently downhill, now add mine. I think the script could be saved by better acting and playing a better script. Together it was hard to watch, and I don't have that sort of thing. "Sigourney was the best part (I thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was just one new thing this movie offered to her genre), but she was also lagging behind. She cannot be accused of who knows what the director and / or editor of the floor has taken away. The whole movie was "okay, that's good enough, let's move on", we feel to him when I know there was more to benefit from the actors and the script that had some good lines and interesting topics. I don't think it counts as a spoiler, but the perfect example is the scene where Sigourney marched to the home of his son's supposed torturous house and has that look on his face and I thought "that is someone's face they exaggerate what it is to see someone living in a mobile home "and certainly enough, the next shot that wants to shock us, I'm sure that bullying lives in a trailer unlike a nice house like her. As many other posters have pointed out that there are so much better films with similarly airy scenarios about similarly confused families that have hit the notes better - "Celebration" is probably the ultimate example I've seen .
