this movie was really bad. it is of such quality that it has many independent films: moments of humor full of long spaces that are totally boring. Any BAM Magician movie fan will enjoy this movie, but then it will probably be the only person to see him. someone gave me this movie to know i am a jackass fan and was a fan of viva la bam before scripted the nature of this show wearing thin. To explain why this movie doesn't work, I should just say that the assumption itself is played by a guy who is with a girl who is terrible to him. And to a large extent, the whole movie you have on Ryan Dunn, the whining and the Bam magera, jumping around like a jolly thief. Dicamillo's performance is strange at best. It's a funny little nonspecific Canadian French accent that to a large extent is the extent of his performance (basically funny for 5 minutes and then it's like 'ok pretending you're already alien') <br /> <br /> Maybe that is, it would work if they went to parody, but all they could do is make a film with zero IQ. I like the humor of the restroom as well as the other one, but it's not even stupid of its stupid. The humor to get out of this movie is completely inside and the audience, even the subtle of Magera and society, is left out of this joke. Next time a magician puts a bag full of money, hopefully he won't blow it on some crappy pet project
