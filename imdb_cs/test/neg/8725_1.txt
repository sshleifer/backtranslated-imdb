This is a weird, weird movie and it doesn't deserve better marks than David Lynch! Special effects are poorly done, actors are mostly bad actors, and this film is not a race that is a minority of the planet trying to fight the rulers, but it seems to be a crazy movie that pays tribute to the sect of organizations. This is certainly not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six-member epic! Look at David Lynch, who is the perfect homage to the novels!
