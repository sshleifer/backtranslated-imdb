Skilled professionals live in an exotic and dangerous location. They get drunk every night. They smuggle opium. Pigs fall in parachutes. They fly under incredibly dangerous conditions. They dress strange and act weirder. They are iconoclastic, outrageous. They violate all command rules and despise their employers at the CIA. They are irreplaceable. <br /> <br /> No. It's not just "Angels have wings" and it's not "M * A * S * H." It is an unpleasant mixture of two, which unfortunately comes as stupid as funny. <br /> <br /> Focuses on shock, fun and education, but does not really achieve its goals. <br /> <br /> As for his shock value, we're safe now, right? Is it really a shock to anyone that a lot of hard-living pilots flew secret missions in Laos in 1970? No, it's not shocking. It is not even educational now, in our current circumstances, when it would be interesting to know that some paramilitary excursion is NOT buried in a file called National Interest, Defense de Toucher. It's alright. So we have been a little bit altered and are no longer so shocked, so stupid. The problem in this case is that the film depends on those features that are fun for its power. Without it, film implodes. A group of hairy drunk CIA pilots are sitting in a stroller leaving girls, shooting lights with silenced guns and killing lizards. He asks the new pilot, Robert Downey, Jr., "When you do this, does it mean there's something to celebrate?" Another answer, guess, "No, that means it's night time." It might be funny if we expected the renegade pilots to be as upright as the rest of us. If not, the gag, like the film, will fall empty. <br /> <br /> Naturally there are action scenes. Everything that can happen on an airplane or on an airplane is happening on an airplane or on an airplane. People drop out of them, the luggage is thrown randomly from their hatches, the engines fail, they suffer damage from the AAA, they are torn during a landing while falling, but most of it we've seen elsewhere, often done better. Some might find this funnier than me, and acting is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is particularly effective as a straight man. Check out other comments, and if they describe a movie that you might find appealing, then watch by all means. There might be something laughing in it that escaped me.
