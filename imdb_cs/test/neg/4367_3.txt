It would be wrong and shameful if I advised you to look at Killjoy 2, you need to have better things to do, wash your car, throw stones in the stream, but at the same time it's not nearly as bad as you probably think it is. It's a pretty good movie that can do a lot more than most direct cinema. Killjoy 2 is very helpful with the maniacal turn of Trent Haag as a clown of the same name, plunging into a role with such a keen abandon that he almost casts scales in film favor, but of course it takes more than one man. big shoes. Tammi Sutton has given the most entertaining portrait director ever since Roger Corman in the Haunted Sea creature and the whole thing is almost destroyed by the hurrying, sweet ending. Everywhere and almost fun.
