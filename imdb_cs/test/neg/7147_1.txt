During this film, I was still wondering why they are doing it on Earth as a "documentary", but do not include the actual footage of the people we interviewed? Sure, it would be the same as any other documentary, but then it would be up to the filmmakers to find out the importance of the film. The use of a number of well-known movie stars (many of whom have asked to be in it) to portray "real" people have made me feel that there is a predetermined message to be delivered and the director was so focused on it that actors could not be trusted by real people. and rehearsed scenes. (Yes, I know it was also a game, but the documentary should be documentary.) I really found myself being discouraged by various stars and still expecting one of them to drop the character for a moment and say: a good person because I'm in this. This movie could have had a much stronger social commentary if it were more objective, or we could see Matthew Shepard and his murderers as humans rather than symbols. (Much better "Boys Don't Cry" had a steadfast look at those involved - good and bad.) Instead, the Laramie Project gives an almost relentless lecture that one's sexuality should be accepted no matter what, and what is little.
