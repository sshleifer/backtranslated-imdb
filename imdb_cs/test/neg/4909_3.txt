This film is the third attempt at a convincing, moody thriller and fails in all three counts. I almost managed to keep my attention, because the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably violated all the rules of life that stood comfortably at the beginning of the film. But it's over the last 25 minutes. that things start spirally. The vaguely credible plotline (and it is generous) becomes totally ridiculous because new characters will emerge from nothing, and random and bizarre events will never be explained. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so bad if scripting wasn't. t so cheesy, acting so wooden (despite strong British cast) and direction so uninspiring. This is not an example of good British filmmaking, nor should it make Tarantino's bat eyelid, at least not compared to his earlier work. <br /> <br /> My advice in this case, if it's hard to stay out of, don't waste your effort. If you're British like me and it's in your local video store, call well. Maybe take a video called "American Beauty" - now it's a great British direction.
