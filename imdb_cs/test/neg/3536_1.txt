RUŠIČ VZTLAKU !!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm .... I just watched a nightmare on elm street movies and I just learned about Giovanni Ribisi. I thought Giovanni Ribisi didn't do any horrors, so I signed up for it. I saw the "base" (ripper mind) I checked on my Tivo for it. There was air on Sci Fi. So I was set up. I got my pop corn and came on the couch and what the hell is that? Freakin brave guy in blue sweat pants runs around screaming! There's nothing scary about this movie! If something is funny! Funny how low the budget is, funny as it is predictable, funny, how bad the deal is and the funny how much money DIDNT hasn't made. Ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor, but this movie is stupid. It's so stupid. At the end, they killed him and then they go to this plane and the "monster" is on him. He shoots him in the head with a shotgun and falls on a long way to the ground. And <br /> <br /> -GASP- the killer is over, he's still alive! WOOHHH! Scary! woooohhhh! Sucky fat bag crap waste 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: You have to go somewhere and you have to kill some time. Mind ripper is not a suggestion. I'd rather sit naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time. <br /> <br /> TOTAL SHOP: F- - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)
