EXTREMELY fast, exciting, interesting, detailed rich book. It is a great pity that the film did not have any of these qualities. Not only was Tom Hanks a slightly raised portrait or Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name turns into key figures, huge deviations from the original story, and a bad Irish / Italian accent from Carmalenga. As a huge A&D fan, I had great hopes for a much richer, truer and more detailed movie where it would start and end up just as the book did - so I didn't want more. All I really did was push me into 1.10 minutes. what was impressive was how ... sorry! I couldn't even finish the sentence without laughing. briefly - Vittoria was a token hottie, very second to Audrey Tatou and there were some very nice Alfa Romeos. I'd like to recommend reading the book to understand that if Ron Howard had to insist on filming ANOTHER, I'd like to save Â£ 6.40 for KFC zinger and some chicken wings - much more fun and more satisfying!
