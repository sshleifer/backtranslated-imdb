"Death Wish 3" is the film equivalent of the shooting range. All characters (except Bronson Paul Kersey, of course) exist only to be killed, either as "provocation" (good boys) or as "retaliation" (villains). The director simply spills on mindless violence (people are even burned alive and blown up), making him an urban version of "Commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, seldom bothering to protect himself from enemy fire). Fans of this short thing (and, they seem to be many) will enjoy it, others .... be careful. (* 1/2)
