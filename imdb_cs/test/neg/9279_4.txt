This film is the world window of Britain in 1973 - the world of holiday camps, bassoons and birds. I was actually in the Pontins Prestatyn while it was being filmed, so it's fascinating to see where I was born as a child, and what world we left behind. The "storyline" is about Stan and Jack's attempts to turn a holiday camp job (Â£ 25 a week!) To chase young women and liquidate Blakey. They are affiliated with the rest of the family's family and some laughs are to be from Arthur (Michael Robbins) and Olive's (Anna Karen) persistent chuntering, as well as the sheer weirdness of Blakey, but the idea that young women would see something desirable. In Brilliant Stanovi (Reg Varney) or Lecherous Jack (Bob Grant) is just terrible. It is harmless in its day, now it's just a curiosity from an ancient age.
