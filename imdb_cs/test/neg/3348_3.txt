Someone named Karl Rhamarevich learns how to live after death by telekinesis. He is buried in a mausoleum. That same night, Julie (Meg Tilly) has to spend the night getting into a group called "Sisters". And Charles's power is in full bloom. Stupid movie. I saw it in the theater when I was 21 and I was generally bored. PG rating should bounce me off - that's a horror movie for kids. One stupid REAL scene at the end has a corpse that broke through the concrete to hit the young guy! To begin with, the corpses are included in the HEAD, so it is impossible for the corpse to use its arms, and no one can break the concrete. When you notice such a stupid mistake, the movie doesn't do its job. He has two good scenes - two of "The Sisters" are "attacked" by floating corpses that fill them. At one point one of the sisters strikes the corpse into the stomach - her hand goes into the body and can't pull her out! The scene has stayed with me ever since. And at the end, it's a cute piece that includes a corpse and a toothbrush (which laughed at my audience). But the rest of the film is dim, dim memory. Only for children - adults are bored. I'll give it 3.
