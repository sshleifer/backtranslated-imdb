In addition to the appearance of the talented Austin Powers impersonator Richard Halpern, this pic was your running mill film spoof. Dated film references will not help viewers who may face this effort in the future. Watch "Groovy" Austin Powers in the hot tub. It's half and a half. Bad special effects are overcome by the presence of many starfish in modest outfits, so at least it should have fun (if that's what excites you). <br /> <br /> I'd rent a classic spoof DVD for my money, like "Airplane" or "Mars Lobster".
