"Graduation Day" - <br /> <br /> I bought this movie last week and waited for some time when I could kick back and relax and watch some "good" 80s slasher gems, I got it and "Xtro" on watch, never seen any of them. I just watched it and realized that there were also external speakers. I just imagine what my neighbors thought when "Felony" came to sing their 10 minute hit? I'm sure it was loud and I'm sure I think I'm weird with this and the sound of a chain saw and shouting from other movies. It was a pretty cool movie, no tension, no story, some amazing death, almost seemed on the amateur side, I usually like movies like this, but it just didn't knock with me, now I'll watch "Xtro" for the first time and have a margarita!
