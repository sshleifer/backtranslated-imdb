La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, or Terror Express! As it was called the version I saw, it begins as a different passenger board a long-distance train. Three Thuggian idiots, Dave, Phil & Ernie (Carlo De Mejo) have boarded and it is clear that they are there to cause trouble because they are intimidating and verbally abusing other passengers and staff. As the speed of the train turns ugly when a prostitute named Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to have sex with Dave, he and his friends decide to hold the train hostage, so they can have an orgy with Juliette &, but not much else. happens except some heroic cop and his prisoner who decided to save the day. Erm, this is really ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was directed by Ferdinand Baldi and is a complete and complete crap from start to finish. George Eastman's script as Luigi Montefiori could just as easily be described as really boring porn as well as horror / thriller. It is a lengthy slow, it's 35 minutes before anything remotely slim happens and as a whole the film lacks some kind of exploitation that Italian sleaze and horror brought at that time. The film can be compared to another Italian production of infinitely better The House on the Edge of the Park (1980), which was produced in the same year, is a very broad comparison, although everything that made the house on the edge of the park is a notorious film, is absent from La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, there is no blood, no bangs, almost no violence, there are only a few really tamed rape, the story has no twists or turns and it's incredibly boring to watch. The Italian sleaze and horror films from the late 1970s and early 1980s are not known for their strong stories or great scenarios, but these films really make the bottom of the film. The character is terrible, the film spends the first 30 minutes and builds them and gives some background to why they are on the train, but that's all forgotten and nothing at all. I also hated the lame end and I don't know if I missed something, but was it a reasonable explanation, why would these three lamebrines kidnap the train? I don't think he was there, was he? I'm sorry, but because your angry at the prostitute is not enough, surely the creators might come up with something more substantial and interesting, if not more acceptable. In my opinion, this film stinks, it's as simple and straightforward as I fear. Director Baldi is doing his job well to be fair, has only one corridor, and a few sections to work on the train, so I shortened it a little when I said the movie was becoming very repetitive. There is no style and he films sex scenes as bad soft core porn complete with horrible romantic sounding piano music. ONE ONE ONE SIMPLE STEP IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE FULL FILM, not a single drop. Forget all gore or violence as you will be very disappointed if you do it just like me. There are several rape, but they are amateur-staged and have no impact, ugly exploitation and sleaze saying that I am not Spit on Your Grave (1978) or Last House on the Left (1972). Technically La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is fine and it's pretty well done on what needs to be a low budget, but the setup seems to have helped keep costs down. Behavior is poor as usual, though because it has been called the original performances have been lost. Italian horror fans will have lots of voices here. La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a horrible movie, it's just my opinion, but I was bored when I expected something to happen & when I never felt cheated, I want those 80 minutes of my life life back. This piece of crap is not even suitable for graceful 99p VHS bargains in your local blockbuster.
