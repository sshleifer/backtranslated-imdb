I'm not going to waste my time describing the plot for it, the second reviewer is doing it pretty well. However, I will give you my opinion on this film. This film is essentially against Japanese propoganda. The Japanese are portrayed as incredibly evil bards who have no respect for anything, as well as having very poor martial arts skills (groups of Japanese men get donkey kicked by women on more than one occasion). Warriors lose almost every (if not every) fight in a film that takes away tension. The storyline is actually quite solid and ideal for kung fu movie though. The problem is that there is not much fighting. When there are matches, some of the battles are pretty good, but other scenes are poorly choreographic. One scene of angela mao takes six Japanese in church and kicks all their butts. The problem is that they show her that she is fighting them one by one when they all have to attack at the same time. I gather that this film was incredibly cheap considering how cheap some sets are. They use the same village they are in Korea and when they are in China without even changing it. However, some scenes are shot in real places and look good. Overall, the only real problem with the movie is slow motion and an uninteresting chart. Since there are few battle scenes, we have to rely on conspiracy for fun and well, I wasn't funny. one and a half stars out of four
