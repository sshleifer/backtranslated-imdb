======= BIG SPOILER ================ This is a horrible movie without likeable characters. So many clichés and senseless scenes. He needs a good editor, but then there's no film. Please save two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refused to kill his brother to kill himself. Description read "moments of dark comedy". Maybe I missed you when I winked. Terrible characters start right at the funeral. Funeral visitors laugh and complain about food while at the funeral of a very young man who committed suicide? Then dad kicks at the only son who left? Right at the funeral? How is it that a neighbor whose husband cheated on her with the character of Sigourney Weaver is an evil man who tells her husband? The father doesn't even know that his son can play the piano, even though everyone else around him knows he's a great pianist. The film seeks to tear down every dramatic cliché possible into one movie: the father overthrows an athletic son to succeed, a dysfunctional family has lost an elected son to suicide, the son felt lost and lonely, drugs, marital affairs, a child conceived over the affair but raised as the son of a husband , incest, homosexual tendencies, bullying, possibly terminal illness, etc. etc, etc. DO NOT USE 2 HOURS.
