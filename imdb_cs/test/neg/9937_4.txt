The first thing you should know about "Zipperface" is that it was filmed on video, so it has that special "home-video-ish" look that's terribly distracting and makes it hard to take it seriously as a "real" movie. And "Zipperface" really looks like the amateurs have gathered for a "real" serial killer thriller. It doesn't matter, but it's not as bad as it looks. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case revolves on the genre of exploitation. Dona Adams is an enthusiastically ambitious amateur in this role - her apparent camera inexperience works for her. And in the end he fights against the killer. The red herring initially seems ridiculous, but in the end they work - I guessed the killer incorrectly. And you have to wonder if Tarantino saw a guy zipperface when he came up with the idea of ​​"The Gimp" for "Pulp Fiction". (* 1/2)
