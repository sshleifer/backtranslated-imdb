Sometimes it is difficult to judge how bad a film made in Italy or Spain is because everyone seems to be using the same stability of 9-10 voice actors trained in ESL to deliver English voices for US release. And things are always lost in the translation of the same -log, character shtick and plot elements written for the expectations of European viewers do not have to go too well with our American ideas of what is funny, hip, or dramatic. I imagine that the team responsible for translating this film into English had about 3 days to do it from start to finish, and apparently each of them received the installment equivalent on their used Fiat. In other words, clean hacking, tossing in one or two takes and never reviewed or redone anyone with a real ear for the American language. Watching "Devil Fish", I can imagine that if you were an Italian watching it presented in your native language, you might find it a slightly fun piece of fluff. You'd be laughing at the joke and the fun drunk, you'd be bothered by the monsters and the villains of the bad guys, and you'd find yourself in an attractive pair of Peter and no-Daryll Hannah like them. a couple on the beach for no apparent reason finding clues about a man riding a monster who has already killed one of his friends. But because a silly voice and a tin dialogue are coming out Let's get the Americans out of the movie experience, we can't help but see that the editors have a serious attention deficit that no one on the screen can act as much as the Attitude project that the stated reason for creating a monster makes no sense at all that the action sequences have all the effects of a cereal bowl full of cooked oatmeal and that the director, screenwriters and producers really hate women. Don't even think about buying or renting this movie - watch only on cable TV on Saturday afternoon with one of several beers in your Pist, or with the help and protection of Mike and Bots on MST3K.
