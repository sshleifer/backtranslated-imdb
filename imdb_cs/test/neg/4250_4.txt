Some people like to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek shows because it emphasizes character development and continuity and offers a more comprehensive background and ongoing plot. In some ways it makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the show fails altogether. The series begins as a soap opera on the space station, with two whole periods of general science fiction stories aligned with the banal subplots about the characters. Characters are a good game and most actors are decent, but I think writers have tried too hard to be "normal". In fact, "normal" means "ordinary and tedious". At the end of the second season, we are introduced to the Dominion, who for a moment hangs terribly before finally going to war with good guys. in the fifth season. This is the main "story arc" of the show, but it only occupies a fraction of the entire series. We still have lame stand-alone episodes, heroes still stuck on strange planets for forty-five minutes, and there is a lot of low-brow comedy featuring greedy, goofy Ferengi. Many episodes are just boring and some are unobservable. The Dominion, the chief villains of DS9, is trying for galactic domination for a good reason that they just don't like it. The whole war is presented by a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Impressively pyrotechnic space battles appear with great frequency from the third season onwards, but they are done in ridiculously simplistic ways, such as the two huge fleets of super advanced starships that fly directly to each other and gush away. DS9 writers (including talented Ronald D. Moore, later "Battlestar Galactica Fame") have tasted their monotonous show by starting a war, but it's still a pedantic soap at heart. DS9 very frustrating experience. The continuous story is too flat and obvious to be truly graspable, and characters that never show up in interesting ways. "Babylon 5" and "Battlestar Galactica" have made the DS9 promise and have done much better. For Star Trek, stick to the original and next generation.
