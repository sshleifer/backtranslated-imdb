Fortunately, I watched this movie myself, which allowed me to advance ahead with the worst scenes (in fact, most of the movies). All right, some of them are not bad, with some good photos (and some of the underwater scenes) and sometimes they're not too bad overhead. But he still doesn't save the incredibly bad script and the way of worse acting. Plus, if I don't find "hottie" movies to be all, even wannabe sexy love that makes the scene boring. Really boring! And for drama: You know it's always a bad sign when you don't like all the characters so much that you don't really care who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you haven't gotten tired of the Survivor reality, you can find something to your liking in this movie. If not, stay calm!
