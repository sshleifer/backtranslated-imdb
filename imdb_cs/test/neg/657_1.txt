According to the standards of Hollywood, this film was made and edited because Hollywood movies are, and therefore, looked like a movie that you would get from a large-scale production studio in Hollywood. This is where something remotely approaches Hollywood ending. This was the worst movie I saw in my life! I'm not kidding. The story was so incredibly stupid and unrealistic that I couldn't cover my laughter at the cinema while watching this movie. I know what you're saying, "his horror movie that doesn't have a good story to scare you." Well, let me tell you something, the movie isn't a little scary. Its too full of stupid pieces that disturb the little tension there may be. The play was also horrible, along with the lack of a murderer you can see in the flashes locked in the cage. Throughout the film, I was still aware that I was watching something that was invented, written, produced and controlled by a highly educated person who was watching too much pornography. Please don't see this movie, spend $ 8.50 for other things like a snow cone that would be much more valuable.
