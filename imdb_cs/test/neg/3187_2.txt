I'm afraid I just kept watching the first hour of this movie because it seemed to me that it was nonsensical television and a waste of talent. Liv Tyler plays a sumptuous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give this work a real kick. As she slowly seduces the bartender into a crime life it is difficult to feel any real concern about some characters. Even John Goodman adds to his weakly comic line with the absence of panache, as if the humorous humor had to be recited slowly if someone missed a joke. The end is supposed to be good, but the starter and the main course let me find out.
