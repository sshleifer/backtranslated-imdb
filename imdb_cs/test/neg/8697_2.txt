This movie could have great potential. With today's technology, one could expect real special effects. But movies are not only made with special effects. This movie missed both! First, let me tell those who are annoyed by this unscrupulous bible: why can't the film have an artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the Bible. I've seen very few movies that actually follow the real story. Watch a movie from his artistic quailities. <br /> <br /> When viewing this movie, you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version. Heston and Brenner had PRESENCE. They became their roles. You don't see it here. Even if you don't compare, stand on his own, this movie is too fast. Parts where the scene should be developed, no. It becomes boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: skip this and watch others. Like camps like others, it's a better and better movie.
