Jeez, that was extremely boring. Christian Schoyen must be the worst actor I've ever seen. And another thing, if the character in the movie moved to America when he was ten or something, and lived here for more than 20 years, he would have spoken much better than what he attracted here. Or say it in my own language "Skikkelig gebrokkent". But it's great to see Norwegian bagpipes in a movie made in Hollywood. it was just a damn shame that they were without talent. The plot itself is below average. I suspect that Christian Schoyen made this film just to live in a dream, as he clearly does in the movie by jumping one beautiful girl after another.
