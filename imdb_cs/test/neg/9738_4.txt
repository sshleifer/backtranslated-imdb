Maybe it's just me, but this movie looked more like a sequel or tracking than a separate project. Why? When it was filmed (just a few years after the war), most viewers probably knew why Rommel was so famous, why his death for Allied was so important, why Hitler's favorite general, but now, 50 years later, it's not. t so obvious anymore. "Desert Fox: The Rommel Story" is a decent war movie, but it is by no means explained by how Rommel got his nickname, what he did Allied considered him his best general, why did their troops so Afraid of Africa Korps? That's what's missing in this movie - we see his fame, his character, his way of dealing with soldiers and enemies, but f.e. We also see that Hitler complained about his achievements in Africa, called him a coward, etc. So we miss a big picture - it's the "Rommel Story", but unfortunately the "Desert Fox" is missing.
