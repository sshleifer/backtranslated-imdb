I write it when I watch a DVD. I grabbed a laptop and went to IMDb during the first song. I didn't know anything about the movie except that the friend said the show was supposed to be good. She also has a decent Netflix rating so I'm here. Maybe it worked on the scene. But I have to say that looking at choral boys who dance and sing completely naked seems stupid. And synchronizing lips with pre-recorded scores contributes to strangeness. Most songs and routines refer to aspects of male nudity. That's my idea of ​​nothing, sorry. Score, meanwhile, is a general show tune. Nothing unforgettable or especially melodic. Everything is meant to serve the lyrics. Which I must say, as if written by the committee. Every song is basically one widespread joke. If they were ten seconds jokes, they could work. These individual few-minute jokes don't. <br /> <br /> Now I'm watching the movie by chapter - a few minutes before I get into the game. Some in the hope that one of them will be different or entertaining enough not to let me go to the next scene. No. <br /> <br /> Good. I quit. So here's what I think. If you have any experience or long-term appreciation of music theater, avoid it - it's not just quality. However, if you are a twenty-something gay and you have never seen or heard a musical comedy, you can have fun. Or it might have your interest if you've never seen a lot of attractive naked men. <br /> <br /> I have.
