I absolutely love stand-up comedy. I like to hear raw thoughts on the podium because they appeal to viewers of their peers the different life experiences they have, or things they have invented or seen that they thought are so ****. stupid that they had to share it with someone. Once there were stand-ups who took the personality they could all relate to (Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind), or they were so damn crazy that you couldn't laugh with them because they laughed with others (Richard Pryor). And then there were provocative comics like George Carlin, who, although he pretended to be loon, was the smartest man in the room who appealed to people to reconsider the things they saw when they walked around and realized how it was happened. things were, and how easily they could change things. Now it may seem that it has nothing to do with "Mind Of Mencia", which, as I agree with most commentators, is Comedy Central's terrible solution to the loss of "Chappelle's Show," but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing stand-up bits for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, mostly on only racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be the three above-mentioned types of stand-ups. He makes a scenic character, everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite stereotypes, is just your run-of-the-mill normal guy. Then he tries to laugh at others, people he calls racist, or just those who disagree with his opinion. Finally, he finally introduces a parody to the viewers and spectators and tells them that it will help them see his opinion. Carlos Mencia always says he shows people that I don't see, but what he really does is not only promote racist stereotypes that already exist and have been funny to death, but stupidly encourages people to they heard and did one thing that helps them stay around: laughter. Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, but easiest, way to laugh in stand-up. The best comedians I fear Carlos Mencia feel is in good company, they don't have to resort to them. They speak in general, and they ask you to laugh rather absurdly than with it, as Mencia supports. As he creates more parodies or situations of "real life" that call for racism or to use others, he tells us instead of asking us to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes . His show is an insult to the minds of those who follow her. Mencia doesn't give us a comedy and asks me to spend it and take what we want (something I hate to compare the two, "the best Chappelle's Show"), tells us exactly how we should see and respond to it --- which, according to him, is making a stupid face and saying "Dee Dee Dee!" This show is suitably named. It's really a show about "Mind Mencia." It is Mencia's mind, through and through, and as such is nothing but silly fun. The show is tailor-made to give life lessons to its main audience at the age of 14-24, how bad the stereotypes are, but that racial assault is fine with Carlos Menci, so you should be fine!
