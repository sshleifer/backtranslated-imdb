Hooray for typos! After reading the reviews and meditations, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this film is a total piece of waste. This movie lost her as one of those rare Tarantino fans. I wish they were made on nitrate film, and all copies stored neatly under the Tarantino fanboy smoking chain. Virtually pointless violence, a plot of holes, Tarantino's desk-tois sans drama, and the absence of character development made this a thoroughly painful, celebrated montage. <br /> <br /> What was there? And how much of it was just because I was too busy reading subtitles? I look at my share of anime anime, and which way to attempt authenticity, but it was exaggerated for a movie in English. With glaring historical flaws, constant reading killed what was there. Why pay money for a narrator who has absolutely no connection to any of the characters, conspiracies, themes, backgrounds or anything else in the movie? When the film needs such an explanation from the hand, it is a harbinger of the utter filth that follows. Historical Research - While it was sprinkled with interesting facts, using the right costumes and props for the soldiers, this film put the truth behind historical fiction. Kudos on the Mata Hari link, although using it as a harbinger was a bit much. Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad that was not smothered in an isolated room. This destroyed any sense that might have a link. Other reviews mention more than half a dozen other artists in the first 15 minutes. With regard to the audience, all these and other references have been completely lost to many who would bother to see this movie, and all who enjoyed it. I'm confused by his choice of when to start the scene, end it and what needs to be included. In a movie promoted as an action movie, why did it take almost 20 minutes to make any kind of testosterone? <br /> <br /> What I believe is a message was trite. The idea of ​​rats and how we deal with them on a primitive nature and "who is a rat?" they were at best cliché, but they were not realized in the worst case. Mention of American camps for Japanese and German Americans would add a legitimate moral high level to this issue. Virtually every character in a movie who gets a talking role has been captured in their own legend. Is it the world Tarantino lives in? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't pay. I'm sorry I bothered to even see it, even with well-intentioned hosts. There was a rich base of ideas to develop, but none was realized.
