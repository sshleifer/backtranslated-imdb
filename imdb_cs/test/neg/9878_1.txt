*** CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> I was excited to see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. But once the movie started, I couldn't believe how different it was. I was happy at first, so both of her parents are dead ... maybe it'll be fine. But then the rest of the film came. I was raging before I finished. Nothing was right, but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden. At the end of the book, Gabriel was my favorite time ... and then the film turns into a totally ruthless idiot? The film also showed sorting, or werewolves, as these nasty, evil creatures were like a book showing how they just want to fit and keep their pack safe. They would never kill people for fun. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a movie as if they did, they should give it a different name and name the other characters. Because then I would go out and watch it again and buy it, but when I think about it, everything I see is bad. You couldn't pay me to see it again or buy it.
