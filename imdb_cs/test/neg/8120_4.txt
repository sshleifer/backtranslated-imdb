A horrible movie about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard. He catches him to bring her back with her. Glynis Johns is in the title role a really stupid individual with a tail hanging. Margaret Rutherford is the sister to be so eccentric, but we see no eccentricity. In fact, Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedy gifts. I like to see David Tomlinson in the movie. He and Johns would get into a much better "Mary Poppins" 16 years later. Miranda is the cause of two boys, neighbor's fianc√©e and chauffeur (Tomlinson). Ask any mermaid to see what's the best tuna, Sea Chicken! For this movie, forget it.
