I can't believe anyone actually paid for making this movie. Stupid, unrealistic and stereotypical. Right from the start of the massive 747 pilot, he pulled the throttle to speed up. then you have 5 armed people with semi-automatic weapons that shoot without one ball breaking 38,000 foot pressure cabin walls. Then once a stray bullet hits the FUEL under the plane's belly and we see the fuel escape from the plane. The meeting was just scary and forced. It seemed no direction. I saw some horrible B movies in my life, but with the names that were in this movie, I was very disappointed.
