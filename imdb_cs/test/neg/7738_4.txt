Because everyone is just watching MST3K with their artificial friends who make (mostly) not so funny and clear about the movies. And that's the only way these people are watching them, and then commenting and voting on the IMDb just because they don't even try to watch a movie on their own site. I watched this movie on my own, I haven't read the first reviews, I haven't had any people who would say what to laugh about, I just got a DVD (I bought Morons From Space for flip) old fave) and watched <br /> <br /> For that reason, I knew what I was in when it was Golan Globus, Albert Pyun's movie, but usually can be quite fun. The film's And Not Too Emphasizing The Brain Alice Down The Story Of Rabbit-Works Made So Many Times, And Similarly Similar In The Basic Structure (But Totally Different In Content) To Warlords Of Atlantis, Another Fun B-Movie. The voice was annoying, but then it is an idea they even cast with a few lines in the movie. The hero character had one of the worst peaks of voices / accents in the English language fi lm history, but you grow to accept and enjoy it. It's not a good movie, but it's not really a bad movie, it's just a bit of an average B-Movie DTV movie, nothing too new, nothing too erratic, and probably would rather enjoy the younger age group (say 7-14 years) than I. It's a little light fantasy. <br /> <br /> I see it again, probably not about 10 years ago I should. Don't be so tough in the movie, because you also have a couple of puppets, this movie is not taken seriously and it's definitely no Troll 2 or space revolt.
