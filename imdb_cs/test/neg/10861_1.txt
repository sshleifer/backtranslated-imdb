This is my first "terrible" IMDb rating and I couldn't think of a well deserved movie that would appreciate it. I was hoping I could amuse the garbage and find the sadness of the saddest, craziest kind. I found a movie that no one could take care of, including its creator. "Hell Ride", directed and written by Larry's "Friend of QT" Bishop, has a simple chart of hidden treasure and three keys, two bands of cyclists and a murderous murder in 1976 to be revenge. Larry seems to be incredibly determined to tell this story, instead of directing his swaying, strangely grimacing main character into situations where he can stroke women who pretend to be. He also has a dialogue containing enough horrifying fiery words / metaphors to give one of them the word "fire" for life. Dennis Hopper escapes total humiliation, others aren't so happy. Sometimes they hit the road on their bikes so they feel even more sorry about Michael Madsen because his high handles seem to add an insult to the injuries they had to discover in this movie. There's a lot of silicone nudity, but quite a little action and no humor at all, so you'd be wondering what kind of audience they meant. My guess is that most people who watch this movie, including the kitsch fans of the 60s bikers, will feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and read the real thing instead.
