What is really a moronic film, all I can say is that a writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and LSD because it must be the result of one of his "trips". Watching all the movie thinking right, it's very weird, but hey, I'm sure at the end there will be a very good explanation for all this ... Just to be disappointed when I found out it wasn't no explanation at all, and that at the end it does, more confusing. At the end of the movie, you will probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing at Que to pay for you food and the merchant told you it would be 11.95, please, and continue to keep you out of the balls. There are so many factors in this movie that are inexplicable and I think it leaves the viewer's imagination in a completely bizarre way. Don't Get Me Wrong I like strange movies, 'The Cell' can easily be described as strange and twisted, but in my eyes it's a great movie (despite the fact that J-Lo, which I don't like, to the maximum I feel failed my opinion). This is not one of those movies and I think you should take into account the characters of those who praise this film. I can tell you that they are probably people who would go to an art show, see the icon of pigeon excrement on a white board and say "Oooooh, what a masterpiece, the artist really found a unique way to portray eternity" when it really is Everything is bird feces on the board. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that the last piece to watch this movie, <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading!
