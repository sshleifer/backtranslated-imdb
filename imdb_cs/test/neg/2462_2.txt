"JB" (Jack Black) runs home after being plundered by his father (Meat Loaf). A few years later he finally gets to Hollywood and comes up with the biggest guitarist he has ever heard, "Kyle Glass". <br /> <br /> After a little quarrel, the two decide to join forces and get to the Open Mic Night for what seems to be less than the popular bar. They won't do well to their shock. When they return to their less than spectacular apartment, they both try to find out what the rock legends have to look at some old magazines. It's only when he realizes that the guitarists on the covers have the same guitar selection. While you are trying to find a similar selection, a music store employee (Ben Stiller, who is also Executive Producer) tells him about the "Pick of Destiny" story he is trying to do. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also says that the choice made from Satan's tooth is in the history of the rock museum. Now two losers with sweat of delusions of grandeur take place on an adventure filled with music to steal the selection. Allow me to say this in advance if you are not a Tenacious D fan who has given us Jack Black's comedy, then you should skip this. I'm not a fan of these two, and just watched because it was designed by Flixter.com. Jokes, for the most part, produce more silence than anything else. I laughed maybe three jokes and laughed at a few others. Tenacious D is for an audience only, I'm not. This film lags behind in many places where the worst jokes appear. And let me say that when Black and Glass don't work with each other, they're completely lost on the screen. All songs in this movie are made by Tenacious D. Perfectly move the story by describing their adventures at the time in the movie. However, I felt that the songs sounded too similar to be discussed. Another problem with this movie is that the language turns off many people. There are plenty of four-letter words in this movie. There are also links to medications. I wouldn't recommend it for kids. The part of Tenful D's schtick is that the black is in the face, and the glass remains in its shadow for the most part. That's how they're in this movie, and it really doesn't work. Now it could be part of the law, but I felt Glass just didn't want to be there. In one scene he performs at a party (in the background) at a party and just can't work alone. Tenacious D are allegedly rock fans in real life and have maybe two rock legends in the movie, I Lost My Number Because I Was So Bored With This Movie. Personally, I would like to see more rock legends and icons in the movie. But we won't get it. We get a movie filled with absolutely lame jokes, a dirty language, a bland scenario. You also get a terrible act and a non-original story. However, you get some pretty good songs that pretty much sound as well. The story could be promising, but many scenes seemed to have been added to the movie in the last second. This is somewhat similar to the Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had much greater consequences - and two songs on the charts. Tenacious D has only a small following, with several HBO specials under their belt. And unlike the Blues Brothers, comedy isn't even thought out. <br /> <br /> If you're a Tenacious D hard core fan, then I suggest you check it out. However, like most movie viewers, when this movie was released to theaters, I would say that I will avoid it. Save your money for this, people.
