An ugly woman-of-the-cellblock swing poking at the bottom of a midnight-movie barrel, combining pulpy sleaze with a hoarse girl-in-the-shower cliche. Linda Blair plays an innocent sent to jail (we learn frantically that she was involved in running over a guy with a car), facing a tough time in the Big House with some of the party's most beautiful characters Russ Meyer pic. Blair is constantly angry, punched, raped, humiliated and harassed. Dialogue is disgusted in all four letters and the swing leaves no release from its onslaught of violence and stupidity. However, some viewers see it as a camp's classic, although his tongue is not far enough in his face. * of ****
