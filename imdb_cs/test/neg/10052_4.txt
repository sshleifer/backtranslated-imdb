This is a family movie that was aired on my local ITV station at 1.00 am a few days ago. This could be a special decision on the part of planners, but REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a somewhat strange movie, weird in the way he doesn't want to upset his audience. Let's go to the fact that children have no more than sadism, and that is why Roald Dahl was such a favorite author for children. It also explains why the DOCTOR WHO has been such a successful show worldwide. In this scenario, you are just dying on the author of the false pulses to do something ugly to the kids, but that won't happen. I'm not a supporter of child abuse, but seeing Howard Spitz lose a rag to the little ones would make the film better. Can you imagine how much worse the KINDERGARTEN COP would be if all the PCs left the manufacturers? I mean, if you're making a film aimed at a child's author who hates children, shouldn't he tell and tell the story? Much of the problem lies with director Vadim Jean, and he feels he doesn't know how to deal with material that is bad news for the film. As someone remarked earlier, the soundtrack is random and Kelsey Grammar is very wooden. I think he was trying to play him with a dead pan just like the show he is famous about, but he doesn't work here, and there are many scenes with silent, ridiculous camera angles that seem unintentional, but very distracting. But at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is destroyed because no one wanted to offend the audience.
