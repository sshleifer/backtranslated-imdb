"The evil spirit takes over the girl and spreads the panic in the Louvre Museum" that's all I think, the film summary and the movie itself! What I think is one of the worst French or non-French films ever made in film history! Nothing good, except for music (only from credits!), some gentle moments (Sophie Marceau) and of course the final film of the movie. what we had when watching this CRAP, but also for being as perfect as one magical CGI job that was too good to be true! By the way, I want to change the summary of the chart so that it is such a "bad spirit takes some cinema artists to make miserable movies" .. Like this.
