I liked all the movies Lilo and Stitch. The TV series wasn't that great, but when I watched this movie, I postponed my views on the show. And I have to say ... It was bad. One thing I found out was a disappointed animation. Yes, you heard it. Animation. Since the first film, I have found that its quality is considerably degraded. His quality was just as high as the TV series, which I didn't expect. If you're looking for eye candy, don't expect much here. Also, animation has not shown any serious moods. Even in the supposed sad scenes, I felt nothing for character, another downgrade from the first movie. Next, was a terrible voice. I found it very, very unconvincingly, and I wondered why Disney, with all its wealth and fame, could not afford the voice actors a real talent. The skill of voice actors was as annoying as in the series. I tolerated the one in the show because, hey, who wouldn't be tired of doing so many voice episodes? Hell, I don't even know how many episodes there are (624 in theory, but I can't believe it). However, I thought that the film would improve the voice, and put the truth in the face that what they could do in the series was their best. Next, was a terrible scenario. It was cheesy to redeem and the writers simply tried too hard. He's trying to put some jokes, but I found them uncomfortable. Maybe it wasn't voice acting, but glaring dialogues that destroyed the sound section. (On the rise, the soundtrack wasn't too bad, and it matched the mood quite well.) <br /> <br /> Fourth, there was a story problem. I predicted everything and the story made the characters so unoriginal and suddenly unlikely. You have aliens to get new positions and responsibilities inouter space. After the initial humbug, they realize that they don't really like them and that they lack old life. Meanwhile, the evil villain breaks out of jail after a very action-packed action event and breaks in Jumbay's lab to steal his experiment. The experiment was then cloned into 100 others and the hamster wants to conquer Earth. When the main characters learn, they try to stop the evil hamster, but they get into confrontation with some kitsch final billing against the experiment and own it in an extremely poor apology that they're trying to make the series look cool. The characters then give up their new privileges and return to Earth to restore their lives. Seriously, how many more films did the end use? The story was extremely short and formal, so don't expect too much from it. So Disney has failed in sound, graphics and story. The only charm of the series was the original characters, and how they managed to keep the "feeling" of the characters, but even the film was unable to save them. I tried to enjoy it, I really did, but I give it 4/10. Another Disney failure.
