If you ever plan to rent (hopefully don't buy) this movie, think again. It was as if Gary Busey had a gun on his head and was forced to act or die. I was wondering if Busey was arrested for anything and was sentenced to play in this movie because I don't see the guy who would play much better with Keanu Reeves at Point Break in this disaster. It was a good movie, but there are thousands of other movies that let you laugh without wanting to get your money back. The only reason I would tell someone to rent a movie is watch this movie is to see Gary Busey jump up and down like a monkey. If you want a good funny movie, go through Quigley and go rent a Spongebob or something.
