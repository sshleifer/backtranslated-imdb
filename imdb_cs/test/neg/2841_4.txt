(Some Spyers) Dull as it was wasted by the water that this frightened homeless man, Darwyn Swalve, has on the murder of a real estate agent all over town L. because of the high prices they charge for their property. Looks like an extra from Clint Eastwood's "Spaghetti Western" Harry, who lived in abandoned houses where he ate dog food, is very upset when his lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted. This happens when a number of real estate agents have attacked his space in an attempt to sell houses to stay with his potential clients. Joseph Bottome stars in the bottom of the barrel horror as radio talk-show host Dr. David Kelly handsome and popular guest psychologist of the survival series KDRX. DR. Kelly is sued by the family of one of his callers, Tracy, who ended up blowing his brain when he was in the air, with a doctor who couldn't do anything to help her survive her suffering she had with him. Real estate killer with dr. In the air, Kelly tells her adventures, and the police try to get a doctor to get their phone number and address by keeping him on the line but refusing to hurt his rating by not calling potential callers in fear of watching LADP. Kelly also has a hot and tough relationship with real estate manager and bust agent Lisa Grant, Adrienne Barbeau, who is the office of Harry's main dealer in the film. Harry will also get Lisa's main competition in a housing business plump and outrageous Barney Resnick, Barry Hope, who threatened to take Lisa out of business in any way possible, even if he had to kill her. Get Berney and his pants to slice Harry's head off when one of his clients entertains him, the hooker he leaves dead and hangs together with the headless Barney. The film ends with Harry taking Lisa as a hostage and Kelly trying to get her to rescue her to Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano), looking like e, didn't sleep in a week, jumped out of nowhere and threw Harry's brains out. Harry quickly returns to life minus the homosexual affair between his ears and gets killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from the balcony and landing on the ground, as a dozen LAPD members, M16 lean over and ready, come in the scene. Nothing in the film "Opean House" worked with a tense laughter almost non-existent. Even the hot sex scenes between Dr. Kelly and Lisa didn't keep the movie because there were too few of them, only two of them, and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a little too underexposed, with lack of light and too much clothing, all of them. Harry the killer in the movie was also a bit comical to take seriously when he tried to do something, Dr. Kelly over the phone and in person, about the high personality. rent and property prices in the country and how people like him find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live. to repair it.
