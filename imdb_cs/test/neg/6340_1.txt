It is sad to say that the film is really horrible and one is trying to find ways to say it. But this is a horrible movie. Gene Hackman loses time (and one suspect, many dollars) to re-play his most famous, and oft again, a role as "Gene Hackman". Otherwise, television actors will be given the chance to become movie stars and resist temptation successfully. Patrick Swayze has a smaller role and has continued to do more things for which he must be eternally grateful. I watched this movie as a result of someone else's review and I felt that another aspect was worthy. You may not agree with my assessment, but now you are at least alerted.
