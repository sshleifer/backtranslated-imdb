An obscure horror show filmed in the Everglades. Two couples stay overnight in the cabin after being a little uncomfortable with the hostility of the locals. Who, or what, are Stalkers Blood? After a while he finds out. Beware of the character of a village idiot who acts like a chicken, he is definitely weird.
