I wouldn't like to give away too much film to tell you that there are many, many, many, many scenes of Lucas (the young protagonist) who go and watch things! Yes. And you'll be glad that the first third of the movie is useless, insignificant, and largely ignored for the rest of the movie. This movie is filled with boring people who make boring things and the dullest of them is young Lucas, who is blind and needs surgery. See, she has delusions, terrible delusions! He thinks the killer is fighting for blind women! He walks a lot and behaves like an unbearable jerk! <br /> <br /> Patience doesn't pay with this film. By the end, conspiracy and events are just as confusing and lethargic, and it is very hard to worry about one way or another about what any of the scary images meant. Nothing is clear, the film is moving at a pace, and that left me with the same hangover effects. Judging from "Fear of Darkness", the British do not make silly thrillers like Americans; they make boring.
