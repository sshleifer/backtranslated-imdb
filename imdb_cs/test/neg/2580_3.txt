Patriot (nothing to do with Mel Gibson of the same name) was released by Steven Seagal, who still made "environmental conservation" in his films. Which is fine. But it's not for good action. When the storyline (?) This movie finally kicked I saw a twist (?) coming a mile away. Seagal's anti-warfare, mother-nature care attitude is not very subtle. The film, which was originally released in cinemas, is filmed very much like a TV movie, despite some amazing footage of Dean Semler's country, the wolf photographer. Steven Seagal as one battle scene in the whole movie and it's totally boring. As an action movie it fails, as a drama that stinks, as the message of the environment is obvious. Avoid as Ebola crossed with the plague.
