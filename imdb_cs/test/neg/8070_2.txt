Rollerskating vampires?! I'm sorry, but even for 80 years, it's just too raw to be remotely frightening ... Can you apologize to the original weird moment because it was parodying old movies and TV shows, but it was once done, so the sequel was needed be a little less camp, no more bizarre! In addition, the first film had the presence of Chris Sarandon - a man who could even make stalking discos in a casual knit look alluring! - that this one is missing, so there was no "danger" in anything that happened, it just seemed silly. It's true I only saw it once when I was seven, but then I was huge. a fan of the original I remember being disgusted. For me there is no continuation of the Fright Night, just a cheap spoof that doesn't deserve any rating.
