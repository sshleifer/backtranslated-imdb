I was ready to love "Where is Poppa", this is the connection of normal sit-character actors who, when I grew up, felt like the widespread members of my broken family of a broken nuclear family. How fun it would be to see Barnard Hughes, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner, and censor Garret Morris. But unfortunately, "Where is Poppa" pulls. It is claustrophobia and burning, and violates the cardinal rules of farce, lightness of mood and fast pace. The storyline involves a lawyer (George Segal) trying to get rid of his superior Jewish mother, who lives in her huge apartment in New York. On the way we are exposed to ridiculous characters and situations: a comic group of muggers who repeatedly mugged the main character's brother, rape a policeman who includes a gorilla suit and subsequent homosexual love, Ruth Gorden pulled off Segal's pants and bit her ass while serving her dinner. Why does it not work? The explanation is a sense of destruction caused by cramped, dark interiors and an antique set. During this era, I totally ate New York cinema, but it seemed to me as if I was flipping through a police sheet in a dark bus terminal. <br /> <br /> However, the main reason is a slow pace. Modern MTV-style quick cuts have changed what viewers feel is a comfortable pace of editing, but even taking this into account, camera shots are kept too long. Land development is also very slow. There is one situation in which this works: a strange love song George Segal sings Trish Van Devere, gently, very close to her face, and for an unbearably long time. It reminded me of those who, in the British version of "The Office" in the British version of "The Office", found themselves in a miraculous environment where you would find yourself begging for a camera to cut off and not stop looking. Sadly, most of the film is more "in a hurry" than "can not turn away". Which made me wonder if it is possible to have a black comedy, which is also a farce. The dilemma is that the gravity of a black comedy object tends to weigh the lightness of a farce. Robert Altman and Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" films like "M * A * S * H" prove that this can be achieved. They do it not only with speed but also with fun subtasks, something that neglects "Where is Poppa". Although the film contains several stereotypically entertaining characters, almost all of them are directly involved in central drama. how to deal with a rebellious mother. The scenes with Garret Morris and Central Park muggers are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break. The muggers seemed to be almost Shakespeare, following the tradition of the comic ne'er-d0-wells. If the rest of "Where is Poppa" had a slightly tighter relationship with the stage tradition, it would be a better film. Edgier is not always better. It is as if all of these talented actors and director Carl Reiner had taken a short time before the 1970s creative film. Random Notes: After Ron Liebman dressed in clothes, he mentioned that "The Naked". Prey "(1966), a great action film that was a stylistic predecessor of the" Planet of the Apes "of 1968. As politically incorrect as he was, it is worrying to learn about the death of an action hero as the imposing Charleton Heston Linda Harrison, who played "Nova", Taylor's silent friends, said James Fransicus in the sequel seemed to be cute and small compared to Heston.
