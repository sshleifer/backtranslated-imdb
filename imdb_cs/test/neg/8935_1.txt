In the Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the good-two goodies, the Lucky Ducks cheerleading team must get into the cahoots with the 'hard' bad girls cheerleading demons team to defeat the terrible Falcon team that always wins in this camp I think. This is a typical 80 year old clich√© (lame) sex comedy that you think will win? But what the film lacks in originality is more than what makes it utterly bloody horror. Oh and insanely bad dance numbers and compulsory Japanese businessmen who want to buy the camp (assuming the male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, will stay at the camp of course). Simply terrible, forgotten, and unfortunately has a surprising lack of nudity. Where I saw it: HBO Comedy <br /> <br /> My Grade: F (yup I really gave it to them)
