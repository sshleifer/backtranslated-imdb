Very durable but ultimately harmless film version of children's literary classics, which includes an animated part in the style of MARY POPPINS (1964) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971). The human cast is very different - James Mason, Billie Whitelaw, David Tomlinson, Joan Greenwood, Bernard Cribbins - but their roles range from misunderstanding (69-year-old Mason as a thimble chimney sweep) to unimportant (Greenwood as a confused aristocrat) several "exotic" characters - including a circus artist, old deer, maid and fairy - for no apparent reason. The animated film segment, dominated by a group of East European animators, is barely inspired, but slightly pleasing in itself and, as usual, with this type of thing, there are a number of songs one has to cope with, one of which he is especially often too often for his own good. The film was directed by well-known actor Jeffries, who had previously directed (more successfully) other children's films, namely CHILDREN'S CHILDREN (1970) and CHANGE OF MR. BLUNDEN (1972; I haven't learned yet, but which was released on DVD DVD by Anchor Bay UK a few years ago).
