A slightly conceived continuation (.. the absurd idea that a snowman killer on a rampage in an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather) returns the spirit of a psychopath, returning through a scientific experiment that provides foreign elements that reintroduce life to its molecules (.. is the best I could do to explain this nonsensical concept). I could go in depth on how the island closes to kill many tourists, but I just don't find a reason to bother because it would be so exhausting. Anyway, the filmmakers think it's wise to kill pretty girls not ten minutes after they arrive (... I mean, why worry we'll even introduce them when we can't enjoy our eye candy, isn't it?! ). The murderous scene of the "anvil" takes the cake. Ice icicles stand out from the beach sand, so the victim can fall on them. Oh, and the other girl is stabbed with a pair of tongues. See what gets to me when I sit down to watch a snowman killer movie. funnybone ("Oh, it's such an amazing cheesy horror movie!") or wondering why the hell you're wasting your time with such nonsense. Jack Frost has the power to freeze water (then how did they be able to melt him in the first film?) And has the island resort to snow. One succession has Jack freezing pool water, encapsulating the swimming model under the sheet, the result is that she drowns with nowhere to escape. Oh, there is also a recreation "tongue stuck on the ice field" a little from Christmas Story ("Cowatonga Dude!") . I've got to cast him, though ... they're real soldiers trying to make this fun stuff fun. Christopher Allport (â€¦ perhaps unwavering) returns as Sam to face his old nemesis, just like Eileen Seeley, like his wife. Attempts at humor on the face (at least for me) fell to the ground, but the cast soldiers tried to make the most of a very difficult situation. and a pitiful dialogue. There is a development that increases the danger for those who are still close to Jack, his genetically altered water molecules, thanks to established foreign elements, allow them to withstand refrigerant / anti-freeze, and yet Worse now can reproduce .. through digestion, Jack hacks what appears to be snowballs that hatch to reveal small snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! A killer snowman costume and small snowball puppets that were introduced later in the movie could create a belly-laugh if you are in such a mood for such shenanigans, but I personally found that this junk is more of a hockey game (that's why purpose, I think, cheap gffaws) from those who are willing to accept it) and unbearable. The snowball is an obvious tribute to Gremlin, where we get a bar scene where little bastards celebrate the number of terrorizing victims at the resort. Weapon against them ... bananas! This explains that when Jack went to kill Sam in the first movie, they both fell on a truck bed full of antifreeze (... Jack's belly emerged from an icicle coming out of Jack's stomach as he pulled them out of the window into the truck bed) and I think in their being "connected" by icicle, Jack inherited Sam's banana allergy, or so this is what we are led to believe!) and thus both "unite" in a certain sense. Phew, such a film as it resists a simple explanation. It's a film with effects and conspiracy so terrible, one might find the presentation enjoyable because it's a lot of drawbacks.
