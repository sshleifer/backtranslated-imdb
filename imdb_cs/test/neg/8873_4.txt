The actors are so unprecedented that it is almost impossible to divide them (Pauline Kael said of the film, "Actors have names but they are really anonymous") and special effects are really bad. They simulate weightlessness with people hanging on the cables and recycling the tricks that Fred Astaire allowed to dance on the ceiling in "Royal Wedding" (but none of these guys move well enough to make it look convincing). The lowest point of the film is when one of the characters, the aircraft mogul, tries to convince some other "giants of the industry" to come with him in a monthly rocket consortium. showing them a Woody Woodpecker cartoon that explains how the rocket works at Level 2! (And to think that Robert Heinlein was working on the script ...) <br /> <br /> The only plus is that production design can communicate with the feeling of "Amazing Stories", even better in the producer (George Pal) the following movie "When the Worlds Collide", which has a similar bad playing, but is much more fun. However, Pal's best science fiction film must be "The Time Machine".
