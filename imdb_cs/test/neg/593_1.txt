I am completely into this type of story, but once the movie fired, I honestly said aloud, "I rented two dollar budget Christian POS". All I could find on this film was that it had a story of descent, but it was terribly executed. Terrible actors, terrible direction and production. The director and producer have to go watch the cube before trying to pull the film in one room. There was absolutely nothing that interests you to the point that you didn't notice that you were in the same room as the whole movie. Grapes! The two main actresses were very easy to see and you could say that the director relies on it to catch you. But these two and their bios can talk about it, they're terrible in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Don't let it be rented. If you're not blind, because it might be a few stars if you just listen.
