I am amazed that critics and the public have so well received the "Hospital". I found it grim, visually ugly, and generally meaningless. After the first 40 minutes of unrecognizable film, the film improves (relatively), but remains BACK too far (not to mention rude) to be successful as a satire, and has too little substance to succeed as a drama. The movie's uncertain tone is its greatest mistake, even shading Scott's amazing (as usual) performance.
