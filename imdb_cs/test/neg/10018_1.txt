The best thing about "The Prey" is the brand line ... "It's not human and has an ax"! The film itself is a padded stinkaroo .... endless insects and wildlife shots make the viewer want to die! No slasher fan will love this garbage ..... Watch "Friday 13" again and burn all copies of this movie you will find! Also rated as one of the 25 worst movies ever made!
