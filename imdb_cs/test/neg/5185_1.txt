What makes this movie so damn wrong? Is it lame sub-par juvenile humor? Could it be a horrible "fashion" suck ass music? Maybe the uninspired nowhere leads the story? Or maybe the fact that Traci Lords gives her the worst performance ever and adds insult to the injury keeps all her clothes on the entire length of this smoking sandwich. No matter why the movie sucks, the fact remains that it really does. I never wished to watch a movie with Dean Cameron, instead of what I watched in my life, but a "ski school" is a masterpiece of a comic genius compared to that. <br /> <br /> My Stage: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes, all launch Tupperware Breasts <br /> <br /> Where I Saw: Starz on Demand
