This movie was just bad. I can forgive low budget films for a low budget, but it wasn't funny, it wasn't clever, it had no redemptive qualities at all if you really don't like to look at fake boobs. I don't know what this genre is classified as maybe erotic horror, but if it is, it's neither sexy nor scary. Slumber Party Massacre was unnecessary; I've never seen previous movies myself, and besides one scene that tried to tie him together, I had no way to know who was the escaped psycho killer in the 'Cheerleader' or why he bothered him, especially since () and I don't think I'd find anything here) it was really clear that the cheerleader killer wasn't the one in this movie. As for the real killer? All I can say is lame. Really lame. When you find out why the killer is leaving the cheerleader (and the coach of the team, and the two stoners who were on the bus route they are taking, and the bus driver just because of the hell, apparently) will you sit there and go-- WTF? Worst apology for the murderous spree at all. "Actors" (two estimates of why I added quotes) generally looked like low-budget porn rejections that most likely were. The poor people are trying to break into the "legitimate" film. One of my friends was supposed to say about the actor who played Buzzy, the bus driver: "It looks like the guy who, you know, gets really into it, and his face gets all the red and stuff." We had a good larf on it. Half of the other actors had all the skills and subtleties of the actors in the sixth edition of "Annie" I just saw. The other half seemed bored with death (especially on the erased scene, in this one redhead ...) and I was also ten minutes into this movie. <br /> <br /> Note: The DVD contains one deleted scene that would give the R-rated movie to NC-17 if it was left. It was totally unreasonable, and because adult entertainment has no quality. The only reason to bother with it is to laugh, much to the wrong.
