Movies like these don't need a sequel. Part of the benefit Don Bluth takes away from Disney is that he did not have to suffer the endless tirade of badly animated cash-in sequels. But it seems like it was a great idea for someone to do the sequel to "All Dogs Go to Heaven" so we have it. Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and is not that good. Most of the film is just a bad excuse to continue and is not nearly as dark, different, or fun as the original. I'm sorry for future generations who will have to endure an endless sequel, like this, without knowing what it was like to have time when Hollywood did not confine itself to successful movies like crutches to free the banal stupidity. Please no further continuation of children's movies, I don't need them.
