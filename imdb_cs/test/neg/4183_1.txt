This thing. God, this. I can't even call it a movie. Film is something that does something. goes somewhere. has some semblance of plot or SOMETHING. I don't know how I do it. Not really. First I say Dark Field is the worst movie ever. and I thought it was. then the ghost island pirates turned out to be bad. And now, the third time in a row, another movie goes above and beyond the obligation to test that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> (sighs) OK. Dark Harvest II: Corn. Sir, that's terrible. Let me share this with you. One feels that the daughters are threatened by some of the magical psychic powers they got from their Popcorn Act II, and the races to find them in the cornfield. Of course, this is the most terrible cornfield in existence, the size of the cornfields of Jeepers Creepers, Children of the Corn, and Signs. the main character whose name is Shy (the amazing name btw) then goes through the cornfield. he kicks off for a moment ... and goes through the cornfield. and an incredibly sad thing? I don't really leave anything. That's almost the whole movie. The only thing I can leave is how two police officers who want to arrest him for ... I don't know. pretends to be an actor. I wasn't interested in this point. He gets away and the police are - something the killer shuts down. Holy crap is a killer? apparently, it is that he has almost 4/5 in the movie. but wait! then he runs for a while and is here, you guessed it, running through the corn field and digging. Then it's the end to save your daughters. Huzzah. The biggest problem with this movie is boring. It's INCREDIBLY, INHUMANLY, TREMENDOUSLY boring. I can't explain how horribly boring the thing is. nothing happens, the characters are as appealing as the root canal and it's just an hour and a half of the NIC. ONLY the good thing that came out of this movie was that my friend and I could find enlightenment because of the near nirvana condition that got us into this film after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to kick overdrive to keep us alive. During the ensuing madness, I found myself embracing the wall much more pleasant and my friend found a new passion for hysterical laughter as he floated across the floor as if he had a seizure. This is the kind of madness that this film brings. it's not just bad. It's bad for your health. The cover looks amazing with the image of the haunted scarecrow assassin AWESOME, which I would totally consider dressing like horror, but this was a deceptive field. Don't get it done! don't watch this movie. watch a better corn movie. Every grain movie is better. Don't let them get! No! and 0 of 10
