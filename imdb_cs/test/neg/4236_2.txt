This two-and-a-half hour film was recently introduced at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) at 10 am. There was a scheduled 1 AM show after that, but wondering if anyone would stay awake to see that until 3:30 in the morning. The opening scene is a man who walks in the field and takes four minutes of film time. It's a sinister sign of what has to come: more than 144 minutes more. There is a scene of a man and a woman against the wall, standing in the sun. It repeats 15 times, with very sparse dialogue. Occasionally, these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking photos, such as closing female genitalia that are displayed for a full minute of movie time (viewers laugh in the last 20 seconds and say, "What's that message?"). The story resembles Dostoevsky's novel "The Karamazov Brothers", in which the credo falls in love with a woman of simple morality. In one of the rare moments in which the crowd laughed (more in despair to try to justify that there had been nothing going on for two hours), it was when the British tourist said that he had not seen things clearly since the Eurostar traveled at 180 miles per hour, the translator translated with the automatic switching of units of measurement from the English system to the metric system to "could not clearly see things because the train is traveling at 300 kilometers per hour". It was amazing on this film that the quality of cinema shows that a lot of money was spent on it. This was no film kitchen 8mm experiment. He was carefully planned, structured, acted, montaged. Yet I was so little of it. Some comments have shown unbearable details, such as the details of a key chain on the door that just opened. Well, it was recorded, but what was the purpose? Some predatory people in the audience left after the first hour. The rest remained out of curiosity: something must happen at the end. He was never there. And maybe it's the movie. All movies in the theater are packed with action. This one wants to be different. Nothing happens.
