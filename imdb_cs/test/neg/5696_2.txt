So it's a space movie. But it's a low budget. You ask, "what effects?" The effects are sometimes good and sometimes really bad. I mean wrong. And notice that I started with effects. There's a story, but it's said in what I think is a bad order. I don't mean the wrong order of Tarantino style. It is said in a totally meaningless arrangement. Mostly she is a mother (in the future because she knows she is a science fiction), as her daughter told her, which is mostly a show performed in a narrative from a daughter's perspective. All you have to do is go through the first hour and hear that Darrow's voice is a computer, you realize how much more tolerant the story would be if he read it. This narration is so constant and extensive that the actors on the screen hardly say the word for the first hour. There is also a lesson for you and the upcoming filmmakers: if you don't do 2001 and want to do some action (this does), then PLEASE hire a good combat choreographer. Otherwise, your battles will look good in BATTLESPACE. And note that the name has the word "battle" in it. Ugh. I think it may be a classic scenario that tries to create a movie based on nothing but a concept. And some effects. My biggest surprise is to see the IMDb list of this movie worth $ 1.8 million. When you compare it to something like PRIMER, which was better with a few thousand budgets, you realize in a low budget movie, it's all about the story. I didn't expect much - but I was disappointed with STILL. Two out of ten stars.
