Never take a film just for its good looks. Although it all starts well, the film suffers from the same imperfections you see in B-movies. Just as at some point, the writer will no longer make the end of the film, so he will end it so that no one can argue that he thinks it is brilliant. A movie that will be listed at the top of the litter list. <br /> <br />
