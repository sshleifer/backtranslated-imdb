Karen and her boyfriend Jerry moved to their new Los Angeles apartment. They discover an old brass bed that Karen liked, unfortunately, has a truly sinister history that involves murderous sex murders. The action is slow. The action is slow, acting is nothing special and there is no tension anything. Although they are sexual scenes lame.The top is pretty cruel and violent, so fans splatter should be pleased. However, the first hour of "Deathbed" is fatally boring and offers some tired horror conventions and cheap scares.Definely one to avoid. My rating: 4 out of 10 and it's generous.Watch "Re-Animator" or "Castle Freak" instead.
