I rate 'The Decline of the American Empire' just below average because it wasn't terrible, but also big. I liked the very open conversations from people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out. That was probably the most original aspect? sexual little movie with people who are very far from models. That aside, it seems ironic that these French-speaking Canadians have a film about a neighboring society that, well, is in 'Decline' when their own actions are their own extinction. A group of girlfriends and friends spend half of the film laughing at their disbelief and accepting such behavior, and the other half "intellectually" talking about how powerful they are for their speech and actions. These are common goals in typical situational comedies, where the main characters entertain themselves at parties dealing mainly with university professors. Unfortunately, it is not their "intelligence" or "history" mastery. It is their ego pedestal and a more powerful attitude that moves me away and not a single character could relate to or resemble me. When one cries, couldn't I care less? It's your bed. When someone complains, I barely twitched. What made me skirmish was one character, uh, pissing red. (Another example of playing with fire.) Sure, I understand that it will happen to some people, but it was hard to watch. And frankly I hoped he washed his hands because he had no problem going back to cooking for everyone. At the far end of noses-up educators, they introduce a stereotypical nomad. That made me cringe because nobody seemed real; everyone was as shallow as their laughter in society. Unfortunately, when no one stayed in the roots, you remained as empty as the soul of these characters.
