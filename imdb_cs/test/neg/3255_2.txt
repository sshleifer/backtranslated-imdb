This movie is upset. That's horrible. If he liked it, these people should examine their heads. Jackie Mason's character sounds like a retard. The guy trying to kill a gopher is defeated and he sucks. Although Chevy Chase was in this movie, he wasn't funny. This film had coarse and indecent jokes and had no Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. Even though Jackie Mason's character had the character of Rodney Dangerfield's character, Mason's character sucks. Rodney Dangerfield was funny! He should go back! I don't care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should come back. The original Caddyshack was Murray's career career. If he were funny in the first fun, he could be funny in the other. <br /> <br /> Final comment: I recommend this movie ... NOT ONLY !!!!!!!! THIS FILM SUCK !!!! THEY ARE OUR, THAT SENSES AND ALWAYS SUCK !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
