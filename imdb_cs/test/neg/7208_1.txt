Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1 of 10: In Einstein's Theory of Relativity is the time from the point of view of time looking at time. (Or so I heard) In other words, this film feels much longer than an hour and a change. Even on a fast forward (and you will shoot this fast forward button) it will be somewhere around eternity. <br /> <br /> If you know your own version of Lionsgate's Greenlight project (that's where you buy a home movie, but the fantastic cover on it and sneak into the horror section of your local Wal-Mart), you won't be surprised by the complete and complete lack of Fun values ​​contained inside. Reading the line (I refuse to call it acting) is uniformly horrible. This is a collection of dead dads and strippers pretending to be in a film between the cans of Schlitz. Working with the camera is a drunk father filming the quality of a film holiday and while special effects are fine the scariest effect is breast augmentation scars on the nude scene. The story is terrible, the kits are spooky Halloween put on high school students ADHD and again reading the lines (remember that it no longer works before sinking at the bottom of the pool is swimming) is distracting for mere words. Avoid.
