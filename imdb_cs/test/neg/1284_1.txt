I had to watch this movie with my five year old. He wasn't once allowed to ... throughout the film ... and loves dogs and laughs almost anything! This movie was terrible of all aspects: a bad script (even a children's account for G-rated movie), bad production (nervous camera shots made me feel sick for the first ten minutes), bad playing (maybe they were "directed" to act cartoonish ), and even poor sound quality (there are parts where the sound level seems to be fine, then you can't hear what another actor says). I am willing to deal with quite a bit when it comes to watching a children's movie, but it was worse than having a stick in the eye. I also didn't like the fact that I was afraid of my head with the faith of God-heaven. Overall, it was the biggest loss of 90 minutes in my life ... and I made some time on my day.
