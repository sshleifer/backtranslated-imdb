All in all, don't wait too much and you won't be disappointed. And if you want to see a movie that takes you back to 1983, it's definitely going to be. The only reason I gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for two reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Michael Caine <br /> <br /> # 2. Brazil's culture and music The film is almost completely borne by Caine when he commits a seemingly impossible task to turn him into a viable and partly trustworthy story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper do not. Michael Caine is a pure class, as always. In addition to being a talented classic and comic actor, Caine brings a mixture of introspection, malice and sensitivity to every movie that makes ... the focus of his spell as far as his role in Alfie ... and the reason he won the Academy Award for Hannah and her sisters two years later. In this farce she is tenderly charming ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholic and sentimental .... and besides the jewel of Rio de Janeiro, she is the ONLY reason not to seek a better form of entertainment. Well ... maybe looking at 2 beautiful young actresses, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. But the view is all you can do in Michelle (though her appearance seems to be dated) ... he couldn't have been a more painful film experience than watching her "effort" act (most of her dialogue seems exaggerated). Demi's performances and prospects will last a hundred times better, and you could easily transpose it as it is to any film today (in fact, it doesn't look too much to be honest). Mrs Moore is certainly under-utilized, especially since she was a bigger star of 2. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a stupid farce, at the end I am a bit like the maturity that all these people can handle This scandalous situation ... that neither friendship nor marriage is over, and that the issue, even with your best friend's underage daughters, could be forgiven and everyone can go on. Injured parties show anger and disappointment at what has happened, but they all work for the best .... a little unrealistic for sure, but surprisingly refreshing. Hope is always.
