I have to admit that despite all the promotions and the Oscar nomination, I didn't expect the film to be expected before I watched it. And I really found what I expected; a film that seeks to be likable for both conservatives and liberals in Turkey, trying to be authentic for foreign audiences and funny enough for everyone. However, it should be borne in mind that it is not possible to be favorable to everyone, so the film remains average for everyone. The whole film tells the story within 24 hours. In order to fit short stories in the full length of the film, some scenes are added without linking to the main story. Mostly it is an ice cream seller selling scenes to eccentric local people (ie Goat shepherds, old women, etc.) And each of these sales scenes is trying to capture the audience with a comic dialog. The theme is mentioned as a universal problem: the struggle of a local manufacturer-trader against holding companies and a monopoly, but it was an interesting topic twenty years ago. Most readers remember Ferhan Sensoy's "Hero grocer against supermarket" in the 1980s. That was the right story at the right time. Briefly, this story is not strong enough and is worth to be a film like today. <br /> <br /> In addition to some gibbery due to local accent, casting performance is so successful. The main role is played by Turan Ozdemir with excessive body language, but still successful. On the other hand, against a limited budget, the director and player's considerable efforts seem to give the film a good mood. But this is not the result of a quality film that is comparable to Italian neo-realists or which should be nominated for an Oscar. Note: An ice cream vendor would stop his own production in real life and be a dealer of one of Manda's competitors.
