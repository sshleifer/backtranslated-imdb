Usually, when I don't see the show on the original run, I'll find it later on the cable and realize it's a gem. "Gimore Girls" is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I missed it. I really despise the shows that fill every minute of the game space with a stupid, stupid, boring joke. That's just one hour. Mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she was bipolar and out of her lithium. She never stopped talking; every minute, every second, talk to every person she communicated with. Worse still, her speeches are childish and soooo like Valley Girl. She talked about boys, her hair, her mother, her clothes. What is sitch? (for situation). I watched this show three times and I still have no sense of this series. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it doesn't make sense except that three generations of women in one family look like "Girls" from Mars. Men in comparison are intelligent and make the show somewhat observable. If Lorelei existed and tried to talk to me, I'd have to tousle her to get rid of her. Apparently, he doesn't know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. She also does not know how to really notice the existence of others. In one show, Lorelei comes home from 10 am. She got a date after chasing a guy she met at the auction. She goes to her daughter's room where her daughter asks how it went. He's trying to find out how boring this guy was. Her date somehow got a few words on the edge. Lorelei complained how the man had stopped talking (choking). Hopefully the date learned how happy he was. One other person commented on how a mother behaves like a teen and a daughter is an adult personality. Lorelei even dresses like her baby. This apparently 40-mum dresses and looks like she hit a shopping mall with her high school friends. I thought that after this show, "Just Shoot Me" should follow because I felt it.
