This is a terrible adaptation of Charles Kingsley's story. The animation is terrible to say bluntly. And the songs are a shame to the film songs, the epsecially "high cockororim" song they keep repeating. I'm sorry about Jon Pertwee and David Jason, the two best British talents providing voice for depressing animation. Bernerd Cirbbins is trying in this terrible production, but he will not succeed. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it's the last movie on the planet!
