I went to see it because I never saw Tel-Aviv where the story is set. I was disappointed because it does not offer many views of Israel's largest metropolis. It is also pretentious - one of those movies that will let you guess in your sense until you give up shrugging. The main character is Batya, a woman in her twenties, who works as a waitress at a secured wedding. Her parents don't care much about her, and when a little girl leaves the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels compelled to take care of her. The little girl doesn't talk to her and Batya can't give her a social service because it's weekend and the agency is closed. So he takes her back to his scattered roof apartment, and when he comes to work in the evening, he has to bring a little girl with him. The boss is very unhappy with this and other shortcomings in Batya's work performance. Another main character is Keren, who is getting married. At a wedding party (where Batya, of course, works) shatters her leg, climbs out of the lady's room, whose door doesn't open, so she and her new husband can't take the Caribbean vacation they planned. It ends up in a dirty hotel on the waterfront with no view. It smells bad, there is traffic noise and Keren still complains. Her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman? writer ?? who is also staying at the hotel and Keren is afraid he slept with this stranger. The third main character is a Filipino woman named Joy, who takes care of old people. The old woman who is hired to look after her is very miserable and doesn't speak English, only German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English, but not Hebrew or German. Mostly she is interested in how her son is doing in the Philippines and wants to buy him a toy as he asked. He finds the perfect ship in the store and plans to buy it. The old woman's daughter, who hired Joy, is an actress who appears in some postmodern "physical theater" adaptation of Hamlet and doesn't get along with her mother. The way in which these three stories, which intersect for a moment, are probably considered deep. I didn't get it. There is a fantasy relationship to Baty's relationship with a little girl, and perhaps a non-existent relationship between Bata and his parents is somehow reversed in this relationship. When Joy sees a toy ship in the shop window, there is a strange strange effect in which small sails ripple as if the wind were blowing and doing it as if they were on the scale of a real ship. Keren draws a bottle outline around the ship that is on the cover of the booklet in the hotel room, and the ship in the bottle mentions the strange female poetry. But what does that mean? I thought about it for a moment and realized that I would not lose sleep in this process. If someone out there has a clear idea of ​​what this is all about, maybe they can fill me up.
