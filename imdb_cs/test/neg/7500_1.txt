So umm this woman has a scabbard that sucks people in her when they do it and there's a guy who likes to watch her around ... everywhere ... and uhh is umm in love with her and she can't love him because her thing . Well, her thing is going to talk to her ... somehow ... she just says she feeds me over and over again and tries to feed her hot dogs, but it doesn't work because it ummmmm wants fresh meat? So this woman is heading to the Red Light District, where she raises tourists, but only the really slim ones, because I think she deserves it, and after a while this guy is looking for her and even when he's like him, she doesn't see her so she finally gets involved to boom twins, but he likes only one of them, because the other one is real. Not bad, as I thought it would be the cause of the kind of news being worn out in the first 1/2 hour, and it takes another hour. I think it killed a couple of brain cells because I sat down the whole thing and now I was a little damaged by the brain. Either way a man is the worst human-eating vagina movie I've ever seen.
