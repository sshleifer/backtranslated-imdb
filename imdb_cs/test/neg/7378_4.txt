So I would give him zero stars, but lo and lo, it came out long before the Ricky Gervais series. Yet it is hard to watch this or any other similar dynamics show (including the American "office" without comparison. It's just not close to being the same. <br /> <br /> I'll give you I will also say that - and the American "office" and "Larry Sanders" - are real satires.
