Unlike most comments in this section, I have to say that this film hardly escapes the definition of "garbage!". The only readers who are aware of what a clich√© catalog is are those who, like me, live in the northeast and know firsthand what an area is. I'm totally sick of films that are supposed to be "realistic," but they show the working class (anywhere) as silly, criminal low-life, but then apologize for their social background. And funny? I smiled briefly and laughed once, but it was at odds with the two boys' actors with Sunderland accents who were reportedly trying to hide their Newcastle accents from Sunderland football fans! Throughout the film there was only one sympathetic character, and it was a senile grandfather played quietly, but very competently by Roy Hudd - the only non-Geordie in the cast. When it comes to writing - Well, I wonder what the university sociology has been doing at the department. He certainly didn't have an ear for a local accent. And I have never heard the word "Purely Belter" - and not only am I a linguist who has written articles about the local dialect. Don't waste your time and sight on this waste. It's not funny, it's not realistic, it's not fun, and it's fundamentally dishonest.
