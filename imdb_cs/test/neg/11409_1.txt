In another horrible horror movie that seems so masochistically appealing to us, we have a lot of friends stranded in a haunted house that slowly kills one by one thanks to a horde of zombies exploding yellow blood and having very bad dental problems. The first 45 minutes is all that is said, and given that the young thespians cannot act from the paper bag and are given the most banal dialogue that is ever recited, it is particularly painful to sit. If you manage to stay awake through this nonsense, things don't improve. With bad makeup galore and kitschy, convenient basement (non-so-special) effects. As for the conclusion ... well, what is the bet that an old timer who warned them about leaving for a haunted castle in the first place will appear and save the day for the last two survivors (boy and girl, of course) with his mystic powers? Please, life is too short for these movies. Give the time you would otherwise spend watching this trio to help the community, do a few shifts in the soup kitchen or something. You will feel that you have actually done something productive in your life, and you will not have the money in the pockets of studios that spew indestructible waste like this. Unfortunately it's too late for me now, where did I put that copy of 'Pumpkinhead'? 1/10
