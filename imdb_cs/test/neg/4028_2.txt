This whole film is so terrible that it's a complete mess. The story is so stupid that I can't believe someone actually sat down and wrote about it and thought it would be a good movie! Acting is probably the worst of any b-movie ever made. Before, I saw a lot of science fiction b-movies and some of them are actually pretty good, but some of them should never be created. to think that just because they put something together and somehow got on the shelves in the movie store, they got something that was good and people should watch it. This is not always true and it is certainly not the Venus truth. This film loses all accounts: horrible gameplay, stupid storyline, very weak special effects, ugliest costumes at all, unrealistic dialogue, wrong direction, etc. It's too much credit! I urge you to stay away from this movie wreck for your own good!
