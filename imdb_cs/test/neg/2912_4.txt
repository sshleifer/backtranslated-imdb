Let's get hard is one of those movies that people probably regret years later that they did. This story of East End Kids is full of terrible racist Japu and jokes and describes how children want to join the army to defeat the Japanese. Because they are too young, they decide to clean the city out of those terrible Japanese. They will find him, throw fruit at him (without being done to stop them) and pull out a short sword to endanger them! Cops say they stop bothering him! It's just Chinese! It's on our side! When the kids come back to apologize, the Chinese man is dead! All this is part of this huge Jap and German Spy circle! Children see to it that it is stopped at all costs! I'm sure this was all right when it was done (1942), but now you realize it, of course, that is clearly a time product. Full of stereotypes, German and Japanese. Funny how East End Kids has a black guy in the group and he is not spared. Gee marmot.
