***** At the end of the film, I reveal two 'twists'. Don't read if you want to watch this movie for some reason ***** <br /> <br /> Oh, that's bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest contemporary actors, sold his soul and appeared in it. The only consolation is that screenwriters have to realize that someone who is ultimately pathetic like Steve Guttenberg can never strive for someone as cold as Sean Bean in his life. Instead, he is killed in what had to look like an amazing twist at the end, by the good guy who was meant to be killed by Bean, but was actually his boss and made his own death. Do not worry. I didn't destroy anything. The act itself is impressively impressive, with Guttenberg's patented "Hey-look-me-can-move-and-Chuck-Norris-face" tough man staring at most of the two hours of hell on earth. Added to the conspiracy I could write while I was tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off, there is also a completely pointless critical error in the fact that one moment the virus escapes if they look badly while another moment, Steve Guttenberg He is bravely running around with throwing, catching assaults and generally abusing this 'virus', which has a different look collection of those little soap bars that you put in the tub. My last word? If you are suicidal in depression and feel like you want to laugh manually at something that should be a bad comedy, but worse, don't come to Channel 5 next week, then burn it when you realize I'm really telling truth.
