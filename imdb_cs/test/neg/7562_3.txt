I have seen the movie many times and every time I am becoming more disappointed, which is a shame because the movies from EX YU are usually very good. It is a pity that Holiwood tried to make a film about a place and people he has no idea. My self coming from the Balkans (Macedonia) found this film to be disappointing. To understand the personality mentality of an EX YU, you need to know their background, the way of life, what makes them cry and laugh. And the film's director did not take this as a guide. When we make (EX YU) films, many symbolisms are built in them, making the characters recognizable and sympathetic and mostly depicting the truth (if based on the true story). "Tito and I", "Underground", "No mans land", "Before the Rain", "Black Cat, White Cat", "Otac on a Put Put", (When Father Was on a Business Trip), "Ko to tamo Peva "(Who sings there?) A precious piece of Balkan cinematography and nothing to do with it, not a half-burned story and Holiwood studio because someone on the panel mentioned the story jumps from one end to the town. I'm sorry, but when the movie is made, it's not only for the American range of spectators' seats, but also for the rest of the world, and some of them also live in the Balkans and Sarajevo and also insult the injuries, half of them in Bitole Macedonia, where I come from. Imagen my shock when I saw Wide Bitola Castle in openi ng movie scene when the bride is shooting from sniper. And what was that inserting real shots of the news in the movie? By the way very disappointing, because the truth is far from the film. It is a pity that nobody with real people has consulted how to live in Sarajevo under fire before filming a movie. The book is one thing and real life is different, and this film leaves both.
