I normally write reviews, in fact, I never write reviews. This film was so appalling that it actually inspired me to start. Virtual sexuality is trying to be cheerful and brash teenage comedy about the usual traps; virginity, boys, etc., except for the main character, will apparently turn into his perfect boy, who created with the help of a machine at the technology fair. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting? Well, it's not. Negotiations are the simplest and terrible I've ever seen. The unfortunate thing is that it seems to really support the script and the movie, which probably explains why I've never seen them in any memorable production ever since. I didn't bother to learn the names of the actors or their characters. Lading lady doesn't bother you or enchant you and you don't care about her at all. The friend's friend does not cause any sympathy, even if the script screams at you to regret it. The only rise you get is extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half-decent actor was a blonde-headed man who, despite his unfortunate weakness, had indeed given him everything he could, which wasn't much in the light of such a terrible work. I will not even talk about the game's abominations, which is the "bad guys" plot. But then again, what conspiracy? I watched this movie unfold in disbelief because I had no idea how anyone would have the foolish insistence to write such a script, never produce, act and manage it. . I can only wonder. The only reason I stayed with my companion and I continued to watch such a wrecked example of the movie was the incredible laugh that we had developed from us because the coherence, logic, class, and even impotent story were neglected within half an hour. I have no idea at all why anyone would want to break the film industry by publishing it to the public. This is a movie joke and it's best to keep the accumulation of dust in the stores for the rest of eternity. 1/2 of 10. If yes.
