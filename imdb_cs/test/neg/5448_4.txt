It's hard to tell if this B-film adventure is ham, spoof, homage or just plain bungle, but it doesn't work as you look at it. Based on Michael Crichton's new novel, it is a nut mixture of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, naff visual effects, and whimsical dialogue. The first thing scuppers this tosh is a gorilla that can communicate in sign language, and needless to say, the movie doesn't get better from that point on. Doing all this old rope somewhat worthwhile to be Tim Curry, turning in a frantic bit of ham and a sports bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know this is all the load of old waste.
