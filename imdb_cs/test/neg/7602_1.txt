This film was so bad and so cheap and so handy, I found that this film is one of the most boring slow movies from the early 80s that I've ever seen. I like most of the 80's horror movies, but I never lent this. It just didn't make any sense. The family, who lives in the woods, invites her son, her wife and daughter to spend their holidays with them, and during the film, for some reason, mother and bride do not get along well. We never found out why until almost the end of the film, but until then, all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of ESP and daughter-in-law has nightmares and memories of the catastrophe of what happens. the unfortunate victims of this "thing" that we have no idea what "it" looks like, all we see is a bright light signaling its approach, and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of Darth Vadar's voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies . Then, when we finally find out what and who it is all I did, there was laughter. This "killer" turns out to be some kind of extraterrestrial Japanese World War II warrior who has apparently returned to life and asked for his mother and her family. And everything that a mother does is standing in front of the living room, shaking hands in flames, or something as if she was going into some cramps. This movie is pathetic! Avoid it, it's not even for renting.
