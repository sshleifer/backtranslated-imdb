What a shame. This is a terrible shame. The table was built, the candles were lit, the guests came ... and then ... <br /> <br /> ... nothing really. Just flashy drivel. It could have been great, OK, maybe it's not great, but it could have been very good. All the elements were there, but at the end of the day the bottle was empty. How it happened is a mystery to everything the director has at his disposal ... <br /> <br /> ... the story was pretty brave, though it required a lot of work with maybe several finishing transcripts to make the story he fixed and tightened the characters a lot (the only thing that was consistent and constant and unnecessarily tight was cinematography, but I get to it). But the direction was lousy, the acting was just: _a-CTin-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and lots of ham, and then cinematography ... <br /> <br /> ... but it was something to look at! But only if you are in a film school "Cinematography 101, never under any circumstances use a professional film camera". Obviously the student fell asleep through the introductory part of the lecture and only heard "... using a professional film camera ..." and then blissfully returning to la la land as the sentence ended. What can I say; amateur and cocky at last! I can only see the movie that is supposed to be as attractive as Chick Flick because it is supposed to be sad, but then it falls and just ends up as 'sad' (like an apology for the movie) ... so even the 'Chicks' wouldn't let the schlockenspiel fool ! <br /> <br /> PS. I felt bad for Miss Diaz. She is much better at her craft than what the film has allowed her, though she was absolutely wrong. Actually, I'm sorry to everyone in this movie, except for the director and (you guessed it) cameraman! I say '1. against the wall when the revolution comes! ' OK, really not, after all "it was just a movie", but maybe a good "tar and feather and run out of the city" could be more satisfying or at least much more fun !!! <br /> <br /> TTFN :-(
