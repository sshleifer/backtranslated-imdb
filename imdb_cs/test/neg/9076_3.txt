Other reviews talked about how honest this film is, especially when it comes to male frontal nudity. Well, those who have seen Grande Ecole with their often naked actors and have been expecting something like that are for great disappointment. Other than a few seconds in the judo team locker room, the two-head showers take a total of 15 seconds. Female leadership has comparatively short frontal moments. Lots of marketing for this movie is aimed at gay viewers, but those who expect a hint of homoerotics between the two male leaders (the best friends who have a three-way relationship with one of them) will be most disappointed. There is no indication that anyone is interested in the other, nor has he barely realized that the other is part of the trois threat. As a movie, Douches Froides is curiously uninvolving; the viewer has little sense of who these three young people are, how they feel, why they behave like them. About one hour of the original cut was erased; Perhaps this is why the finished film seems frustratingly underdeveloped. Stay with the French film Grande Ecole, which more than fulfills its promises.
