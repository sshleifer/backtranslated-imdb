I am probably one of the few people to defend and even enjoy "Frisk", a project that has given Todd Verow a map if it's really where he is. I appreciated that someone had the courage to take Dennis Cooper and not back from the material; Verow is quite rolling in her. Judging by what he has done since then, he is well suited to this type of material and should probably stick to it. "Vacationland," would be a "teen-out out" movie, so misleading in many ways that it will become an unintentional comedy, and I'm disappointed to have to report it. First, our hero, Senior High School "Joe" is too old to play 18. When we later meet the man to be Joe's teacher, it is confusing because the sweaty one the guy looks much younger than the student he teaches. Joe's mother looks younger than him and neither "does" nor older. Second, in the opening scenes Joe seemed to either play or actually experience mental problems. His credit got better when the movie went on and I found out that he was "playing young" but it just didn't work - it was weird. It's 15 minutes before anything is discovered, who, what and where these people are, and why we should care. The second scene in the movie is a widespread piece of shop in the men's bathroom, which, given where the story goes later, is totally useless; a subplot with a teacher goes nowhere, not even as a "passage ceremony" for our "young" hero ... one minute Joe nervously tries his hand at the bathroom stand (a scene so non-erotic that you truly wonder what someone sees in practice) , the next minute he is an expert on sexual blackmail and violent double crossing. This is followed by a widespread scene with a character that we will later learn about, "Andrew", and that is about everything you learn about him, except that he is probably gay, but not yet. There's a lot of stuff to run 1:44 (which is about 20 minutes too long - I can't imagine how it played with the absurdly long and pointless deleted scenes of Joe going); a sub-fence copied from "gods and monsters" with an old patron who spews rhetorical approaches pos nothing nothing played by an actor who apparently can't remember his lines (he is properly posted with such a way Dickens could come up with a slow week) ; mix-n-match almost four times between boys and their friends, a gay toilet hiker who would be a wise sage in the form of Queen Nellie (and Queen Nellie suddenly took on the role of a "hooker with a heart of gold" as the most tired stereo type?) that only exists to be degraded; extortion, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and abuse of loop audio software for recording audio tracks. <br /> <br /> What you won't find in this movie is all the interiors that create masterpieces; We expect to imagine ourselves at the airport, in the grocery store and in the classroom because all the scenes in these locations consist of details and poorly adapted sound scenes in order to express the idea that production cannot be afforded. One thing they were able to get seems to be a real gay bar; Either it is the worst bar in the world, or there are only about 5 homosexuals in Bangor, Maine because the bar never has a patron in it. Another good laugh came when the actors were to scream for dance music that apparently did not come from the speakers, but it was just a lot of silly music "score". Lands and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable, and dialogue, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, is "film-talking," which means that no one really talks like that. Since we have no information about these characters, it is not possible to worry about what happens to them; it is as if Joe et al emerged from the ether and one day they could simply cease to exist as soon as the credits go (surely the character of Joe's sister, Jennifer Gray's wannabee, who is a crazy Czech, seems to just "stop" you never know where is she in LA or what is her problem ... but again ... does it matter?). Visually, the film looks sometimes very good, more evidence of a new development in hi-def video than anything else. The cut is clumsy (one great edit; Joe is naked and says, "I wanted to play sports but ..." and we cut to the shot that revealed his "ass ..." ha ha). The composition is also sometimes odd (I thought I watched SCTV's "Persony" parody when the boys talked in bed together and visually looked as if their noses were stuck together across the scene!). One of the senses of Verow really prevents him from making a "defamatory" or somewhat coarser film he usually does, and maybe he should not stay away (foaming toothpaste / sexual fantasy worked fine, I thought, though The tone was out of focus with the rest of the movie) ... Produces and manages this story of "sensitive age", similar to Herschell Gordon Lewis's directorial movies, without having porn movies without sex. I have some unintended laughter and it wasn't boring, nor was it very good.
