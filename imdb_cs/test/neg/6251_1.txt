Even as a big fan of low to no budget horror genre, I couldn't find this disaster slightly amusing. With terrible action, a painfully general "plot" and no bulky characters, no matter how boring and drunk you are, this is not worth 81 minutes. Don't make the same mistake. Rent something else. Something else!!!
