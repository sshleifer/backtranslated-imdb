The mask mask is a horrible movie. I don't like a baby and I don't like a dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple, but it can't redeem sitting over this garbage. Even in just 88 minutes (or so it says), the movie couldn't end soon enough for me. The only real laugh comes at the beginning with the short performance of Ben Stain. And it is done. The rest is just rehash the first movie. Actually, it's just an insult to rehashes. Why was this continuation done? This movie costs millions of dollars to make. Why should I sit in a movie with a child and a dog who deliberately tried to drive a fool? Jamie Kennedy is talented but has nothing to do in this movie. I don't bother to be nice to this movie. 1/10
