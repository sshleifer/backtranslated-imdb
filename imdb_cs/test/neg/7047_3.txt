Why bother to see this movie? It's probably the prize for the worst movie star career career because Clark Gable is a laughing Irish patriot in Parnell. It's unthinkable that Bergman would choose this movie and his director over a lucrative Hollywood career where she could choose between the best screenplays and directors. For starters, there was no script to work except for a few notes. We should believe that polished Bergman is a poor refugee who is willing to do anything that should be released from a refugee camp, including marriage to a poor Italian fisherman. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this part. If so, it made much more sense than occupying the light of Bergman in such a proletarian part. But because she was in love with her director, common sense flew out of the window. So, she goes to live in this poor village, where men have to try to get a poor life out of the sea. A place that apparently hates to be and where it doesn't fit. Her only friend is a village priest who knows she's not suitable for the life of a poor fishing bride, but tells her that for love's sake she must suppress her real feelings of resistance and accept poverty and despair she is meets every day. In addition, this volcano is always on the verge of eruption and drowning of all in the hot lava. But like a true heroine, Bergman revolts against her suffering by declaring war on almost everyone else in this grim movie. He even goes so far as to try to seduce a village priest in a scene that would make laughter if it wasn't that pathetic. Since her poor free-lance husband must lock her in a room to keep her from escaping, she is forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her from the island. For her, no sacrifice is too great; No person inaccessible if he is willing to help her escape from the island and her misery. I'm not going to bother telling you how it all ends. The end of the film without the script is as reliable as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (because I saw it on late night television) that he had two different ends! So be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit in this rabbit turkey and catch a Bergman bowl. This led to her fall in Hollywood for the next seven years and she was convicted of sleeping with her director while still marrying Peter Lindstrom. None of the films she made with this director (whom she later married) is remarkable, except for the evidence that the career is crazy. No no. It's pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - SoundTrack
