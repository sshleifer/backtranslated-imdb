This little left is remarkable just because it's the worst movie ever made by Abbott and Costello. It's horrible in every way: crazy music, horrible choreography (look at the worst male dancer), charming special effects and sets, wooden actors (barely in high school in their vocation and not heard) and a screenplay without a laugh Better times were for a comedy duo. Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd is much more profitable, as is a TV series that has been occasionally inspired. But skip this.
