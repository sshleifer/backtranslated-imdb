Film criticism of the world, sorry. It's your job to give advice to the filming public so they can wisely choose what to spend money. But I ignored your advice and was deeply injured. However, my decision to see "Cat in the Hat" wasn't random. You see, three years ago, all of you critics said we should avoid the "calamity" known as "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". Then some of my friends took me to see it, and it turned out to be a varied, fun and almost hypnotic treatment. So when the critics unleashed their fury against "The Cat in the Hat", another big budget update for Seuss with a big star in the title role, I thought it must be the same old song. How wrong I was. For five minutes, I thought I was clean. Initial credits are smart, kids are charming and production values ​​are top. Then the cat appeared. There are many problems from now on, but Mike Myers' woeful mistake was the biggest one. Where "The Grinch" was rescued by Jim Carrey's inspired casting, "The Cat" was destroyed by Myers. It can be very funny when its energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches. Every movie he did was really funny, he was really just a feature comic sketch, from "Wayne's World" to "Austin Powers". So trying to do the same thing here, it's just that these comic sketches are more like things they hold at the end of SNL, not funny, just painful. Not that the writers helped him. After a charming prologue, the film turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor, badly timed pratfalls, and offensive stunted humor attempts. This movie was the coolest movie experience I've ever had. Time. So much talent and work went into something so nasty. I know the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unharmed by this mess, I just hope that the amazing Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will have more chances to show their spells in much better movies. If you are a parent, avoid it like plague. With movies like "Elf" and "Brother Bear" currently in theaters, you have much better choices.
