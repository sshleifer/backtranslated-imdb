This movie is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forcing US drama. All the characters were really weak, especially the non-charismatic Goya and the misinterpretation of Bardem, who was just fine in his classic interpretation when acting as a French ally. Just another chance that you spent money in a good movie. I don't think it was a low budget movie. Definitely not recommended. Perhaps the director should think a little about whether the film is meaningful or not before losing money. Maybe they don't bother because they have profits before they bring them to the movies. No hope in the cinema ...
