For what's worth, it's a pretty decent road runner cartoon if it's a little short (only less than 6 minutes). Gags are good enough, animation is competent and the new restored DVD master looks nice. But that ends. Let me give you a little behind the scenes: in 1958, thanks to a labor dispute, WB seized lots of canned music that would be used in 6 years of cartoons. <br /> <br /> There is only one phrase to describe this short music and it is "has 4Kids sound". I use this phrase to describe music that has absolutely no correspondence with screen action, and I feel as if it has been recorded by an orchestra composed of Sonic Youth band members. The music in this short film is hopelessly deployed and incredibly uncomfortable, especially given that in this short scene there are scenes (especially piano traps) that work best with little or no music. <br /> <br /> I didn't think the WB caricature would be destroyed by terrible music (even Lava's results aren't that unpleasant), but since the caricature isn't so remarkable, it's almost painful to watch the music. It is something like the 80th episode of Doctor Who, and yet it could be done unnoticeably thanks to the incredibly horrible Keff McCulloch music (which sounded like hitting a demo button on all five Casio keys at once). I'll be the people who will fool me, but I could easily watch one of Larriv's RR cartoons. At least canned music was usually in sync with the action on those.
