I wasn't very excited when I saw this movie in the first place, but a group of us decided to see it at the opening night. I felt like getting up and going out and trying to get my money back into this movie. I felt that the film is very boring, uninteresting and not true in many aspects, including "playing". I tried not to fall asleep during the movie because I was watching one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The scary movie series was more frightening than this movie. A sad attempt to pull out a gothic girl, a redesigned merchant and a 15-year-old geek and some casual guy in a video game that kills you is a bad plot. Then he tries to throw a scene in a very horrible love where the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after his girlfriend was murdered. The theater was packed when the movie began until a little more than half of the people left before they finished. If you feel the need to waste only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time to see this movie ... get ready to feel cheated.
