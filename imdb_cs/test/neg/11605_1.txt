I am impressed by the fact that so many people regard this film as good. Let me make it clear that I am a huge fan of Hitchcock and I have gone out of the way to have as many of his movies on video as I could, but the one I felt was so under par not only for Hitch's movies - hell, me 'I'm too nice here. This really sucks in the picture. I don't care that Hitch did a favor for the very talented Carolea Lombard, but I saw the 1950s sitcom with more cleverness and style than this boring turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? Listne I like mashed potatoes and ice cream, but I don't want to taste them together. I saw better chemistry in chemical spills on the highway than here. <br /> <br /> If you really love Hitchcock, avoid this movie and look at one of his better ones. For a loud scream, the pieces of Hitch made on an old TV show were more fun than anything this movie fails to deliver miserably.
