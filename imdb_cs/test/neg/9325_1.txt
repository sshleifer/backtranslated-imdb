Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! "Beginning" wasn't the biggest, but better than this one. This is not a good way to lead to the original film. It's just awful! CGI hyenas were so fake looking at both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed old Sinbad movies better than this. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this film waste is cinematography and clothing that has captured this era. I understand why this movie has been redesigned as "Beginning". In my opinion, it's so bad. Where does the money come from waste? Give me a million dollars in budget and I'll show you how it should be done!
