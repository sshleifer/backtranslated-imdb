That was a bad movie! Ashley Rose Orr was terrible, had no Shirley Temple charm ALL! Those horrible smiles she would have made when she got her piggy little eyes so I think she should be cute and the audience should go - "aahhhh bless!" It just made me hit her. She had to calm down "oh my good!" about a hundred times throughout the film. She could barely pronounce the sentence without accompanying her with a false giggle. Horrible HORRIBLE movie .. If I could rate it minus 10, I would. Don't waste money on this piece of waste, go out and buy the original Shirley Temple movie!
