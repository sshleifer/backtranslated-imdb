No shortage of female meat but still not interesting! At the very least, Lenzi is probably more capable of peaking at Spasmo and getting started with Kiss Me Kill Me <br /> <br /> The Hard Gore R2 DVD release can be reduced to 86 minutes, but this movie includes one cannibalism act and one victim - a birth scene a girl who is brutalized and disembowelled by a canonical tribe we are warned and who later set fire to some cottages. Arson? Firestarter Fernox anyone? Certainly not cannibal swing, but there was always one decent? Avoid.
