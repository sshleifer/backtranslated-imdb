Jerry Angell, owner of the finest zombie-horror mullet, is returning to another undead event in Todd Sheets's horrific Zombie Bloodbath gore. This time Jerry plays with a stupid low-life criminal who, along with his equally contemptuous partner in crimes, some escaped convicts, several teenagers, and lots of screaming girls, comes face to face with a horde of shame, body-eating corpses. Obviously, he learned zilch about improving his craft in two years from Zombie Bloodbath, the leaves bringing another grim mess of the movie that somehow manages to be even worse than the original? performance that I thought was almost impossible to achieve. Acting is uniformly miserable, amateur and inexpensive effects (most gore seems to be nothing more than picking cuttings, offal and blood from a local butcher's shop), the story is incomprehensible (if I could understand the zombies will come out of the dead because the scarecrow orders them !!! ), and a direction frustratedly loaded with inexpensive video searches and totally insignificant cuts to black and white. And as if it wasn't. So much to convince you of the complete lack of imaginative qualities of this film, this boggling, which is wrongly moronic, should just do the trick: the few remaining survivors stumble on a lonely truck that happens to have a stash of bacteria occupying it meat. passenger seat - this is just a matter for dissolving the undead (but surprisingly it does not harm life).
