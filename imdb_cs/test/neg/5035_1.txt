This scary piece of dragon was (comfortably) loosely based on a true story that included two of my family members (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). This film is offensive; in addition to the fact that it was not a good film at all, it is by no means capturing what was like losing such a close family member and completely neglecting those who were actually hit by the tragedy of real life. > <br /> As for the director; he managed to earn a family accident at a Porsche price. <br /> <br /> If I could give this zero, I should. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
