OK, so my summary line is a cheap trick. But the movie is full and it is absurdly praised, so ... <br /> <br /> I caught this one on TV (uncontrolled because TV shows all the movies here, that's for you Americans who could say I was I did not like it because I saw the cut TV version - fortunately it is just a US thing and did not know what it was. I turned on, captured the last minute of the show and the movie started. In a minute, I begged that it was a comedy, given the particularly absurd clich√© to the novice (yes, it's a bad movie in the movie, I know, but what is the way the viewer is interested! I don't even know why I didn't switch channels). And yes, in fact, the film turned out to be a comedy, though unintentional. Marina Zudina is pretty pretty but gosh, that's a terrible performance! While casting a stranger in a role is smart enough (he doesn't speak a bye bye language barrier), sorry, Marina Baby, playing muting doesn't mean impersonating Harpo Marx. Her acting is unintentionally funny at many moments, just look at her as she draws X in the air while the killer follows him. He wants to kill you, no time to play Zorro. We get a lot of "running upstairs" that get into tension, like in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shooting another. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? But the best / worst pearl is to have a guy electrically hit in the tub and ... Well, I've never seen anyone in the bathtub killed by electric shock, but I'm sure you don't see blue cartoon rays in real life, right? And what about instantly trusting an average-looking boy because he says he's a cop and didn't ask him to show you his credentials? OK, so it turns out to be a real cop. But even though I don't ask for a badge, it doesn't make sense (fence-wise, we could always think that credentials might be fake, or it could be a crooked cop. Screenwriting 101). What about the big twist? Don't tell me you didn't see it coming from 200 kilometers away ... I'm sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his unnecessary footage. Now I'm thinking about what is the reason why give him "Mystery Guest Star" credit ... in the END headlines? The film is over, there is no more secrets, and everyone and their brother have identified Guinness (even those who are not film enthusiasts will recognize the "old man" of the Star Wars), even better in this way, so we can pretend it's not late big actor. <br /> <br /> People compare it to all people, Hitchcock, I suppose it must be John Hitchcock, because late Sir Alfred would feel embarrassed to watch it, let alone do it. And it gets 6.8 / 10 ???? Is it Bottom 100 material! But then we're talking about a rating system that allows the 'Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' to appear as the third best film ever made (check the Top 100 ), so ... <br /> <br /> 2/10.
