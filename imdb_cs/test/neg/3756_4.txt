Of the four main players - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin - the one I never heard of at the time was the one who annoyed me and destroyed the film. Well, she had to do a decent job to get her to throw her and VHS into a trash can. I mean Kelly in the role of a teenage brat, "Tia Russell." Ironically, six years later she played a stunning and extremely likeable role in "Rowena Morgan" in Mr. Holland's Opus. Candy, as usual, is fun to watch like "Buck Russell", or the title character, Uncle Buck. Few actors were better off playing a nice, unfortunate slack than Candy. I liked his character here, but I can't watch that spoiled teen girl more than once. Also in the first few minutes of the film, the little boy "Miles" (Cauklin) says the word "G-damn." How bad is it that a six-year-old boy says the film's name is in vain? These Hollywood people are so sick. No wonder many of their children's actors have turned out to be mentally confused.
