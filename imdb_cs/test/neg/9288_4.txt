It is not uncommon for a celebrity to struggle with the proverbial "alarm". And if they survive this event, they come to a deeper understanding and recognition of their special happiness. However, in the case of comics, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were before it. That's what Martin Lawrence does. Frankly, I pay little attention to celebrities because I have much better things to do with my life than to watch them. So I wasn't aware of most of what Lawrence had gone through before this movie. It was interesting, but unfortunately all in common. I stayed with the bigger impression that this guy wasn't just funny. Save the big life message for the book, just be funny on stage. If you want to see the funny Martin Lawrence, borrow some old Def Jams for which he has hosted. Do not rent a Runteldat.
