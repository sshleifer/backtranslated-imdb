I've never seen the original version of a 1930s movie, but this remake is one of the worst things I've seen from a big production studio in the years. The vision of actors such as Meg Ryan and Annette Bening, once close to talent at level A, is a painful path across the path of poorly written roles. No one in this movie seemed to want to be in front of the camera. Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play worthless roles that have no effect on the action and add no fun value. Jada Pinkett Smith's character is used as nothing more than a trick to look modern, having an African American lesbian character, but in fact she is there just looking cool. There is no real reason why Messing would be in this film than to fill the number of women in the original I will marry. The side characters starring Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotypical female characters with Mendes. Display Vixen looking to steal a rich but bored and slightly neglected husband and Mazar covering the gossip role. The film is boring, lacks magic, humor, or sympathy for all characters. It almost seemed to me that the film was a punishment for everyone involved, whether in front of the camera or behind the camera. There is one glimpse of hope in the film, but few have the chance to surround it. and the dying stars around her are Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still an amazing talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor in the small role she has.
