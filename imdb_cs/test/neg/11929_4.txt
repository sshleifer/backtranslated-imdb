It is a little disquieting when a studio refuses to screen a film before it gets a wider release. That many films suck is no surprise, but when the studio itself admits so much time, the filming process becomes fun. Consider it the first Christmas gift from Hollywood, then that "Aeon Flux" is not nearly an insult to the taste and decency you might expect, given the above. Although he is ultimately overwhelmed by his shortcomings, he has, at least, an idea that he can move with. Too bad director Karyn Kusama seems to have a little idea how to do it all. It's a future. There was a plague. There is a dictatorship, and there are rebels. They are known as Monicans, and by far are not cults of berets or tennis rocket believers, they are attempts to overthrow a former, called Goodchild. The regime is occasionally intended for citizens, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and her friends can stand. Through some biochemical virtual reality technology, Monicans receive orders from their dear leader (Frances McDormand), a mystical priestess of the type who seems to have been a hybrid of carrots. It falls on the Aeon strap on some form-fit, futuristic spandex get-up to execute High Carrot commands that are of course some versions of "destroy the mode." After years when her sister learned that her sister was being wiped out by Goodchild, she needed little convincing. No wonder things are getting complicated. Goodchilds may not be exactly what they seem, and Aeon may have an unexpected history with them. Although occasionally confused, the central idea of ​​the film (which I will not betray more) contains some neat images of the nature of human existence and survival. There is room for much more exploration that the film does not use, but the ideas are there at least. Big problems "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama has made a decisive decision to shoot almost all the events so close that we can rarely follow what is happening. To make matters worse, it is set in a leap of jumps that are losing us completely. The result is some serious spatial disorientation that takes the film. "Aeon Flux" is one of the elegant costumes, oddly angular architecture and agile characters. Many of these events take place in minimalist, open spaces that ask for long, long shots that could convey the grace and athletics of the above. Instead, we get fractions of seconds of flying limbs, broken glass, and accompanying sound effects. There is a pretty good movie that tries to get out of the moha "Aeon Flux." Put this in the hands of the Wachow Brothers, say, and the results might be different. Though I felt like "Aeon Flux", he deliberately pushed me away from the movie I wanted to enjoy. This film is unattended by its own forces. Just as a novice poker player has made a royal flush, he somehow finds a way to lose despite his potential.
