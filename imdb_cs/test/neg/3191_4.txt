I usually watch Hollywood dribbling, but I was pulled along with some friends to see this one that turned out to be fun in places, but totally devoid of any originality. Don't worry, you won't have to think - Tarantino-like story leaves enough over-obvious advice for us to correctly predict where it goes about fifteen minutes before each "twist" - I sat there worrying that the movie was building pretty nicely for Hollywood movie but that it would have nowhere to go to the top. And my boy realized that the YMCA couldn't save it, but Liv Tyler almost did. I suppose I'm a man and helped at the age of twenty, but she did a really good job - apparently she didn't have to do anything except she looked absolutely gorgeous, but what she did well! McCOOL'S will definitely not fall as one of Hollywood's greatest achievements (or I should say "shouldn't" because the mainstream US film industry is nowhere to go and does not store a hit for 10 years as AMERICAN BEAUTY, TITANIC and PRIVATE RYAN SURVEYS, and even those who have a big drawback, but if you are a teenage man do yourself a favor and look at Liv - it's one hot cat Rating: 5/10 See also: something Quentin Tarantino, any American teen movie over the past decade , anything with sex as the main selling point.
