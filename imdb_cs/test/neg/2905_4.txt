You know, after the first few Chuck Norris movies I got, so I could say that the movie was made by Golan-Globus, even though I'm tuned in the middle without looking at credits or title. What's more, I could say it was Golan-Globus during the minute of the screen. Something about the story structure, goofy relationships between characters, courtesy dialogue, wooden acting (with occasional straightforward performances), the tempo of the scene and the rhythms created by Albert Pyun as John McTiernan, paper thin charts and Choreography fighting against readiness ... Golan-Globus He was incredibly consistent over the years in style, subject and perspective. <br /> <br /> What you can say is that they have to work for them because they have literally made dozens of films. You go to one of their productions and you know exactly what you get. And it is not brain food, people. "Ninja 3" is another piece of hackwork in a long line of products from the GG Sausage Factory, offering typical limited pleasure for movie visitors. floor. You have Bad Ninja, slicing cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way. You have a good Ninja, he promised to stop him. You've brought the Westerner into the mix so we can identify with him (or her in this case) and make sure that "we can still beat those annoying Orientals on their own game." You're interested in love (which is usually also the worst actor / ress in the movie) fencing with a hero. You have an endless string of attacks, assassinations, and persistent shots of men shivering in agony, while an arrow or throwing star emerges unconvincingly from their eyes, neck, or chest. You have your Beefy White Guy / Bodyguards in suits calling Ninja 'Son B * tch' and throwing a colonial punch just to give it to him. You have a final confrontation between Good Guy and The Bad Guy, which lasts 20 minutes and just stops as a cartoon RoadRunner instead of reaching the top or resolution. Ninja 3 is a bit different, in that the plot revolves around a torn female athletic type who is obsessed with Bad Ninja, so it ends up killing lots of cops and criminals and Beefy White Bodyguards in suits while under his magic. But all the other elements are there, as formal as Kabuki's game or Noh drama. Actually, I thought Lucinda Dickey was pretty nice in this movie. It's pretty muscular and crooked, has big cheekbones and some athletic "ooomph" to her movements, and you can actually pause the faith so much that you accept that her character might do some of the performances she pulls in the movie. Almost, but not entirely, carries this thing. One more start for her participation and good energy. Sho Kusugi is naturally here and largely dominates the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. And just to show you how third-class films and uninspired GG movies, the director and editor have overcome the latest climax between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with numerous reactionary footage of Dickey and her friend watching the battle for life and death. expression of mild bemusement. I'm serious ... for all the emotions and reactions that point to driving, they can watch a sea turtle in a Marineland aquarium. I can only imagine how Dickey had to feel when she saw the finished product - she probably wanted to launch an editor with a katana for the real, because these reactions make her look like a complete idiot. Pleasant waste of time ... but it's definitely a waste of time. Maybe if you're a fan of Sho Kusugi, or even a fan of Linda Dickey, you'll find it worth it.
