This movie is complete and a waste of time, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And coming from me, it certainly says something. In fact, I wish I gave him negative stars instead of evaluating it as a poor star. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie I had an open mind. I find the legend of Chupacabra interesting and I like kitschy horrors. But in this case, I draw a line. The leading man gives one of the worst performances ever, looking and sounding unnatural when he delivers his poorly written lines. The leading bitch gives a little more tasty performance, but it doesn't take much. Chupacabra ... Well, given the low budget this movie was, the creature was tolerable. But it looks exactly like someone in a mask and suit. The mask is quite detailed and can look great in person, but not so on the screen. Speaking of on-screen, you should think that they could at least use a better camera. Looks like it was taken by a video camera for a loud call. Not very good, either. I do not know what he who wrote this abomination thought. Dialogue sucks and just ... I can't describe what I have to do. At least not without getting into the web. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid it at all costs. It's just not worth it. If it comes to television and you have nothing else to do or watch, then * find * something else to do or watch. Read the book, listen to music, * anything. If so, you can't say you weren't warned. And for the Lord and the Lady, this landlord. It's not worth it, even if you have a chance to rent it for fifty cents. Believe me, I know.
