New Year. The day after consuming a few too many martinis and Cosmopolitans, they mixed with a bunch of bubbles at midnight, my wife and I found out that the local cable company was offering free digital channels for January. We had a choice - we'll use freebie channels or start watching eight seasons of X-Files on DVD we received from our daughter for Christmas? We opted for digital freebie because DVDs don't get anywhere and we need something like ten twelve-hour days to watch all X-files begin to end. The Drive-In channel offered a classic horror three film marathon: Asylum (1972), The Damned House (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum is well rated here, and Pit and Pendulum were too late to watch, which meant we could only be properly critical of House of the Damned. To be honest, we tried to be serious about the movie because its stars have a fairly good acting credential - Greg Evigan (William Shatner's over-written Tekwars) and Alexandra Paul (the only Baywatch kid who would even if he has a ten-year-old boy's body). Unfortunately, we soon disappeared into giggling, under the influence of a small dog, as we all shouted the names of the movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters! Acting, especially the real daughter of Evigan, wasn't too bad because of the stupid script they had to work with. CGI, for 1996, was cheerful - it was so bad at the worst place in the final scene when it was supposed to be the worst that my wife and I were melting away in laughter. <br /> <br /> Total: 4 5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5
