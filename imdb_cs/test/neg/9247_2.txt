I can name just a few of the movies I saw and which were so bad. This film has terrible things: Dialogue is vaulted and clich√©, acting is largely poor, with a few exceptions, cinematography is nothing to talk about, and the plot is stupid (fat woman chasing a suburban family because her daughter was not a football team). That's so bad, it's fun to watch. If you can catch it all your life, I would recommend it as a comedy. As for a serious movie, I'm afraid I'll have to evaluate it. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you're a serious movie fan and you're looking for an interesting and challenging story or a good meeting. There is no one to find. Edit: Hmmm ... I think a group of people who have been working for a lifetime have had to write some fake reviews and vote against all the negative ones. Don't trust them. This is a really bad movie.
