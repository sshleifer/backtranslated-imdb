I'm a fan of Judy Garland, Vincent Minnelli and Gene Kelly, but this movie left me cool. I was expecting another American in Paris from Minnelli, so I might have waited too much. The film was short on songs and short impressive dance numbers. I was impressed by the very expressionist dance Kelly as Mococo on the ship. I was also impressed by Nicholas Brothers in Be and Clown, too bad a song was so unpleasant. I also attacked Judy with Kelly with bric-a-brac. Check out Lorny Luft's autobiography for some interesting information about this scene. Actually, the film has to be some of the most annoying songs of Cole Porter, especially "Nina". Judy and Gene also shout constantly as children of funerals. The storyline is thin - a par for a musical course - but it is not imposing impressive dance numbers or memorable songs. I think the best parts of this movie have remained on the floor. Please some film restorer, find the pieces of the movie and show us what the movie could be!
