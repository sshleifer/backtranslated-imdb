Rich vs. poor. Big City vs. small town. White collar vs. blue collar. These things are not original motifs in movies. So when you decide to include these topics, the story should be more original or very good. This one wasn't. I never believed in the romance of two young lovers in this movie. Not convincing or convincing, it just fell. Don't bother with video rental.
