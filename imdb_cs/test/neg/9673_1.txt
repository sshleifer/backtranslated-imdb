I wanted to say that since I first saw the movie, but I won't let any of my kids or grandchildren see it. At least not until I tell them and understand that it's completely fiction. All I could see was that the animals went to Ark, everything else was false. Lot and Noah fight on the ocean like a pirate movie. Make sure you tell your children a real story before allowing them to look at it, but in fact, until they are old enough to understand that it is not real, they can have a confused Bible vision. That was the worst biblical movie I've ever seen. Bruce and Evan The Almighty were much better off and should learn more. Let your kids watch
