What an absolute joke movie. The case for this movie would make you think the Duel meets Jeepers Creepers meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good movies by themselves and you would think using their plan, MM couldn't go far wrong. That's what I thought, and I was very, very wrong! We watch two college students traveling miles across the desert to get married. Picking up a girl (not getting into the dress), then being chased by a leather rip-off in Monster Truck, which they appropriately name F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). Monster Truck \ tI admit that it's a very cold vehicle, but less than thrilling scenes of scare can spoil its potential. So MM decides he's got a bit of grudge against these guys and persecutors for a while, they lose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputations, then go to the motel where Adam is sleeping hitchhiker Sarah (though they both wear underwear!). Then they are caught MM, taken to his home to escape death, and try to kill MM, but fail, so they prepare to continue. Except for a tiny "twist," that's all. <br /> <br /> If you can get in the first 2 minutes? where did Adam's friend Harley emerge from hiding in the car of Adam's car to try to scare him without explaining how Harley got there, for how long, or how did Adam fail to implement it? without thinking that you hate it, you can enjoy this movie. The Monster Man has very bad cinematography and a direction that is immediately out. That's the kind of movie you can pick up as one of those movies in a box of 20 horror movies you've never heard of. What's so annoying is Blockbuster So many of these poor quality movies are filmed by some amateur movie students on digital film, and that's exactly what MM is (though IMDb says that this particular director was born in 1961). Action in this area film is cruel. The screenplay that the writer seemed to be funny was irritating and childish. You get the impression only one suggestion was written before they started shooting. In fact, the screenplay is desperate, a lot of the film seems to be improvised, full of those boring, non-fun conversations that are just funny or important to real people. Imagine yourself filming yourself and your friends with conversation, of course, the points are funny? YOU, but mostly it is waste. This is what is the scenario for MM as. <br /> <br /> Don't even look at it in gore? it's pretty minimal and there are much better gory movies (Bad Taste, Evil Dead et al ??) <br /> Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, even with their cheeseiness and plot holes, are much better than that film. Compare the intro of Jeepers Creepers with the introduction of Monster Man and see what I mean.
