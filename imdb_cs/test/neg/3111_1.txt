I bought this movie for about $ 2.5 at a local flea market. I thought with the cast in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe & Mario Van Peebles are fine), it would be pretty good. Boy, I was wrong. This movie pissed me off. Almost every scene takes too long. The scene where Rob Lowe watches this girl singing and dancing at the bar, lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in the movie. The rest isn't a picknick either. My guess is, when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so everything lasted 3 times longer. Conclusion: The current rating of 1.9 here on imdb is on the money. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Go watch some dry color for 1.5 hours instead of watching it! <br /> <br /> If you want to see better films from this director, check out "Mean Guns" (with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or "Postmort" (with Charlie Sheen).
