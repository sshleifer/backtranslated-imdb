I can't emphasize enough, don't make this movie for kids. <br /> <br /> For this reason, you should save adults as well. Well, maybe I was a little exaggerated. This is not the worst movie of children ... No, let me reformulate it. This is not the worst movie created by disillusioned adults PRO adults who were scattered, and somehow sold to children (that would be "Jack", which I wanted to examine / intestine like a fish). The adults will not learn anything surprising (well, if you have to, fast forward just before the end of the credits for the Educational Bit about an interesting cosmic phenomenon). We usually do not end up as adults we wanted to do as children, because reality tends to get in the way. Well, duh, I could tell you that (so they can four years at art school, but I descended). I have no idea what the hell kids of this movie could get out of. Most likely, they just get upset (we get to the point where Russ was traumatized at the age of eight). There's a better film, "Kiki's Delivery Service," which basically has the same message but handles it instead of drilling into the head. And adults will like it too! By the way, there are moments in the film when you need to keep in mind the older MST3K-ers if they think OTHER Bruce Willis' movie with a sad little child in it.
