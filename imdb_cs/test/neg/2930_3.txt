Well, I generally like Iranian movies and after seeing "10" from Kiarostami the night before, I was expecting a great movie. I was very disappointed. This is by far the worst Iranian film and one of the most boring Asian movies I've ever seen. If you've never seen Kiarostami before, watch ten instead. If you want some good Iranian movies, you can also try "Sib", aka "The Apple". This movie is divided into 5 parts, and only the fourth, featuring some funny ducks, is worth watching. If this is the first Iranian movie you see, you probably won't want to see it. I don't blame you, but you miss some great movies.
