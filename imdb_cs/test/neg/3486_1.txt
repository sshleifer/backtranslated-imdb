This film has a language, style and attitude down ... plus the greats go from Occy (world championship) and great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin as a turtle has pidgin surfing and surfing scenes are getting the best ever. A real classic you can see many times. Nia Peeples is a child, and Laird Hamilton shows early things that made him the world leader of extreme surfers.
