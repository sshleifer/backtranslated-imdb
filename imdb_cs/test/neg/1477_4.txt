And it's not a very good documentary, as the American MOVIE seems to have confused some people to think it's a spoof documentary ("Mockumentary"), and even some newspaper TV shows have described it as such. because it is easy to mistake this document as one big wind ala THIS IS A SPINAL TAP <br /> <br /> What seems to be the cause of the confusion is that the documentary centers around the beginning filmmaker Mark ... Yes, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, because if we had no dreams, we would all still live in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies cannot be taken as a criticism because both Sam Raimi (Yes, One) and Peter Jackson (yes, one) both They started making a low budget horror comedy so again, it's not criticism. It's just that Mark Borchardt (yes, that one) is a parody of an American trailer basket <br /> <br /> Remember that it's something about MA RY Ben Stiller gives a lift to a risky hiker ("Come to my office because you're f *** in" fired ") Well, that's what Mark reminds most of Jerry Springer's guests so it's very easy to understand why do you get some people It wasn't a good documentary since Mark and my classmate crept over me. Did you know that someone thinks Mark will grow up as a serial killer? Does anyone else think there is enough time left for it to happen?
