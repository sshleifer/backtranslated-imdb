I have to start by saying that the actress and the actor did a great job for what they worked with. The problem with Dark Reality is that you had a poor director who was trying to be so innovative and evocative that he ended up with the movie. From start to finish, you can say that the quality of the film reel is low, but the bad lightning and shaky camera just hurt it by hiding what's going on. The sound is subdued and often not understandable. I'm sure Huston (the director) would say that it should provoke panic in the audience, but more than enough material to do. It must have resulted in the camera and lighting causing it to be a symptom of superior syndrome. The story is good. The basic story of a sadistic female kidnapper who avoids clich√© by keeping the girl in despair all the time for good reason. Billy Bob of Silence of the Lambs considered his victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem with the story is that the dead people are constantly chasing the leading character in the mind, and the second time they have discovered that I quickly moved forward because it was trying to destroy the only decent part of the movie. Finally, as the director put it together, he showed random blurry things, and the scarcely visible scenes (not because of horror, lighting, angles, and camera) eventually destroyed the film. Apparently, Huston was trying too hard, and if something like a bad film school project. If you want to see a decent story, then it's okay, but warn that the quality of the movie is sufficient for most to turn it off.
