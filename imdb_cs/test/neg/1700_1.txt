Jason Connery is not an actor; is the son of the actor. His Macbeth is the worst I've ever seen. Oh yes, he will kill King Duncan, but he will also kill William Shakespeare. His wife is even worse. Please give me the Polan version on DVD so I can forget about this monster. Jon Finch, Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, Here's ACTORS!
