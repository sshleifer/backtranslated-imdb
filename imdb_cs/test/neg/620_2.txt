I could not. I was bored, not only because acting was a terrible and tragic story was simply a b-movie whose plot was about cannibalism, but the fact that I was watching a foreign film that I don't mind was STILL nicknamed. <br /> <br /> "Special effects" were terrible. When the rear of the aircraft breaks off, you can see that the model is hollow as it "tears off" in false snow. Most of the film takes place on a sound stage that is clearly not real and almost looks like a game because the "sounds" around the snow are heard but not really the scene. "But as a military person does not have food" (it is never clear what this man is doing or why he is in charge) he says, which I am sure no one ever said or even thought about about food because they were worried if people were alive, not how they ate it, it was just a stupid font that pointed out that they would have to eat dead bodies to survive. Finally decide to eat the body, one person will find one body without a shirt.In spite of being in the snow for a long time, not remotely frozen, in fact, his meat is very flexible and fresh. or even the winter seems, and the scene continues for five minutes, where I had to stop, the remake of "Alive" was a much better film about trying to survive in a terrible situation that I am sure the real survivors praised because that one of them had something nice about this version, it was simply eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary. Avoid.
