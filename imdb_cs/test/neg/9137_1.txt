Director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man to see this terrible spoiled daylight. Reggi's report, so powerful and resonating in his previous two Qatsi films, is hopelessly confused here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keyboards, laughter heads, etc., mixes without purpose. The show of banal paintings is mostly a generic piece by Getty Images et al, and cumbersome digital manipulations are amateur in the worst way imaginable. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?) Could point out that using a solarizer filter on almost every frame is BIG BAD idea? Coarse looping, layering, and image distortion resembles the first class of Photoshop. And to make matters worse, computer animation sequences are more fertile than the Wall Street pie chart of 1980. This does not mean that improved aesthetics alone would save this film, but some modest efforts in this direction made it tolerant as visual food for backing music. I feel I must emphasize that Philip Glass's score will surely satisfy his fans. Not a radical departure, but rather an improvement of what Glass does best with the beautiful violin contributions of Yo Yo Ma. If you decide to see this movie, be sure to focus on the short introductory sequence. While you may be familiar with the once majestic, but long-abandoned Michigan train station, 89 minutes later, you will find that you remember this image of the decline of the 20th century as a critical point when you were headed to EXIT / press STOP You were warned.
