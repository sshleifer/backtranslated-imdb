It seems to me that he almost touches on how Star Trek fans are trying to try this movie despite the incredible number of shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First, none of the famous characters are of such a nature. Scotty is portrayed as a rogue instead of a competent engineer who was in the original series. Uhura ... Gods, I can't even think about what they did to her nature. All her dialogues were painful to listen to. McCoy looked like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock ... well, let's say Leonard Nimoy was awfully useless. He got a bad dialogue ("I don't believe you understood the severity of your situation Captain." Gravity, get it? Get it?) And done almost in the buffon. Kirk ... oh man, don't get me. William Shatner is the beginning of a Hammy actor to let him direct the disaster invitation, which is what we got. The story is absurd. Giving Spock's brother is a pretty desperate story and unnecessarily soap operaish. But hey, let's go with it. Searching for God. Again, a weak chart basis. Don't you think so? OK, let's go with it too. So assuming the two above-mentioned fence elements are audio, what's wrong with the script? Well, too much is being recycled for one thing. For example, Enterprise does not function properly again. Should we assume that Starfleet would send a roughly dysfunctional skeleton ship into a potentially dangerous situation just because James Kirk wants to handle the situation? If that's the case, why don't you want him to be a better ship as an advisor? Adding to it ... the crew is grossly incompetent. Scotty has a ship in pieces (and seems to be rough enough to hit his head unconscious WHEN enemies are on board!) No one seemed to notice that the Klingon ship had surfaced at decisive moment (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly shows the ship within range of weapons) and the crew seems too familiar. In other words, there is no sense of discipline. As far as Starfleet's flagship is concerned, it is no surprise that the Klingons have not yet cast the Federation. <br /> <br /> As for personal struggles with pain, it was stupid. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he could not save the turkey. In short, no one could. Of all the people involved, I think Leonard Nimoy is the most embarrassing. I hope it is, anyway. Thank goodness that the original cast didn't bend on this stupid opus.
