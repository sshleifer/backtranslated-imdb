This movie was fine in terms of movies going. It could be done as a crossover into secular movies. However, it had little to do with Left Behind books that it was probably based on. Major story spaces were removed and new main story spaces added. I was most disappointed with the way Nicolae was portrayed. He was shown with supernatural powers he did not have at this point in the books. The antichrist is not Satan, he is not omniscient and not omnipotent. Faith and beliefs were displayed in strange, surrealistic ways that seemed to make the film stupid.
