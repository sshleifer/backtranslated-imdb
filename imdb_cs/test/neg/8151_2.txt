She gave it two stars because the DVD cover was good enough to buy this piece of horse dung. I paid the dollar for a local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have a few good movies (at least I think they're good) they've never seen inside a video store. After I saw it, I'm really offended. Light years worse than anything I've ever seen, I can't even recommend it as a campsite. It's so bad, instead of making you laugh, it makes you angry. How did this horrible movie find some kind of distro? I can only believe that it was itself distributed, as an amateur DVD would suggest. For producers of this "movie" to get out of business, it is obvious that you have no talent for it.
