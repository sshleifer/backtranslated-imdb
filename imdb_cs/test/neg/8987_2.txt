First let me say that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book could be great, but the movie isn't. I've spent my entire life in the Peidmont area of ​​NC. I've never heard southern accents as ridiculous as those in this movie. I lived in two small towns and Charlotte and Raleigh. Occasionally you meet people with a strong southern accent, but I've never met a city where everyone would be talking about a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind. Your comments reveal more about your warped psyche than the movie. If we were to stretch our ideas and pretend that there was something realistic in this film - which is not there - then it is true that bad people like Tory's father always find some justification for their actions. The author chose religion as opposed to Tora's supernatural abilities. Your assumption that the "true character of the Gospels" directs a person to defeat his daughter is about the most accurate and misinformed interpretation I've ever heard. Before launching the Gospels, you should first read them. Back to the movie. The dialogue is flat, unnatural and unbelievable most of the time. In particular, many of the things that Kade said to Tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood, context, or way they are said. The "exciting twist" at the end of the movie is lame predictable and has no credibility. Some have also claimed that Jacqueline Bisset is doing a great job in this film, but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also an outdated, predictable one-dimensional character. Is it Bisset's fault? I don't know. <br /> <br /> If you have a choice between watching this movie and the 20-year Muppet Show, I recommend the Muppet Show.
