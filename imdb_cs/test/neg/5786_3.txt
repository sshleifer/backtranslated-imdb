Top pistol without inner hostility. Or class. Or money. Or Cruise. In fact, the justification for an ascending mobile cast of actors who will play a great deal to market their ability to lead matinee has nothing to get their teeth out of. It's a shame because Charlie Sheen's opening film opens with a great promise that is wasted almost instantly with a nonsensical wedding set. Barking. Dennis Haysbert is a changeable actor for me, but he's fine in this movie, especially action sequences. Michael Biehn is a first-class action hero, but not a leading man: Charlie Sheen is, for all intents and purposes, a leading man, but he is never a pretty action hero. There's a stunt cast of hundreds who are also nice. 3/10
