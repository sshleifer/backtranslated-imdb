The film is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. Nothing about that frightening ... or near the threshold of fright ... It's just another case of "another horror movie of teenagers" - one and one you've all seen. The first few minutes in the movie and you'll know what's next. The worst part is that the script is bluer than the last part of the scary movie. It would be better if it were written in Spanish. And don't let me start with inner jokes and holes. <br /> <br /> Although I give some credit for special effects. But believe me, just like any Hollywood horror movie, CGI and special effects have little or no effect on the horror movie's ability to scare. In fact, it makes it worse. There's not much to see between Anita Bri's fresh face and the haunted site.
