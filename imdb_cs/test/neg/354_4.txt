You would hardly know that a year later MGM gave Norma Shearer to DIVORCEE, which shines with MGM's technical know-how. How far they came in one year. CHENEY is a very early talkie. The camera is barely moving. Shearer is her usual charming self and Rathbone does well in a romantic lead role. They are all very careful to speak brightly and slowly into a microphone source that eases against a naturally dramatic scene, but the game is a robust and fun warrior, so one can enjoy if expectations are not too high. Incidentally, the conspiracy involves a ring of higher class thieves who infiltrate society to become victims of their victims. There are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all. Oscar nom for best adaptation scenario.
