I'm so disappointed. After waiting for 3 years to repeat / DVD the original series "Darkplace" I could not wait for this series. The first episode is over and I'm horrified. Everything that was great at Darkplace was deleted here. Worst introduction: canned laughter. it takes the original point of it away and just makes it almost unnoticeable. (One joke about Garth's eyes fertilizing the audience was good ... the rest barely remember ...) It's like bad quality "Knowing me, knowing you." I hope this will improve because the series continues, otherwise I will be seriously disappointed. back to "Darkplace ..." <br /> <br /> "You're the most sensitive man I've ever known. And I know God ..."
