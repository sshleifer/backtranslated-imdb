I didn't really have HATE Mirrormask. I really wanted more out of film than nice visual effects. The film begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (allegedly) want to escape to the circus, he just wants to escape from the circus. During a massive dispute with his mother, Helan wishes her to die. Bad move. Mother gets sick ... something (probably cancer) and needs surgery. On the night before the operation, she dreams of traveling to a beautiful world of her dreams and nightmares where she finds herself. Personally, the film got to me as soon as she started to dream. Early scenes show the strange and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the hospital's bleakness and the dirt of the apartment building. But as soon as she dreams, the films will move to a CGI country where almost everything is a computer image. The problem is that this dream world has no mystery and miracle it should have. while movies like the Wizard of Oz seemed tempting to explore the mirror mask, they pushed the images into our faces and then pulled them away to give us another picture. It's a little rhyme or a reason to design in this movie and even though some things are very nice (the librarian is a masterpiece), they just disappear so fast they are soon forgotten. Helana and her sidekick Valentine are at best uncomfortable and, at worst, unbearable. Overall, Mirrormask is like a nice bet that you bite and find is actually ash. Stay with real children.
