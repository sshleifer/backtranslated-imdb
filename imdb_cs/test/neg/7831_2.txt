You have to start worrying when you see that Michael Madsen is the director of Cast. I'm used to going through a list of shame that's his movie career. I watched for 45 minutes and still wasn't sure what was going on. The film consisted of love hating the relationship between Madsen and Argento, which basically was Madsen insulting her, threatening violence and generally treating her as dirt. She on the other hand loves him, then she doesn't, then she does it, she wishes him, then she loves him again ...... what's wrong with you !!!! The script is a horrible, miserable soundtrack and nonsensical aggressive and gross sexuality that I believe has been added to attract some viewers because the film has something to offer. I would have given movie 1 but it just about managed 2 with a little excitement in the last 20 minutes. It did actually answer one question in the last few minutes, but I won't share that I'll suffer for the whole movie like I did.
