I can't believe I got into this movie to do the kindness of my friends who asked me early April 14, 2007. This movie is definitely a pain in the ass in the theater and boringly boring, nor did I feel the cruel impact of his "depressing scenes" that I consider a total failure to attract audiences. The worst even trampled me, because my friend did not come to the theater in time because she was busy helping her friend to find a suitable one-night hostel. I wasn't really disappointed at all, but this movie is a thing that is really bad for me, a useless story, naively created and I don't know what to say. The title is not somehow suggesting that horrors and horrors failed to overtake the audience, maybe the slaughter of the animals might get more creeps if it showed the real situational play in the theaters. Good luck to anyone trying to watch him like that.
