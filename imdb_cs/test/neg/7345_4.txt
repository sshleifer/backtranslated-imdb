The story is short about a priest who lacks the faith of a business man Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who looks closely at a case where another priest is suspected of being murdered. The priest denies being guilty, but at the same time is unable to discuss the matter for confidentiality. Enter the Daniel Clemens team to start playing the cop ... While the storyline is not ridiculous, everything else is. Let's start with the visual aspect, cinematography is boring, it looks more like a TV series than a movie. Camera angles are boring, in fact there is not a single memorable camera angle throughout the movie. There are no interesting details to reveal details. And the scene is moving, well, there is not much to say about them, they are not smooth at all, there seems to be no connection between the scenes and the real storyline. Okay, they used the transition with music between the two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions in the entire movie, the times disbanded were used there was no visual connection between the scenes. The boring visual part could be forgiven if the film offered something else. Unfortunately, the film offers only forced wooden gaming and a clumsy dialogue without strikes. In addition to the sound problems, the sound volume is reduced in the movie several times as if the microphones were too far away. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect a film solution. It could be because the film never gave me an opportunity, or it could be because of a presentation that was so boring that I never even tried to figure it out. Put two two plus two together B-movie where 'B' means boring.
