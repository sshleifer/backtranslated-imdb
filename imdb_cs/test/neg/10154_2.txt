My friend and I rented this a few days ago. and I must say this is the only best movie I've ever seen. I mean, woah! "Dude, we'd better take some beer before this joint closes" and "dude, linda won't wear a bra anymore." what poetry! woah! and it's also an amazingly original film. You don't usually have to find a movie slasher where every murder is exactly the same. exactly! now it's originality. and almost all the transitions between the scenes are these big shots of psycho in the ER shrubs. how cool! acting is so amazing. Dad was just great. must study REAL DADS before shooting. and how many movies do you find they don't make sense? not too much. but this is one of those gems. I mean, how cool is it that one guy was waiting outside for six hours to get a joke while his friends were both inside? it is really cool. overall I would say that this is the only biggest movie of this genre, nay, in the world! *****
