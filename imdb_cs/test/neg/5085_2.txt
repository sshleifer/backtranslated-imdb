Although it was hard, if not impossible to follow, and not because of the horrors it displays, but the way they were displayed. Imagine what Costa Gavras could do with this true horror story. What I am arguing against is the idea that there is a need to condemn the need to condemn. What shows us with the power of a powerful cinema. I feel that the filmmaker's eagerness, perhaps justifiable anger, didn't allow him to see it clearly from a film perspective. Or, if it was a film aspect, I think, the choice, then I didn't like it at all. I was more concerned about the way the film was made than the film itself. I'm sure I thought so, but unfortunately it's not enough.
