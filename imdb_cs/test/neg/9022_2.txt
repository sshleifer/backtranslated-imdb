This is probably Wayne's poorest film; at least the poorest, in which he had a leading role. It's just incredibly bad. Adjustments are especially terrible; it really seems that the editor (if there was) literally picked up the pieces of the film from the floor and put them together. The hole must be seen to be believed. John Wayne had to go every time he mentioned it! I know there are "B" movies - but are there "H" movies? If so, this is an example. And I say this as a devoted JW fan.
