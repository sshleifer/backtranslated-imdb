For many years he has loved Stephen King's novels and short stories, as well as most of the reviewers, I am consistently disappointed with the adaptations of the film from his printed works. A few notable exceptions are "state me" from "body", "Carrie" from the same name novel, and "Shawshank Redemption" from "Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption". This film is by far the worst thing ever made with the name of Stephen King. No wonder Mr. King has largely given up any connection with him. I feel that the thing that most offended me about this misbehaving, cheaply filmed, hideously driven piece of garbage is that they had the audacity to change the end perfectly Don't waste your time or money on this amazing bow-wow movie! !
