Yes, in this movie you are being treated to a few small snowmen in an apparently very warm climate, so this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously. It's actually a much worse movie than the original, because at least with this production, the whole production looked more than a few dollars and a video camera. He has his funny moments, but he really play off the cheapness of his movie and do that is your intended laughter is a kind of weak movie if you ask me. You can't come up with a good story, your effects will be really bad, look, let us make the movie look as bad as possible, with a horrible one liner and we have our movie. The first of them had at least a somewhat trusted story as a snowman who attacked during the winter, not what equals the resort. It also had better effects, this is just a step or two before "Hobgoblins" when it comes to monsters and you really want to be more than a step two over a bunch of puppets. Yet it is all that is a superb ending that shows a large naval vessel that is stamped out by a powerful frost. Actually, I'm kidding, but it was really the funniest part of the movie.
