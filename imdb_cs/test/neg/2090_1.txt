Last week on Friday I and my friends looked at "Snakes on the Plane". It was amazing compared to this horrible movie (however, many scenes were ridiculously cheerful). In principle, a woman has a Mayan curse, where she collects harmless, harmless garters of snakes that pass through the victims instead of attacking. The girl with the coke bag is hot enough. The title screen says "100 passengers ... 3,000 Vemers Vemous!" Scary, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Just a few stoners and a few other losers. It is worth five dollars to turn the woman into a huge CG snake and engulf the entire train. It's just sad that someone would go to such lengths to create crap just to do a few bucks because of "Snakes on the Plane" craze.
