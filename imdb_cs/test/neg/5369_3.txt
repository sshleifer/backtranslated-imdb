"Paranormal State" is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. I enjoy watching what the "team" has to say and what they will find, but I know that the whole show, along with its builds and storylines, is completely set up. They go to real haunted places and I suspect they are talking to real witnesses. I usually feel I look at not watching the nonfiction, but a real movie that is contrary to reality. Personally, I would not recommend or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic fear seeker. <br /> <br /> Interesting show. Stick to "Ghost Hunters"
