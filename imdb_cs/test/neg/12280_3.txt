Basically a barren action movie has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) built against two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action to lead the 80s, Roundtree's small part is far from his "Shaft" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, one sitting right next to his ridiculous turn in "Toolbox Murder" (this man he was once a respected actor, now he brought flowers in his hair and complained about the bleeding of people on the carpet. Only Stack Pierce is acting with some dignity. Do not be afraid of violence: most of them are too bad to offend someone. (* 1/2)
