I don't normally write reviews, but I had to do this for the movie. I'm shocked by the acting talent in this move that goes to waste ... the screenplay was awesome ... cut horrible ... and the plot was very thin. You spend the first half of the film wondering who is talking to whom and what they are doing on the ground. The other half of the film slows down slightly, but has no depth or feel. The only saving grace is a nice but still limited CGI and location in London. I gave it 3 stars and the fact that the actors were still trying to do a good job with the drivel they got. If you like the loss of a few hours of your life with an average popcorn disaster movie fun, by all means, this is a movie for you. But I would recommend you do something else with your time, like watching real archive footage online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
