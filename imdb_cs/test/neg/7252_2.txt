I do not think that the number of wrong soldiers and strategically contained in this turkey can be defeated. Everything in this mess was done on cheap and the soldiers looked really stupid. Examples: At the start, a 2-star general gets a lieutenant's strategic advice and admits it undoubtedly. Map used by Lt. shows opposing positions, but they apparently have only one narrow valley to use in advancing on a battalion (although the map showed a dozen more). The back cover occupies a position from which the enemy is clearly seen and exposed. They beat our heroes from high country, but this excellent firepower has little difference. A single enemy tank progresses near the end (at the beginning referred to as an armored division), proceeded by a lone infantry point (!), Which moves extremely slowly without covering the area's survey, then surrenders to the tank when it deems economical to continue. - The most bizarre scene. The soldiers occupy the cave. There is ice and deep snow all around, but in the cave there is no deep puddle in the yard from which everyone wakes up repeatedly - their feet will only take a few minutes to freeze. Later, the survivors woke pathetically slowly and the chest high across the river to return to their unit. Remember that the winter is deep and the earth is frozen. Yeah yeah! And that's what it is. Screaming commands to positions on higher terrain, put mines near their own position and warn each other to nepo≈°lapali (!) At the beginning of the award is granted to a soldier who has been awarded the Medal of Congress. Was he blind, or did Director Fuller just ignore him? One of them was wounded with a bayonet's foot at the points and finally pulled out a piece of shrapnel without running down behind him. He announces that it should qualify him as a surgeon. Now it was fun.
