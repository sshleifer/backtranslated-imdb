I found it an observable film. There was some good stunt work that gave the story enough excitement and tension. One had however to suspend those credibility on a number of conspiracy opportunities to work. For example, despite the loss of the transmission cable, clutches, and harnesses, when the pilot manually pulled the landing gear, luckily they found a replacement deck for the Caribbean decks. According to a plot drilling a hole in the vault ceiling, it would turn off the vault alarm system when the system would be reactivated (I can't think why), according to Daltry, the battery drill couldn't control the helicopter ceiling, but they just happened to have a hydraulic drill complete with hoses and fittings to fit equally comfortable take-off points in the plane of hydraulics above the vault. Since the aircraft has a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to understand how this can be achieved without affecting control systems or at least adjusting the cockpit hydraulic pressure alarms. If we take it for the sake of conspiracy, it takes a few minutes for a small hole to drill at the top of the vault (the voltage will be able to pass before the Fed gets there to check for a false alarm), but since the Doors door has closed and before the Fed walked a few feet to the second security door, they cut a large panhole hole into the vault roof to pass. One can accept all the theses and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good yarn, however, what spoiled the film for me was when what seemed to be the writers' efforts to figure out what until then was quite a predictable ending, killing two heroes (if one can refer to wrinkles as a hero) Ketchum and Brooks either were shot and thrown out 747 at 10,000 feet of another wiliest gliding down the cable between the two planes villain Daltry with one hand can unbutton the cable carrying the weight of an adult man with air pressure a few hundred miles an hour pushing him, letting him fall to death. And yet, in the following order, these two, without any explanation (however subtle or unlikely) miraculously survived 10,000 feet and had the time to create a complicated scam to get the money. The only survival note was Sophie that her brother was a bad shot. Don't expect an Oscar nomination.
