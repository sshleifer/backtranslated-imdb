what a pity that our first movie is so bad .............................. hi what did you do in this movie : (... it's horrible and director :( .. there is no story in this movie. I slept while watching this movie. It's disappointing and most crew members aren't from Saudi Arabia. It's supposed to be a comedy movie but lacks essential elements in comedy, <br /> <br /> I know this is the first experience with a movie theater in Saudi Arabia, but from Kaif Al Hal! movie is the presence of some talented actors who didn't help much text explode their talent at last .., iwant know your comment about this movie guys ... is that bad or what?
