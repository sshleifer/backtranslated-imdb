I did not make great assumptions that it was certainly a very, very free adaptation from Eça de Queiroz, and I must say that this free adaptation creates a book like many possible good ideas and characters. The problem is the way it is done, without any care, without any taste, just the noise of cliché of bad taste everywhere. The script is so fake and the characters so unreal that it makes petty to see nice actors like Unas, Bryner, Morgado, Lagarto and others, lost in the net of everything except cinema or narration. To my surprise, the newcomers Jorge Corrula and Soraia Chaves are brave in their performances, but you can see that they are lost as a drifting ship without any direction. And when we talk about direction, does this movie seem to be missing? Where is the director? Everything is bad taste; Frames are anything, and anytime, using a handheld camera without any legitimate reason, a lighting design that should build the environment does not exist (and no excuses that the whole point is a dark real story). The problem overall in this "struggling" film is that like no taste, or a very, very bad taste. It is sad to see how Jorge and Soraia dissolve in such false and gratuitous sex scenes, painting troughs of the film, such as storytelling, or fake transition motifs. Perhaps Carlos Coelho da Silva should see Carlos Carrera's 2002 adaptation of the same Eçy book and get felling to build a real movie.
