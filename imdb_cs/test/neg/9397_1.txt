The film has no excitement and has no interest in keeping your interest. The film had nothing to do, funny, dramatic or romantic !!! How can a movie be romantic if a girl never gets the right guy for the last movie before the movie ends? Maybe Part II will be romantic, but someone else will have to risk wasting money! I have nothing but to say otherwise than waste time !!! The film had nothing to do, funny, dramatic or romantic !!! The film had nothing to do, funny, dramatic or romantic !!! The film had nothing to do, funny, dramatic or romantic !!! The film had nothing to do, funny, dramatic or romantic !!!
