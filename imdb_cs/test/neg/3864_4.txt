This is the first time I feel the need to comment on an IMDb, write some kind of review, and, as is often the case, it's not really a great movie, but really scary. Take the narrative style that the youngest may involve the Max Payne series, cast literally unkonwns (which is not a bad thing in itself), bad dialogues, some dark scenes, but not enough, and make yourself film of it. Don't worry about bad behavior, length (too long), lack of immersion (the lead character must be one of the most interesting things I've seen for a long time - I couldn't worry if he died) or often ridiculous solutions found which the main character finds himself. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't write anything if it weren't for another review, which would have 10 stars. I gave it four, but maybe three are closer to what I feel. Not only do I not want to see it again, but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself. Oh, and the so-called noir movie is nothing without a good soundtrack - not here. The final song sounds as if it is more suitable for Western film. It's not romance, it's not an action, it's not a noir, it's not good. That would be my rating if there weren't at least 10 lines.
