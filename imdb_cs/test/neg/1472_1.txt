I usually enjoy underground movies and antiheroes, but that's a bad joke. I wonder how it can be called a movie. All these people are looser and filmmakers fail to make them interesting at all. They are neither funny nor tragic, simple stupid and boring. <br /> <br /> I may miss something, but I won't watch it again to see what. Anyone with a video camera can do better than that ... <br /> <br /> I give him 1 for originality. Everything else is stupid.
