I still wonder why I was sitting all this thing. She had only about 3 minutes of real fun, the rest was just total boredom. Acting isn't so great and action scenes are soooo cheesy, it's not even funny. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but now I can't think of anything. Probably there were things that some can enjoy, but the end must be the stupidest idea ever. What kind of person would get a small toy remote-controlled helicopter with a burned machine gun in it to murder the president? This idea could never have been done in the first place, let alone someone so stupid to try, I think the writer had to be obsessed with the scene of a toy car in the Dead Pool, but actually tried to make it look serious.
