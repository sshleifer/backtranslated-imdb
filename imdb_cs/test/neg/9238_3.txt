**** Probably Will Include Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> After Attempting Attention (I wouldn't say you'll make sure you get help before you die "suicide attempt"), Joey he finds herself pregnant and begins to see ghost images. Overall, the movie was a bit slow, but fun enough to watch the whole thing. There were only a few minor horrors and excitement for the horror movie. But halfway there was a really terrifying scene (though I didn't give it away) :) I watched this movie because I liked the previous movie The Eye. I was a little confused, however, to determine it, other than being a "supernatural tense" film from the same creators, Eye 2 had no relation to the eye, * whatsoever *; Different cast, different story. Eye2 has nothing to do with the eyes: The film had several controversial scenes: Joey is attempting suicide three times (4 times if you count the time when witnesses say they saw Joey) jump in front of the train), she's associated with a brutally defacing striker, she is They spread in the restaurant and witnesses say she was "attacking" people and yet she is allowed to go about her business freely, without even as much as evaluating the psyche or in the hospital (for reasons other than her pregnancy). The film was not the greatest horror movie, the story was rather appealing (even for the feature film: P), the ghosts were either small and / or nothing we haven't seen before. But it was an "interesting" story and once you learned what the "truth" was behind the ghosts, it was an interesting twist on the "spirit" story. The film rated 3 out of 10.
