I'm sorry, but I was disappointed in the movie. It was very hurrying as I suppose you can understand that the length of the movie version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of big scenes were overlooked just to go through the story. Unfortunately, because the film is so rushed, you won't get to really know and feel for each of the characters at all. Not only that, this film is boring. I say that with the capital of B 1/3 of the way I started yawning and I couldn't wait for the movie to end. When I was reading the book and watching the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go before I could finally leave the cinema. Mr. Darcy, who's in this movie, can't act. He also looks too young to play Mr. Darcy. Every word coming out of his mouth is rushed, as if he had to get through the script or something. Where is it built? At first, he seems confused with everything. It's just bizarre! It all looks. <br /> <br /> He tried not to compare the Colin Firth version, but if you like this version, you'll most likely be disappointed. Costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress like some women's fashion, and she wasn't raised in a swing. Her dress suggests she could be the poorest peasant in all of England. I disagreed with several scenes in the movie in fact that I don't think it was considered right in this society for men to do such things, honestly Mr. Bingley, who's wealth should know better. There are some things that are said to sound too modern for the time this movie is set, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shocked, he acts like a simpleton to me, not a character who likes and respects. And what about his laughter !!! Even Wickham hardly has a presence, and Mr and Mrs Hurst and a few other characters have no presence. Keira did it well, but it's just not the same thing.
