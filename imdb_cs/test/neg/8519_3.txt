This film is strictly intended for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. I'm angry with the TCM that this mess is showing more often than a bachelor's mother, a beautiful artwork. I'm still more angry that some Hollywood boobs thought it would be a good idea to remake a bachelor's mother, fill it with some lame songs that only serve to break the flow of cute comedy. Instead, Hollywood could have spent time, money, energy and talent wasted on this terrible remake to give us something new and original - Wow, What Concept! Bachelor Mother (original), with Ginger Rogers and David Niven is a spicy stew that is cooked with sexuality. That's the 1930s blink at Hays Office. The Book of Joy (remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is strictly milk and cookies. It's a 1950s handshake with Eisenhower. Which cast would you prefer to watch - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, every cast member in the original version is much better than his remake counterpart. <br /> <br /> In the original, beautiful, young Ginger Rogers is on top. David Niven is perfect as a somewhat spoiled, sophisticated yet confused, roaring storehouse embassy. And I always like to see Charles Coburn in the movie. In a bachelor's mother, he is priceless as a desperate grandfather of a wannabe. In Joy's Bundle Debbie Reynolds is her usual living self. She is okay in this role, although her performance (along with Fisher) completely changes the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. He is completely absent on the screen "presence." Here it is too healthy for this story. His actions are completely bland and helpless. Likewise, his singing is so bland and unusual that he has been forgotten about the whole world. The only time he's not completely painful is in Butterfield 8 - where he doesn't sleep by the way. Here, Fisher's lame performance alone is enough to destroy this movie. Adolphe Menjou, a popular actor, provides competent performance, but not one of his best. He's more stormy than commanding. He and Fisher are not convincing as father and son. You see a musical for music, the story is just a random one? Or watch a musical for a story, with some (hopeful) good music used for spice? If the first one, this lame remake. Otherwise, it is much better to watch non-musical original Ginger Rogers, a bachelor's mother.
