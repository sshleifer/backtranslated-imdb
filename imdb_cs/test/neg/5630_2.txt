RIDDLE was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what seems to be an attempt to pull the mysteries of Charles Dickens 'novels into the present story, but this attempt is thwarted by the choice of using the two time slots in which the puzzle' broke up. Despite the cast of well-known actors who have tried to pull this straight film on DVD as much as possible, the resulting product is a long, boring, amateurish mess that can only be considered fun if viewers are cast fans as they remembered from other films. Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist who confines himself to reporting on dog race races while dreaming of important reporting challenges. A series of similar murders happens to be an old friend of Mike's - Sadie (Vera Day) who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames, having just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by Charles Dickens, and has a gold heart, putting sandwiches off to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp Beachcomber (Derek Jacobi). Sadie's murder attracts Mike to the role of detective journalism and, with the help of Kate (Julie Cox), begins to bind investigations to the tracks he found while reading Dickens' manuscript. The flow disruption of this somewhat simplistic story is the use of flashbacks to Dickens' time as Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) tells a somewhat personal story of extra murders. The parallel between the stories and the casting among the actors may have worked in other hands, but the finessing of this kind of risky escape writer / director Brendan Foley. He draws his story to the end (finally) with a tired Hollywood ending. In addition to Jones, Jacobi, Cox and Day, the film has attracted the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng, PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal but happily distracting. It is a fragile piece of molasses that lets the viewer wonder how films of this quality will sometimes find funding. Grady Harp
