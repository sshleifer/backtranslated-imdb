I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say, "Ben Johnson?!" - he was a crazy boy, MOVIE STAR, COWBOY, and in 1976 he scratched by playing the sheriff in silly films like this movie by choosing GOOD KILLER BEES that everyone thought was getting ready. us at that time. So there are these bees and they kill some people by flying in the mouth and go after them underwater. Eventually these idiots find a swarm and die, and this woman is trapped in her car with a swarm. Cops are like what we're gonna do? Bees die when it's cold. So where can we cool it down? VÃ­m - New Orleans Stadium! So he drives this car and his accompanying swarm of killer bees on the streets of New Orleans and the streets of New Orleans, with a bullhorn who says, "TURN STREETS OFF OR ARE DIRECT." And the future home of the tens of thousands of flood victims with its broken toilets becomes the narcotic fate of this strange bee bunch. I don't know which is more outrage on this big city ... well, I'm doing it, but this is too. The best view of an extremely faded-to-orange 16mm print, though Betamax is a good alternative!
