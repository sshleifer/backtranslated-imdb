This in-name-only sequel to ROADHOUSE's classic DEA agent (John Schaech) comes to rescue his uncle (Will Patton) when his uncle is badly beaten by a local drug gang, headed by a wooden Indian actor Jake Busey. Gang wants to take over the poor guy's bar for shameful reasons. Patrick Swayze is probably missing here. Schaech is an indifferent actor and is not convincing as an ass-kicking lawyer. The fighting here is occasional and not as powerful or cruel as the fighting in ROADHOUSE. The final is just as weak. Some good-looking women leave things for a while. There is an amazing struggle between Daisy-Duke-type that turns out to be handy as fist and guns, and an ugly-looking baby Busey who is handy with sharp tools. At the beginning there is also a terribly dressed girl who is the co-founder of Schaech, but unfortunately she never appeared in the film. Very bad. She made a short dance dance for Schaech, who had my full attention. If nothing else, ROADHOUSE 2 launches a strip strip scene that comes damn close to what a real strip club looks like, a rare circumstance in every movie. The rest is snooze.
