The next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is ... oh yes, "Graduation Day"! All these seniors, simply with the full potential and ready to go into the real world and become adults. This means that if they can graduate without having to mistake the fool of the campus running around, the life of the students drives with their sword of sword ... Yeah, it all comes from a high school star that drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the Navy at graduation. The coach coach holds the blame and fins in his lowered position in the shop-class, while a girl's friend still mourns her death a year later ... All these characters are the main candidates for the "Serial Slasher of the Year" and you just have to sit over this movie until To end find out who-to-it. "Graduation Day" is fun, although it is by no means spell-binding original and there is not a lot of unforgettable extinction, but there is enough going on to keep you a little entertained. Like Linnea Quigley screwed up the music teacher and arrested the common, thirty-year-old actors playing teenagers, and of course ... Rollerdisco! I have to love that crap! You can do much worse than "Graduation Day", kiddies ...
