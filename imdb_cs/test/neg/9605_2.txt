Normally, I don't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk music as if I forgot it as soon as I see it, but since I saw this movie just yesterday on one of the Showtime channels (346, I think) I decided to make an exception. Aside from watching Carol Alt, I can't give any reasonable reason to watch this movie to the end. I am always amazed that good looking women are willing to appear in such a scary movie, but I think this movie would lead to something better. I hope she was right about her. Otherwise, it is all that is typical for direct video transmission, or just a piece of waste depending on your view. While there are some decent moments in this movie, they won't be able to connect well with a story like that. The setting, as I recall, included Carol Alt as a depressed housewife who believes her husband, a cop, is cheating on her. There was also something about their baby dying in an accident, and she blaming him for it, but before this story went anywhere she fired and killed him. On the same fateful night, an injured stranger comes to her door and she tends to him, and almost immediately her house is besieged by government robberies and mercenaries who intend to capture an alien who seems to be almost superhuman combat skills. <br /> <br /> The same kind of material has been done before it has gotten good fun, especially in The Damne's The Bourne Identity, and this time it did, but this particular film left a drop due to poor production values ​​and a lousy scenario. This movie really breaks down at the end when a mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg (!) who was programmed as a policeman and after finding out that Carol Alt had killed her husband, she tries to kill her ! The film wasn't particularly good until this point, but the end of it really destroys it by trying to change a modest action thriller into a rough Terminator / Robocop wannabe. I also thought that the violence in the film was a bit exaggerated at the end, with a demented cyborg that poured out the poor eye of Carol Alt, before finally biting the dust. What it was? What was it in this movie? I enjoyed the attention and amused for about an hour, until the end, when it reminded me that I was not watching a first-class film. It wasn't even a second movie. The final scenes seem to suggest a sequel that I don't think would ever happen, though I haven't checked the web carefully. Needless to say, I'm not in any hurry to see any continuation of this movie.
