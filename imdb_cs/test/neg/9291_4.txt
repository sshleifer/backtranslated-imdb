Barricade finds Alice Faye without songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without a passport. He's in a heap of trouble, I won't say exactly what, and neither American extraterritoriality will help her. I mentioned this because one of the causes that the Chinese, including the bandits, are attacking the American mission in this story deep in the Chinese interior was the special institution where American citizens who committed crimes were tried by the American courts established by our consulates. But we were far from the only country that did it. The story, however, opens with her on a train to Shanghai trying to use the Russian ice hockey accent. Accent Intrigue Warner Baxter, which is quite plastered. But the bandits break the road and two seek refuge in the US consulate, chaired by Charles Winninger. It's the best in the movie and I just wish that a better story was released because I liked its character. He is a widower and a proud member of the consular service, appointed by William McKinley in 1900. Ten years later he asked for a transfer, and that's the last thing he heard about. As Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Hale said it is a real forgotten man. Baxter has done well in a role that someone like Clark Gable would have done in his MGM sleep. Heroism would be more natural to Gable than to Baxter because the mission is barricaded and defended against bandits. Alice Faye had one number to sing. Why Alice's song was cut out, God and Zanuck know it. One thing I'm still trying to figure out is when the mission residents finally resort to the basement with a trap door, just who stayed upstairs to pull the carpet behind the cellar door? Barricade had the potential to be much better than it was. But sloppy cut and loss of faith in a 20th-century project, Fox releases the project unfulfilled. Watching Barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal.
