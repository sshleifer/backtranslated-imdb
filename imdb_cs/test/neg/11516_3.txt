Be With Me is an almost perfect wallpaper wallpaper. Let it run in the background. chat with each other and return to it whenever you want, and at some point it will end. Unfortunately, as I observed myself, so I felt like I was almost watching the worst, longest, most impulsive beer in the world when I just managed to keep my eyes open as the end of rolled credits; and then I did (just) a few more moments of vigilance to witness "thank you" to film sponsors, including the Asia-Pacific breweries. Oh! Methought: How surprising is it * that all the shots of Tiger Beer that are scattered in this most forgotten movie? Meanwhile, dialogue between individuals with occasional stabbing in depth, but too often nothing concrete progress on the film's overall story is said or witnessed. It is as if one could turn off at any time and come back anytime later, and you would really miss anything that would be an unacceptable event or part of it in terms of overall film development. So the ultimate "wallpaper movie"! Well I wonder ... What movie were those who positively checked this tracking? I was wondering and continuing to think ... Surely it couldn't be in such a way that it would be an insignificant justification for Singapore's apology for the camera. Reportedly, "Be With Me" is to be woven around the themes of "love, tragedy, and redemption." The only thing I witnessed was boredom, a half-baked scenario with shattered inconvenient text messages, and the only redemption was when this totally useless film ended. What a waste of time, it's over! It was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious, with the exception of Theresa Chan, who is "a remarkable woman who has overcome the adverse events ..." Well, no disrespect for Mrs. Chan, but since she was so wonderful and an amazing character, why did the script have to include stories of other characters without trying to connect their lives? Nevertheless, it turned out to be an almost excruciatingly boring film whose main points were credits. Rather than tying in the fates of all the characters, I really felt that the film ended in an almost impossible attempt and apparently fell between the molars in terms of any viewer involvement. I'm generally art -house movie fan and usually don't object to slow stimulation (there's no shortage here, believe me!). I hate movies like 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but I'm considering Eric Rohmer as a great filmmaker. So I hope it puts my criticism in some perspective. However, there was no imaginable feature in the film's design and submission that could prevent the eyelids from flowing down slowly as it dripped "Be With Me" every minute. Watch this movie if you want to feel like a waste of time. Otherwise, your life wouldn't be any richer if he missed it. 3/10
