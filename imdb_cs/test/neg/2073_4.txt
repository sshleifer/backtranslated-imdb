Dull Acting, Weak Scenario ... The Worst Spanish Movie In The Years ... I Was Attracted By (Naked) Beauty Of Paz Vega But As An Actress <br /> <br /> Nothing, You Can't almost to understand what he says ... <br /> <br /> The story is not very coherent to say ... we've heard about it <br /> <br /> before, but as this is "modern Carmen" we'll find a few changes: - A French soldier is now a Basque soldier. -Merimee himself is in the story. -Carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with the famous <br /> <br /> "matador" and she can speak fluent basque ... <br /> <br /> Can anyone understand this mess?
