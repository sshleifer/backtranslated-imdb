Spoiler * This gives away a very irrelevant ending ** <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film, there was a brief introduction to the world of gore master films gore, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this movie got lost and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gore films were measured by the amount of blood used in it. Blood Feast was 2 galloner, 10,000 Maniacs were 5 galloners. But then she goes and says Dr. Gore was 15 galloners. I want to know where half of the 15 gallons went. I watched the movie and saw very little at 15 gallons. We agreed that there was a lot of blood, but nowhere near 15 gallons. Some scenes were definitely nice and realistic, with strings of meat and everything, but I wouldn't say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "END! ENNNNNNNNNDDDDDD !!!" Sounds familiar? This is what you should say near the last half of this movie. After Igor was placed in an acid bath, the film slowed down to a painful crawl. There was no complete ending because it was not in line with anything that was 90 minutes before it provided. She left in a van with a total stranger, BIG DEAL! This is what happens when you hold on to an individual (I won't tell a person because he doesn't qualify as a person) very innocent about the world around her. The doctor teaches a girl to be loved, so every person she meets loves. Although HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the film that we don't like acting, directing, or even gore ... I'll go with the A and B options. BOTH WERE TERRIBLE !! It was enough to give me bad dreams of cut editing and people with strong eyes when talking to one person. But I did it in the movie and came out stronger. Too bad I couldn't say the same after ROBO C.H.I.C. That was the BAD movie. Usually I can take a vinegar dose in a good step, but once in a while you get a movie that bites back. I think this movie took a hand or a foot (haha ... * sigh *) I admitted I enjoyed the view of the scenery where a good doctor stared at his future victims and opened his eyes REALLY wide and just stared. It was very similar to Fuad Ramseys in the Blood Feast when he looked at the lady in her catering store and didn't use her power after that. I think this film is taking place where Fuad's forces have ended. * Final judgment * The film should remain lost. Hello <br /> <br /> -Scott-
