Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from Franz Lidz's book. Young mother Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell) struggles with a very serious illness and her own renowned inventor husband Sid (John Tururro) is in a department of emotion little missing. Dissatisfied with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) decides to stay with his two eccentric uncle Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Cutell) until his mom is okay. Steven seems happier and even interested in his uncle's strange habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz. This drama, set in the early 1960s, is a bit comic ... to turn it into zany. Not a MacDowell fan, UNSTRUNG HEROES ensures my attitude; even though I enjoyed the movie and it's not a total waste.
