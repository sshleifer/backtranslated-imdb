Cartoon-like special effects, horrible gameplay and dialogue, and dry land! This movie has it all! My friend and I went to the blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of, but that was just too much. The film begins with women and her son on vacation on an island in the Bahamian region. Women who become a doctor / virologist are in an area where a man collapses. He has a peculiar blow on his shoulder and immediately knows it's a contagious virus. The story continues to show a surprisingly fast romance between two teenagers (this is justified by the fact that the girl says, "I know it's fast, but it's just nice." ????) We are told that within three months, if the virus is not treated and will contain it, it will spread to united states and kill millions of people. This information will not stop the CDC from leaving the island to rescue. Fortunately, the cure for this terrible virus is just in time and the island is saved. To celebrate the death of loved ones, people on the island have a party breaking where everyone is dancing, having fun and forgetting the terrible epidemic that has just occurred.
