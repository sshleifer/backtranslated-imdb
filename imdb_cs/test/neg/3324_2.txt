I should have known when I heard that Anne Rice had left a project that would disappoint me. I couldn't predict that years after it's just thinking about a movie, I'm still angry. The novels are amazing, and when I know they're losing the screen, this movie was a big middle finger to the original piece. I hope one day someone will try again, the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. It changes the roles and appearance of large and small characters for no reason. It will destroy Lestat's history. Queen acting is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but I can't bring myself to laugh. The magic and the glamor of the novels are simply not there. The film is a bad excuse to imitate as many musicians and "dark" images as possible into one movie, hoping that the small Americans would pull it. Part of the appeal of the first film, Louis's story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat is supposed to take over the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank God I read the first books, or I never touched them after this movie.
