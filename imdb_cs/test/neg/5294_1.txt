I went to the cinema somewhat feared, I came out of what I witnessed, disgust at the garbage (go through the film). Actors, especially Travolta, should be ashamed of their involvement in this matter. The only thing that was in their minds was the payroll check, it doesn't matter that it is a cut of their talents and us. Travolta has to go back to doing another "Look Who's Talking" movies when he returned to the level of his pre-Tarantino work. It comes to something when L W Talking sequels are better than this. Travolta is no longer King of Cool, but King of Corn. Michael Caine himself admitted to doing bad payroll movies, Trvolta should follow if he has any respect!
