Some movies are just stupid outside the explanation. That's one of them. Words cannot do justice to wooden acting, stupid conspiracy, and still predictable results. The only thing that makes this movie halfway worth watching is the terribly clad women (and mute guy for you ladies) in it. The female fighter leader and Valeria are quite attractive to the eye. But that's probably all this movie has done. Some stupidity at the point: One scene, when they embark on a journey to the Dark Den, they leave the supposedly devastated country. But we clearly see the 1980s behind them. About 2/3 of this film appears to have been filmed in the college basement. The deadly puppets of socks look scary like a monster from a sesame street. I have to agree with Latronic that many fifties b-movies did a better job than this. The only thing I think was not teenagers from space.
