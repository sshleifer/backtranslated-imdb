Fatal Contact: Bird Flu in America: 3 of 10: This movie is both funny and sad. The funny part is quite obvious because it is certainly not a sober view of a possible impending crisis. This is a modern version of The Swarm. And, like the murderous bees (and the so-called bee-killing crisis that brought them), the bird flu combined with a media pantheon inspired by the end of world scenarios (SARS, Y2K, global warming) that simply refuse to come. The sad part is the obvious attempt of the filmmakers to inspire panic. Disease pandemics have historically been quite common after all people not all died in their 1940s from heart disease. Even the recent pandemics, such as AIDS, reflect the old-fashioned VD (I mean syphilis) crisis that killed more soldiers than bullets. The flu pandemic in the early twenties was an ugly trade killing millions of people, but sincere life went on. I wonder if our excessive media and their powerful hungry government allies would make life possible today. The film floats wildly from fairly competent scenes (Triage in Grand Central Station) to ridiculous (Rednecks' attempt to ambush the National Guardsmen in Manhattan). The scenarios themselves are quite useless because filmmakers can't decide exactly how infectious the bird flu is, or whether the symptoms are Ebola-style or simply a long illness. Indeed, one scene will show everyone in biohazard suits and another will not even have a mask. The film also strongly refuses to provide any practical advice on what to do in the bird flu crisis. (Outside hand washing, what no adhesive tape?) Acting and directing are eligible for a TV movie, but the script is all over the map. The last movie has a strangely non-exponential death sum at the bottom of the screen. Like Swarm.
