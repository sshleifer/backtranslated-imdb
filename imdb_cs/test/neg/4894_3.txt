"The Ballad of a Sad Cafe" worked hard on her image, but when she got to the time she trembled, she stood in her own created dust. You can't say it loudly, but if Amelia Vanessa Redgrave were to fight John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood, my hard earned dollars would have to go to Redgrave. Her portrayal of Amelia was so close to perfection and consumed with more determination than most actors are willing to give to anyone with millions of dollars. Redgrave gave Amelia this soulful campaign, a mixture of her own unique voice and a heavily earned woman from the south. For the average viewer, it could be considered unpleasant, but as the film progressed, did it become? Miss Amelia transformed this stage of beauty into a rough one. Was it Redgrave's performance, as well as her interaction with the other characters who put the film at the top? but not the highest. The others who followed her performance were needed, but not stellar. As we moved past the dark cliché image that every stage designer hired for post-depressing work in the south handed over, the tiny characters felt like posters. The picture needed a scene, but the characters of the city had no other purpose. Take, for example, the idea of ​​Rod Steiger about an old, wild, spoken preacher. His scenes alone will make every viewer question the validity of this city outside the city. The main two players who surrounded Amelia fought with the charm for the admirable peak of theft but with the wrong direction? it seemed faded. The most ridiculous of the two (although both are controversial lines of common sense) is Cork Hubbard, who plays Amelia's "cousin", who accidentally appears one night. His character is never completely defined, he has no real motive and his loyalty remains uncertain. He does not play any vital role in this film beyond forcing us, the viewers, to question his common sense and honesty. Can you create a character simply by pulling your tongue out, waving your ears, and punching your chest and head? Finally, is there a second end to the absurd ?? Keith Carradine. Callow's detailed footage of this troubled man builds character, but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia makes his intent to beat them. Were they characters like the Southern cliché, how were they? some stood forward and tried to create an absurd period, and I cannot claim to have failed. Where the "ballad of a sad cafe" failed to rise above mediocrity was in cinema and story. This film was about Amelia and her need for other souls in her life. The level of audience comfort with the arrival of her dwarf cousin was fun? one couldn't help but wonder if he was a sincere or self-confident man trying to drink a warm heart. The character of Cork Hubbard is never fully understood, but we accept him with short shots and Amelia, who are doing little things together. It is his idea that turns from a tenant to a cafe owner. The problem is that director Callow has never brought us to this dramatic level between Cork and Redgrave? is the man crazy or representing the whole Amelia family? I needed something from Callow, who brought these two of David Lynch-esquire the relationship they had. Then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of Carradin as the "love interest" of Amelia. With the flashback flashback technique, do we see two creatures, but never fill their love? which Amelia is angered against their love that has drawn him into the world of madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why wasn't there a connection between Carradin and Redgrave? Why was it in the movie? With a lack of focus on these characters connecting, any scenes between the two made no sense? Throw in the Cork selection and it just gets completely discombobulated. While there were several beautiful choreographic scenes that Callow created, the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost my focus, interest, and my care of the characters fell when I didn't understand the final question? "why"? Overall, the "ballad of a sad cafe" started with a blow, but ended in a very small crack of a firecracker. My emotional feelings about this movie turned up and down, up and down, and finally stayed down mainly because of the lack of understanding of the characters' motives. Redgrave did a phenomenal job like Amelia, and while the other characters (except the random Steiger) tried their best, I just didn't understand who they were. Their motives were so confused that when the emotional end finally came, I was apathetic. Director Callow seemed to lack importing scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players. Callow created several beautiful scenes where the faces seemed to overlap with the landscape, allowing us to focus on Amelia? or Carradin, but nothing has been explained or developed. The film played with anger, discovery, happiness, memory, anger, anger, anger, disappearance. Without comparative connectors, this was transformed from contemporary period film to actor playing in front of the camera. It was a shame because "Sad Café" had a promise, it just couldn't bring it. <br /> <br /> Level: ** ½ of *****
