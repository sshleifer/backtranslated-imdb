**** Possible spoiler **** <br /> <br /> If you were doing a serious film involving a powerful but aging father with three apparently ungrateful daughters, featuring top quality actors, with great cinema and a beautiful midwestern environment where would you go there? Why would you have a modern tragedy after "King Lear" of course. <br /> <br /> I expected that. That was definitely not what I got. I got 105 minutes of feminist audacity - one long dispute over the inhumanity of a man against a woman. Why, he wasn't a decent man in the whole story. You see soon in a place where this movie could go, but you can't believe anyone who would lose all these fine actors and craftsmen on that Trite scenario - you want them to get to the King theme Lear. But it will never happen; and it's a real tragedy when you ask me. In addition to the panorama of a beautiful country heart, the only thing worth watching in this movie was the gorgeous chameleon, British actor Colin Firth, practicing his midwestern accent. Now there was treatment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
