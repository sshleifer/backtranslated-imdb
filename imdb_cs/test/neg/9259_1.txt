Take the wrong script, some miserable behavior and throw a politically incorrect morality story and what do you get? Something that should go through quality family tracking. Seven are the story of a 19th-century family traveling America in a train car and hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a child whose sex I'm not quite sure), hence the title of the movie. The story opens to a family living a seemingly normal 19th century. century life on the farm in the middle of nowhere. John's eldest son is a premature teenager, "lazy and good for nothing," as his father constantly reminds him. We see the bat right now that it has a penchant for practical jokes when it connects the string with the hair of its sleeping sisters and connects them to a nearby mule. When the mule moved, the poor girls were taken out of bed. John is caught by his father and is immediately punished with a strap. That same day, a wagon train goes through. Pa is tempted to unite because he promises a new wild life, wild west. And so the family comes across their stuff and their heads gone. From the outset, the film seems weak and amateurish. Acting is below the level as if it were one of those films shown in the school about pioneers. I can't blame the actors, however, because the lines in this movie are stupid and just too rude sweet and optimistic. I have to tell you that I caught this movie, while with a wave of channels I am a boring Saturday afternoon on a Christian TV station. Not from the religious mind, I myself watched in horror as the Seven themselves offered moral statements that were not only outdated, but also utterly offensive! If I were a good Christian, I hope that I would have a good sense of complaining about the TV station that it was sending such a waste. However, since I am cynical, unbelieving with an impious sense of humor, I have decided to sit and laugh stupidly. In one of the opening scenes, the role of the father as a strict ruler of the house is founded when he suggests the idea of ​​going to Oregon to his wife. Her answer is warmed "Over my dead body." We are supposed to laugh as the film cuts to the next scene with Pa and Ma smiling as they drive the car along the prairies. I suppose even the most determined feminist would have to admit that this "best father-belief" attitude was the norm these days and one could argue the need for such a dictatorial rule when living conditions were difficult, but somehow I felt that this the film supported this view, even today. Beautiful news coming from a Christian TV station. Anyway, it's getting worse for the family and moral integrity movies are getting smaller. An Indian (or Native American) robs John while lying in a field. Like ordinary wild, the Indian takes Johns clothes and things. Fortunately, Pa, with the help of passersby Kit Carson, is able to kill Indian as well as a couple of his delinquent friends. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a real hero. The family is accompanied by a doctor who is a resident of a train wagon, Dr. Dutch (played by Aldo Ray). He shares Pa's feelings about John and says it's useless. Maybe, but also the best thing about this movie. Doctor Aldo Ray's doctor is a buffon who is unable to tie his own shoes, let alone treat one of the girls to a broken leg. Luckily, the young child did not cry when the car ran over and tore the leg in two, because Dr. We know the disadvantages of continually disparaging a child. Here is a movie that supports this behavior. Later, Pa develops food poisoning or something I didn't pay much attention to and dies. His deathbed scene is a great thing to come from. Frankly, the man didn't even look sick. Soon after, Ma also dies. Children are left to themselves. And that is when the real adventure begins. These kids intertwine with rapids, meet more Indians (they are nice) and embark on snowy terrain. And I thought, "What's that trash!" Sorry, there was nothing redeemed about this movie. This low budget Little House on the Prairie is a shameful waste of time and an insult to "families" everywhere. I am surprised that in 1975, at the end of the feminist movement, and when Native Americans' treatment focused, something like this could have been done.
