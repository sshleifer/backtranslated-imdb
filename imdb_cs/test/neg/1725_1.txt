Peter Crawford discovered a comet on a collision course with the moon. But when the government doesn't trust him (stupid fact # 1). He builds a shelter in deep underground and draws to see who will go. Plus is willing to kill to save mankind (stupid fact # 2). With millions of dollars of technology, how could a civilian see what NASA can't? Moreover, the end justifies the means of moral of this story is simply plain !!! This film is unlikely and absolutely incredible. What went through these people's thoughts, why the hell are piles like this green light? Sometimes I wonder who's in charge of making a movie in this city.
