As a big fan of Jim Carey, I settled in with optimism in the cinema. After all, having fun with Dick and Jane seemed to have all the ingredients to make another Carey's success. After the initial five minutes of good humor, he seemed to provide the film, but after the conspiracy collapsed, it went wrong. The idea that a charming, charismatic, top-notch VIP employee might suddenly find himself at work in his closest supermarket is so hard to believe and then get around the fact that this person has also become a criminal master is virtually impossible. The actors seem to be confused with the situation. Of course, the stereotypical, wealthy, non-captured bosses don't even try to pull out of one dimensional figure a bit, but for Carey and others around him, work is much harder. One minute Dick is regarded as an office worker obsessed with possession, the next minute it's a messy mess that can barely combine two words together, and finally becomes a tiny thief who is able to happily put a gun to another. male head. Jane is just as confused with her role and her character never gets. The idea of ​​the story is so good and it is a pity that this movie failed to make it work. A strange moment of laughter from loud comedy can be found, but it's usually more physical humor than anything funny or clever. Carey tries to save her best parts to save a sinking ship, but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so much gaping hole for his personality. Carey shines as she is presented with a strong, bold character (The Moon on the Moon, Ace Ventura), who never imagined this film despite his best efforts.
