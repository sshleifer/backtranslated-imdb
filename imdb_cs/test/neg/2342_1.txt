For me, this film is just a very poor teen party movie with all the normal clich√©s and boring stereotypical characters (Nerds, Jocks, Popular Girls, Sleezy Boys, etc.), but with a motive against drugs and drinking. <br /> <br /> If you've ever had an unfortunate chance to see this movie, pay attention to all the links to responsibility and keep it real (I don't know how else to say it) I think the only thing that would make this movie in cool, it would be if the TV game was on fire. That, or DVD it was exploded ... <br /> <br /> 1 of 10000 - Watch Animal House instead.
