Normally, I wouldn't even lean to watch such a waste, but because the role-playing game is a nice hobby for me, it was a movie theme. It was garbage in so many ways that I don't know where to start. I'd rather sit in the "Plan 9 from Space" marathon than watch the next minute of this vomit. At least Plan 9 had no agenda. How the media could surrender and irresponsibly represent the extremist agenda because it is beyond me. It's a frightening time when a whole group of people can be ruthlessly ripped off without any real facts. I know this commentary was more social, but it couldn't help because it pleaded with the film. Imagine that the pro-nazi film is rated strictly on film merit. It won't happen. As it fits, the people who made this film are themselves and should perhaps move to the Communist enclave to promote it.
