While there are many recommendations in Maetel Legend, both in the concept and in the finished product, it is a bad film. The fence wise is that telling Maetel's early life, which is usually unclear; At the same time, writers took the opportunity to tell the story of Machine Empire. And since Leiji Matsumoto has trouble with his next job, we get a starting point for Emeraldas her sister, Her Mother: Queen La Metalle and a little Galaxy Express 999 to add this movie. In short, Maetel is a princess on La Metalle, a planet with an irregular orbit, which means her cycle around the nearest sun reaches the cold phase and the Sun dies. The planet grows ever cooler throughout the story, thereby increasing the sense of destruction. To protect her subjects and her family, the Queen decides that mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of La Metalle. Enter Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyborg who provides the means for this work. Through the film, the characters are left to the question of mechanization, will they still be human? Can Hardgear Be Trusted? Do souls and hearts remain? So for Matsumot's fan there are a lot of things to answer questions, the topics went on, except that the film is supposed to be an introduction, as well as the fans' interest. Negatives, especially animation, while Galaxy Express 999, a TV series of more than twenty years, has a delicate animation in the mouth and sometimes superficial character design, Maetel Legend has all the worst features of modern animation, and so earns respect for the Galaxy. Expres 999. The design is well detailed, but unfortunately the animation suffered from leaving well-drawn characters that "slip", as in the background, or the camera zooms in, a fast way of animation. However, a few yes, a few well-animated scenes are used over and over again in dream, repetition and extra scenes. Anyone who seems to have a movie will wonder how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine. Story Story While everything sounds great in the concept, the finished product is in fact a series of conspiracy conversations that are repeated over and over again to the small effect of how many times the characters encounter the same issues and learn the same things is practically offensive to the audience and characters who seem to be much more articulated in earlier incarnations. Add to all this, some horrible character design that seems lifeless, over exaggerated, and the audience is left with the film, so Miss Manipulate it could be just as rewritten as another movie, at least novices should not be confused. And yet it really has its moments, the end is at least surprising. The situation of citizens of La Metalle was quite influential and justifiably disturbing; I think I found that the whole human-machine theme of anxiety. It is hard to know who Maetel Legend recommends because it is not well animated, written or executed, and confusing when Leiji Matsumoto's compulsory cross reference is introduced. But I can't help but brighten up when the beautiful Three-Nine enters, now it's a good cinema. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars from 5, 2 if you're a fan.
