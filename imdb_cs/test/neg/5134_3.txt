OK, I don't want to upset anyone, but the movie was really bad. Just as the scenes were edited and acting, it twitched me on some points. I really tried to enjoy it, but it was like a student film, they had to have the smallest budget. I liked the fact that the story liked it so much and the characters were nice, but the film on the whole was just awful. Why is it that in almost every lesbian movie one of them has to either commit suicide or die, or go straight?!?! This is the message of bad and unrealistic news. I gave it 3 stars and everything I thought was very kind. Watch this movie if you want to laugh as bad as it is.
