With Al Jolson at the height of his popularity and Warner Brothers' jazz singer having the highest grossing film of 1927, it was inevitable that other studios would churn out several vehicles for their own Jolson-esquire characters. But while the jazz singer was a sensation for his being the first interview, Matinée Idol lacks the voice of his star singing (now obscure Johnnie Walker), and must do with his visual antics. Matinée Idol was an early director's task for the renowned Frank Capra. Capra's first pair of feature features for Harry Langdon revealed a very striking, excessive style that made Langdon's average grotesque almost unnoticeable. A few photos later and Capra learned a little bit with some pretty regular and decent camera. But he still shows no ability to shoot physical comedy. It seems that the longest comic routine - performance on stage - has some good gags, but it's all cut into a lot of different camera angles, and the comedy doesn't have a chance to flow naturally from the show. In theory, much of the jokes are in the headlines, but there are too many of them, and none of them is particularly funny. Of course, Capra would have grown into a gentle dramatic and romantic director, and you can see he's starting to develop in this respect. He tells the line, closes on Walker and Bessie, who is at the point where he first looks at him when Don Wilson gets up and neatly follows the word without a word. Then there are a couple of beautiful and gentle pairs of couples in their scene together on the fancy scene, which is very reminiscent of love scenes in the early 1930s in Capra. Johnnie Walker, Columbia's reply to Al Jolson, is not exceptional talent. His comic timing is good, but there is nothing to stand out. Bessie Love, on the other hand, is a pretty good actress with a very strong face. Kudos told her she was involved in physical comedy and lost her dignity with the boys. There is also a good role for Lionel Belmore, the stupid and cheerful character actor who appears to be appearing in absolutely everyone at the end of the 20s and early 30s. Matinée Idol is one of those pictures he has gained more than his fair share of attention thanks to his director, who later made several masterpieces. By itself, this is a very uninteresting piece and like most of Capra's work before he met Robert Riskin, disappointment.
