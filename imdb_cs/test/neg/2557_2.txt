I thought you might need to watch a movie that boasted cast, including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews. Unfortunately, I was wrong. A complete mysterious nonsense from beginning to end with O'Toole and York wildly. I watched it twice and I still have no idea what's going on. I feel that O'Toole plays with Laird from a Scottish castle who has a drinking problem and enjoys playing his childhood games with his sister (York). He also barks. But besides, your estimate is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The film has no balancing function. I can only assume that the cast and director were blackmailed to make this ill-considered, unimaginable stagy piffl. Clearly losing the time of a talented cast and director. Ridiculous.
