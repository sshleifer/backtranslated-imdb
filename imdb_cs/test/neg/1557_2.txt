This is an absolutely forgettable picture. My friend took him to a bargain for local $ 50 rent. He should have asked for a refund. Or at least a discount. The story is something like this: A giant monster threatens the earth, and the aliens decide that the most accurate human being on the planet must be chosen to save the earth. A small holographic space alien appears in front of the postal worker and tells him it's "it". The Devil is in the details when it's time to evaluate the film and count on Zarkorra! The invader fails. The Zarkorr monster has only a few short moments in the screen for about 5 minutes (with a generous estimate). A cute extraterrestrial hologram has even less time on the screen and can be the most exciting feature you can look at just because it is wearing the 'teeny bopper' stereotyped outfit, which is complemented by an excitingly short pleated skirt. The final final battle with the monster is over before you can say "Tango Foxtrot Whiskey, end." The next moment you were wondering if you had just wrecked the train, or if someone had drained 3 blood pints from you. <br /> <br /> Although this movie added one line that I am friends, and I still repeat and laugh at this day, it was the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal picture. Since the cast of the "protagonists" is "interrogated" by the fuzz, one of them responds to the questions "What are you, some kind of question?" It comes in such a nonsensical way that if you are sitting with a group of friends (who will not be friends for a long time, if you have actually talked to your friend to watch it), you can actually experience howling or two unbelievers laughing. Although it is not Manos or Eegah (not bad enough to be classically bad), this movie will still bore you with its terrible dialogue, unimaginable characters, and non-existent special effects, and still deserve to inhabit 100. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
