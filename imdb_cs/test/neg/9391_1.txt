I have to admit that I didn't have to watch the whole movie. I missed the first hour during the Sci Fi channel. Or did I save the first hour? Other reviewers summed it up. It was badly conceived. Poorly written. He was wrong. But the worst thing for me was ADR. The whole movie, which seemed to be dubbed, sounded like it was in someone's garage. Widespread echoes echoed the words that had just served to hang the bad dialogue. And hang. And hang. Even for a TV movie it should be recognized. And the idea that alternative dimensions are distinguished by color saturation came out in the 1980s.
