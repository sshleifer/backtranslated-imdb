When you are accustomed to Lana Turner's Postman Always Rings Twice, and compare it to this low budget, low talent, low quality movie, well, I was just embarrassed for Ida Lupino singing (more like speaking) and the piano scene. When the first scene, which she didn't hear, and all the people just stared at it, I was positive that everyone was throwing their eyes and going away, or at least talking to each other (Stinks, c'mon, let's get out of here). Actors are flat - emotions are deflated. Ida is a true spoiled bilateral shake all over - just a 100% turn. It was like Betty Boop at Conscious Sedation encounters service station operators in nowhere in the US. The story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, the chest was ... it doesn't matter. I felt sad for the rest of the actors. Maybe if the real actress got the lead and the actors had more emotions, then the movie could have a chance. I apologize for insulting those of you who thought he was outside this world. I shouldn't mean if he stayed out of this world.
