Don't worry ourselves, ok? We all know that this film was created for the success of "Grumpy Old Men". Unlike those, however, this travesty has zero humor and very little heart. Gloria DeHaven is the only glowing light that can be seen. He breaks my heart that she finally got a chance to showcase her skills to the next generation of viewers, just to end up in such a piece. There was a moving scene that represented someone standing up. Her outstanding performance was the only quality that took place in "Out To Sea". Everyone else is going through the movements. 2/10
