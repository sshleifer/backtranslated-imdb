At first I was excited about this movie and I expected it to be a combination of Equilibrui and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was constantly disappointed by the lack of depth and interest in land and subplots. In the middle of the movie, I revealed that I avoid characters and sets from turning off. I enjoyed the assumptions of the future with the merged and separated cultures. What could be a sophisticated and intelligent look at the future is morphed into a prolific, semantic SciFi channel midnight swing with horrible acting, cheap sets and the last gratuitous shot of Tim Robbins vagina. Maybe he should stick to his socialist political bragging - it was all downhill from Shawshank.
