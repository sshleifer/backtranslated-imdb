Did the first travest really make money? This is another continuation (in line with ANOTHER STAKEOUT), which no one has requested. But we got it anyway. The sequel is like its predecessor, completely dead. It's also pretty disgusting (remember the scene for dinner?) Thinking I'm almost sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck and Warden. Did they need money too much?
