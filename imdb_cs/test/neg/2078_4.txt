Before you start whether this movie is worth your time or not, I should inform you that I've never seen another Carmen adaptation, so if you're looking for a review of how it ranks among others, it may not be very useful. when I came across Carmen, he was on the car radio when I was driving through Spain for a family vacation when I was a teenager. I didn't pay much attention to it because I didn't like opera at the time and I didn't know anything better. The story is about 150 years old. Do I feel like I missed this movie? Yes, mainly because of the conspiracy, but also because if all the actresses who played Carmen looked like Paz Vega, I should happily sit in my DVD collection. Directed by Vicente Aranda (who also tells the story with Joaquim Jorda, the story is told by the original author Prosper Mérimée, a French writer who went through the 19th century Spain. He comes over José (Leonardo Sbaraglia), delinquent a soldier and one of the many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), sensual, sexy, bedazzling gypsy woman who has the mouth of the devil, mood 'toro and who ruthlessly leads the man to their doom. José, attracting him to his stand-off behavior, but she hangs up, wraps him and lets him go in. Until one day, José is asked to be murdered, and Carmen convinces him to join her group of Gypsy smugglers. , she fell in love with him, but she meets a charming Escamillo, a bullfighter, Can José keep his jealousy in shock or destroy him? <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful, seductive story, something that resembles, almost, Shakespeare's or Ovid's conspiracy, portraying immense passion and emotions that can make us or break us and transform us to do things of nature. It is poetic, fiery and above all slutty. I got hanged up, I didn't know what direction to turn. I always hoped José could change Carmen's dirty ways. I won't tell you if he succeeded or not. <br /> <br /> The above overview is what I got from the movie, but I wasn't impressed with it. Only after I watched it, did I sink a little deeper into the story and realized how much missed the opportunity Aranda had made from Melling's classics. It was a shallow, shitty drama that saw that Vega spends a lot of time partly or completely naked (not that I particularly complained about it!). First, the negotiations were wrong. I didn't impress Sbaraglia on José. I'm still not sure if he was a weak actor, or José was a weak character, I didn't read the book. It is believed to be a man who spends most of his time with the burning desire for Carmen by looking confused, jealous and a little dull. Paz Vega was a little better than Carmen. I was convinced by her stubborn, malevolent character, though I had seen it more compelling in other films like Zapping and Lucia y El Sexo. She seems to be too pretty to play a Gypsy woman (not that I have come across many Andalusian gypsy women), so her role did not really fit her. The other actors in the film were not great either. They seemed to do everything half-heartedly. The story is passionate, emotional? they looked half-arched, as if they couldn't wait to get out of the tight 19th-century costumes they wore. However, the costumes I was impressed with were one of the film's redemption factors. I like Spanish culture, I liked the soldier's uniform, the cap and the Flamenco women's dress. Good. That's all I can say about it. Sorry, back to criticism. The scenario, as mentioned above, was rewritten by Vicente Arandou and Joaquim Jorda, so badly, enough to leave Merimee in his grave. It was boring. It didn't use José's intense passion for Carmen (or maybe it was just acting). On one and the other, ubiquitous Satanic and Devil's connotations, there were ubiquitous lines among millions of sworn words. I know the Spaniards are partial to the strange word, but the film was strewn with a handcuff, a "bitch", in literally every line. <br /> <br /> Editing and working with the camera were boring and ordinary. In fact, I liked only one battle, and that was when the camera followed a fleeting shot in the middle of the air that hit Carmen's face. It was good. But the rest? Boring. Finally, it is sad to see that such a great story goes to waste with unconvincing behavior and direction. If you're a literature teacher, let your class follow this adaptation to get an idea of ​​the story. But thanks to Paz Vega, only the male half of the class will be devoted to the film. Otherwise, stick to the opera version (though I hate musicals). I give this movie 4 just because I love the story! And Paz Vega!
