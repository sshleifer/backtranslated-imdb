The DEA agent's name, Anslinger, is a nice inner joke - that's the name of a former drug tsar who, almost without help, made marijuana illegal. Despite this knowledge of books, writers continue to have farmers harvest and sell fresh immature leaves, rather than cured buds. Besides, I always find it amusing that filmmakers can never find real marijuana plants for filming. Do you think it would be a company that would create real fake movies for film business, or could make several scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I suppose it's too much on the budget. Probably the most interesting thing about the film is trying to cover the concept with exactly what's right and what's wrong with society and how the law treads. and yet they try to do justice despite it. <br /> <br />
