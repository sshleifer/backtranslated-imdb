I just saw Princess Raccoon at the New York Asian Film Festival. The Lord, who introduced the film, congratulated the audience on their delicate taste. "You could be in Herbie: Fully loaded," he said with a smug smile, "but instead you are here to watch Seijun Suzuki Princess Raccoon." The audience applauded and encouraged. Well, let me tell you I'd rather watch Herbie: Fully loaded twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, a supposedly moody musical based on Japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films I've ever seen. It is so pathetic that her miserable fact actually made me dislike other Seijun Suzuki movies, which is quite a performance. With Princess Raccoon there is such a huge area of ​​things that I hardly knew where to start. Perhaps his worst mistakes are both aggressively incomprehensible and boggling monotonous. If the reels were mixed or half lost in shipping, viewers would not know the difference. If you don't believe me, I dare to steal the print and let someone run in random order. If you can tell me which one is where I give you every penny I have. The first third of the movie includes a scene, songs (including cringe-inducing rap numbers) and pictures. which are by no means at all concerned. The heavily integrated computer animation is thrown into the negotiation and adds another huge and rapidly growing wall of incomprehensibility. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out that the writer had written any Japanese folklore that got into mind on a lot of cards, stacked them, shuffled them, handed the cards to the table and wrote the script in their order. About thirty-five minutes into the movie comes some form of conspiracy. Something about a shape-changing raccoon princess (in human form) and a regular person who has fallen in love. I was hoping this would be a movie that would be something other than a series of confused scenes, but without such luck. The film continues to be just as helpless. I wish I could get out, but I was trapped in the middle of a narrow line. In retrospect, it would be worth it that it would be an unpleasant scene. I'm exhausted, I'm just thinking about the last few cylinders. I spent every moment hoping and praying that it would end. Every big dolly was moving, picking up music or a scene that looked remotely as if it were closing things, and renewed my hopes that the credits were about to return. After the agonizing minute he continued. And on and on and on. Finally, after dozens of false alarms, it was shortened to what I was sure to be an abstract pattern on which credits appeared. Then, contrary to all the reason, he cut himself into another scene. How could I forget? The totally unrelated subplot that concerned a ninja who was captured, urinated and cooked in soup was not yet packaged. I'll never be back for 111 minutes, but you can save the pain. If you don't want to hide your memory or future enjoyment from the big Seijun Suzuki movies like The Cubs and Tokyo Drifter, you don't see Princess Raccoon. I'd rather spend my time vomiting.
