This original HBO is quite straightforward and quite stupid. Armand Assante, again making a poor imitation of Stallone, is Ray Wellman ex-con just for parole. All he wants is his old girlfriend Lacy, played by young Marcia Gay Harden. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy teamed up with stalwart Elliot, played by Sam Neill. Another complicating issue is that Ray's old Cell friends want some favors and kidnap Lacy to make sure that happens. Ray and Elliot come together, despite mutual opposition. What follows is violent and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why she would win an Oscar in the future, not so polished, but her raw emotions, honesty and some somewhat explicit nude scenes this is worth watching. Nearly. Rent a "fever" (no title will fit in the movie) if your fan of it, or you miss it and you will be grateful that her stars have continued to do better. Note: This is a hard "R" movie for language, violence and nudity.
