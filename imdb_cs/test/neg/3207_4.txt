I haven't seen this movie in years, the last time I was really drunk after 5 pins tenant at my local Witherspoon's, but even then I was pretty terrible. This movie is pretty horrible compared to other animal movies, the first two were pretty good, 3 was pretty crap, but miles better than this. The story takes place 53 years after 3 animals, Charlie the bounty hunter from previous movies was found floating in a pawn in space by a crew of some kind of miner, em, people and aboard. Once the last egg of the animal left in the galaxy Charlie has brought with him from the ground, he has opened a blockbuster and we have creatures aboard a spaceship, head for an obvious "alien" rip and lots of horrible FX and you are far enough to have this movie in a nutshell. The only good thing is when we are reintroduced into UG (or so it leads us to believe), who is now a villain and wants to preserve animals instead of destroying them.
