If I had no expectations from this film, I could have received 5 or 6. How it stands, I give it 3. Behavior is weak, the correctness of the drugs being discussed is lacking. you feel no empathy for the characters. Just before I watched this movie, I watched 'Adam & Paul' and I laughed and wept several times. This movie didn't even make a similar chord. Human Transport Directors may have ecstasy experience outside the workplace, but there are no real drug-related semantic knowledge. In fact, I consider it somewhat offensive and counterproductive that the current drug laws are less politically oriented. Watch "Requiem for a Dream" if what you're looking for is a wonderful, moving movie about drugs.
