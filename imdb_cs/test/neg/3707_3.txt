Bill Rebane's "The Capture of Bigfoot" is one of the worst horrors ever made. The owner of the greedy saw Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy) has decided to capture Bigfoot at all costs. However, local ranger Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learns that Bigfoot lived peacefully disturbed by a geological expedition and sets out to protect the creature. There's nothing interesting about this crap. The film is extremely boring and full of horrible songs and cheap special effects. gore, no tension - just huge boredom. Avoid this terrible waste like plague.
