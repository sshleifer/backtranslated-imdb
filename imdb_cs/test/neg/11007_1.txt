The film interpretation of Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton John Madden does not achieve the justice of a great literary work. While the story is maintained by elements that give the novel its soul are skewers and all in all lost in the film. Madden cannot convey the innocence and overall tragedy of Ethan-Mattie's relationship instead of turning her into a moral story. The mark is missed and the point is lost in added detail and poor dialogue. Zeen (Zenobia) in the book is almost totally an adversary, the book of the least likeable character, where in the film can be almost sad, even if it is a stretch that you so badly like for this sick woman who is being cheated. More specifically, the book describes Zeen's tyrannical control of the house and Ethan. The movie just ticked me. Adding foxes was unnecessary, just like the scene with Mattie trying to kill. It was just misinterpreted and done. Film Faults: Ethan's elusiveness on the dance scene of the church, interaction with Denis Eady, the addition of a love scene, fox scene, a scene in stores, the release of his plans, the lack of demonstrations of Ethan's inner emotions and thoughts, the introduction of a priest instead of a nameless engineer. the growing relationship where the reader never knows what Zeena thinks. Too many shortcomings and bad decisions.
