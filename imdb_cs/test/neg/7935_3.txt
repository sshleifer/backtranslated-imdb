OK, here's the deal. I love action movies and generally I have no problem suspending large amounts of distrust over hole holes or other unlikely actions. However, this film went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to ridiculous. Let me explain. The police sent a notorious gangster and a cop killer (along with a number of other prisoners) to a bus with a total of two guards. Then they are forced to stop at a place where exactly two cops are working, one of whom is a retirement day and the other is a burnout. The building seems to have been closed, so the police have decided that everyone else in the area will get a New Year's night. Right. But wait, it's better. Gabriel Byrne turns out to take Fishburn before he can meet him and other dirty cops. (although we will never find out anything about their relationship or behavior). Interestingly, police officers launching an attack on the precinct are nine yards in full SWAT with night vision goggles, assault rifles. Later they even bring the helicopter with more people in full. I'm not a cop, but I'm sure you can't just roll the whole platoon out of the station without asking what you're doing. A police helicopter ??? In a supposedly terrible winter storm ??? Also, no one near the precinct will happen to hear or see this great siege that happens with flash grenades and a heavy rifle that goes away? I'm serious, come on. I know this is happening in Detroit, but there, too, would be a suspicion of a supposedly secret mission. I also like the fact that the research room will find Tommy Gun and some weapon still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable. <br /> <br /> I could live with some of these problems if they weren't there. Also other glaring problems. For one, a few minutes of the movie are shot pretty in a very frenetic and hyperactive way, and I thought I'd set the tone for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The rest of the film doesn't have a sense of stimulation or tension or drama. "Characters" are not related in any way, which is largely due to the fact that they are not particularly interesting. There is not enough interesting action to make this a good action movie, and there is not enough character development / narration to make it a viable thriller / drama. The "relationship" between Hawke / Fishburn is the only thing the director even tries to do interesting or intense. And by the way, the last scene in the wild? I thought it was in the middle of Detroit's industrial zone and suddenly we're in the woods? Acting is not terrible in this film, it's just that directing and writing are cruel. I really enjoy Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy's movies, but this is terrible.
