Maybe I'm too generous to give this film two and a half stars out of five, but sometimes there was a moment. However, as the "Werewolf American" movie this is a missed chance! There is no real plot conspiracy to the superior original being talked about, but the story is in some ways similar to "London". <br /> <br /> * Spoiler warning possible * American kids go abroad to love a beautiful girl. Another of the children is defeated by a werewolf on the same night when someone is bitten, and despite the warnings of an undead friend, the full moon glows the hair, fangs and claws! But there are some differences in the story, for one; the girl is one of the werewolves. Second; There are three American children. And the third; There is some weird - @ $$ Werewolf iconic intent on taking over the world! It's crazy how it sounds, the last one, it wasn't a joke! * Spoiler Ends * <br /> <br /> Films suffer from many things. Tom Everret Scott's performance is at best amatuerish, and he and Julie Delpy, who play his love interest, don't seem to have some chemistry together at all. Second; Weak script that seems everywhere. This lacks many elements of tension and dark comedy that made the original. And who said that eating from a werewolf wolf that changes you a little, will you turn him back to man? Last I heard it wasn't part of werewolf lore at all! Third; terrible special effects; The werewolf's effects are done using a computer animation that works for things like dinosaurs, ghosts, and spacecraft. But it seems to be choppy, false, and artificial when used for furry creatures like werewolves. However there were a few things that saved this from the total "turkeydom", there is one cheerful scene in a Parisian cafe when Andy (Scott) has coffee with Serafin (Delpy), throws a lot of condoms on the table and try to pass them like chewing gum by chewing and blowing the bubble! Also; soundtrack, a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs has the word "moon" in their title, like the original movie, the soundtrack is great however. And another funny scene, when the rotting corpse played by Julie Bowen tries to whistle and her eyeball jumps out, loudly laughed at me. Overall, however, this film seems to lack the joke and tension of the original. And too much of an ending doesn't help much. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a Half of Five Stars (Average)
