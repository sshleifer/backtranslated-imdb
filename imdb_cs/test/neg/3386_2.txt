He heard some good notes about this film as very bloody and frightening, but it is not so much. Of course, the screenwriter wanted to make a horrifying horror movie, but at the same time imprinted a teenage comedy on young target groups. Spooks and comedies rarely lead to good movies, so does MONSTER MAN. It's not really funny, nor scary or too enjoyable at any other level. Approaching 39 years of age I saw my share of horror movies. I've seen the good and terrible, but the crop of movies released these days is so frighteningly average that I'm bored when I watch them. Receiving these days for bad movies like this really bother me. Let's face it, they made a lot of bullshit in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, but they were also considered such. Today they are considered "good fun". - Bollocks!
