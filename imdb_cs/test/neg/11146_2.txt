this film sucks big. so many holes on the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he need arnies' bodyguards? I couldn't understand why Arnie didn't appear at work for days and then suddenly appeared, taking the entire armory and disappearing again! Nice work if you can get it. Sadly, the last 1/2 hour must result in a standard Arnie 'uzi 9mm' final. Interpreting the depression of Arnies' officers is to bow and sniff. I thought it was a bad winter for most of the movie. Much written, Arnie is called 'mate', 'dude' etc for 95% of the film and then suddenly we hear him be called by his real name Jericho Cane (where they get these names from ??). The end is so twee that you should prepare a bag with a barf. Too bad Gladiator withdrew the same end with a 100% larger class. <br /> <br />
