Three Stooges are probably the greatest comedy team in the history of the film. For this reason, they deserved a much better end in Columbia than they got with this short. <br /> <br /> "Sappy Bullfighters" isn't just good. It's true it's not all Joe Besser's fault. Personally, I feel that some of his shorts are fun, just because of leaving the usual Stooges fanfare they contain, and that Larry is ever more exposed. However, this short just won't do. And the fact that one knows that it is their last short time that has ever been shown, which only contributes to overall disgust. and how little effort went into their production. This short is so sloppy. It's a simple re-make of curly short, "What is Matador?", Filmed years ago. As if this was not bad enough, the studio actually threw Moe and Larry from the original (which was shot almost 20 years before). Aren't these things obvious? Laughter or sad? You're a judge. Another part of this short game, which makes it an unfortunate situation, is that it's basically a show by Joe Besser, with whom he shows that everything that is (at least in this movie) is Curly -Wanna-Be-Away-Totally Wrong! Moe and Larry have little in this short job. As a Larry fan, I also have to say that I feel a bit shameful that Besser used a joke that Larry originally popularized in short "Ants In The Pantry". To see Besser say "I can't see, I can't see!" and Larry says "why don't you see?" while Besser gets into "closed eyes" is wrong at all levels. Two brave soldiers stranded for all these years, Howard and Fine, have something to do in this short time. There are no funny pieces with them. The only thing that qualifies is Larry, who is hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, trying to be his "Pepe" dog. <br /> <br /> The dynamic duo can't be blamed. Larry and Moe gave it all. No matter how ridiculous things might get (and I'm sure they have their views on this point in their careers), Howard and Fine never gave anything less than their best. Their efforts are not pale since 1934-1959. I often like a lot of shorts that some refuse to be horrible. I'm for their "experimental" unusual shorts. At least they contain new ideas. However, this short, I think everyone can agree is just not good. Thank God TV later discovered the boy's shorts closed after separation. If they were forced to go this way, it would be a gross injustice for all the years they invested in making the audience laugh.
