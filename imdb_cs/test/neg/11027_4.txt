Carole Lombard and James Stewart are trying to impress some life and meaning in this bizarre film about the afflictions of a newlywed couple. Scenes play as if they were divided between different directors, each with a different goal. Some are Capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. There's even an extended adventure sequence where the plot suddenly targets a small plane in a blizzard. It's hard to say which scenes are most mismatched when the film as a whole is so devious in tone and the storyline isn't exactly believable. It's just worth watching for film students or actor fans - some smaller parts, such as Judge Doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also very well played.
