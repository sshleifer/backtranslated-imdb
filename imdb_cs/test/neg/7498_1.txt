Hello Everyone - For what's worth, I'm in a doctoral degree program in Indonesian politics and I came back here a semester after about a year's fieldwork, most of it in Jakarta. I'm a big movie fan in general, so I went out as often as I could and bought a ton of local VCDs when I was there. This one I saw in the theater because it opened when I was there and fortunately closed soon after. <br /> <br /> Who was meant for this movie? Spoiled women and daughters of Indonesian superelity, whose partners are weakly and inefficiently parodied? The vast majority of Indonesians who could never afford a single meal, let alone full food, in the central movie restaurant? Or gay Indonesian men whose dilemma in the country of Muslim society is reduced to an absurdly simplistic, as-to-respect, preaching. If it wasn't all bad enough, the soundtrack was either recorded or mixed so much that even native Indonesian speakers didn't hear many lines. In short, if you are looking for a world-class gay-themed movie that seems to be the least likely to produce such an animal, forget it. "Westler" since the early 1980s, or "My Beautiful Laundrette", of the same era, has succeeded much better when contented with homophobia, and showed by not saying constant, terrible scenes. Overall, the unfortunate waste of money in a country that still cannot raise all its children or keep them healthy.
