No wonder so many young people have attention deficit disorder. The theatrical (dance) productions these days seem to be about how many camera and camera director / editor angles can push into a 1 hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this performance? Sometimes try to count on something else that shows up with this, otherwise completely unseen program. I tried to distinguish at least some of the other dancers in production. That wasn't possible. They didn't seem to have any faces, just blurred â€” that was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's bare chest (nice shine!), Michael Flatley's legs, and Flatley's patented shoulder to shoulder, looking like the opposite. to the other. Since he was the executive producer of this work, I think it was to be expected. One does not have to wonder who his target group is. Riverdance was a much better production because it tried to present the show almost as seen by the audience, not the podium, the side wings, or the view of the nails. If I'm not mistaken, I believe Sir Michael retired. Thank God for the little blessings.
