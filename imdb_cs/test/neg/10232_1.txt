I'm the man who has never seen animated movies, but I will make an exception for Thumbelin and Swan Princess. Being totally in love with the first installment of the series, I bought it and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I spent the money. I finished the movie and everything I think is HORROR !!! I wanted to like it, really. I tried it very, very hard. But I couldn't enjoy the other of this exhausting movie. The song made me pull my ears off my head. The dialogue was so weak that every time I opened my mouth, I felt myself trembling with frustration and irritation. The villain was ridiculous, and I felt that at the end I wanted Derek and Odette to die ... and I was absolutely in love with the first movie with them. I will try to suppress the memory of this movie because it almost destroyed the first one for me. There is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film. The difference in animation between the two is very obvious, and I longed for the first and I wish I would never forget the third. time.
