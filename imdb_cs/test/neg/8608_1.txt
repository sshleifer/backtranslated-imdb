... so why do I see 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' on Earth? Answer: Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook. I saw Vegas live and enjoy it. I think he's an intelligent and unique intellectual who can keep extreme oafishness. Crook I know only about the biggest comedy of the last 10 years together with 'Alan Partridge', 'Office'. Just like Gareth, he was just cheerful, and I was wondering how he would convert to another character on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So the guy and I went to the multiplex last night and the movie was very entertaining just because the average nonsense dialogue and joking Ferris and Dave were enthusiastically and enthusiastically delivered by the talent of Vegas and Crook. They're meant for better things (they've done better with infact) and I'm even convinced that Vegas would do a decent direct actor. The trite scene where he says he's missing his wife came almost close to touching, though ** SPOILER ** pinned on the scene at the end where he is taken back by his wife needed to be extended, it just wasn't believable. And in the whole Vegas movie, he seems to miss his wife two or three times. The film became grotesquely unbearable and simple old, well, grotesque when sex was mentioned. No, I will add when it was displayed on the screen. Tolly's unreasonable explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why she wasn't even funny, and just made me feel a little sick. Also, it was completely unpredictable to include Jeremy's character as he picked up his nose before pointing a bogey on his finger. Only when he held his nose, he woke a smile, was it pathetic, and that made him look as low as possible, but to show that the close soton was not needed and was good. One scene I thought was funny was sex in Vegas in Vegas. His block conversation with the second block just emphasized the fact that the three are not always infinite ecstasy. Not that I know ..... <br /> <br /> That's probably all I can really say. I'll quit, and that's actually my main critique of the film. It is to revive the British film industry. It is not "Trainspotting", which is sure ... it is not even "Love Actually" (you would have to have a heart of stone that would not be thrown away at the moment), and Â£ 3 million could actually be a better project. 'Mike Basset England Manager' was an amazing little known British comedy and was produced much less than 3 million. I only hope that the BFC will learn from the "Sex Lives of the Potato Men" and will not get so unreasonable in the future. Although horrible reviews of this film is still just an increase in the box office. :-)
