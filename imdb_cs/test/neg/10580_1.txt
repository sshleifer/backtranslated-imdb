By chance, I rented this movie with my sister in the hope of watching a great funny movie that was funny, but my expectations were disappointed. This film was above the disgusting and rebellious for the PG-13 film, it should be rated R for many mature links that continued this film. I wouldn't recommend allowing a 13-year-old teenager to see it. Although nobody under the age of 17 is watching this movie, watch out for a really stupid movie, there is no humor in the movie, just a lot of disgusting sexual links, including a little pedophilia, something that it shouldn't even be joked. <br /> <br /> I'd like to know what happened to PG-13 movies that were actually safe for 13 years old? This is beyond the pathetic film and should be reconsidered.
