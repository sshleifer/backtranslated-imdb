It's a shame when high-quality actors and actresses engage in pure crap, probably because they have been offered a great deal of money. Not one of Helena Mirren's better career steps. The action of "teen" is just scary, it did not help the scenario, which is partly simply inept. Most of the work of Kevin Williams is above average, but that's really under par. This is the type of movie you watch on TV when there's nothing better about it, and you have a half bottle of wine to drink and wait for pizza to drink. second half.
