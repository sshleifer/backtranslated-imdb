I have to admit that I enjoyed the earlier episodes, but probably because I was younger and stupid at the time. I was excited about the return of a family guy until I saw the "new" bullshit they were publishing. It was no surprise, it was just like an old crap. All the lame jokes were there, including flashes, except that they added a joke about an old haunted pedophile who seems to be in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE. this is just one of the annoying gags the family lives, and for some reason people are still watching. it's no longer funny, just annoying. let it die. Possibly a family guy was funny at the moment, and cheap laughs and gags were original and fresh, but now it's just not funny anymore. If you really find a family guy funny than you need to be retarded or bordered retarded.
