I was told that Jon was on spiritual experience for a while. I guessed the movie would be interesting. It is not so deep for such a subject. "eternity" never ending life. Experience after death and "story". The film is not like comedy, but it is not at all funny, at least not yet expressed. It's so naive. A charming movie, but a naive film. Must be avoided. The sequences of the Middle Ages seem to come directly from the fairy tales and it is not a matter at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight is doing the best. Normal is the producer and screenwriter of this film. The movie was launched right on the video so I found it on the video store. It's a shame because I know that Voight was serious about spirituality and the film isn't so deep.
