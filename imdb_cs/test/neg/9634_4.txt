RIPPER HANDS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> The Edwardian Doctor (Eric Porter) uses the newly created Freudian analysis a young girl (Angharad Rees), who turns out to be Jack Ripper's daughter, and just as deadly ... <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that the hammer's horror in which a respectable company takes care of a beautiful young waif he attracted so much as a whiff of scandal, even if he took all and various things with a number of deadly tools (broken mirrors, pins, etc.) to murder! L.W. Davidson's scenario wanders aimlessly from one murder to another, sacrificing his own subtext (Porter's apparent appeal to Rees) in favor of a commercial melodrama, and the tone remains subdued throughout the world. Some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid, even for Hammer, and they were cropped from the original US release (despite the MPAA R rating), although the complete version is now available on home video. Porter and Rees give excellent performances and a climax in St. Vitus Cathedral. Paul is a clear highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and not threatening. Directed by: Peter Sasdy.
