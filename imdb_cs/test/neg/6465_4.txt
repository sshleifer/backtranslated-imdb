This is definitely a "lesser known" comedy short of the twenties. The only reason I saw it was because it was on DVD from Kino Films representing shorts by Laurel and Hardy with Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but also generally average to below-average in film style. Compared to the shorts of Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely one step below them in quality and humor. Also, backing music was quite poor by standards of other silent DVDs. I ended up turning off the sound because of the unsuitability of the music to set the right mood. But it's still worth seeing. I have to be honest in this short time. That was the last of 8 on this DVD and by the time I got to it, I was pretty bored with an average of 7 out of 8 shorts. So it's possible that the movie may be better than 4 - but certainly if it's the case, not better than 5! The movie is quite standard short about the incompetent bellboy. Nothing particularly interesting and there are certainly much better quiet shorts.
