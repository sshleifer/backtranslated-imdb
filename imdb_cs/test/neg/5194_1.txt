I cannot pretend any knowledge of cinema or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love her people. In July, with my 14-year-old son and I, I went to Turkey to Cappadocia where I was looking for some remains of a neighborhood where his great-grandfather Iordanis lived until the great departure of Anatolian Greeks in 1923. Reading the film (refugees from Odessa) maybe I could learn a little more about the forced migrations of modern Greeks. If I hadn't been home in Rhodes, if I hadn't been to Greece 28 times in so many years, I wasn't familiar with dozens of islands and cities in Greece and if I never liked friendship with those who are alive. maybe I believed that this lament had something to do with modern Greece. As a professor at New Jersey State College, let me assure you that I am familiar with the history of the period covered by the film. My wife's uncle was murdered by the Communists during the communist seizure of power. My mother-in-law had an Italian invasion and a German occupation ... barely. These characters on the screen speak Greek, listen to Greek music, but who are they? No, they're not vaguely Greek. Of course, they are not people at all, but only allegories. This is what an artist devises when life is not entirely appropriate or insufficient to perceive how it was or should have been. All represent any aspect of post WWI of Greece that the larger external forces have sent to fate they did not deserve. As we were joking at the end of the 1970s in America: "The revolution has not happened." It's not a joke for an ideologist / artist. It's actually a reason to get us over two and a half hours of suffering. And it's all because the different forces (Eleni's soliloquy "guards" in different colored uniforms) did not allow the 1919 generation (Spyros) generation to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of Nikos and his fellow musicians, ie movement, cause) . This dark, surrealistic revisionism pampers the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to maintain their desire for life in the 20th century tragedies, to achieve more than any of their Balkan neighbors to become so politically developed and globally integrated.
