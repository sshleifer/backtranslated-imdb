Is there a clich√© of firefighters NOT used in this movie? From the opening line "I'm too old" through "antiquity" firefighters, "terrible woman", the loss of my best friend in the firehouse, to the last funeral for the fallen brothers, this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at Disney ("Our studies show that the audience really likes it when ..." and then it stuck). <br /> <br /> There's nothing original here. Any emotions we feel for these people are brought to our admiration and feelings for firefighters. Go watch Rescue Me if you want to see real heroes: Everyday foolish boys who don't think they get into a burning building to save a stranger.
