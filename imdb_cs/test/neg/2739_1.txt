The usual horrible movie ... I'm not going to bother you about synopsis, just put together The Core, Armageddon, the evil planner Military Officer and one or two Solve-All Nukes and you'll have a movie when I can call like that. Seriously, nuclear weapons in this kind of movies are more useful than Swiss army knives: the Big One is coming? Nuke in some places and is over ... Tornado wants to destroy "Insert important city name"? Nuke "Put another important city here" ... The volcano erupts? Nuke it! Nuketa is coming away? Nuke it! Coffee is cold? Nuke it! Didn't you like Transformers? Nuke yourself, but I can't make sure it solves things ... <br /> <br /> In the end, how many more movies like this can be done before they start copying one another? I doubt there are still a lot of things that can blow up nuke ...
