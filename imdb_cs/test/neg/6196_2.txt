This film has the look and feel of many "Fresh" directors (close-ups and focus on the emotions the actors are experiencing). The film point was presented from many angles and well expressed by relatively inexperienced cast. The point to be "have faith in Jesus Christ and the Morman Church" Oh, and if you read or hear anything contrary to the prophet's teaching, that is just Haterade. (Fuel for Hate)
