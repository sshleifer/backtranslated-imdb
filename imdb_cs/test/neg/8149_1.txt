With the little respect she deserves, I would like to say that this film was terrible. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the direction and value of the production was clearly lacking. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good hard laugh and then loses another two hours of his life, which is a really painful experience. I was surprised to find this movie on a DVD DVD, where it was conveniently located. I thought it would be good and I could find some amazing independent movie - I was wrong. I wish I had never seen this movie. My 3-year-old cousin couldn't make a worse movie. I'm glad I saw the movie because I can finally tell people that I've seen the worst movie ever done and be sure of it.
