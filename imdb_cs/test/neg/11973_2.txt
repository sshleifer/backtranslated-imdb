Wow! Here comes another movie with direct access to the video to make the film masochists happy. If the cheap opening credits don't tell you that you're driving, then diabolically tragic "writing" will surely be. The diabetic boy is tied to the legendary scarecrow. his dedication to the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes on nuts and begins to commit people. Do I need to say more? This film is made up of many cheap effects that make it look like it has been modified with iMovie (note that the creepy color inversion) and the actors who probably weren't good enough to show up on some special Cinemax movie at night. Actually, it's not fair because the actors didn't have enough space to work around the abyss. Parts of this film really look like a parody, especially when one character picks up his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever conceived by people, with the worst lip sync ever played along with it. "Gore" is also very disappointing here. In most B-movies like this, there's a thick layer of cheap Gore FX to cope with what the story and the acting are missing. Here are things so cheap that it's not fun either. This movie actually makes "Jack Frost 2" look like a lot of fun compared. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is "the worst you've ever seen" then you probably haven't gotten deep into the world of B-horror with direct video. Regardless, this movie will cause you a lot of mental anxiety, no matter what your background is.
