Unfortunately, House of D is just horrible, with a ridiculous plot, horrible writing, some mediocre behavior, and in fact just about everything else about it is subpar. Tom flees from New York to somehow survive as a lone child in Paris and manages to convince a beautiful Parisian girl to finally marry a Frenchman, despite a poor understanding of her language. She is shocked to discover her "secret" a few years later! Riiiight! He then "presents" his story about running his son, and who is expected to believe he thinks it's just the biggest birthday gift his father can give to his 13 year old boy. If only such things were so easy! David Duchovny miscasts his own wife Tea Leoni as her mother and strikes once more. Leoni makes me laugh like a comic, but it's just bad for this role. One of the problems with which there is no character is sympathetic. I just didn't give a damn what happened to any of them. I rather hoped that Robin Williams and his "baby in the adult" trademark would fall into the village exchange, but unfortunately it wasn't, and we had to endure his crushing performance all the way. Anton Yelchin and William's daughter Zelda were not bad, but I think the rave reviews of others are giving them just because they were nowhere near as bad as everyone else in this movie. They weren't great, let me say so. There are so many foolish and fanciful aspects to this movie - Erykah Badu, Bicycle, Catholic School and Madonna, comfortably silly characters, etc. - That this review will continue forever, so I'll just say that House D is a very bad movie and I'm almost embarrassed for Duchovny. Things that really annoy me are how I was so strongly encouraged by online "friends" to find out that I have traveled so long to do so. I wouldn't be so upset that this movie is so bad if I lost a couple of hours at a local cinema, but instead I lost all day and found that my so-called "friends" were either stupid or dishonest, because it is a horrible movie!
