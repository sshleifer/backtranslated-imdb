I saw the movie on TV yesterday. I just finished reading the book in which the film was allegedly based. In the introductory titles he said: "This is a free adaptation of Eça de Queirós novel". I should have turned off the TV at that moment. Vera Sacramento's idea of ​​"free adaptation" is a story about the influence of the Church on people and the hypocrisy of people who were morality at the end of the 19th century. into the sex story. The only thing she accepted from the novel was the sexual part, which was only slightly mentioned in Eça de Queirós. And of course, the name of some characters. As figures, in the novel, Amelia and Joao Eduardo were victims of the Church's influence. Amelia was seduced by her father Amaro and all the time she was in control. Her fiancé João Eduardo was expelled by the priest because he dared to criticize. In this film, Amelia seduces everyone she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim. João Eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons. Vera Sacramento changed the novel that criticized the moral costumes of the epoch and turned it into another movie with lots of (bad) sex. Worse still, her story was completely empty of ideas. Two wasted hours! Eça de Queirós certainly does not deserve it.
