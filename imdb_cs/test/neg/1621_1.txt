This movie was so bad that it was funny! For a moment I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie. The "Cliffhanger" scene at the end made me laugh until the guts hurt me. The screenplay was pretty horrible, but in conjunction with the horrible acting of Sean Young - especially when he explains the whole plot in great detail (along with flashbacks) while hanging from a cliff - it's really a classically bad movie worth watching! In fact, the false shots in this scene reminded me of Ed Wood. I still can't believe how it happened. First, how did such a bad scenario get into the green light? How did the actors get? Were they in low places in their careers? Questions, questions.
