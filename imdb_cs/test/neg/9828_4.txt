The rich production values ​​you usually find in the Merchant / Ivory movie are here, but this is an extremely boring look at what could have been a very lively affair. I agree with an earlier poster that there is no point in developing the story through the eyes of an African-American family, and yet their own ancestor, Sally Hemmings, barely plays in control. It is not very clear what could be found in helping the audience understand the motivation of these historical figures. And I was very concerned about the accents of many characters. Nancy Marchand sounded very British for what the French nun assumes. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi have tried different accents in different scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly serviced in this biopsy. Her role as Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, is written in such a way that we never touch who he really is. At one point she slapped the slave, and another moment, she is condemning the entire system of slavery. Nick Nolte performs this job well enough, but he never gives us real care of Jefferson or some of his uses. Overall very disappointing.
