That's just another of those "Americans will find romance with a charming stranger in an exotic European setting." This genre has been bankrupt since the 1950s, but it still spews it. I let my girlfriend see me to see this one - a bad idea, we both hated him. If all you want to see is Tuscany, try watching "Stealing Beauty" with Liv Tyler - a marginally better film. These types of genre films are very congratulations to Hallmark-ish.
