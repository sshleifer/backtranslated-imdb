I like old "monster movies" for the net value of the camp. This one will not disappoint if you find such a thing is fun. Acting is purely a fifties. You get used to it when you saw enough of them ... the dialogue is very stupid and eventually forgotten. You're just there for a giant bird. "Science" in this movie is cheerful. A monstrous alien bird who can manipulate anti-matter ... who intends to cause confusion and eat people ... an alien who has come to Earth to nest. Some of the best scenes in the film (which don't have a bird in them) include "scientists" explaining what's going on. Much has been said about the ridiculous puppet puppet. It looks like a new bird ... bald and ugly with disheveled feathers. He is even like a hungry, angry baby. However, the bird scared the crap out of my three year old who had great scary bird nightmares for the evening. It's a little scary. <br /> <br /> I was very sad from the scene where the egg was shot. (Like an egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) But I'm a bird lover, what can I say?
