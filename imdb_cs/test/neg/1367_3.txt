The "Satanic Brotherhood" is a stunning combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts with Father Charles Bateman (like Ben), who sets off with his beautiful blondes to the west: curious Ahna Capri (like Nicky) and daughter Geri Reischl (as K.T.). Things get into the trio, where they are approaching Hillsboro, which is captivated by Satanic cult! <br /> <br /> When dullish passengers hit Hillsboro, "action" switches to the film's more interesting gathering figures: townies L.Q. Jones (as Pete, Sheriff), Strother Martin (as Doc), Charles Robinson (as Jack, Priest) and Alvy Moore (as Tobey). Their interplay is sometimes fun. Soon all gets very stupid and predictable. Mr. Martin is a stand-out (as you would expect); he considers the possibility of a Satanic cult to be a "cock-and-bull story", but is (of course) their leader. The End of "Come in, Children" is mysterious; unless it was the original name of the movie.
