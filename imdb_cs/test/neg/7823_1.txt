Not only the money we paid for renting or actually going to the cinema. I'm talking about how big manufacturing companies are wasting so much money on things that are really boring and not talking about ridiculous. With the millions they used for a movie like this, because I don't think the actors here would actually work for free or for an insignificant amount. With this money, imagine how many good independent movies you can do, or maybe one good Hollywood movie. It's just rip you, but not everyone, just most teens who are willing to go and see the movie Ashton Kutcher just because they are his fans. I really don't know how a common sense could actually act in such a movie. If you really look at it in the future, the actors have the same quality of this movie. So I think I shouldn't be surprised, actually, I couldn't expect more.
