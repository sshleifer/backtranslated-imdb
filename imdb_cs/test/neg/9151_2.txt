I saw a horrible movie called Sleeping Dictionary. One reviewer at Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) had it right when he wrote, "From A to Zzzzzzzzz." The story is about an English colonial idiot who comes to Malaysia to "civilize savages" to speak and end up falling in love with his sleep vocabulary. Sleeping Dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute who speaks fluent English, that she services English colonialists and teaches her her native language in return for ... but the film never says it clearly, but I can only assume that he will give her money or something. Needless to say, the film focuses much more on the "dormant" part than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. Things get complicated for our young hero when a forbidden love affair is amplified by her culture, the soap opera house, and her own boundless stupidity in every crucial decision she makes throughout the film. So yes, the film has some major drawbacks, but on the other hand, he added exactly two things I rented in the first place: a beautifully photographed exotic place and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman playing a vocabulary for sleeping, Jessica Alba. My friend told me that this crappy movie was her most beautiful and damn good. She is not a great actress and it does not pass for Malaysia, and it is quite obvious that she uses a double body on nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has a rare face and a character that is more than just sexy but also beautiful in a way like Vivaldi's Violin Concerto or Rembrandt's painting. <br /> <br /> (PS Excuse all those who are feminists who discourage the objectification of women, "men's eyes", etc., but I hope you understand that I don't mean any disrespect.
