This is a pitiful film. What makes it even more pitiful is the time, effort and money embedded in a super predictable scenario and action. It's about some kind of monster, by the way, and some sort of insect. Do not expect an explanation of the plot. Is none. That could work if there was something interesting or characters we could care about. It's not. Everything that happens to any person is as predictable as the other Sci Fi Channel movies. Don't try to understand what some characters are saying. They talk crazy, especially annoying leading women whose accent is a fat British who is harder to understand than any old British movie you may have seen. It's incomprehensible. A lot of money is spent on some great files and scenery, and this is the main crime of this movie because it's just not worth it.
