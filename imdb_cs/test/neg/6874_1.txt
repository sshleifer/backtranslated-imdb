this film wasted my time. I saw only a part of it, and I wept about the wasted time I could spend doing something productive and useful to this country. For all those who have watched this film more than once, I blame them for global warming, because the amount of black balloons that got into the earth from this piece of crap was not needed and if they came from another movie, I would forgive them. Robin Williams has lowered his standards to actually take part in more than 10 seconds in this movie and Tim Robbins, as he went from this movie to shawhsank redemption, has no idea. please do not take this film for country security. stop releasing black balloons into the ground from a movie that should never be financed or released. Please burn all copies before someone else has to watch this crap.
