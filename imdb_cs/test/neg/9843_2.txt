Had this film been controlled by a man, he would have been imprisoned. While Adrian Lyne was tied to an editor's lawyer to oversee the evacuation of a classic literary work to calm censors, and to avoid the 1996 Child Protection Act, the woman will be pleased with us and everyone . . I miss a date? In addition to the obvious pedophilia, this film is completely pointless. Didn't this woman enter an active military base? Has she never met a soldier? Whose army is it? Uniforms had to come from Uniforms-R-Us. Just throw some patches who cares? Just make sure each one has a big red. Inside, there is a tiny joke that has undoubtedly gone to the author's head, but perhaps anyone who fitted the military vehicles slipped him. Certainly there were no military advisors. The US Army does not operate slums. Temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner than this. The US Army does not give 14-year-old girls work on military bases, nor does it allow them to use fire or training courses. There is a lot of drama about the teenage girls' age. This film has nothing to do with it.
