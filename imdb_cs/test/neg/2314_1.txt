1 hour and 40 minutes of talking - boring talking and more conversations and then some. It is hard for me to understand how an actress like Anne Parillaud, who shines greatly at Femme Fatale, would sign up for this piece of crap! Incredible. If you need a cap, this movie might help, though I would like some nice classical music. Unfortunately I have just found that I need to write 10 lines for my comment to appear - it is almost as incredible! so short and brief one or two sentences of a sentence that express the core of the film is not enough. people, people. I made my point and waste of time with more useless words - how does this movie do. Wolfgang
