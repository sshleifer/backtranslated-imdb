I was looking forward to it so much that I was a big fan of the book. But when it came out, I remember that it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time I had ever spent in the cinema. Basically, performances, sets and music were excellent, and they are the main reason why I rate it. There is no way she would deliberately lie to Miss Minchina to prevent her from punishing other girls; in the book she tries to describe lies as "not only evil but also vulgar". There is too much Disney's end for me, too; Sarah's father returns from the dead and everyone plunges into the Indian sunset. While the book is happy (and critics might say equally improbable) ending, it doesn't leave you thinking, "Oh puh-leeze." What is true in the book: 1. Sarah's father is a soldier 2. Lines between Sarah and her father ("Do you teach me with your heart?" / "No "I know you with my heart. You are inside my heart." That part was brilliantly done. 5. Core Core - A rich girl who suddenly finds herself in poverty - is there, but that's it. Maybe. All I can say is two cousins, 7 and 12 years old, who were big fans of the movie until they read the book. <br /> <br /> If you want everything you need is a "good feeling" movie, then it brings. If you're looking for a movie that actually tells the story of a little princess (in fact, if you read the book) don't waste your time with this. This is such a shame; with such a cast, if they kept at least a basic story, it would be fantastic. I'm about reading this book and reading that book too much? Very likely. But if someone tries to adapt the book - especially the classics - to the film, they should at least do the same. Preferably more than once.
