This year 1950 is so bad that it is unintentionally funny. Tom Conway shows Dr. Gerard, a scientist who turns natives into a monster using voodoo. His poor wife, Mary Ellen Kay, holds a husband who has no time for her, but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. Together, Marla comes as a greedy murder that has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle. Her idiotic friend, portrayed by Lance Fuller, is on safari. They hire "Touch" Connors, (later renamed Mike Connors, Mannix of Fame) as a guide. English is a horrible actress, but hey, no one else in the cast has turned up even in academic award-winning performances. "Touch" (sorry, I can't even write a name without recovering, I think, what ...) gave a half of a decent performance to a bunch and it says a lot. The monster can only be seen briefly and the end is at least predictable. I would say that this film falls into the category of films "it's so bad, it's almost good". It's good on a rainy night when there's nothing else on the tube.
