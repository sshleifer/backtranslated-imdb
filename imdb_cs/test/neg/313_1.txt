I can't believe I even rented NetFlix unnecessarily on this complete CRAP. How long did it take to make this movie? 15 minutes? In the budget of what? Fifteen dollars? I can spend a few hours with my Sony camcorder and come up with something better than this treacherous bile, and it's even available on DVD! The very sad thing about thinking about classics as stepfather was not released on DVD, but this piece of smoking manure does it. I hope that my ONE ONE ONE ONE rating is 2.5 in total.
