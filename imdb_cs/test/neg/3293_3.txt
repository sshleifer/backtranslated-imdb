This exhibition went mad. It's against everything a family should be, even if it's a comedy. The show is supposed to follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) as they pick up their three teenagers: Hilary, Larry, and Mike. Good background for comedy, but that doesn't mean it's a good show. I don't think I ever heard more glaring talking from parents to children and vice versa. The only thing that seems to be on the show is to control children with parents and sex. I know that sexual intercourse is usually the subject that teenagers often talk about, but is raised in almost every episode that has no meaning. One episode I was watching was about parents who gave their daughter, Hilary, a car, not once you think they're kind of related to how they talk to each other and how parents talk about how Hilary is "their slave" . " "The show fails at the most comedy level. At this show, I wasn't allowed once in many times when I tried to watch, and I'm the guy who gave such movies as The Animal House and Dumb and Dumber very Michael Rapaport is a very good actor and why he decided to destroy his career by making this piece of the show's dirt behind me. <br /> <br /> Parents make sure your kids never and I think it never Teenagers, you will probably laugh at it for blatant sex links, but none of this will work out and then you will feel rather empty. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2/5 stars.
