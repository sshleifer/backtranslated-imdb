I really am desperate for women to discuss this program joke, as if it was intellectually committed and supporting women's liberation and independence. This show is the biggest insult to women alongside all those libidinous hip-hop videos. If talking as a bunch of unscrupulous teenage boys over $ 100 lunches in elegant restaurants, recklessly shopping for useless fashion and jumping into bed with the closest man in place is considered to be empowering, the fate of Western women can be doomed as we speak. > <br /> In addition to the damage it causes to the female sex, sex and the city is NOT FUN. Not once was it funny, captivating, exciting or original. The episodes play monotonously. Each character is made in factory-made dummies that behave in the same way in every episode. Not once did these shallow, unattractive women evolve. Perhaps the worst is the lead character, Carrie Bradshaw. Apart from looking disgusting, her passion for analyzing relationships is worthy. In addition, the show portrays a man as a bunch of empty beasts who are unable to commit to healthy relationships. Even though he is a decent man, he is somehow painted as a villain. The total lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some "progressive" pseudo feminist. The saddest part of the show is that these women live unhappy miserable lives. Any intelligent woman would never envy them. It is a banal show with even more banal characters. NYC must hate the way these garbage appears in an otherwise beautiful city! Fortunately, this train wreck is over! Desperate Housewives are considered a replacement for SATC. While DH can be quite far-attracted, at least it explores women in more multi-faceted ways. Plus, he treats men with respect and it's really fun!
