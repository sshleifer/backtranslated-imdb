Dr. Krellman wants to save his son Julia, who dies of heart disease. He decides that a heart transplant with an ape will cure his son (not - I'm not kidding). He makes a transplant and (somehow) his son changes from a fragile guy to a muscle bound man with a dime mask that resembles an ape! She naturally gets out, kills men, tears women's clothes, and triggers a trigger. All this is interrupted by the boring novel of the police I had. Arturo Martinez and Lady Wrestler Lucy Ossorio. We also get meaningless female wrestling sequences that do nothing to plot. All this ends by copying the end of "King Kong"! This is (of course) quite a silly movie. The story makes little sense, there is a gratuitous female nudity (the core of any film exploitation) and a VERY graphic hole that looks ridiculously false (except for an open heart transplant). It still has merit. The entire cast takes everything dead seriously and is not really as bad as the actors. Also dubbed in the dialogue was (for such a movie) excellent and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing. I also saw excellent DVD printing with a bright strong color (which helps). We're not talking about classics, but about exploitation.
