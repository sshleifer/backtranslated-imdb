The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and her two strange servants arriving in New Orleans from Paris. Her mother had been involved in a scandal years ago, and Ingrid returned in an effort to irritate whoever had forgotten that she or her mother had existed. That's because the reasons why they're shocked enough will pay her to get rid of her. Then, with this money, he leaves New Orleans and searches for a millionaire elsewhere as he represents as a countess. Along the way, Gary Cooper appears and looks completely out of place as a love interest. It's amazing that this film wasn't the reason why Ingrid Bergman's film career collapsed - her performance and character were so bad! Instead of an elegant and mysterious woman she usually played in movies, she is probably one of the most annoying characters in the film. Her fake Contessa was shallow, demanding, unpredictable, and stupidly stupid. How she was able to deny ANY man looked like a mystery, as it seemed less vampire than just plain nuts! I was not exaggerating to say that she sometimes behaved like someone with a combination of severe mental illness and personality disorder, and all this together I think "who would fall in love with this mess?!". Honestly, I couldn't look at her history and narcissistic behavior and looked more like a guest at "The Jerry Springer Show" than at the front lady! Confusing, terrible and overworked are the words that come to mind when I think of her role. The rest of the cast, frankly, is overwhelmed by Bergman's ranting and hysterics. While Gary Cooper is generally an excellent leader, he controls it and just looks lost. And strangely, they cast two total wonders as her entourage - Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Mrs. Robson is best known for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I, but here, for some special reason, she was dressed in makeup and the end result looked similar to a love child in the Indian cigar shop and Aeta Jemima! Her face was very wooden, she admired a strange eyebrow and dressed like a slave. As for Mr. Austin, he was a dwarf, and although he should not oppose it, his role was written as a jester - a very, very ungrateful role for someone who is "vertically challenged"! Overall, this rotten acting, writing and flaccid direction makes this one of the great stinkers of this age - almost as absurd and boring as the famous turkeys like PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.
