Sometimes things should not be done. And even though the setting seemed to be good enough, it only goes on that the audience exhales in horror. But the problem is, it's not another movie. It's so bad that you wish to receive a sentence from Jason Voorhees. I've lost track of how many sports movies and spoofs are included in the movie. And in general, he succeeded in his experiments. True, telling your team that they should fail every subject that would be a real player was initially a bit funny, but it became tedious to watch. This and the joke about "Radio" and "IPod". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't stand to watch this movie again. Even Trantasia is worth more. "D-"
