[Warning contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I didn't feel any sympathy for any of the characters, including the main one that gets over the death of her girlfriend v.quickly, (but it's okay to hide with an ex prostitute) from the casino in which he works). The main character is portrayed as this stunning intelligent writer who draws into a network of fraud while his book monologue runs. I can't say I'd buy a book, a much better assumption would be if voice-over (which unpleasantly cuts to tell any piece of film you might not have known through his book) would have 52 different personailties ... to represent each card in the package, but I turn. Finally, there was a twist when the main character was set by someone close to him, but as I did not like his character at this point (I found it impossible to have someone similar in this movie, the characters are one dimensional) Zombies) That I really didn't care about, and was glad the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Plus points: English actress from the ER doing lengthy South African accent Minus points: irritating movie
