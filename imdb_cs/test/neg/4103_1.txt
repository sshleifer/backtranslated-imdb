My friend recommended this movie me.Is should know that to watch it because my friend is a kind of nerd video game. But the name and the cover looked good for some reason. I was so bad. I mean, what's with their suits first? And acting! Looks like they got people from Barney. Except Ben Kingsley. And why was he even in this movie? He thought it was a comedy! But I have to say that the special effects were pretty good. But that was the only good thing. Seriously, the movie is worse than Pearl Harbor. And that is actually underestimation. Everyone had to think "oh, I'm getting paid, so it doesn't matter if it's the worst movie in the world." I would like to understand why someone would do this kind of film if they were to manage, act, produce, write, and make their hopeless life the best friend to shoot and edit. Probably one of the worst sci-fi movies ever. One really raised movie
