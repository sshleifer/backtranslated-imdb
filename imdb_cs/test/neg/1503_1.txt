I like low budget movies. Including those who are deliberately or deliberately funny, excess false gore, violence, etc. <br /> <br /> But this is stupid. As soon as you see the end, you will say what the hell was in place of all the killing scenes with no one else (except couples) witnessing. THE WHOLE story away for those stupid enough to really watch it) Grandma is like a spiritual Jason. First off the body window and 15 seconds later in the living room. The whole thing is setting for a novice. They pull out scenes with graphical killing, knitting needles in the eyes that only Chris Angel Mind Freak could download. Again, the end was Pre-posterous. 56 min waste of time. I saw one of the directors of other films and it was almost as bad. Give me 20 thousand and I could do better. This really deserves a big fat 0.
