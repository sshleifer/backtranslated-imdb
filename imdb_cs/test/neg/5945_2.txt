My father insisted that I watch this movie with him and regret that I wasted my time watching - I want it to be an hour and a half back! The "funny" little film concerns the elderly Don Ameche, who stayed with his son Tom Selleck. It turns out that Ameche is not just "forgetful" as he was told, but has dementia (it seems to be a lot like Alzheimer's disease). And because Daddy is so often "for lunch", he gets into so many problems over and over again - almost like an adorable BABY'S DAY OUT. But the problem is that you know that BABY'S DAY OUT is a fantasy and the child will be fine. In addition, you must not laugh at a child for having a deformity or illness. But in this case you are encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind - and where is the humor?! If this movie was more successful, the producers would then make movies that would have fun, or people with cerebral palsy or with meat food?!?! There are a lot of people who should be ashamed of having done this movie.
