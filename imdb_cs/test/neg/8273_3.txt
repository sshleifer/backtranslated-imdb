I couldn't help but laugh at seeing what the public might think was an email in 1996. Email seems to be an interactive chat-like discussion with lame voice synthesis reading every comment aloud. And some of the other "tech" aspects are also ridiculously laughing. I swear, the "high-tech" communications center actually has several Commodore 64 monitors in it. Almost like watching a movie Hackers nowadays, I think. Despite the fact that for the majority of the film the main actress is illusioned that she is forbidden, the last part of the film has an inexplicable use of a foot that I can't ignore somehow. So why something so stupid? Anyway, to sum up: the plot is quite predictable, it is wrong, the killer is quite quarreling. But it can be fun at Mystery Science Theater 3000.
