I can admit it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And that doesn't say a little, because I think I'm somewhat enthusiastic about lousy movies. But that's bad. This film is so terrible that there's no fun in it, it's just bad. This is almost impossible. There are no strengths and nothing positive. I'm just going to be crazy about a few points I sucked in. First, CGI must be one of the worst things I've seen. I can't believe this movie was made in 2005, CGI reminds me of something I may have seen in Babylon five times back when CGI was new and fresh. It's wrong outside the faith. Second, the actors seem to be among the worst types of daily soaps. And when I look at their biographies, I see that I'm fine ... Thirdly, being able to breed huge reptiles doesn't match the other technology they invented in this film: an incessant pistol with endless ammunition! Seriously, Michael Par√© shoots 100-200 times without reloading in any other scene ... As if it wasn't enough, there are also planes shifting the shape! Initially it is a regular F-16 fighter, in the next scene there is something completely different and in the third scene are again F-16! If you're buying footage, don't mix it like that! Frankly, there are a lot of things I say, but I think I'll stop by. You all understand what I'm saying. I honestly didn't think this kind of movie was made. It's like Ed Wood. Absolutely ignorant of quality, he doesn't care what everything looks like ... It's almost amazing in all it's terrible. If I could give it 0/10 I would, but 1/10 is the lowest grade. That's it.
