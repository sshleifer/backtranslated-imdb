Although many fans of Billie Dove are pleased with her work, I have to go through it. As a socially prominent member of the British intelligent set, her British accent is basically non-existent and her line reading sounds just as good, line reading and her emotions seem ecstatic and cumbersome. Basil Rathbone, usually a great actor, seems to be everywhere outside and also talks with a strange type of accent - in his case, something like Italian, though we can't be sure. The scenario can keep your exact ethnicity a secret. He is further hampered by a scenario that gives him one of those old film ailments, something to do with nerves that require surgery. The only real fun is provided by the renowned Kay Francis, who paints a variegated bob with side curls in his role as a spoiled countess who blatantly engulfs men, including Rathbone, and then spits them out. It pulls it away with its unique aplomb. It's the only living thing in this dead movie sea.
