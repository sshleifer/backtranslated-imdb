About twenty years ago, Charles Bukowski was my hero. I blindly accepted an image that was created by intellectual types and seen in various films. Of course, I never met the intellectual types that prescribed Bukowski as a hero. They usually could be found safely behind the counter at lumbar video stores and record stores. These people barely spoke, and when they asked the question, they usually grinned and nodded in some vague direction. They were useless when a specific name appeared, but their shelves were always stocked with special and unique titles. To be introduced to a secret lumbar club, I believed I had to throw my bourgeois up-bring and push the anti-culture. played by Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. At that time I was a fan of Rourke. He also embodied a sort of modern male fantastic anti-hero, tense intellectual type. I liked it at the time. Barfly's hero taunted the convention. Mid-class hiker 30 who lives without ties, no one's answer, - Oh - and be recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob, topping on the cake. Then I read Post-Office and Hollywood, the later Bukowski took over his film experience. Now, let me move on to the latest film based on Bukowski's book Factotum, which I read and enjoyed. Bukowski has the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended up and Chinaski started. 20 years after Barfly, the fictional film Bukowski is still the same. I watched the movie for about an hour and I don't see any signs of cracking the facade. Here's why my hero was Factotum Bukowski. Chinaski is nice (played by Matt Dillon). It has clean, elegant hair, stylized but not over the top. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks good. Chinaski goes from work to work, ignores and / or fights with various bosses. Screws two floozies, one of which lives with, leaves just to return with little impact. Chinaski is his own man and we never see him. It's a sterile, one-dimensional, 30 something James Dean's archetype. Factotum lies on the viewer. He does so by inventing the idea of ​​a man (writer) without consequences. Poor guy who suffers for his art. What could be cooler than that? Let's say Factotum has some truths, because the events happened. Viewers lack the pain that protects Chinaski's existence. Perhaps the purpose of this film, and most of the films, is that for 80 minutes, we must escape a world that is filled with aftermath and pain, and a takeover mediated with an antisocial fellow who smokes, speaks, drinks with separate chill. The one who rejects the conventional behavior of work and family. My hero used to be Bukowski. It would have worked long ago. Then it was easier. Now I didn't require a hero. Things aren't that easy. Lumbar logic and cinematic portrayal of counterculture icons offer no solution or even ask.
