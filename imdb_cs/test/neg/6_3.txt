Heavy Sales: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical dramatic drama to a loud, screaming film about World War II Shakespeare theater groups saddled with an old, exuberant, brilliant but unreliable star at the end of his tether. Effect assistant actor works hard to make his master coiffed and costumed for making "King Lear" (during a raid!), But both men are losing grip on their crumbling situation. Based on the dwindling years of Donald Wolfit, whose dresser was Ronald Harwood, this acclaimed production seems to be a welcome haven for chewing gum. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this moment in his career, not at all older) seems too robust and fast to play actors; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) can't modulate Sir's moods and seizures in a way that makes sense to us, so in one scene, a train with a commanding echo of his voice stops, and the next one is curiously falling apart. With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and talent, one would assume that a devoted assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss (and his future), yet servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney, who would carry rather than rest . Courtenay, who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar next to Finney for Best Actor), is much more attuned to his role, and eventually his blessing commands and confusion achieve a single real feeling in the film. These two, fortunately, do not follow each other's heads, and screenwriter Harwood is careful not to fall into the pattern of love and hatred (which could be seen first in the film); but without being a servant versus a celebrity, there is nothing in this portrait that can be seen, apart from the deterioration of narcissism, the hint of what once was. * 1/2 from ****
