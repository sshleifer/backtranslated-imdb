This film was a desperate attempt to restore decisive time in English history. The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the war is marginally accurate, but the overall historical accuracy of this film was a journey away. This film suggests that the war was over religious differences, but civil war was by no means Catholic versus Protestant: both sides were Protestant. Cromwell was never present at the Battle of Edgehill, never "saved the day". The royal winners did not win, the battle ended in a draw. As another reviewer noted, Cromwell was definitely not one of the "five members" who were to be taken out of the house and arrested. Overall, this movie was decent. The producers tried the WAY hard and didn't show it so well. <br /> <br /> could definitely be better.
