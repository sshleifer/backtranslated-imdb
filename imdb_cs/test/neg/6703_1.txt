Hey guys, this is my first review and I would have to choose the worst movie to review. As I watched for 5 minutes, but believe me, you saw that this movie is not going anywhere. Behavior was pitiful, camera work and lighting seemed to be shot and packaged in a 10 year old package. No offense for 10 years. Just I couldn't take anymore I got out of the sofa, took the Adam house DVD from the DVD player and threw it in the garbage. Maybe if you are a Colin Farrell fan this movie may interest you because the character in the movie, Anthony, is Colin Farrell looking alike. But it is as far as it goes, but it will never have acting skills. I gave this movie a rating of 1 (terrible) just because there were no minuses in the health drop-down list.
