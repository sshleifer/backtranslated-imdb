Poor. Talk about false. AFTER THE LAST ADVANTAGE POSEIDON is bad in every respect. Salvagers Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to pull the wreckage of the ocean-going liner of the same name with a really creaking tug. They are questioned by ruthless Tella Savalas and his gang of machine guns arguing. This part of the sequel, part of the remake has Caine, Malden and ANOTHER a group of Poseidon survivors who similarly dangerous trek from a sinking ship. This group includes Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Sure, you'll want to be blind after you've seen this mess. Sally Field is especially annoying as a passenger aboard a Caine's boat. Disaster Master Irwin Allen not only made this one, but also decided to drive it.
