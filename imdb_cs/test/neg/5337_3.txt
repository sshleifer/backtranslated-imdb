Well, one of these Japanese movie ghost girls attacks ... I don't even remember how much I saw. maybe he sells it ... but not me. it's not scary at all. Japanese horror movies are very similar from the first one, and also pulling the kid. I saw what dragged under the scene so many times in many horror movies. the cell phone scene is also nothing new ... the drama of the guy who is hit by the train a little sucked ... I think he lacked all the drama ... OK this is for kids 14-16 who listen to Japanese rock and think they're so unique ... let me tell you. there is one million = D it is one of them. 3/10 I've seen worse, but you won't miss anything by seeing it!
