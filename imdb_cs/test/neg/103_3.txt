too bad this movie is not. While the "Nemesis Game" is slightly amusing, I found it hard to suspend my distrust of the entire length of the movie, especially the situation Sara was putting into. We should believe that: <br /> 1) This hot chick will move unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night, just to solve some puzzles? 2) The protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun, but they do not put together a riddle "I never sinned" until the very end ... and then ... and then .. . get it ... she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together? I know it was the creator's device to show the audience what's going on, but does he really think we're so stupid? 3) When Vern and Sara go to Chez M to ask for a blonde. There is no one chick in the whole building. Nada. Come on. I know it's Canada, but I'd expect more from the country that gave us Shannon Tweed. And anyone else will notice that when Vern surfed the web and found that the riddlezone site that when immersed above the link cursor remained an arrow, and did not turn into a small hand (as all curators do when click on hyperlink?!?? I mean, if you have such a prominent role in your movie, you should at least have the right things. Oh, God.
