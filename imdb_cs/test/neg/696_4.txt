If you want to watch movies because they are beautiful, you should be fine. If you want to watch movies that start with a good guy who tries to catch an evil guy, then reveal the tracks to the motives of everyone throughout the movie, skip it. At the end of the movie, I still didn't know why Stargher killed the women he did. When you set up such a ritual serial killer, it would be nice to know where the rituals came from. Dreams was like a nice movie with a serial killer who wasn't the best, but at least what killed the girls was explained. They also indicated on the dark background for the character of Vaughn, but they did not explain, in fact, did not say why Lopez's child psychologist was much more suited to this task than the rest of the people they interviewed. Regarding the problem of a small child, etc. If the rest of the story is persuasive, I don't care about details like how Stargher provided all the luxury electronic equipment and underground chambers, or why the FBI didn't check whether he owned some other property or had access to places Out of the way while they were waiting to see if the whole entry into the mind of the killer thing will work, but I'm glad I feel what motivates the serial killer in the serial killer movie as he kills the way.
