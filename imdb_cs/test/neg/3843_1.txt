Actually, I joined this site to write about this movie. I sat in the living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I did it about an hour before I had enough. Curious to see what the general public, which the film noticed, thought of this film, I looked at it. I was absolutely shocked to find that there was a huge number of people who thought it was great. I needed to say, and here it is: This movie is an absolute waste. It was a chore to sit down. "Jokes" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this unpleasant character should only appeal to the age of ten and below. In fact, it may be the section. I'm just for the grotesque ridicule, but not even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, allows you to take bad uninspired clear jokes and play them at twice the speed. That's funny. Ha. Ha. Movies you should see that take stupid humor and add comic timing and originality: Marx's Brothers Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, ... and the list goes on. Don't waste an hour and a half of your life on nonsense stupidity. By the way, I can only assume that the reason David Bar Katz (second writer) did VERY little after the movie this movie is because he was immediately blacklisted. I am actually impressed by the fact that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.
