What bloody inconvenience! You can't get to those items with TV budgets and some smartass directors who can't tell the difference between Lanc I, II and III. All the stupid clich√©s are in place; On character and human level, the story is so modest and incredible that it hurts. And all responsible people will be delighted to get rid of the joy of excellence. Technical Data: Garbage. The flying lancs that would approach would be dug out of heaven by a dozen. One-engine night fighters attacking in the back rear: ridiculous. As I said: made up of the director I bet, he never heard the name Lancaster before this project and a few 3D guys who turned to Lancs for bug ducks. But these are minor things to the overall average of this movie. Although it may be too cruel, I would say that it hurts the memory of those who have died on both sides. TV crap, fun stupid masses that don't care as well. Shame on those who are responsible. Use your brain next time. And enjoy the profits you've made.
