Imagine watching a slide show where the projector on each slide takes a long time to remember three times. Imagine that the pictures in the presentation consist entirely of secular scenes? small park; and an empty tennis court; piano. Now imagine that the people who use the presentation have a frustrating slow, semi-cloudy conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the images they show. Skvělý ?? You introduced the whole film "India Song". The film is an agonist-slow image of images that scream little, "Look at me!" Jsem PROFOUND !! with such an outrageous self-assurance that the images themselves and the film as a whole are not made mere horrors, but comfortably deprived of the depths. Visuals could easily be replaced by a number of still images, as described above, because it is so rare that there are really people on the screen, and even though they are, people are actually moving only slightly more often than furniture. They never speak or influence in any meaningful way? they just stand there and look at each other and sometimes weep. The most dynamic moment of the entire first hour of the film is when three people walk in the parking lot in slow motion. In fact, visuals could be easily omitted altogether, as the story is told entirely through narration. The story is about a woman who hates India because she is hot and hates people hating India because she is hot (this point is covered several times). It is also about a person who feels that he is entitled to sleep with the aforementioned woman because he will sleep with anyone who asks her but does not sleep with her simply because she never asks and is very upset about it. So she looks at her tears running deeply down her face. Later he looks at his bike, because a tear is running down his face. In fact, when you look at your bike, you can't see one tear that touches his face deeply, but you know it's just the same, just because it's the kind of movie. best, narration becomes background noise, serving as a perfect compliment to the coma's visual effects. Simply keeping consciousness through this whole film would require the ultimate act of determination. Watching him and actually leaving with a serious and meaningful idea of ​​what to do would cause the same kind of migraine as trying to read lengthy technical documents in the dark. This film is perhaps the greatest monument of pseudo-artistic prejudice that one will ever know.
