If the fiction and get shorty didn't exist, it could be OK movie. When I say that I think nothing of this movie is its own, if it's another piece of horrible dialogue or clich√© full of scenes. before I have to, if the short short seems to appear in this garbage sequel, all portraits like Steven Tyler behave terribly and are not needed and as for Christina Milian, man, don't get me Some of the best actors and actresses such as John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem to be trying to be with children and hips and almost destroy the reputation of this film and frankly I think the best performances are from The Rock who plays next to one of my smallest Actors, Vince Vaughn. The man tries to be funny with him when he marries mickey out of how the rappers seem to talk. Cedric entertainer and Andre 3000 play other horrible double acts (I personally think the background actors were better than Cedric and nd Andre) and the only one the funny part of playing Cedric, Andre and the rest of the gang is how there are pants down there on your knees, so there you can clearly see the boxers and the only reason I find it funny is that the games are actually doing it. trying to be witty and unhappily failing, having no new material, comedy or cold, because it copies every other film and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is that it is a brilliant predecessor of Get shorty.Oh yes, I forgot to mention that there is a big cliche at the end.
