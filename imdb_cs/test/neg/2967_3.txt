There were very few good moments in this movie. Only a few characters were added and not so good. There were enough big holes to get through the truck. The pace crawled like an old man. There were many moments that the movie never returned as Coco stripping. What happened to her? How's it with Garcia's sister? Is it better now? What about Leroy? We didn't know anything about him. What about the electronic piano? What about a rich girl who has an abortion? What happened to her? That was an interesting subplot. Overall, it's not a good movie and I recommend another musical that was in this movie. COMPLETE TIME WARRANTY !!!!!!!
