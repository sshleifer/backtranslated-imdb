It's strange what fate does to some people. Looking at the discount tray at the DVD dealer, I came across a copy of the deadly instincts. Being a collector of any movie that is either science fiction, horror or featuring extraterrestrial monsters, I decided to buy (no matter what it cost five dollars? Bargaining, believe me). After reviewing, I came to the conclusion that it was nothing special. But after I did some research on the internet, I found that the film was actually called Breeders & was a remake of the horror movie Tim Kincaid, which threatened video stores in the mid 1980s. Which I have seen. My recognition for "Deadly Instincts" grew after this discovery. Meteorite falls to the lawn next to a private girl's dormitory. The only teacher there, Ashley (played by Todd Jensen? That's right, the one who turns into a cyborg in the cult film CYBORG COP four years earlier), notices that some students are beginning to disappear while they meet the black -haired woman with scarred & wearing grungy leather clothes. His investigation revealed that the alien creature mounted a meteor and came to Earth to act with the help of local women. Along with a local detective who believes he's responsible for disappearance, Ashley tries to stop the monster. Original breeders, director Tim Kincaid (who would leave the genre to make gay porn), was a science fiction / horror movie that was actually a slim-veiled soft-core porn movie designed so to make the skin flick on genre fans. It is, in my opinion, one of the worst films made in the 1980s. Why would someone want to remake this is quite a mystery. <br /> <br /> This remake is actually a better effort than its low-source source. Taking the basic concept of extraterrestrial monsters trying to intertwine with human women, the film removes any pornographic elements. The film is actually very tame. There are no sex scenes, no nudity (even during the shower scene), curses and violence are kept to a minimum & there is no gore (who can cheat gorehounds). This makes the remake of a movie safe for the whole family, that is if the kids are not frightened by the alien monsters (which brings me to the movie M 15+ ratings, which seems a bit much). The Tame of Things Aside, The Movie Has Errors. The script, while containing some good features, has a series of holes so large that you can crash a meteor through. <br /> <br /> What? Are you mad at me? Come on, this review needed a bad pun, so it remains interesting. <br /> <br /> By the way, movie setup is one problem that the script couldn't fix? the movie takes place in Boston, but the buildings don't seem to belong to Boston. Something about architecture is wrong. Another thing is college itself, with a fairly large building housing about twenty students (all women, of course) & just with one class? art. The only teacher there has a relationship with the student (& does the janitor!), Who somehow escapes the director's attention. Not to mention the police who are so one-dimensional (and stupid) that the real Boston PD would have a good case if they ever decided to sue. A meteor? the chance that a meteor that is transmitted from Saturn (initial credit control) reaches Earth without power, is astronomical. This does not include the chance that every meteor traveler will survive the landing. As for acting, Todd Jensen gives reliable performance as a heroic teacher, while late Kadamba Simmons (who was murdered by her friend shortly before the movie came out) cuts a remarkable figure in this leather outfit, as well as proving that he can act. The visual effects are run-of-the-mill, with credits due to the filmmakers for giving us a cool-looking monster.
