My friend, who is even more in cult films of the 1970s than I, recommended it to me and in fact gave me a copy that I watched. However, I wasn't as excited about the result as he was? Or, for that matter, Michael Elliott? it was. The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and Texas Joke SAW MASSACRE (1974): I really want to say that it served as the basis for a former 2005 remake that was much more than the "original". ! So we have a remote and abandoned wax museum of incredibly live mannequins (guess why it is?) With his seemingly harmless curator (hammy Chuck Connors), who was "attacked" by a mandatory group of stranded teenagers (among them Tanya Roberts). Does he also have a mad brother? shades PSYCHO (1960) incorporated for good peace, up to the same-twist? who is to be a mechanical genius (shown in 'poltergeist' which positively accompanies the first murder). The film benefits from Pino Donaggio's score, but since it is so derivated and not very well done to the shoe, it basically ends only with redundant (and rather confused) genre efforts.
