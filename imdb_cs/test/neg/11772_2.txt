It's not often I give two stars of horror because horror is my favorite genre. The film can be a BAD in that it is not a masterpiece, but it can be fun based on unintentional humor, bizarre characters, etc. The case is a large number of horror / fiction films from the 1940s to the 1980s. . They are fun for genres-enthusiasts and guilt-seekers, because their "badness" is fun. However, this film has no humor or effective bloody scenes of the "Piranha" of the original. I suppose that in 1995 it was a boom of political correctness, so gore on television was minimal. Now in mid-2000 with C.S.I. shows, TV is absolute blood! (Good for us horror fans!) William Katt and Alexandra Paul are not Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (originally 1978 stars.) It's not Katt's and Paul's fault, but writers and directors who made this lukewarm movie turkey. As the main characters interact, this film is a major mistake. I will not say how this is part of the conspiracy. This TV movie probably had a larger budget than the original, but it fell as a good horror movie, as seen from the user voices here. Stick to the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer-fish movie!
