Good. I really tried to slip into the (so-called) silly and surrealistic humor that this film is supposed to be. I was told that the Japanese version of this movie is much shorter than the one that was shipped to America (A) and has fewer political links. Besides, I found this sexual / political farce as boring and pointless as standard porn. Central female leadership is easy to see and could actually work. I'd like to see her in a non-pink film where she could really bend her acting muscles (and not, not the ones you're thinking). Obviously, Japan can (and does) produce as much crap as other countries. I couldn't recommend it to anyone, with the remote possibility of someone who has Jones for Asian porn. Go see a real Japanese movie.
