This film seriously questions me again whether Armando de Ossorio was a good filmmaker or not ... His BLIND DEAD films are praised by many fans. I understand. But a lusty Gothic vampire trick like Malenka does not show any signs from a talented filmmaker. And this also applies to SERPIENTE DE MAR. This is a horrible gameplay, a stupid storyline, stupid events, a lot of other things you can expect from a bad monster movie and also veteran actor Ray Milland, who is trying to murmur his way through this movie without much thought of what's in it does. It seems that Milland was already very bad at filming SERPIENTE DE MAR (his last theatrical role) and was so laughing that it was all the more sad. One last performance alongside Peter Cushing in the film of director Roy Ward Baker (also in 1984) does not change much. But the sock puppet / sea snake is a hoof. Watch the beacon whirl and crush it. See how to destroy a miniature boat harbor. See how to demolish bridges and torture on charming miniature trains. Good Badness? Yes. 3/10 and 7/10
