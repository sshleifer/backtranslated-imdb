Girls might be nicer if you are their accompaniment or observer! +. What I am saying is that it will take special circumstances for non-whince responses to this effort. Delivering many lines seems uncomfortable to some actors unnatural. Lighting also seems to be a problem, even though vision failure may have been the reason for my frequent blinking. And if you look at this movie, be so open to accept elements that no zoo or circus would refuse: They are above ground and underground creatures that feasted on dozens of campers near Louisiana's empty mansion. This is the discovery of a trio that is sent from its print media to investigate death. Then two of them disappear and the survivor is part of another trinity that deals with hunting. Eureka! I realized what one of these "special circumstances" would be - unconsciousness.
