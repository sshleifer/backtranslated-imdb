"A scientific scientist is experimenting with human DNA in an effort to create a perfect human being. His work has reached a point where he can receive a human fetus within a few days and accelerate his growth to an adult." the creation is (omitted spoiler), but the side effects of the process (omitted spoiler), "according to the synopsis of the DVD sleeve. fi, is based on medical technology that currently exists for the growth of the fetus outside the uterus, which could be the possibility of tomorrow ?? or today, ‚Äùsays Dr. Right. And Dr. Joyce Brothers appears later at Roddy McDowall's party. First, we see that Rock Hudson (like Dr. Paul Holliston) lit a cigarette and rides recklessly (watch the speedometer!) during a storm; unfortunately hits the dog. Mr. Hudson takes a wounded dog. She learns that she is pregnant and thanks to her experimental knowledge of fetal growth she can save the life of one of the puppies. What really shrinks is that Hudson uses an experimental cure to grow an embryo, so he can survive outside his mother's womb. The dog, number one, grows rapidly into adult size and dies like a mother. Hudson lives with his sister-in-law Diane Ladd (as Martha Douglas); because his wife Nicole, also a doctor, died in another car crash. Mrs. Ladd seems more emotionally stable about Nicole's death than Hudson, who survived the accident that killed his wife. Things start to be horrible when Hudson's dog shows intelligence far above a normal dog. Then Hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human, Barbara Carrera (as Victoria Spencer). Hudson and the actors are trying their best; but the story of "Embryo" is extremely absurd nonsense. If you take her stupid introductory and final scenes, Mrs. Carrer's brave character almost works; she could be a bigger star if she offered better movies than this. The infantile end indicates continuation; but fortunately this idea was interrupted.
