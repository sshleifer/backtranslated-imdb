I really tried to give this movie a chance, but when I realized that most of the movie was told by a lot of boring officials walking around talking about phones, I knew it was over. Much of this movie also looked like a footage. That's just lame. <br /> <br /> The person with the camera had these short short approaches done for no reason! It bothered me so much, but I was just wondering why the hell he thought it was a good idea. It adds nothing to the static scene of two people talking. It's not NYPD Blue or some police show or something. <br /> <br /> How could they not realize that telling this story from people's conversations in conference rooms and what's not, is BORING?! Didn't they follow this mess? By the way, it was just a boring movie and it makes it appear that the one who did it doesn't understand the good story in the movie. Darn footage ... that's wrong.
