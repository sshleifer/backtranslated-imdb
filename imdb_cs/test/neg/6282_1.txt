<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is Tenchi? This is not Tenchi. Practically all are written terribly from the character ... As far as characterization is concerned, the only clear place is the friendship between Ayek and Ryoko. Br /> <br /> Also, villagerism is not punished for its acts of rape controlling the mind. If a male villain had made one of the women what Haruna was doing with Tenchi, then (rightly) he would have painfully bought it at the end of the film, died terribly, and the audience would have made fun. But not only does Haruna pay no price for her crimes, Ryoko really forgives and contemplates her actions. No! The real Ryoko would disintegrate her for what Haruna did to her beloved Tenchi; The audience I saw it with, I included, all booed audibly on this scene <br /> <br /> Anime fans, avoiding this movie. Tenchi fans, avoid this movie even harder.
