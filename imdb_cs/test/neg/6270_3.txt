Why C Thomas Howell Makes These Movies? Cruise (Howell's one-time co-star) has a huge blockbuster with WOTW and Howell with this lame effort. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Production Values ​​- I'll start with good things. The appearance of some scenes in this movie is not too bad to be honest. Set-ups are fine in points and direction is not too bad. <br /> <br /> Script - Terrible. A series of clumsy scenes that could be placed in any order that you like throughout the movie. The amount of time the scene faded black and reappeared a second later in the same room was countless. A very bad story (but also a Cruise WOTW) takes some blame, but the abysmal scenario kills it. Special FX - Okay, I don't want to be too rough when I imagine the budget was smaller than the Cruise Lunch Account - but in the overall context of the movie the effects are poorly implemented. Some shots are quite impressive - mainly shots of bridges, Washington, steamer. But mainly "extraterrestrial" machines and tentacles are terrible. Also, camera quality is fuzzy on some images and completely removes others. Acting - I am a Howell fan, but as he has limited himself to playing in these low-budget movies - he has been "overdone" to bugs long ago. Check out his performance at The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. No comparison. He overcomes his facial expressions, his trembling arms and legs (where he managed to get this running style ???) and the final revolutionary view of the scene where he loses his family's photo. Hysterically. But after all - he's still the best actor at the show. Busey looks embarrassed and Peter Green (Zed is a really dead child now) mumbles incoherently with his only scene. I honestly couldn't understand one word he said - I even went so far as to try to activate the subtitles on that scene - but the DVD didn't have subtitles. It seems to be a real thing to keep in the family because Howell's son, the director's wife, and the line producer get into the movie. None of them is good. <br /> <br /> Direction - not bad, but not good. <br /> <br /> Scores - Dismal. he will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to return to great time. He should look at Rourke and try to figure out how he went back to List A, but if he does such things, he won't soon have a career. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
