David Dhawan copied HITCH and such an unofficial copy The film is not even 1/2 as funny or funny as the original, which is boring with forced stories like Lara's track with and without her husband Plus, where the stupid Chota DON is unwilling and David is also trying choke drama, but the movie looks incoherent, boring <br /> <br /> The song just jumps out, so romance and everything prevents some funny Govinda scenes, dancing before the interval nothing else worth noting The last few scenes are pretty funny but tend to be too long <br /> <br /> David's direction is as bad as MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA, needs to change his style or try something good Music saves grace, some songs are good, but situations seem to be forced <br /> < Govinda looks overweight and seems too loud and shouts his lines in the initial rollers but gets into the groove and gives his best m one hundred in the office and on the scene with Salman in the cabin and at the end <br /> <br /> Salman plays alone and the nose tone plus his fake style of acting is a headache <br /> <br /> Lara can be avoided, Katrina is fake as usual <br /> <br /> Kid overacts
