First, this film works in fact that it is disturbing. I really didn't like seeing all these scenes where people make a living, etc. A strange erotic introduction gives a person a feeling of necrophiliactic wonder. It's a little nasty for me. But the movie really works in this regard, and it should be scary, so I give it for it. Yeah, a few points out there for those scalpels and ... well, damn disturbing idea of ​​getting rid of life. But what this film lacks is an interesting plot, characterization, or real surprise. The entire teen-flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple, predictable way. Lots of "tense" moments, spooky guys who are crazy, and the big question of all: is he a murderer friend? This film fits into the "Scream" category and countless others that appeared in the 1990s. Well, I'm not gonna ruin it, but it's not interesting who the murderer is. We'll find out who's halfway ... and from there, the movie is drunk, trying to fill up some time ... somewhat boring. I watched the clock for a little bit of this movie. The leading actress is great, as usual, but the board that acts on the dashboard, which is located, makes one moaning in pain ... a student who is a detective who everyone thinks is Mad, but she's the one who really knows what's going on. And the cops? Ahhh, they're just laughing and eating donuts. Very predictable, flat, sometimes distracting, but mostly boring and boring ... It's like an American movie company that flew to Germany to make a movie to be strange ... hmmm ..... or did it ? <br /> <br />
