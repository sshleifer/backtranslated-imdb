I watched this movie with my friend, a passionate hip-hop fan, and was really looking forward to capturing the "soul" atmosphere the movie claimed. Boy, we were dead wrong. When I watched the movie, I felt two things: remorse and relief. Remorse because I regretted wasting my time looking at this terrible piece of dung and relief because I watched it for free on cable. This film really gives a bad name to black people by giving so much terrible stereotypes that I believe all intelligent blacks are trying to tell everywhere. I am Asian and I feel very sorry and ill for those who made this film. What more to say? Bad writing, worse playing and a scary story. Even if you're bored to death and have no choice, don't watch this movie. Seriously. The film really has nothing to offer except when you want to see things like petty illegal drinking, animal killed, women's degradation and overall: really bad movie - OBNOXING-SICKENING-AWFUL MOVIE. Ugh.
