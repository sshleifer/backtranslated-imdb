This movie is so stupid that I want my $ 2.99 back that I paid for !! First, this movie starts with lots of wooden geeks actors with fillings of talent as if they got out of the street somewhere because "real" actors either didn't show up because of a laughing script or they just couldn't get anyone desperate enough to make this movie! The music in this movie is enough to make you sleep, flute music for faerie dance in the wild wouldn't even be good enough for this movie! And that guy dressed as Satan seems to be dressed in a special K-Mart Halloween costume! There are no dead scenes except for a few lame scenes. When I saw the horrible murderers look in those bathrobes with Nosferatu's faces, I laughed! That's what the whole city should run once a year! This movie is one of the worst demonic movies I've ever seen. Avoid this!
