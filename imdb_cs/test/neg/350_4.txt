It's exactly what the title tells you ... an island inhabited by fishermen. The wrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and crew members are landing on the island, being picked up by fishermen or tied to work for the treasure hunter Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he has found the lost city of Atlantis, kept the restless scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for 15 years, so fishermen can uncover the treasury under the sea. Of course, Cotten is a complete lunatic. Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry. This madness was driven by Sergio Martino and is not surprisingly without merit. It is a fast pace, reasonably well done, and fishermen look pretty convincing (though it is unlikely that anyone will prove that these things don't look like real fishermen). Luciano Michelini has an excellent music score.
