What? - That was it? The City Sheriff (John Agar) throws out a mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? Did I write it? I have seen it? <br /> <br /> With The Wildcats, "Night Fright" is one of the films he deserved to be made in 1967. The suit is just asking for trouble. Redo it in black and white and set a story about thirty years earlier and you should have at least 4.0 ratings on IMDb. But unfortunately this one should never have a chance to see daylight. Oops, there's another joke - you can never tell if there is a day or night in the story because they seem to be interchangeable. I'll give it to you, a few mortar shops in the scene looked like they could be in the air like Coke ads. They were thinking about it now, they were probably the best looking and best lit scenes of the picture; Coca Cola had to pay for them. If they saw the finished film, they could better serve to prevent it from being released.
