If ever there was a movie that could be considered a missed opportunity, then the movie is Galaxina. What could be wrong in the sci-fi film base around sexy female android sculptures? Surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time? Well, unfortunately this movie is almost useless. There are a lot of mistakes with this production, but there are two basic problems that will destroy the entire enterprise. First, it is a comedy that has no funny pieces at all, or at least a movie where potentially fun aspects are presented incredibly unamusing in a way. Secondly, the character of the title is woefully underestimated. This may be because Dorothy Stratten wasn't really an actress, but if that was the case, it was a terrible decision because it's still the best on the film. I don't think she really has to be a great thespian to get rid of the role of a sexy android to be absolutely honest. Anyway, what we have left is a lot of breathtaking comedy reliefs that often consist of hopeless fake gags of great sci-fi hits like Alien, Star Wars and 2001. It's badly written and not funny at all, even He does not really have a plot to propel things together. The story is basically about a police space cruiser that is sent to get a rock. And it is done! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-concept film is one whose storyline can be described in one sentence. What he did not define was what you call a film that can be described in less than a sentence - perhaps unnecessarily? It seemed to me that he certainly won me, but failed. It seems to have been an attempt to spoof Star Wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. All we can do is let you get cold and a little irritated that it's not close to what it was supposed to be. Barbarella for 80 years is not. Shortly after completing this film, Dorothy Stratten was murdered terribly violently and terribly. And for this reason, Galaxina has gained a considerable amount of its cultural interest. I think it's a great pity that Dorothy didn't have a better film to immortalize her.
