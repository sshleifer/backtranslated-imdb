I was really disappointed with this movie. I heard some great reviews about him and unfortunately I missed it in theaters. As a result, I was really excited when I came to the DVD. I thought it would be a high-speed horror movie with a lot of terrifying surprises, but instead it was a snail-paced predictable movie. He pulled and pulled without a climax in her, and after all the difficulties that the people went through to try to escape, the end was absolutely frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for one reason. This is not your typical horror movie with one central evil guy who beats a lot of people to death. The story makes this film unique and provides change for people watching a lot of horror movies. Although I don't like this movie, I recommend all horror fans to see it at least once. You like it surprisingly. As for this horror fan, all I can say is that I hope there's no sequel to this forgotten movie.
