This movie was so awful, so boring, so badly wrong - it took a lot of work to do what was to be a sure thing in such travesty. I love Lucille Ball, but in this movie she is absolutely smelly. Too old, he couldn't sing, sounded like a truck gravel, even though he didn't turn on - and the greatest sin of all - SHE DANGER. ARE ONE. The studio shot in the foot with this and some other parts of the body deserve to be wounded for destroying what was supposed to be a wonderful version of the wonderful stage musical - or perhaps those parts were missing. That could explain that. But Lucy thought she was right for the part that required SINGING - that's the saddest thing of all. It's very good to know your limitations. Even a legend cannot come out of such a scent and still feel like a rose.
