(There are spillers) The usual film slasher with a story that takes place around this forgotten mine outside the near-abandoned city of Sutterille. After receiving a letter map and a gold nugget from his brother Jared, Shadrach Smith, Clair and her husband Nick Breman, Carrie Bradac & Sean Hines, they go to the village with four other friends and gold prospects Alx & Tori, Steve Wastell & Sangie, and Hayden & Rox Ann, Rick Majeske & Elina will take part in their claim. Later, it turns out that the fact that Jared disrupted a long forgotten gold mine caused the spirit of the notorious stone Jeremiah Stone, Vernon Wells, to return to life, and with it began his reign of terror. Stone, or 49er, is the most ridicules slasher / killer in film history. The stone seems to have been buried for several years under a few tons of coal, which is being cut with this hook by two people. After making in almost all of the local local hermit aunt Nelly, (Karen Black), who is the daughter of Eve (Alexandra Ford) was also one of Stone's victims, tells those still alive that unless they return the gold back to the stone mine the crazy miner will be \ t t has never left until he killed all those who still have it. Aunt Nelly gets so much time to tell her story before she turns into a Stone torch and ends up jumping into a nearby stream. The film continues endlessly with the murderer miner on the rampage to appear to be about as scary as burned toast and equally dark. Even those who appeared in the film seemed to have no real fear of it. In one scene, when he broke into Aunt Nelly's house, everyone inside everyone charged, instead of running, causing the spirit spirit to lose its right hand; Stone spent the rest of the film with a mining rope attached to his "stump". In addition to actress Karen Black, "Miners Massacre" also features veteran actors John Phillip Law and Richard Lynch as Sheriff Murphy and Old Man Prichard. Portable stuff, but nothing special movie has a predictable ending with a whole gold mine up in flames. Viewers gave a hint from the creators of the "miners massacre" that the end of this mindless madness is nowhere in sight and can very well resurrect in a possible future in a possible sequel, God will help us all!
