I first watched this film in the mid-1980s when I was a kid. We couldn't get over it. Dialogue, acting, everything about it was lame. Here are a few examples ... imagine that these spoken realities are dramatic, so exaggerated: "Oreegon?" Why would anyone want to go to Oreegon? "<br />" Survivalists? Nobody has ever told us about survivalists! "<br /> <br /> This film was so bad, my sister and I rented it again for her 16th birthday party, just so our friends could sit and laugh as much as it was. they were able to finish!
