This movie should never be made! It smells, it's terrible, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. Will you start seeing the sample here? Jackie Mason is definitely not Rodney Dangerfield. Gone were Ted Knight and Bill Murray, who were necessary with Dangerfield for the first film. It seems that all three (stars) knew the smelly script when they saw him. The one who had no good sense of leaning out was Chevy Chase, who was stuck around, but in my opinion, he was strange to both movies. This movie is simply NOT going to be. Nor does it have any other qualities. This thing largely depends on anti-Semitism to work, and it works at the expense of. I hated that thing. Waste of time.
