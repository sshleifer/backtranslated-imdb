As a fan of Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best), I was looking forward to this movie. Although I didn't catch it in the cinema, and after seeing it on TV, I'm so happy to have given up on the video. From a good book they managed to create one of the worst films in Dutch film history. All the good parts were omitted, the story changed, not its benefits. All the humor was cut out. What is left is bad, despite a dramatic, inconsistent film that I do not want to watch once again. better work on Giphart's topper Phileine zegt Sorry. Look!
