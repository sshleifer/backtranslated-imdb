Just like the horrible cancer that rains from the sky, I crept into this movie on a movie channel at night. Being a fan of bad movies and actively engaging in the purchase and viewing of this bad movie, I was intrigued by the idea of ​​a truly looking-up action movie from modern times. After what I was wearing, I found my hands inexplicably turned against me, grabbed something within reach and stabbed my head and neck. Something sinister was in the tape ... err ... where I am ... this is one of the embarrassingly bad pieces of the movie I came across. William Forsythe cannot play more than one character and this character is always a joke. Even if they get into comics and give things to do and say they are funny (a Deuce Bigalo), she laughs badly. Erika Eleniak is very much the same when she played in her fair share of horrible movies and did terrible work in all of them, not helping to help it. The classic b-movie villain Andrew Divoff does a decent job, but hardly has any scenery he could chew on. Even a reliable standby for b-movie action, Daniel Bernhardt, cannot deliver anything bordering on entertainment. As for the film's own merits, the story is lame, the script, as well as the action and plot plot, is boring and ... well, stupid, for the lack of a better adjective (the master knows they didn't give any effort to why? ). Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad, and anyone who has seen bad enough can learn to appreciate them, but there's nothing here. to enjoy if he is not one of the worst tolerant films and you just feel so inclined to test his metula. Before you do this, take it from me, this is not terrible enough to look forward to (unlike what it says ... some of the ridiculous Italian zombie movies). A b-movie fan would be much better off looking at most of Bernhardt's other films, or anything else that was ever filmed. America just isn't the place to go to it, especially not now. If you like, look at anything from the seas, movies like Heroic Duo or a little less normal Hakaider (along with anything else in the scary Keita Amemiya scene) will give you a much more fun and better way than your apt to. find elsewhere, especially here.
