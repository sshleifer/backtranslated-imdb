Though unusually in color for the second string of the oater, the vivid clothing of the leading women fails to bring any life to a straightforward scenario. "Conspiracy" revolves around teenagers newly released on an honest attempt to go straight but to be watched by a vengeful ex-Pinkerton man (the chewing scenery of Fred Clark) and a femme fatale determined to involve them in her banknote robbery systems whether they want or not. As Cole Younger, Wayne Morris is big enough and hunky enough, but his "cool" performance and wooden acting skills undermine things. The action standard is honest, not better than Gene Autry or Roy Rogers television episode with Colt. 45 that it never needs translating and miraculous shooting skills that allow a horse rider to shoot from the hip and injure a man from at least 50 feet. ..oh dear ...
