It's not a bad concept. I just wish they took another direction. It's a movie that tries to be interesting shocking you with the bestiality to start, which works for most people (prudes with weak stomachs). But besides, there's not much to this movie. It's not funny or romantic, so please let someone change this label, and since I already knew the farthest is actually the most places and the million-dollar industry, I wasn't really shocked. But most people don't know it and I thought that as the film evolved after a secret came out it was just disappointing because it could be one of those shocking eye opener movies that would teach the ignorant about the fetish that is very reality for (Yes I am So do homework) hundreds of thousands of people. So if you like watching bad movies that you can dream of about how you could make them better while watching them than surely, have fun doing it.
