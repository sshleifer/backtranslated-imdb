This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Independent or not, solid writing is a must. Ditto for directing and acting. I know these actors can act (I saw them in Sporanos and more ...), but this movie is very bad, very bad. Maybe it's a script, maybe it's a director. Probably a bit of both ..... Probably a lot of both! Technically OK, Just Bad, Bad, Bad ... I have a theory that those who support this movie also own Poker Magazines because I have seen a very favorable review in one of the magazines. "Hi, we did it, so it must be good, right?" Not so fast Bucky. I know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even make a movie, much less sold and distributed, and I praise these people for that. But the final product, leave a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br /> P.S. I won the free rental and I chose this movie from the blockbuster. I'll get my money back tomorrow.
