There is a reason why the chairman of the board got 2, (which is too high), this film is out one of the worst movies of all time and I saw my share of rotten movies. The Chairman of the Board today played two of the most annoying actors / people, Carrot Top and Courtney Thorne Smith. Carrot Top just isn't fun and wasn't in this piece of trash. Courtney Thorne Smith is no better, just look at "By Jim" and you'll see a great example of what I'm talking about. The Chairman of the Board got me 1 because it is as low as it is, it's so bad. I am a little shocked that this piece of waste is not somewhere on the bottom of the IMdb 100, I would put it in the top five on this list, but its slow work is in progress.
