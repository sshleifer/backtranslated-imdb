On the heels of a well-received and beloved arrival of the movie's classic age, relating to the life of teenagers when they go into adulthood, George Lucas' American Graffiti, we have Cooley High. Species Adaptation by Eric Monte, co-creator of the popular CBS sitcom 1970, Good Times. Cooley High was and is considered a black version of American Graffiti. in Graffiti in America we have a black slum from Cabrini Green in Chicago as the background of the story. The site of America in 1962 is Cooley High in 1964. The Stars of the Movie Welcome Back Kotter, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman as the main protagonists of the film and its main characters. It's Garrett Morris playing major who is trying to keep Jacobs' and Turman characters, named Coceise and Preach, from trouble a lot of time. You know, I'd like to say Cooley High is a worthy comparative piece of American Graffiti, or it's a great movie on its own, but I can't. The problem is that film producers could not or could not hide the sad side of black life in America. The film at Cabrini Green in Chicago doesn't help. Even gross attempts at humor are not here. When Coceise looks for a letter of intent from the college he finds, his brother threw a toilet. When a gang visits a Chicago Zoo, one of the gangs named Pooter, he has an ape thrown at him. When the character of Turman, Preach, is haunted by two hoodlums in a school hangout (a dirty and depressing place to eat food in a much smaller number of people), he opens the girl's bathroom door while the girl relaxes, escapes the same bathroom window! High school, character homes, bathrooms, almost everywhere in the film, show an unhappy look at the decline and poverty in cities. If that wasn't enough, there was a rough humor in the movie. The use of violence and blasphemy in film. Cooley High may be the advent of the film's age, but it's the hard and rough coming of the film age with little or no joke and a penchant for using nostalgia that made people so popular and appreciated by Americans. Motown Records had a movie. The company's music was part of the film's soundtrack. But even here you feel the same old same old as he heard these songs a million times ago. Not that they weren't great songs in themselves, but black music, it was more than just Motown at the time. A song approaching the end of the movie, Spinners' G.C. Cameron, it wasn't that impressive. There were better Motown ballads that were done, better Motown artists than Cameron without a question. The last part of the movie showing where the characters went to pay tribute to the film Cooley High Headed to be, American Graffiti. This shows that Preach, an intelligent but underrated student, went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte may have patterned himself as a Turman character. The last shot of Preach runs away from Coceise's funeral, which took place in the dark rainy afternoon, and all the bleaks represented by Cooley High. Eric Monte, through Preach and the last scene, had a little lesson for us all when we watched Cooley High and the love of the past. Don't look back.
