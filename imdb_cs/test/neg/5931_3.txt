Kudos to DP Baxley to make it look like a real movie, the first time it happened in this series (with the exception of F / X scenes). But when it came closer to the values ​​of film production, it lost most of the fun of the first two. They were very in the category of "so bad they're good" terrible movie entertainment. Is it possible to argue that "believers" simply tried to make a general action film praying in it? It is so many times in the film that they destroy their own belief system as unpleasant. If everything is happening according to God's will and it is simply his tools, then people who are infected with the virus become part of his plan, right? Use it for every situation where someone is not subject to God's will by faith, and you get a hypocritical little movie from 'Action Jackson'.
