Okay, I'd like to doubt it. I watched his show. It's not funny for me. I only remember a lot of "weird" sounds and shouts. I don't think I even cracked a smile. The only thing that resembled humor was his Anjelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston. I think you can get horror when you watch it. Also, what's with "Ask Whitey?" section? Is it ripoff "Ask a Gay Dude? / Black Man?" from Chappelle's Show? Isn't that obvious? But when Chappelle did, he revealed the ignorance of the topic. Like Borat. But what is the choice of random white people and yelling at them? It's not funny, it's just stupid. And I'm sure I heard some "jokes" somewhere else ... it seems like it's like "plagerising" pieces and pieces, throwing in some "loud" shouts. Anyway, it wasn't funny. Seriously. Don't waste your time.
