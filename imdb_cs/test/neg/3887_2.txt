What manufacturers of this frightening adaptation have tried to do is absolutely impossible to understand. A group of top actors in the main study (with some remarkable exceptions) who give quite good performance results. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and Joanna Lumley is as good as Diana. Everything goes well with the scripts that were given to them. <br /> <br /> So much for good. The average would include files. Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although the bizarre house they use for the Dower House looks remarkable. It is clear that Dower's house is too big. In later parts, writers decided to bring the story back to Great Britain, probably because of saving money, although with little imagination I have no doubt that they could recreate Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Bad. Screenplay. It is such a terribly bad adaptation that it is difficult to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in the Battle of Britain, but survives, blinded. He makes a short look then commits suicide - why? Loveday has changed from a young woman totally in love with Gus to a reasonable woman farmer who can give up her love of her life barely with a tear (less emotional than Brief Encounter). Gus, a man who was sacrificed and passionately in love, is ready to give up his love without complaint. Walter (Mudge in the book) changes from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man. Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't talk. Aunt Biddy still has a drinking problem, but now without any justification. The Dower House is occupied by an army for no apparent reason other than a very short scene with Jess, who is afraid of armed soldiers. While Miss Mortimer's breasts are perfectly pleasing, I couldn't see how their images shifted forward on several occasions. Beautifully named Nettlebed becomes secular Dobson. Word restriction prevents me from continuing the list. There is a sequel (which I have lost all interest in following after this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes have been made to create the story. It's hard to imagine Rosamund Pilcher approving this grotesque perversion of her book; apparently lost control when buying rights.
