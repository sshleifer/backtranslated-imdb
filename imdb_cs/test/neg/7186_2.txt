The fear of darkness left me with the impression that several different scenarios were written, too short for a feature film, then clumsily joined into this Frankenstein monster. At his best, the protagonist, Lucas, is creepy. How difficult it is to draw a bead on secondary characters is more sympathetic. I'm afraid the Darkness might reach mediocrity if it took only one approach and saw it through - and it just made Lucas psychotic and confused instead of being ghoulish and off-putting. I wanted to see him wrapped in asylum so that the rest of the character could have a normal life.
