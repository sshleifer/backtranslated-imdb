STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Unorthodox Journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) leaves time when a local police force ended up trying to romance a member of the police staff. But everything changes when a pub in the Thames is read, murdered, and a transcript of an unpublished novel found by legendary writer Charles Dickens. As he creeps deeper into both secrets, he is further immersed in mystery and danger than what he negotiated. In 1998, former footballer Vinnie Jones shot out of the blue and took everyone with surprise by his iconic classic gangsters. Lock, warehouse and two smoking barrels. Okay, no one has escaped his acting skills, but his presence as a hard man seemed to provide a decent movie guy career. But it turned out to be a single hit, and everything he really did was to support the role of a much more acclaimed actor in films like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish before coming down to the direct realm on DVD. it was a puzzled and Labor-like thriller that might be okay if he didn't take on other acclaimed and promising new talent stars like Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith along with him. What made him fall from the dizzying heights of success so fast (except for a pony trick) is somebody's guess (risky personal life is an estimate), but here he is. And the scenario as far and incomprehensible as it would be a task in one's hand, but with a bad-looking look at Jones it is still a task to be understood. Jacobi's juxtaposing role as a former tramp hiker and Dickens himself speaking directly to the camera are obviously allusions to what is possible, and the scenario is predictable in other areas as well. Add to this cheap looking production value through out and debut director (also writer) Brendan Foley made a bad first impression. What exactly did I expect with something that came with The Daily Mail for free? *
