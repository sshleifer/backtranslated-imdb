Compared to director Kevin Connor, ARABIAN ADVENTURE is a masterpiece. But that doesn't say much. In fact, The CART EARTH'S CORE is a silly fantasy adventure in which Peter Cushing - who seems to be on something strong - and some other actor (whom I don't know) uses a giant kick machine called "Iron Mole" way down to Earth's core - only to find that the interior of the Earth is pink and inhabited by apes similar to people who enslaved people. There is also a huge bird that controls the apes using telepathy, and we will see that he blinks his eyes in the detailed movie. Most importantly, Cushing and his name also meet the beautiful Caroline Munro in the underground caves. And here's what I really got against this little swing: why is it why, when Munro is in the movie, he only gets about. 5 minutes screen? WHO LOVES IN SPY, MANIAC, DRACULA AD 1972, SINBAD GOLD VOICE - He's always in the background! How does Kevin Connor think we'd rather listen to the fake accent of Peter Cushing and look at some ridiculous monkey man whose voice sounds like a scratched CD rather than look at the beautiful Munro? I do not get it. Please someone controls the movie where this English brunette is still on the screen!
