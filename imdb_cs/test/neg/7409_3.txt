This is Jonas Quastel's debut as a director and to be honest he shows it. Looks like he threw every type of trick he learned at the film school to try to add some style to a badly written script that helped him write! The film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others who are looking for a plane in the Pacific Northwest that crashed that his daughter was and also a special machine that his company built to want. The first 5 minutes of the movie are either blurry or shaky or out of focus! Quastel tries to capture the "Blair Witch" mode with these types of shots and grows very fast. And there are also POV images that are directly from "Wolfen" and "Predator". These shots are from the viewpoint (POV) of Sasquatch. Editing is sometimes very jerky because the scene seems to be shifted in the middle. I heard that this movie was shot in about 12 days and I suppose that instead of "Getting Back to One" they just rebooted without stopping and editing the scene. And the rest of the movie is fading from one scene to another. There are so many scenes that have fallen out that I lost count. Now, naked scene with Andrea Roth. It's not her. You can easily see his body double. And you know you watched the wrong movie "B" when a hot chick in the middle of the Pacific Northwest decides to go to the nearest hot spring and bathe! ******** SPOILER ALERT ******** <br /> <br /> And Sasquatch alone is not bad if you don't really see him and it's just a blurry picture behind some trees or shrubs, but when you finally see him at the end, of course you're disappointed. First not high. The actor who plays Sasquatch is just hairy in certain places on his body. His partial suit! And he's bald! I heard that he died of makeup during the shooting and maybe explains why the costume looks hurry. Some of the sound effects that come from Sasquatch are nothing but the known lion roar we've all heard in other films. I must admit that Henriksen is not bad. Yes, he works with the wrong material, but he has one of those interesting faces that can actually increase certain moments of the film. People say that Bigfoot's good movie was never created but I disagree. I've always said that "The Creature From Black Lake" is a good movie and I recommend it. I'm crazy for Sasquatch, but this one is just amateur.
