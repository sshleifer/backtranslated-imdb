This movie is worse than terrible! It took a good story and turned it into a schizophrenic cinema. The photo is extremely amateur. . . looks like the 5th year of a home-made film project shot with 8mm cameras inoperative. . . editing seems to be done by someone who has psychotic flashes (in drugs and booze), with short scenes followed by other, unrelated scenes, then chopped segments of scenes embedded. . . absolutely useless and unreasonable nudity. . . missing scenes. . . day scenes inexplicably transformed into night scenes, then suddenly back to day. . . apparently no continuity. Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes and James Mason's good acting skills are superfluous, as well as the gift of a "key" support cast - (forget the villain and Anderson women - a very amateur actor). This movie is a good remake candidate, even with Skerritt and Hughes. . . This time, do it professionally.
