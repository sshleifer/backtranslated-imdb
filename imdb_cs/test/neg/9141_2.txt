This is a failure so complete it made me angry. All the subtlety and structure of Reggio's early films is gone, so nothing but squeezing digitally blurry images, the only purpose of which is to be whining Bad things that people do. How come star Trek-like wormhole graphics, slo-mo colorized seascapes, mutiplicities apparently fake computer icons, and shots of athletic competitions that incidentally show that no one has ever been able to top (or even match) Leni Riefenstahl for filming bodies in motion, edited along with video colorization overlay that 1980s "Dr. Who "producer would refuse as" too cheese, "adding to the controversy against" civilized violence "? There is no intellectual, emotional or visceral connection between these images, as they have collected and mutated Reggio and too many digital effects of the artists, and I suppose the warning story he wanted to produce. It seems that with all the "dramaturgical consultants" involved, no one has dreamed of Saying Something Important and thought that everyone could say something. Only people who watch too much TV to do this and believe it makes sense; this is the kindergarten Stan Brakhage, and ultimately helpless in his relentless appearance. The only irony and tension here (as opposed to "Koyaanisqatsi", where the persistent beauty and strangeness of time-altered ordinary images made you consider their meaning) was when I skipped and skipped the DVD I watched. This is MTV for the Noam Chomsky crowd, based on the reflex rather than the reflection, and nothing to say. Two stars for music that is glass style best pomo-Cesar Franck and contains some passionate cello by Yo-Yo Ma. (I hope he won't be able to upload his parts to play the movie, some things you shouldn't do for pay.)
