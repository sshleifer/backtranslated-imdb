Dr. Seuss would be upset now if he was alive. The cat in the hat proves how film production can have a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goats. Mike Myers is an infamous cat in a hat, a big mistake! Myers proves he can't act in this film. She acts like a prissy show girl with thousands of tricks up her sleeve. Children in this movie are fine, somewhere between the lines boring and uncomfortable. The story is just like the original with several improvements and like most movies based on other stories, never do with the original story! Bringing Quin to the evil neighbor was a bad idea. He's a stupid rascal who would never get anywhere. This movie is like a rejected comic from a newspaper if you think about it. The film certainly looks sticky! Sure, there are funny adult jokes, like when a cat cuts a tail and the censor goes out before he says a naughty word, slightly funny. At least Grinch had the courage and the movie was actually good! This movie is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and poor average gameplay. Was Mike Myers actually in the movie? And another thing, fish. What's wrong with that stupid fish! When you see it for the first time, it's a real fish. The next time you see him, he's animated and talking. But it looks like an animated piece of rubber dough! This movie is absolutely out of the wreck target. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I was surprised that it was a good joke, like a water park joke, that was good. So please, if you have a choice, watch Grinch instead of this mess.
