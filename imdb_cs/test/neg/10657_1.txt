... without anything. This film begins with scenes in China with a newborn. Although this is not a new concept, I did not want to give up. Then there is a flash to adolescence. The man's wife and biological child are poisoned by a father who neglected them. Although it does not seem to be culturally accurate and the film has taken no step towards the development of these characters or the purpose of devotion to the adopted father, I pushed it. Furthermore, we are in Malibu, where we are bombarded with poorly constructed classroom interaction and a terribly low budget (fill in a blank note: work / camera / lighting). I'm not going to give out any of the conspiracies anymore, because I suppose the synopsis is accurate: the film is supposed to show how a Malibu girl is, who (though she seems to have innate compassion and interest to help others when she he immediately asks his teacher for a trip to China), spoiled and untrustworthy, considers himself a healer and helper of body and spirit. <br /> <br /> Lame. LAME, LAME, LAME. Now I'm, right, I'm a tough critic, so maybe I'll take one of those LAME away and you'll be on the mark.
