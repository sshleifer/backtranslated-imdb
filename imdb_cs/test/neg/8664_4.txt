Mansfield Park, in my second half, is my favorite of Austen's novels, and Fanny Price is my favorite of her heroes, so I'm saddened by the unfortunate fate she has suffered in her big and small screens. The only good character reading I heard was made for radio Amanda Root, who gave her the same quality as Anna did in "Persuasion": a strict, confident, honest moral center. If the actress was younger, visual casting would also be good; but Fannys, who have reached our eyes so far, were more like: Mary Crawford; Ruby little girl; and (in this incarnation) a jovial serving girl, or maybe a cake, with high moral principles pulled by a pin. Well, I was hoping for a better one, but I was worried worse. The series had a solid Edmund, in an actor who was the best in sympathetic sap, and perfect, ie Absolutely Abominable, Mrs. Norris; otherwise it was dullish. The film, which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea, came out as a mixed burlesque. After such disappointing and more recent disappointments from the sister works of this production (the new "Persuasion" and "Northanger Abbey"), I couldn't help but expect mixed expectations; and overall it seemed a little better than not. He harmonized the novel intelligently and eventually left me with as much feeling as the comic version could be. On the other hand, it had to rework most of the characters, except for Crawfords, and by the way, it reduced or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including the best-known character and what it should be if it's not his best-known scene. The character is a cruel aunt Norris who is always ready to direct other people to what she has to do, but she always avoids having to do something of her own; it doesn't make any sense here. And with it goes a lot more: her note that goes through Fanny, "... considering who and what you are"; The discovery of Mr. Thomas that she banned Fanny's fire in her room all those years, and his roundabout apology for her; Fanny is honest in acknowledging that during her visit to home, Aunt Norris was better off than any of her sisters in handling all her mistakes. But then, the whole story is missing in the story, and so most of what's happening in theater rehearsals and most of what Thomas Thomas is angry with on his return; Thomas and his wife are in fact different from what they were. Above all, the scene in which Crawford proposes Fanny, one of Austen's most complex, is simplified to bare narration; missing from it, Fanny's relentless defense of what he knows is right, and what he knows is very true, against all the scattered Crawfords and others who can use it. For a male reader, now no less than when it was written, it reveals with unparalleled clarity - unrivaled, in any case, as far as I know - what a woman is going through in an effort to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to mistrust. It's a great scene in the novel; it's just a scene on TV. And Fanny, oh, Fanny: When will we see your form?
