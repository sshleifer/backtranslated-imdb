I got this movie a few years ago and I found out that trying to find some information about it wasn't even a powerful IMDb. That should be all I needed to know. With friends like this is an anthology that plays as a collection of episodes of Twilight Zone / Outer Limits, all connected by bus, which really doesn't seem to be connected to the rest of the movie. Of the three stories, she was the only one to collect any fun value, the second episode in which man (s) grows out of bacteria in the boy's refrigerator. This episode wins points for a few places of humor and it's a bizarre assumption. Other than that there is an episode with a talking car (bland and directional) and an episode where a girl visits a very unique dating agency (my dog ​​guessed the end of this one). <br /> <br /> As stated in other comments, rating 18 is completely unfounded. There's nothing offensive here. If you're after a good horror anthology, check out Asylum or Creepshow.
