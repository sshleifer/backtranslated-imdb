I watched this movie after seeing the original "Spoorloos" several times, in anticipation of a chilling end. I can't even start explaining the anger and disappointment I've experienced, the End has come and gone, and the film has been a happy ending. What is a waste of time watching this remake in the US ... <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, please skip the "Vanishing" and watch the Dutch original "Spoorloos". The tension is very well built. You feel the frustration of Rex in finding any trace of what might have happened to his girlfriend Saskii after entering the gas station and never returned to her car. The search takes him three years, and when he finally comes into contact with a person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he must agree to undergo the same thing Saskia has undergone. He leaves the end in your chair speech.
