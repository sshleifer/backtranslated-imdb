This is by far the worst and stupid show I've ever seen on television. It is almost physically painful to watch an adult (well in his twenties) that he does nothing but torture and ridicule his parents, who always seem to have a clue about what stunts they have to endure with their sinister son and his equally stupid son, they always have no idea. friends. Of course I know his parents are in it, but I really hate how he always behaves as if they were completely surprised. It seems to be fake. And I really hate the introduction of the show, in which the voice asks "Bam Marger, what will he think of next?!?!" (I think so, anyway) and Bam himself says, "Whatever I want f ^ * k!" - WOW! Bam is a really hell raiser - living at home with mom and dad! Of course, the word "f ^ * k" is replaced by a tasteful beep, but the message is displayed. Bam is a real rebel - at least with his own eyes. Of course, Bam and his insensitive skull positions point to the teen boys' audience, and of course it's an MTV show, but please raise the bar a little. It's painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore nothing but boring.
