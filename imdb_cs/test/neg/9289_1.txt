Martin Lawrence might be considered a talented man, but those days are long gone. The Runteldat shows a man who immediately tries to play his compassionate card to his situation, but he is always responsible for this when he thinks it will be beneficial to his ego. The sad truth is that at this point in his life, his best days were behind him: his half-funny show was dead in the water after his co-star on the left and now faces the career of playing voice and god terrible action movies <br /> <br One gets the impression that this concert film was not designed to give Lawrence a career of further support after his humiliation, but rather a childish attempt to clear the air by both tries to pathetically save what is left of his life and somehow turn it into something what he prides himself on, a decisive moment in which he has shown himself to have gained his fame. Sadly, the concert is nothing more than a generous expression of Martin, who is incredulously trying to be funny, provoke pathos, and then claims he doesn't care for it because of hardcore. The sad truth is that this is a real public embarrassment for Lawrence: the way he favors sad sorrow, he wishes he would just pull down his underwear on the stage, head for the gun, and fix it again. . There is no real view of his performance at all. Like childish titles, Martin tries to make his last moment of truth his own way and fails miserably. He'd be better off waiting for E! The true story of Hollywood instead of running on stage and making it an idiot for the second time. Perhaps the saddest thing on this concert film - or rather on a career - is that Martin didn't do Thinking about it. What was this film supposed to do? Sadly, his fame was fleeting, he was a glimpse of a frying pan before an underwear incident, and now that the only way he can get a job is to carry Will Smith or Pixar. They could also call this concert 'Tombstone' because that is what it is. Martin Lawrence is just dying on stage, and with him it's an interesting career. Now? Just a pathetic side note in history.
