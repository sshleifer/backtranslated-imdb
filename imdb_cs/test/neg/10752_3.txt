One reviewer says the one who wouldn't like this film that "it will only be appreciated by movie viewers who have kidnapped the film as a distraction". This is, in my opinion, quite unfair to those of us who consider it boring. I didn't get tired or disillusioned with film or filmmakers, but I found it tedious and confident. But then it's true, I'm not too big to have profound meaningfulness. I feel that it can be of great importance to those who know it, you know. It's very slow and spends a long time trying to create points, using images, really to do it. so. But on such days as these, it seems possible that a movie like this might be the kind of thing you would encounter in one of those dark and depressing cabins in modern galleries than on the popular cinema screen . .
