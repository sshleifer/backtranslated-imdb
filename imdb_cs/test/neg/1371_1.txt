I'm sorry, but this guy isn't funny. I swear I heard that 4 year olds come with better jokes than with some of his. For example, "Dee dee dee" is perhaps the worst phrase I've ever heard. There is no creativity at all, and when you make fun of mentally disabled people when you have reached the level of your own show, it is incredibly muted on Mencia's part. Although each of them compares Chappelle with this fool, their competition is not. At first they had very different shows. I think everyone in all menica shows on average had only about 2 short 5 minutes of skits between his 10 minutes of praise for God knows what. Chappelles show came out more as a comedy sketch, with 2-4 parodies that cast the entire show. All the chappelle made a brief summary of each parody before and after each. Here Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think that having a show that consists of the same standup comedy that he talks about his standup special would be a beneficial idea? Does anyone really want to listen to a little George Lopez pioneer years before Mencia, but just dragged off the faith to the point where his dead? Snowflake has a chance in hell. My opinion is, although most people hate this guy for his racism, I can't stand him for his incompetence. The Central Comedy was looking for a minority that they could call "controversial," and then let Chappelles follow it. The problem is that this guy made it clear he didn't want to be Chappelle. So instead he leads his miserable show as a hot train wreck directly to the ground. Does anyone want to watch a weekly standup of the same thing every Thursday, I know for sure how hell I don't. I can't express my gratitude to Comedy Central though. This idiotic show is done. Personally, after watching his standup, I don't know how he got his own show first. There are a lot of other well-deserved comics like Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc. In fact, someone is better than the fool.
