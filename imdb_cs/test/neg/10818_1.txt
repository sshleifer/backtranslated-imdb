It's probably unfair to comment on this movie because I turned off the movie for the first time because it was so bad. I can watch anything, but this movie was so boring. I was bored before I put on the DVD and thought it might be a laughing action horror / action movie that would lighten the mood. It's not even that it's a device that increases the level of boredom by the power of 100. He had to turn it off after 45 minutes because all that happened at the time was that some people were diving and a big mole was discovered. Seriously, this movie is not worth the time, although you can enjoy a bad movie like I could, avoid this movie as a plague.Worst thing I've seen in years.
