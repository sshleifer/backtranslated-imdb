a boring, horrible piece of Italian euro-basket about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time pampering beer (that's what makes him an American, right? Our scientists spend most of their academic life from their minds, certainly. great theories) who study something (calling dolphins, patterns of fish migration who knows). He hears a strange sound through the headphones, proving that his radio is picking up a station in Jamaica. At the same time, Jack Skellington's girl with one of the worst, most faded males of bad hair 80s that it was when I was glad to be a witness trying to calm the dolphins in the Seaquarium working on how they are apparently upset about the amount of fish recently fired. The beginning of the film was really a badly colored story about two unpleasant, very Italian people who are attacked by something invisible underwater by boat. An angry woman never sees again (the best part of the story) and the dead body is without legs. A bad, alcoholic scientist (who has an inexplicable English-American-Italian accent) and a little girl with hay hair begin to theorize that a giant monster is hiding beneath the coast of Italy. .Florida. <br /> <br /> They will ask the electrician to help create an underwater microphone so that the monster can sing karaoke. This guy has a beautiful girlfriend whose only drawback is that he pronounces Peter "Pey-thrust", but for some reason he is sexually attracted to an anatomical skeleton with curly hair, a situation where someone flashes. Dubbing is a horrible, editor spaz, and plot generally yawn. A little about how this strange scientific corporation genetically engineered this giant giant shark-octopus-barracuda for some reason that makes no sense, and a really unpleasant greasy hairy guy bypasses killing women, again for no apparent reason. The stupid sheriff and his mass agent are on their way along with a female scientist (who knows he's smart because he wears big glasses). At that time a female scientist takes on a huge, terrible monster (yeah, right, Ed Wood's giant squid was more believable) with just a little handaxe, and she wins the competition. Hooray for skinny little women who seem to be the best hunter monster! Solving the problem of a giant thing is blowing up half of the Everglades, leaving a dead zone a few miles in every direction. To hell with ecology and the environment, right? We have to kill this giant monster! Finally, an electrician and his brooms love to ride the sunset on Vespa, which is o.k. Ever since she got over her fellow deaths and he's not very upset that his girlfriend was defeated by a crazy greasy guy. Hooray for true love! Wait a minute, there's nothing about this ...
