This film almost nervously collapsed. When I recovered from appendicitis a few years ago, I just started teaching at high school. The whole lesson was a bit nervous for a beginner, but to get mentally prepared to return to class I decided to watch some horrible movies. The Flintstones was one of the movies I chose, and then I gave "King Of The Streets" (British title 'Alien Warrior') to. Just before I finished, I found myself almost in tears over the waste of everything ... my life, the movie, the 2 pounds I paid for it a few weeks ago in the Blockbuster ex rental section, the time it must have been accepted to print the sleeve of art, the efforts of the editors and the musicians involved in the soundtrack (how insignificant their efforts were) ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> I like bad movies. Let me make this perfectly clear - I love watching blockbuster movies. Me and my friend Dan sat and watched many, many horrors of lavender and laughed at them. But that was another kind of lousy movie. I don't think anything will happen to that, nor does Tobe Hooper's "Death Trap" (which is probably my second worst movie in the world). The whole, when the car was almost killed from some of the abandoned parts; repeating music on any occasion, regardless of screen events; whole .... AAAGGGHHHHHHH !!!!! I can't even continue this "critical" dissection because my reflex started. The futility of this film, even now, three years after I watched it for the first and last time, still doesn't tell me (but I can still write). The whole "making car from strange parts" section has led me to think about terrible things. <br /> <br /> I encourage you if you are interested in watching this movie, just look at the video cover and imagine the worst possible version of the synopsis story on the back. I can almost guarantee that it won't be half as bad as this movie is. Under no circumstances should you consider watching for some reason. Not if you are a Christian and want to see the allegory of Christ; not if you are a bad movie afictionado and want to experience the true nadir baskets; even if you want your life to look longer (and believe me, it looks like a minute for every second of this movie). Don't be mistaken, this movie is rude. It is an antichrist in video form. As Bo Cattlett in Get Shorty said, "I saw a better film on my teeth".
