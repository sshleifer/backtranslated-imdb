It's rare to see a movie that strikes in every aspect, but "Caligula" must certainly have this title. I'm not sure what's more horrible; violence, sexual perversity, acting or plot (or its serious lack). Two and a half hours basically follow the rise of the infamous Roman Caesar "Caligula" to the throne at 37AD and show the atrocities and perversity he allegedly committed in power. Acting is lifeless and boring - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Of course, knowing that this film really lacks anything legitimately interesting, the directors have decided to throw away as much nudity and orgy as possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't make it easy, or they don't dare to abhor this movie. Working with the camera is delicate, the dialogue is ridiculous, in fact you would have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face across these color lines. And then there's violence .... <br /> <br /> Get ready to see the movie. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through writing) but through outrageous acts of violence that have little meaning or purpose other than to repel the viewer. This is the only goal this film has achieved. One has to wonder how the creators of this film thought they would appeal to someone appealing, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few). When it is over two and a half hours late, you take nothing but the disturbing images and knowledge you may have witnessed the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> You were warned
