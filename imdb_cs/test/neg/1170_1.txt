The title says everything - Ed Gein, Plainfield Butcher. It's not a zappy action movie full of high energy teen movies. This would fit into a well-established genre that some people consider amusing, something like "Halloween" or "Massacre in Texas." It is dark, slow, filled with chopped corpses and silently evil. There are few shocks, no monster shots, no loud electronic score. I don't know who it is - maybe ghouls. Under the credits we can see pictures of skulls, dead bodies, skins draped over the backs of chairs, things like that. And they're rebellious enough to think that this movie should be pretty good for this Grand Guignol to open. Unfortunately, it is not. Acting is just as bad as high school. The script tries to sink under vulgarity. Ed Gein, who only killed two middle-aged women and maybe his brother, chases a screaming, bloody young woman through the Weir forest and wears only a modern bra and bikini rather than period lingerie. Gein also decapitates a nightguard who has never done in any historical sense. <br /> <br /> Direction? You can do a better job. In the first few minutes, lawyers discovered an abandoned car with blood splattered across the windshield. Nobody is there. A handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests that they seek a victim who can still be near and live. The sheriff, who has no motivation, yells at him, "Now just forgive me! It should be just an exchange of views that resembles business. Why does the director have such anger? The characters of diverse species listen to radio programs or recordings that play old jazz pop songs - for example, Louis Armstrong "Ain't Misbehaving". This is - what - rural WISCONSIN in the fifties? And the characters insist on music that would appeal to Cotton Club customers in Harlem in the 1930s or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. No way. The radio will play Kitty Kallen's "Wheel of Fortune" or Theresa Brewer or, like probably, Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between music and events adds anything to our understanding of what is happening under the paintings. Someone who was involved in the production liked old jazz pop songs, that's all. Of course, with a low budget you can only do so much, but it can be light years before this butcher. Look at "Ed Gein", with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way to deal with this madman and his fondness for dead bodies, and for a budget that couldn't exceed this power. These comments are based on the first twenty minutes of the film. That's about as far as I could. If someone finds out that this story is, in any case, well done and fascinating, they should try to look at his taste. It's mine down here - and I consider myself pretty crooked.
