Not all the films made in 1931 are so creaky, and the fact that it was "the best picture" had to further stimulate the development of television. Typical of all Ferber novels, it's not possible to bring the whole story to the screen, not to mention character development. Dix - so stable in the first third of the film - makes a face, but no one knows why and makes no sense. And what is there about Dunne that makes her so stoic? Edna May Oliver's scenes are priceless, as usual. This film plays a role in the history of the movie, but it is long and boring.
