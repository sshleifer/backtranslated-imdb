Killjoy 2 beats the first movie just a bit bit. Things that improved here were acting, Killjoy makeup and a story. It is rather a gore fest, it has no supernatural elements like the first one. In this installment, Killjoy kills his victim in more common ways, he doest to set them on fire, and he doesnt shoot with bullets that were in his mouth. half assed, in fact it was half assed, they killed Killjoy in a very cheap way.I would strongly recommend it to anyone who likes horror movies.Seriously, the first movie was good, but the second is better.
