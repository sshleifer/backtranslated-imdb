Boat holiday, married couple, angry waiter and shipwreck are the reasons why this movie begins. <br /> <br /> I like breasts. No question about it. However, when the main character joins the one who currently has the most fish, mostly by having sex with them and playing a permanent sacrifice, my anger just rises to a whole new level. Take two boys (husband and another man), put a clean bomb on them, take a woman on a desert island, collect all her moral questions, write a lot of moral questions for men and mix them in a big bowl of arguments, fish and zippo lighters and you come up with such a piece of unwanted film. Behavior is, I would say, well. There are some bloopers, but not many if I could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to a lack of moral values. The person with the biggest fish gets her attention. Although one of them is her husband, she sees no problem of being unfaithful to a man (Manuel) because "I have to do it to survive". How can you justify sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30 feet away? And will it not benefit from it? Female women have absolutely no problems justifying whatever they do. If he does not agree with her behavior, it is a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to look at this movie. This is the kind of movie that will do just about everything else you see this year in a pleasant movie experience.
