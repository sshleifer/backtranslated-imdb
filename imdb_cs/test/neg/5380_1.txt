Why???? What a disgusting joke about the supposed movie ... from the poster it looked like a cute movie ... what a disappointment ... who the hell is the male lead? He looks like an old retarded retirement officer ... I'm a cop and I can say ... the man can't act ... come back to being a cop. ass as if it was Mel Gibson, "hell not ... put the filmmaker out of business .. this guy has no business making a movie ... I seriously doubt that women or homosexuals consider him appealing ... anyone is no movie a talent hack that cast no talent hacks in the lead .. it's great that white guys are always getting asian women but why ugly white guy why not dean cain or brad pitt as white friend .. why asian women like ugly white boys or blacks in what I see ??? Don't get it .. must be low self esteem .. <br /> <br /> The only hot girl who can act in the movie was Kate Holliday .. why was there one hot white chick among all the other ugly Asian chicks they think that they are hot and can act ??? Only two actors in this film Poetry Host at the End of the Movie and One Hot White Chick in the Massage House .. TL Young and Kate Holliday should be the film leaders .. <br /> <br /> The Asian character was ridiculous looking like she was trying to be too heavy to be a ghetto / sexy black girl ... the keyword here is "trying to" .. <br /> <br /> Gina .. you can't act and you are not hot enough physically for this kind of role .. you have to play character role and be more humble in your own presentation .. i think the actress is gina hirazumi ... i watched her on IMDb and she is a great asian actress ???? If that is the case, I do not want to see what bad Asian American actresses are .. <br /> <br />. No wonder Hollywood doesn't have Asian American actors !!! if it's the best they got !!! reportedly won an Asian film award? Give me a break ... it looked like they were just making a movie to give them a lot of Asian girls. they're not even hot .. Gina ... you're not hot .. stop trying .. play character roles and improve your playing. You are not the leading female type ... <br /> <br /> If these movies make money, pigs can fly .. so that they are so dull, but I feel that these actors / actresses need to either improve or work on your craft: except for the two actors I mentioned who should play the lead. I say this in love with all Asian leading girls in the movie, please do what your parents say and go and be doctors / lawyers / engineers ... and do on the fun side .. so that that's what you're doing now .. i'm not trying to be mediocre but hoping it will read and push you guys to get one better or go to another business .. there wasn't even a message ethically in this movie .. he was not surprised if "Soap Girls" was secretly funded by Ku Klux Kl members of the Asian American Hate Propaganda Department of the Clan. Otherwise, Asian people have to hate themselves. I'm not Asian .. people are pathetic. .Is Asian people.
