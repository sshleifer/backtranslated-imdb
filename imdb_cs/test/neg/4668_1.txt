First. I don't look at Americans. I know a lot of people who are intelligent people from the USA. But this movie is so bad that I had to comment. First, the movies are mostly far from the truth. This film is no exception. Lots of scenes are so incredibly false. For example, the departure of two spacecraft. You see how they fall out of full tanks in space. Just a little distance from each other. Remember what caused the shuttle to explode in the past? Just the little winning part that came out. Here is just the ordinary to drop fuel tanks that are large, if not larger than the entire ship. What idiot would let 2 spaceships pick up and do it at the same time ??? Second, the Russian station is a piece of crap. I hate it to bring you, but today astronauts travel to Russia. Because their equipment is much more reliable than NASA. The shuttle is retired. And NASA uses it only to pay off bills. And there is no better alternative. And the list of great girls goes on and on. This is really an insult to people who take space travel seriously. And I know about half as much as these guys do. But the most unpleasant part (read: full movie) is Propaganda and Patriot crap that u choking. MY GOD !!!! I thought I was looking at CNN's commercial ad for an hour. Actors solve their minor problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they face, starting to fight, ignoring the police, etc. Etc. But as for their love for their country and sacrifice their lives, suddenly all stand in line to commit suicide for it (bomb detonator) ??? Maybe I miss the feeling that I'm a real "Patriot" who can sing the national anthem back in Swahili. While driving with George Bush behind the wheel of a golf cart, you drive in circles until the battery is empty. But this film was too complicated for me. And when I finally caught and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the American flag out of my hiney. I realized I was glad that this movie was finally done. I don't know why so many good actors were involved in this narrow-minded, stereotypical, propaganda film. But I'm sorry. This represents a country where you can get murder if you have money or power. Until "Uncle Sam" thinks you're a good patriot. Where everyone is happy if it is another country that has been destroyed, no one cares.
