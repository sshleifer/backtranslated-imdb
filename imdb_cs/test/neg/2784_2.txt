Right to the video and with good reason. It's like neighboring children playing in the yard, but worse. A young man (Don Digiulio) has inherited a farm in West Virginia that has been asleep for several generations. He decided to marry a few friends to check the property. This agricultural land served to produce good grain crops, even during the Great Depression. The secret is that the owner murdered people and watered the field with their blood. Then hang their bodies like scarecrows. Special effects are quite lame and terrible dialogues are full of unfair single-line lines and joking so ridiculous that the sound can be better off. Cheap gore and false horrors. Along with Digiulio in the cast: Jeanie Cheek, B.W. York, Booty Chewning, and Jessica Dunphy.
