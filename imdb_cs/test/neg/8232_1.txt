This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther who wears metal dental prostheses, bites people on his neck and goes after clucking like a chicken without waving his hand. He also thinks he's a chicken. Sounds bizarre? For me, it's more bizarre and stranger, the better you are, the better. The more gore, the better and so on. The film begins with a record that decides whether to release a maniac from his institution. They mentioned that in prison he created some dental prostheses that he used to bite people on his neck. He also clucks like a chicken and thinks he's a chicken. If I had a patient like this, there's no way I could release him. First, Luther heads for a supermarket and attacks an old woman on the bench and walks away. Then he sneaks into the back seat of a woman's car and goes up to her home. While in the house, Luther ties a woman to bed. When daughter's daughter and her daughter's friend return home, Luther hides. Later in the film, a policeman comes to the door and asks for his mother. You can clearly see that the daughter is frightened of her mind and crying, but the officer is still asking if everything is fine. He says everything is fine. The officer finally gets in the car and leaves. If I ever saw a woman crying and looking scared, I would at least get inside the house to explore a little. The end is so stupid. While the woman in the barn, she starts clucking and gets Luther excited, so she starts to walk her hands waving and clucking like a maniac. Finally he shoots at him and just sits for a while before finally catching up. Then the credits will return. <br /> <br /> This is one of the STUPIDEST movies I've ever seen! Nothing happens in the woman's house! NOTHING! Sometimes I like the movies from the camp, but this really bores me. I'm giving this movie 1 star of ten.
