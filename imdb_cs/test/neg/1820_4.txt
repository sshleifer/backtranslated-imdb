It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this somewhat obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. Can't understand how talented Mr. Rickman gets into these average movies? Judas Kiss boasts some amazing actors, interesting conspiracies and interesting twists, but his strange visual wandering and editing patterns have destroyed what might have been a great criminal drama. Many scenes seem to lack vital information to explain the characters' actions: Why was our hero immediately suspected of being bosses? Why didn't he trust the detective he replaced? There were times when I honestly couldn't tell if the director thought Judas Kiss was a legitimate crime act or campsite. Why else would he be throwing in the topless / extraterrestrial / lesbian porn scene in the first two minutes (this little surprise certainly tore me out because my kids were playing nearby!)? Did he deliberately instruct his two major English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such horrible new Orlean accents? As Alan Freak, I admit that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a tousled, tired, tired way to behave at home. Judas Kiss is not a great movie but has some interesting moments, but I do not recommend it if you are not trying to dive into Alan Rickman.
