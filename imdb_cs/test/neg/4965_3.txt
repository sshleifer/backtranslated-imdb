I read about this movie online and after seeing the generally positive reviews it received and viewing the trailers I decided to check it out for myself. What a disappointment! It's getting pretty good. the opening scene was actually pretty tense, but from here it's all downhill. I see that the filmmakers tried to do something else with this film, but by watching him they took all the pleasure. These choices, combined with "C.S.I" adjustments, music and montage usage, lack of tension, fear, or humor drag this film. There is too much foreboding and many "subtle" tracks, so when the first twist comes soon, you already know how the movie will end. I gave the movie three stars because I think the cast did a good job than I can't recommend this movie.
