Frankly, I didn't think there was anything funny about this movie. It was really lame and poorly done without any conspiracy. Surprisingly, there was a laugh at the Malcolm X terminal, and that was about it. Seriously, Soul Plane did even the worst movies like Gigli look like Emmy's winner. This movie is not really worth seeing unless you were blind as Johnny Witherspoon, who played a blind man in the movie (another sad character). I crouched at most stereotypical jokes and destroyed Tom Arnold and D.L Hughley by dropping them in this movie. This film can be summarized in one sentence. Nashawn wins $ 100,000,000 and creates his own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, did I mention sex? If I could rate this film in negative whole numbers, the start was fun, which will bring this movie to 1/10. Do "t bag" pfft!
