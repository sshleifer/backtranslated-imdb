This is an officially horrible, boring, frantic and absurd video ever created. The film is about a crazy boy and his friends and lands at 747. His dreams are very scaly and have no sense and are very bad. Every special effect looks like it was done without any modern technology, and a guy who plays a "lead role" in the movie could be created. If you watch this movie, it will definitely make you stupid. I recommend that you never consider watching this movie, and if so, good luck and don't miss the brain cells you've killed. Nor did my comment fully comprehend the horrible creature of hell that was made. The person who wrote the comment in front of me did not follow the same movie that I watched horribly, and I wish I never saw. Peace.
