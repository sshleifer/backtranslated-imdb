First, the current description of the IMDb graph seems misleading, the film is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynist tracker who plans to kill them all. He stops at a small motel where he holds them hostage but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence follows. I took this mistake by mistake and thought it was the next 2007 movie, The Hitcher. Not that Hitcher was a little better, and I was looking for a slow movie that would be the same he watched, but sometimes it was almost unbearable. I think I could throw up a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than that. I can't even count how many movies I've seen with virtually the same story, so it was sometimes almost painfully predictable, but what really made it horrible was a few scenes that ... well let me give you an example . At one point the door is covered with blood (which is obviously) blood and two police officers on the scene calling from 911 are looking at her from 30 feet away, see a man who is also covered with blood. The door, he agrees that it looks suspicious, but decides not to investigate further. But, however ridiculous it may be, the film has never been boring, was well made, directed and acted, complete with good special effects, gratuitous nudity and violence. I probably wouldn't recommend actually spending 90 minutes of my life sitting to watch this movie, but it turned out to be ideal to have for a while I cleaned my cellar. Also highly recommended for fans of crazy movies, and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan to do more talking than watching.
