[possible spoilers] <br /> <br /> The sixth "Halloween" movie is a totally depressing thing, but unfortunately not as the filmmakers imagined. Now everyone knows the story of being massacred and released in such a sloppy, incoherent form. In particular, the other half makes no sense, because the elements of the plot are introduced and dropped, seemingly random. The full end of my head scratched my head. What the hell happened? Is Dr. Loomis dead or what? This is what you get when you give a shameless hack in charge of a movie. It's not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> This is a graphically strongest record in the series. I have no problem with gore if it is in the right place, but this movie takes it to the absurd levels. The infamous exploding head must be a new series. It seems that Michael himself is looking forward to murdering another human being, which is contrary to his effective, methodical approach to John Carpenter's original. I'm not entirely sure who was responsible; director Joe Chappelle or producers, probably a combination of both. I would be delighted if I would grant pardon to all those involved if they just released the legendary "Producers' Cut", which is a more complete version of the film, which is a huge improvement from each account. From what I understand, it's a completely different film. I offer to pay the full price for buying a DVD if Miramax comes to his senses and releases it. However, there are some good elements. The idea that Michael is controlled by the Druids is interesting. Paul Rudd is as solid as Tommy Doyle, whose look is an elegant tie with the original. Neat visuals help to make driving a little more attentive. But these modest offers are overshadowed by the overload of the jerk we have to deal with. Finally, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is known as Donald Pleasance's latest film. Many of his scenes have been eliminated from the final cut, and when he appears, he seems fragile and unhappy. The film is dedicated to his memory, glaring (if he is an unintentional insult) if he was one. The fact that a talented artist should end his career is too depressing to think about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (outside ****) <br /> <br /> Released Dimension movies
