Being a fan of the game and watching this movie physically vomited me !! It was a horrible movie, though the story was similar to a game conspiracy. the whole thing of super human soldiers. Except that Jack Carver, all the American men in the game, is playing German, unless it is some twisted irony, that's what made me pull the middle finger on the TV screen. The fact that you can say that the film was filmed in the woods in the middle of what seemed to be mid-summer is impossible because the game takes place in the tropical rainforest, while the director just looks out the window into the window. in the morning and went "that's a good forest." THIS IS ALL HOUSE DIRECTORS: If you are going to make a movie based on a game / book, understand it and ask the fans for it ... don't just play for an hour and assume you know it !!!
