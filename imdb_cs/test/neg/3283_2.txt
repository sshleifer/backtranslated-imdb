If you haven't seen the "Home War", let me tell you what's missing. It is a showcase of ethnic diversity and sexuality that could only be nervous and entertaining in the 1960s. Where America has grown in accepting races, sexual preferences, religions, etc., this show seems to argue with this progress. It's a step back in America's development. For example, one of the ongoing jokes of this show is that WHITE's daughter goes to school with a black guy. This is obviously a hilarious look as you don't see this type of relationship in any business center in America. I lived in small towns and big cities, so don't give me any red state, blue state apologies. Not only is this a joke, but a father who allegedly is not racist, finds it worrying and asks his daughter to repeatedly break up with his friend who is against his "he may sound racist, but he's just a stupid" character. If this is not enough, the second running joke is that one of the sons, and soon to be metropolitan, is ambiguous in sexual orientation. The audience learns over and over again that it is not gay, but the father is not convinced that he is constantly avoiding his son, worried that his son will hit him because all the homosexuals are nymphomic wild men who can 'control their will. A father always comes to any acceptance of his son, once for a show, but usually goes about avoiding him in the following episode. the only way this show can heal itself in my eyes is if there is a continuous exposure to these "unnatural events in life", a little open your father's eyes, but that may be too much to ask - And besides, with such jokes, I'm sure we'll have in episodes to resemble merriment - Episode 13, "Father Votes Against Female Voters", and Episode 14, "My Muslim Neighbor is a Terrorist". Please release this show, FOX. We live in a world different from that of your managers.
