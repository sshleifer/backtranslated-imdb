Like most moviegoers, I am an avid reader of books. The first 2 films have the main characters of Buck, Ray and Chloe, but in this second sequel they play on the other side of the presidential effort of Louis Gossett JR. The world at war is based on the meeting he has with Buck in the book series. The problem is - this film is as terrible as the first two. Amanda only appears from nothing and suddenly has a significant role to play (I won't reveal it in case someone does not read the show). Other illogical parts. I really want Cloud 10 to make a good movie, but unfortunately it's similar in all the wrong ways to the first.
