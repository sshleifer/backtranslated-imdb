Six months after Laura's sprinter school died during the race, the murderer starts killing the rest of the team, who uses various sports equipment as weapons: this is a plot of the early 1980s, Graduation Day graduation, a subtle genre supplement that offers very little in style, originality or grace gore. <br /> <br /> Some of the tremendously horrible musical interludes, some familiar faces (including the early queen-like appearance), are what this brings. Linnea Quigley) and the shaking of nudity (the assumption of any slasher movie!). So don't forget the deadly scenes? Are they lame and rather bloodless? crap elements: quick editing that can trigger migraines and epileptic seizures; a war disco that is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song, 'Gangster Rock', performed by the unforgettablely horrible Felony; improvised sitting of school students; Christopher George coaches her as Michaels; and a cheese music teacher who leaves her students (who for some reason find him quite irresistible?!?!). Towards the end of the film, the event rises a little, with the discovery of the bodies of the losers under the tribunes and a pretty twisted scene with Laura's body in her cap and gown, but it all comes to the end of the day to save the film before average.
