Thank God I didn't buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity, and of course, after seeing it, he feels that he should be paid! This must be one of the worse movies I've ever seen! I realize they couldn't have had a lot of budget, but I swear I could do a better film than staring at pets! Acting was terrible, as was editing, dialogue, ALL! It was so bad that I was really angry when I watched it! I look forward to the REAL movie that this story will be coming out soon so that people curious about it won't be looking to watch this joke!
