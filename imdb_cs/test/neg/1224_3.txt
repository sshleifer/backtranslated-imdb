Lonesome Dove is my favorite Western second only for The Searchers with John Wayne. I watch Lonesome Dove about every 6 months and I never enjoy it. I've read all the LD books, though I can't remember many of the Comanche Moon. I also enjoyed this mini-series and decided to upload it to our DVR so that we can push through the ads quickly. Unfortunately, I went wrong and did not record the first part, but decided to follow the other parts and try to pick them up. No one who could ever compete with Robert Duvall or Tommy Lee Jones, and I expected to be disappointed and I was. Although there were so many things that weren't true, I was most obvious when Nellie died the day before and Gus was out. range, it passed to Clara to write him a letter from Nebraska telling him how sorry she was to hear about her death. How could she know the next day in Nebraska in the world? In addition, it was to be 7 years later after her departure, and her children seemed to be about 6-7 years old, perhaps a little younger, yet more time continued before they actually moved to Lonesome Dove, and in Lonesome Dove they had \ t there was about 10 years or more before leaving for Montana. When they stopped at Clara in Nebraska, which probably lasted another 6 months on the route, the girls seemed to be about 10-13 because they were playing in the yard like little kids. Mathematics simply doesn't count. I agree that the man who played Gus had a lot of his mannerism and looked a bit like Gus, who looked like a young man. I'm also a little confused about one thing. Captured by a white girl they brought - was it the one they captured when they invaded Austin? They said she was captured 25 years ago, but if she was captured in Austin, it was only 7 years later when it happened in the movie. Was she captured earlier? I remember seeing a captured girl when they invaded the city and didn't know if it was the same. If anyone can explain it because I missed Part 1. If it was 25 years old, it will probably be over 40 years old when they found it because it looked like it was lying on the ground. Also, the way they ravaged her when she was captured is hard to believe she would live to be married and have Indian children. I must admit that nothing is worse than John Voight playing Call in Lonesome Dove's sequel or Lorena's incredible marriage to Pea Eye in McMurty's sequel to Lonesome Dove, which has never been explained. Also, the way he killed Newt off, I heard that it's happening for them to continue with John Voight without his consent.
