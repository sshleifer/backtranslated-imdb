Slightly fun and confidently cheezy - but what else could it be? Cushing in one of his poorest roles, and he often sounds dubbed. McClure is just too Cheezy to believe him, but who can blame him in the wilderness of this movie whose plot of ancient people-dominating dinosaurs has a 19th century return of "period charm" but not enough, and unfortunately the script carries the racist connotations of the literary genre into films. Nice effort of actors, but poorly conceived production.
