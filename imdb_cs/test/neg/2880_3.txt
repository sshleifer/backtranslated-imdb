While I can see potentially redeemable qualities in this film through its intrigue, I certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene was playing was too much for most viewers to ask. Huge holes in the script, such as the never-explained "your father died today," have made it even harder for the mother to make these characters meaningful. <br /> <br /> In Cannes in 2001 he won first place, which is a shock considering. Perhaps the French had a hungry film noir that year and desperately wanted something as sadistic as this movie. I understood the long scenes as a device that would keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but when I dealt with the inability to connect with the main character, it was too far away for me and held me completely away from the story. This is a movie only for the most dedicated film noir fan and one who doesn't expect any satisfaction from watching the movie once it is over. I LOVED movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which were much more intrusive, but at least brought the viewer something to edit and stimulate. To see how slow and painful the silent scene after the scene has become so useless that I thought it tiring - and I really wanted to do it every step of the way.
