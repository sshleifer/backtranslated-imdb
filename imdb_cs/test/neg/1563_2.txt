The strange coincidence I started following this move after Brice de Nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be the worst than Brice de Nice, so I was really looking forward to something better to forget about this horrible flop. Unfortunately, OSS-117 disappointed me again - I don't know, maybe it's just a translation problem, but since "Diner de Cons" I haven't seen any French comedy I would call really good. Even if I look at reviews on IMDb, only people from France give high notes OSS-117 ... <br /> <br /> For me this movie really didn't work - in some parts it is as fun as real Bond movies, in others jokes were a bit too predictable or too spicy.
