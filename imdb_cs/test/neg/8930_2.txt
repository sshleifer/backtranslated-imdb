Steven Seagal is back! This year with his third film. Of course, as one fan who has become increasingly dissatisfied, I can say that it is not surprising that it is enough lame. First the film made headlines because of obvious problems in production due to Seagal. He would appear late on stage, change the screenplay, crew, etc. And generally cause problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent his problems enough!). It also becomes in their second collaboration an upcoming mercenary who promises to be as bad as this waste. It also means a big break in Seagal's career because this movie is the first to really dig the footage. It was a little bit in Ticker, but this movie has a biscuit. They borrow bits from, order (Van Damme movie, Seagals biggest rival in DTV movies!) No code of behavior, undisputed, and also the whole action sequence from the little-known Peter Weller to play the Top Of World vehicle. Interestingly, a car chase stolen from Well's epic, made almost 10 years ago and ironically cheaper than this waste, is in fact by far the best action movie scene. I was quite shocked when Dolph Lundgren had a short stint in the world of action video games that he had fortunately escaped. Although Seagal is the leader of the DTV action market at the same time, with Van Damme and Snipes his main rivals. Seagal still can sell movies and I don't know how to live. Surely fans must be bored of this horror, desiring to return to similar Laws. The story here is completely lame. In fact, the film has so much hole plot that it's not bare to think. For example, at the end of the movie there is a little girl who Seagal apparently knows at an orphanage he gives a necklace. Why I don't know, but we never see or hear it in the rest of the movie. In this film, Seagal has a girlfriend who is psyche at the beginning of the film and is haunted by visions that are never explained to the end of the film and mean nothing. The film is so ridiculously glued together by a series of insignificant paps that it becomes headaches. This is by far the stupidest movie of Seagal! Seagal himself is as old as ever, but he can't get into his credit as I could say. However, Seagal feels the need to speak as if he were a gangsta rapper, which forced me in those classic early films to spend the days of having his Brooklyn / Italian-American accent. He also has a painfully unfair double act with Treach, who suppose he's a rapper. It's funny how producers seem to think that Seagal's combos, plus a hip-hop star seem to work, because his DMX team at Exit Wounds was his most successful film since Under Siege. Clearly, if no one has heard of the rapper, it won't work. However, it is an action film and therefore the action itself must be considered. Unfortunately, the action that did not come out of the NU Image back catalog is strict. There are a few small battle scenes with some of the classic Seagal Aikido, but when 90% is done by his double stuntman, who has really hard work in this movie, he doesn't really impress. There are also some standard weapons fighting that really just have some nice violent and bloody squibbage to go for them. All in all, it is a painfully boring experience and I left the same verdict again: Seagal lost it! I'm still asking the old question now, "Why do people still watch his movies?" This is a very good and good question, but a sad bastard who continues to watch his films in vicious hope that he can do something good again. Chances are slim, unlike Seagal's ever-expanding waist. * 1/2
