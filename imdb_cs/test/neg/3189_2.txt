One night at McCool wants you to think it's a modern and smart black comedy. It pushes his "weird" characters and "outrageous" situation with the viewer as a crack dealer doing overtime. The assumption is that it is a woman who deals with gold called Jewel, and who gives people to steal and sometimes murder, so that she can have all the mundane qualities she desires so desperately. That wouldn't be a bad strategy if she chased rich guys. This movie really wants you to believe that foxy con artist would lose time dating bartenders and Andrew "Dice" Clay. Please. The main mistake in Jewelova is really the only fun that has been found in this smelly (and that's unintentional). Watching it, it's not hard to believe it could be a good movie in it somewhere. One night at McCool, she simply couldn't decide which direction to go, so she was sitting in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. They are trying to be sexy, but no clothes are removed on the camera, and several scenes of the head body are terribly pedestrians. There is one recurring scene where a hitman asks a protaganist (played by Matt Dillon) about how sex is with Jewel. Looks like Matt doesn't even know the audience. Why did he go the same way? One night at McCool's also wants to be funny. Sorry, bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings or Three's Company didn't work. Worse, this film seemed to be going into a dark atmosphere to accompany his comedy. Something like Coen's sophomoric film, but his shallow scenario couldn't play subtlety, nor could he be in his shock. What is left to the audience is a film that seems to be busy trying to please everyone and just lose any attraction.
