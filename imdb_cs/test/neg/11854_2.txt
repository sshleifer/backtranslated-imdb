I'm a huge Eric Robers fan, I'm collecting his films and I'm getting 60. But I'm honest when I say he sometimes does really horrible movies. But hey, that's why I love him - he's funny. But this has to take a price, I can't wonder why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and Corbin Bernsen to the picture. While Bernsen is absolutely terrible (he really doesn't like it), Roberts is doing his best in the film (and that doesn't mean much). Practically, she does it routinely. The female lead (Brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and acts like one. And Tim Abell and his crew look like action plastic dolls and they act like you. <br /> <br /> The land is really awkward. I haven't seen any of the Carnosaur movies, so I can't remember the shots that were added there, but explains some things. But there are still huge holes like craters on the plot. <br /> <br /> ALERT SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The first attacks are located outside the lab in a nearby forest. Eventually, however, they inflate the whole lab in pieces and just relax that everything is over, but they forgot those who were outside ?????? <br /> <br /> When a helicopter pilot is alive, I wonder how she couldn't see T-rex climbing a helicopter ???? <br /> <br /> The boys in orange overalls are my favorite - what are they doing out there on a cross-country bike or what? Of course there is also a B-movie standard sex-scene with silicones. This time Lorissa McComas greets us. I have no problem saying that (looks terrible), but look at a guy squeezing her breasts and being on the verge of a climax for 8 !!!! minutes is just too long. Shame on all of you (including Eric Roberts) - now I'm looking forward to Con Cons (I wonder ???)
