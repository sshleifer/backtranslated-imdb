It could be some SPOILERS AHEAD, but I doubt it. I have no idea how the scenario for this did what happened around the crusher. That's horrible. Totally unobservable. I hung up there for 45 minutes (about half the running time) and I couldn't stand it anymore. I was a fan of Elijah Wood in the 1990s (see "War") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's moves from bubbling to serious this year (see "Chasing Liberty", which is surprisingly fun). I saw pieces of "Run Lola Run". So I liked the three leaders. It was not. No one was doing well. Wood's Jones was flat. He had no imagination for an aspiring writer (his violent fantasies seemed to have been torn from the "Christmas story" and his lusty ones were - huh, the cross between boring and alarming). Potente is absolutely relentless from the first second and I only know that she was supposed to be a "girl" by reading the box. Speaking of synopsis - the one who employed this job made the movie funny, unpredictable, romantic and quite enjoyable. Whoever the person was, should be employed to rewrite this script. I didn't care for any of the characters in half. Moore's Lisa is an aspiring actress who is spirited and a little conniving (for no apparent reason at all) but her ridiculous period of play (which is supposed to be funny in the presentation) is on par with the rest of the script. There is supposedly a happy, romantic comedy ending in this little way - given the nature of the material they've had to work with, I can't imagine it. Save your money. Warn your friends. Don't watch this movie.
