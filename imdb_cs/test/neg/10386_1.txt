Blackwater Valley Exorcism is located on a small town ranch where Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is a teenager wandering around the blood of dogs. Her parents, Ely (Randy Colton) and Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell), own a ranch and are deeply concerned about their daughter, she has not been alone recently and is considered a danger to herself and others. Ranch's hand and ex-Miguel (Del Zamora), a priest, recognize Isabel's symptoms as a possible possession & when he starts to speak an ancient Latin in a strange voice he can see. Blanche calls the priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo), who is her next daughter, Claire (Madison Taylor) ex husband to see Isabelle, confirms Miguel's suspicion and accepts the work of exorcism that hopefully expels the demon inside Isabelle and innocent girls for free. Director <br /> <br /> Director Ethan Wiley I sat there in my house before watching my Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I was still asking the same question why I'm doing it. Why am I still sitting in all those terrible low-budget horror movies that seem to have been filmed on the camcorder? Right allows you to be honest about Blackwater Valley Exorcism's complete total and totally unrecognized rip-off The Exorcist (1973) & you literally tick the main plot points that two shares. There's an obsessed teen girl who is getting horny & suggesting inappropriate things, a demon that uses past misdemeanour is against others, worried parents, the way an obsessed girl is shunned by a doctor, a priest with a troubled past and an obsessed girl is inter alia tied to bed. I assume that where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (other than total bullshit), it is that it tries to put everyone on the screen some time on the screen and tries to overcome how the situation affects them, but it's so badly written boring . The movie begins with Isabella, who was already obsessed, so we never knew what a normal person was, so we never care about her, nor what's happening to her, the rest of the character is badly written and supplemented. Sometimes I wondered if the Blackwater Valley's exorcism is a spoof, there's a stupid scene in which the vet tries to soothe Isabelle's obsessed with soothing horses and after he says he needs a "little prick" to enter his room with a huge needle hidden behind his back! There are several scenes in which people are embossed along with a silly comic sound effect. The result of the film is an uneven tone that moves between a stupid spoof and a serious horror drama, or at least in my opinion. According to some of the lyrics before the opening credits, Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on "Real Events", yeah, the real 1973 events that took place in the movie Exorcist ... This text also states that the exorcist scenes they were under the supervision of a real priest. There is no decent shout or exploitation to revive things, there is a scene of a cut arm, there's a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix and that's about it. There is no surprisingly bad language, even though the demon is trying to be offencive. I would like to imagine that the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has adult ratings is because of one very short scene in which a couple of breasts can be seen. One pair of naked female breasts is not worth watching this or the money you could spend on it. There is zero scares, no atmosphere and a really amateur feel to the whole movie too. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 1,000,000 I have to say that I was wondering where all the money went, the movie looks ugly and cheap. There are no special effects to talk about, and production values ​​are bottom. Acting is very bad from everyone involved, Jeffrey Combs's favorite genre gets close to top billing during the opening credits, but has nothing but a portrait of what is about five minutes of time screen. Even he had to worry about how bad it was to be hiding behind a mustache and a terrible accent, better than this. Blackwater Valley Exorcism is the utter troublemaker of the Exorcists without anything that made the film such classics and creators, it's thirty-five years too late. Total Turkey from start to finish.
