Now I remember what the "indie" filmmakers excused before Pulp Fiction. It was David Lynch, wasn't it? I caught this thing to see Kyle Secor. What a waste of perfectly good Bayliss. It was so painful to watch him, as if someone you love is terribly ill and there is nothing you can do. Almost every clich√© in the book: desert, psycho, bizarre crowd boss, cyclist, Tracy Walker (who, fortunately, was only on one scene, but I expected to reappear and say something special and deep as "If a person wants to know where he is going, he has to see where he is," he said, or some sort of fake waste. I have a theory why so many indies are short in the desert. I think it's because they can save money on lighting . <br /> <br /> If you want to be in pain, find this movie and watch it, if you are a Kyle Secor fan, watch the Court TV homicide repeat, if you want a good, unpredictable road thriller, check out the Wild Heart There's a reason nobody has heard of Delusion! My God, this is a waste of a good title.
