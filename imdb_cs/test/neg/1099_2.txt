It starts in Pennsylvania in 1913. A bunch of children is killed in a mine explosion deliberately set out by the mine owner. Cut to 2006. Recently widowed Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) are moving to a remote house near this mine. What they do not know are the ghosts of young children scare the woods and kill anyone who is around after dark. Slow and boring horror movie. The assumption is obvious and has already been made to death. The story also has big gaps in logic. It is never clear why these children will kill someone or why they then body their bodies (yes - it's shown). They are already dead - why do they need food? And why didn't the main villain get in the story long ago? He was nearby. Why try this time? Also, the characters are not a bit sympathetic. Sarah hit the worst. He has several saving graces. The place is beautiful and scary at the same time, some of the murders were very bloody and brutal, and the children themselves looked scary quietly walking through the woods at night. But overall, I was bored and struggled to stay awake. You can skip this.
