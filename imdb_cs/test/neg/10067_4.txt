From the fertile imagination that led you to the irresistible HERCULES (1983), it comes even more absurd (read goofier) ​​sequel: we get another impractical prologue of "the beginning of time" right from the bat, which even contradicts these events as totally contrary. set up in the first movie!; the shortened splicing of lights from the same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN-type shift sequence. Narrative-wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven all-important (but poorly animated) flashes? a crime that sets one month's cascade on a collision course with Planet Earth for one thing! Faster than you can say "nepotism", Zeus sends his champion again as a white-haired bearded man of relatively young Claudia Cassinelli? who has now rightly taken up his position among the elite thanks to the almighty tasks that took place in the first film? Find his blooming thunderstorms and distract the calamities in the store. First, Hercules (Lou Ferrigno, as if you didn't know) touched the earth's surface, which comes in contact with two attractive damsels (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) who need to get out of need !; the former (who would go on to become an Italian television personality) seemingly has the ability to talk to Little People (!) ??? that look unusual as little GODZILLA VS sisters. MOTRA (1964) !! Just so they could cheat so many unutilzed footage of the first movie, as humanly possible, the divine villain quartet resurrected the good ol 'King Minos (William Berger again) from his skeletal sleep and rebuild it against his eternal enemy. Typically, Hercules is made to meet a number of potentially deadly enemies including the Gorgon? a terribly underproduced sequence that was supposed to lead to a plagiarism suit, the filmmakers for much better CLASH TITANS (1981) bothered to watch this movie. preceded by his muscleman let the viewers in his tactics before performing them as if to show us how clever he is! And just to be crystal clear that he wears his sleeve influences, Cozzi has Hercules and Minos to turn one of their battles into a cosmic version of "King Kong vs. Godzilla," and later King Kong closes a big snake. the meeting rose directly from the classic 1933 original. I swear: it's all true and nothing but truth! As with the first film, the cast is full of old relics like Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as a wizard with a really bad hair bottom). and coming stars ?? not only Carlucci, but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as the younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and again Eva Robbins (whose costume overcomes her appearance in the first film); For what's worth, Pino Donaggio's score for this one recycled from the musical stimulus featured in his soundtrack for the previous movie. So far, if you've been stuck in this review, you have to realize that this is one of those films that is so incredibly bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course he will have: either reject him in one unflattering sentence or spend a considerable time , which discusses its shortcomings. I'm sure I missed some of his ruthlessness, but I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't mention one of the biggest laughing nude instances in the whole movie, which almost got rid of my chair (yes, it even surpassed the above-mentioned animated titanic duel for me) and to decorate the rebellious den of the gods, which is in the shape of a giant marble kettle !! wonder why I put this movie (and its predecessor) rating instead of (not entirely unfounded) BOMB; In the past, I had several lengthy on-line discussions about whether star rating of a particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its pure entertainment value? but these are the two cases where I thought it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in his final assessment. I don't know: maybe it's because I'm currently in the "sword and sandal condition" (with another 10 more serious examples scheduled for the following days!) I decided to add these two movies to my DVD collection simply based on the fun I am with them in this recent search? and the only thing that has to do with something, right?
