I can't believe I actually sat the whole movie. A friend rented it because the jacket sounded good. The jacket was right in defense; Someone was supposed to sleep at night. From the jacket it sounded like it was on the same level as Freddy, Jason, or maybe "The Shining". It cannot be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of minimalist and / or surrealistic movies, you can enjoy it. If you're looking for a good movie or a couple of excitement, go for a Jason vs. Freddy IV rental - you'll have a much better night.
