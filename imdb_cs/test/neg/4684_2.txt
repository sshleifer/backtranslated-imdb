That's terrible, you just can't believe it. The score is uncomfortable, filming is bad, for example, sometimes you see a shadow of a cameraman who appears on some actors. The quality of the film is very poor, it seems to have been done in the 1920s. It's scary. There's some blood in the beginning and through the film, but it's always too dark. No gore any effects. The director did something better than the Blood Rites. But outside there is a man following, 'Cause finding a cheap movie isn't that hard, but you have to pay hard earned money for it. Surely it will get into my top ten worst horrormovies at all, I don't know if I would call it horror. There is too much talk you will have bloodthirsty after watching
