One of my favorite "bum" actors, C. Tom Howell, stars in this warm WOTW remake. Runs a lot as a CGI-generated spider-like machine goes around killing everyone. The budget for this was obviously quite low. It was also one of Asyl's productions. Have you seen any of these? Yikes! I'm not sure why anyone would do it, while the large budget version of Spielberg killed them at the box office. And if the truth is told, no version is so hot. The 1950s version of George Pal remains the best representation of H.G. Wells, primitive special effects and everything. Perhaps because Gene Barry was more convincing than Howell or Tom Cruise.
