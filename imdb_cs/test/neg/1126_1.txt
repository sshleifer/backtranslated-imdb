OK ... this is to include Spoilers ... but who's really old? If you do not appreciate the seconds of your life, you are wasting your time on this pile of garbage. There is not one redeeming quality in this movie ... and I say it's a full-blown holiday movie fan. I loved cousin Eddie from other holiday movies ... but he works only as a side character. Do I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie? Not at all. I think he's a great actor ... but this movie lacks any coherence ... he's gone ... it's just rude. And the actor who plays "Third" ... Jake Thomas ... was just terrible, more than likely due to a real lack of direction. I don't know why ... but his whole character crept up. Some people say it's a horrible movie because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo aren't there ... it has nothing to do with it. Script, direction, playing ... special effects ... everything is a train wreck. With orphans. And kittens. Oh ... and the train ran over the old people. Please, whatever you do ... stay away from this dirt! I call it dirt because it is the name of Franchise's holiday.
