He just saw this movie in the opening night. I read some other user comments that convinced me to see ... I must say, I wasn't impressed. I am so fearless that I feel it is necessary to write this commentary to save some of you some money. It might be scary for someone under the age of 13, but it really didn't do anything to me. The peak was ridiculous and most viewers stayed before the film resolution. Besides, acting seemed a little superficial. Some emotional arguments between the family were less compelling than subconscious scenes. <br /> <br /> If you've seen previews for this movie, then you've seen most of the best parts and a strong understanding of the plot. This film is not worth seeing in theaters.
