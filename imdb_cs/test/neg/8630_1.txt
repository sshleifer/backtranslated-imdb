Man, this is a horrible movie. As with many horrific films, the structure of his horror rests in the script. This is such a poor attempt at a psychological thriller that gives the genre a bad name. Okay, here's one major problem: Sandra Bullock's character is kidnapped by Jeff Bridges in the car in a busy daylight shop. Somehow, her friend Kiefer Sutherland does not find a single witness of this act and subsequently spends most of the film entirely clueless as to her stay. Come on! Personally, I consider it absolutely offensive to the weakest members of the audience. Yet we are forced to buy into this nonsense. Even frustration is the misinterpreted action of Jeff Bridges. His character is certainly a little eccentric academic, but far from the sociopath who would do these things. He walks about ten minutes, gives or takes, spills his bean into Sutherland, why he has done his cruel actions. However, the explanation itself lacks the most fundamental sense of logic. Therefore, no intelligent member of the audience can truly believe in the possibility of his evil. And if you subtract this element from the story, the whole thing falls apart. Also for major reasons: -Jeff Bridges using a strange, pseudo-French accent without reason. - All the boring undercuts involving Nancy Travis, especially her rescue day by turning the tables on the bridges. A crazy woman who somehow remembers Jeff Bridge's license plate number that Lucky Charms is real. <br /> <br /> -Sandra Bullock's character name, Diane Shaver, conveniently re-scrambles to create the word "disappeared". Are you kidding me? - The logical impossibility of drugging, kidnapping and burying (in a very distant place) of a human being in forty minutes (as Bridges specifically mentions). This is the movie that made me forget the fictional, incredibly stupid (but very successful) character of Donald Kaufman in Adaptation. Many screenwriters are brilliant, inspired artists. Some are just bozos who persuade nitwity running studios to make their drivel. This particular scenario is so overwhelming that Donald Kaufman himself could sell it. Unfortunately for us all in the real world, Todd Graff actually did.
