I was thrilled to see this show when I started seeing A&E promo. I was fascinated by ghosts and paranormal because I was a kid, and I like to catch "Ghost Hunters" when it is on (SciFi channel). I tried to watch three episodes of "Paranormal State" and use only my time to comment on it because it's so bad and retains the idea that anyone who believes in paranormal is a trusting fool. "Paranormal State" is out of cheesy. Cheesy "Director's Diary" that allows you to wish Captain Kirk. Cheesy teasers go into commercial breaks that are completely taken out of context. Everything that is paranormal at this exhibition is automatically considered "evil" and the work of the demon spirit. Then come the exorcists, the demonologists, the psyche ... as in the "Poltergeist", almost expect the team to leave and say, "This house is clear." I very much appreciate the approach of "Ghost Hunters", where they try to disprove the claim, then take away what they can ... and they are almost always reassuring for the client (if they find something) that the creepy is not wrong. "Paranormal" is not "so bad that it's good" ... it's just bad. Wasn't A&E used to "art and entertainment"? The artistic part is long gone and the fun factor is now also diminishing.
