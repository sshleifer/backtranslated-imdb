This absurd gathering of self-indulgent improvisation on a big theme should be trapped in the repository along with a number of other unfinished Welles projects that no one has ever seen. Now we know why! To add another insult to previous injuries, the scary English language dubbing by amateur Americans dubbing actors and even the great guy alone just increases all the sloppy mistakes in telling story and construction. It's as if every weekend a good Spanish soul gave Orson a couple of pesos, a 35mm camera and some short ends of a negative film that remained after some other production, and told Welles to go to the Spanish countryside and just keep shooting everything and everything until the film store runs out. It is true that if Orson, instead of the notorious Jesus Frank, actually shaped this film, he could drive out 85% of what he shot, but we will never know. Welles has never done the time to adjust his own work here, and somewhere along the road he or his heirs have punished someone else to do, it is not entirely perfect for this debacle. Those wishing to prove that Welles was the happiest of the young men in his early days as he surrounded himself with John Houseman, Herman Mankewiecz, Greg Toland, Bernard Hermann, and Robert Wise need no better proof of their adult shortcomings than this film mess. In his sad old age, Welles was able to do anything when he needed a few bucks or pesos, including selling his artistic soul. The devil got this certainty!
