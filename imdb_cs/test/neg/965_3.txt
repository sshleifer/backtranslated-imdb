Sometimes Hallmark can do it - just like the 10th Kingdom - but many of their fantasy movies are spinning, and that falls into the second category. The version I saw might have been cut out (demon [?] Displayed on the trailer and promotional photos did not appear), but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing. IF THE EMPLOYEES ARE WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIR TALE: <br /> <br /> In any case, the film updates the story to the beginning of the 20th century (?) And does Gerdu and Kay (here Kai). A fan, I still expected to say, "The Dead doesn't solve puzzles" for 18 years. Followed by the basic story of Hans Christian Andersen: the boy gets an eye out of the ice, bad, the Snow Queen is taken away to solve the puzzle in his palace and Gerda wants to find him and have different adventures on the way. As these two main characters are older than the original, they spend a lot of time connecting them and falling in love. Unfortunately I have never been convinced that they are especially in love, and certainly not enough in love to make sense of Gerdy's quest. By the time the main plot enters, the film has slowed to crawl. Unfortunately, when Gerda starts looking for Kai, he can only lift the pace to the leisurely walk. There are some special additions to a story that seems to be going nowhere. At the beginning of the film Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother, but no explanation for it is given. The polar bear living in the Palace of the Snow Queen is more than it seems (though this is perhaps because the producers realized that bear feelings about the Snow Queen would be fine in a fairy tale, but not in a modern movie). This is never explained. Also, allusions to the fact that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are dropped, but never. The screenplay is also full of anachronisms that will really break you out of the "fairy tale" mood. The production looks good, although there is evidence that it is a slim crown: the Palace of the Snow Queen is a hotel where Gerda and Kai lived ice-covered. The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: Kai meets as faint as Gerda initially, but once she sets out to find Kai, you warm her. Bridget Fonda looks great like the Snow Queen, but she seems to be in another movie for everyone else. Finally, the film is unsatisfactory. It looks good, but it pulls and has no magic.
