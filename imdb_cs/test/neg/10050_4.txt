From time to time, is it very appropriate for the aristocracy to watch a silent film about the rough lives of ordinary people to commemorate the privileges and comfortable life they have enjoyed since the beginning of humanity or before? compared to the complicated and hard work that everyday people have to endure every day because the aristocrats rule the world. And that's what happens in "The Love Light", the first film by director Dame France Marion, who, thanks to her work as a screenwriter, will be famous in the quiet and world-wide world. better for her, surely because her film director's career does not impress this German number. The film tells the story of Dame Mary Pickford (Dame Angela Carlotti), a cheerful Italian girl who lives around the "picturesque squadlor" (an important difference in opinion between upper and lower classes; aristocrats prefer to live surrounded by "picturesque luxury") ”?); he has two brothers and a secret admirer, but all he gives him is indifference. Destiny is working hard and soon the war is being announced, and two brothers Dame Angel are enrolled and they are both dead in the next reel. But fate is even more cruel and Dame Angela in the meantime falls in love with? Němec !! And to make matters worse, she does not know that her Germanic sweetheart is a spy and that the light signals that she is sending him every night from a lighthouse that thinks it is a love signal, does not mean "Ich Liebe Dich" but "Sink Any Damn Italian ship at sea Fortunately for Dame Angel, soon her sweetheart German spy will be found by the neighbors in her house where she was hiding him (not really, because it is not an easy task for the German to go unnoticed? ?), but a German spy dies before the Italians capture them. <br /> <br /> From that German love, Half of a Germanic baby is born (unholy fate at full speed?), but a greedy neighbor who has a special idea of ​​motherhood, taking his son with the approval of the Catholic nun, who took Council Trent to extremes, the fact that Dame Angel is going to be on the verge of madness. and you may think that Dame Angel's sad life will finally improve, a huge mistake, because Destiny has in mind that the returned soldier is blind. But as they say in Germany, it may be a blessing in disguise and eventually Dame Angela will renew her son and start a new life with her blind darling in a poor Italian village in what should be a happy end for the common people. As this German number predicted, it was much better for Dame Frances Marion to continue her career as a screenwriter, because as she sees in "The Love Light," she had a lot of imagination to come up with incredible stories. ! ?? but a completely different subject is for direct movies, and its silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm despite Dame Pickford's efforts to engage the audience with many dissatisfaction. The non-existent film narration causes the viewer to be indifferent to this kind of film, where Dame Pickford alone provides interest and not its circumstances. And now that you allow me, I have to temporarily accept my holiday because this German earl must send Morse signals from the north tower of the castle to one of his heirs with a rich Germanic tradition.
