If it wasn't for the very attractive Jennifer Jostyn in the lead role, I'd turn "Milo" off after the first 30 minutes. However, as far as eyes are concerned, it is not enough to save this film, not with a long shot. Milo begins with a group of young girls accompanying a "supposed young boy" a yellow spot in a forest house where they show them embryos in jars. The deal seemed to be that if he showed them a glass, ol should try to perform a gynecological test in return. One of the groups voluntarily becomes Milos's "first patient" and leads her behind closed doors. A moment later, blood flows under the door and we went to this day. Enter the beautiful Jostyn who plays one of the girls that grew up today. A substitute teacher with shallow confidence, whose closest friend appears to be a goldfish, will receive an invitation to return home for a friend's wedding. Yes! You guessed it. Return to Miloville. Milo, who allegedly drowned years ago, seems to have a dilemma to stay dead and start terrorizing and murdering the girls who have failed to "explore" all these years. Milo, the character reminded me of one of Cronenberg's "The Brood" mutants. Could be scary, but how scary can a villain wearing a yellow cape be? The story itself is tangled and the conclusion left me 90 minutes back. I'm sending Milo, a clumsy slasher movie to stand in the corner!
