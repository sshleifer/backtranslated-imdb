I appreciated this presentation with 4 stars. They are all for a scenario that has been lost out of recognition in places. What can I say? They took one of the best games written in the last century and robbed her methodically of heart, humor and humanity. I don't blame the actors who are likely to do everything in their power, with awkward directions and incomplete characters (because the sheer characters of the scenic version have their guts and insights). I very much blame the director, who seems to be trying to find ways to undermine the script. There are so many unpleasant pauses in the TV movie, unpleasantly re-staging moments and clumsily re-introducing line readings that I sometimes forgot that I like the game. I am not one of these people who think that genius games are on the film automatically worse (just the opposite), but this special game was tremendously subordinate to this trip. Now I hope they make * a real * movie of this game. The world deserves it.
