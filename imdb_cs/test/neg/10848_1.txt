don't buy this movie for comic value like i did, i didn't find it a little funny, but so f ****** miserable and lame it's incredible. I gave it to a friend for Christmas, which was pretty funny (on my side) I recently heard that he was watching and told me what a ** hole I was! There is nothing more frustrating than watching an exaggerated, dramatic, poorly scored scene where the camera is on a tripod and does not move ... film work is truly pathetic and can only say that DONT WATCH THIS FILM !!!! !!!!!!!
