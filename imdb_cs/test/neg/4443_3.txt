Watching QUINTET is not unlike watching a group of people playing a word game in Portuguese, or in another language you don't understand. You get the idea that they play the game, and if you watch closely, you may start to understand the rules. But why bother because it's clear you can't join and you don't want you to have a chance. Director Robert Altman is not the one who asks viewers to like his films, let alone understand them. Sometimes it allows you to slip into the image to be part of the crowd, as in M ​​* A * S * H, NASHVILLE and WEDDINGS, movies so full of commotion and controlled chaos, one or two other subjects in the scene t make a big difference. And at other times, he seems to disagree with someone being able to watch the film; as in PICTURES or THREE WOMEN, where stories are almost personal monologues created for the audience of one, Altman. With QUINTET, Altman seems to deliberately dare someone to join the story. <br /> <br /> You can't rely on Altman to do it logically or expectedly, which is sometimes the thing that makes his movies so remarkably iconoclastic. But sometimes it is not expected that it is dishonest, just stupid. For example, in QUINTET we are familiar with a young woman who is probably the last person on earth to be able to conceive and is truly with a child. This last ray of hope in a crumbling society is almost immediately extinct; Altman doesn't even wait until he finishes his last depressing card in this complicated nihilistic and pessimistic story. It tells us how empty and insignificant a life is at the bat. Brave? Maybe. Stupid? Definitely. Without a goal, he is trying to build a story on a rapidly melting glacier, all the time reminding us of the nonsense effort. <br /> <br /> For the record, QUINTET, you can at least claim to be prophetic. The story focuses on a treacherous game played by various bored characters. It is a form of TAG (assassination games): a handful of people focus on elimination, each of which is a would-be killer and each as a victim. Two or more may form an alliance to kill the third. New targets are assigned when they die. Whoever lives wins. All this is happening in some exotic, inhospitable wasteland. This is, to a large extent, extreme, sci-fi version of "Survivor" - minus commercial plugs and fake "reality". It's not a bad sci-fi epic concept. The post-apocalyptic environment, the microcosm of the world (the cast is a highly multinational), a game that cannot be trusted, or at least not long, and where no one wins. Literally the Cold War. A strong-eyed director with a taste for dark humor and a violent invention could have a field day. The secret in QUINTET is not in play or how it is played, but why it all exists. If the "Quintet" game is a metaphor for life, then Altman seems to see nothing in the material, but a chance to show life as an empty, meaningless game - a conclusion as it is obvious that it is false. Given the lively, though cynical nature of the other films, I don't believe Altman believes in QUINTET. And if Altman has no faith in his material, why should we?
