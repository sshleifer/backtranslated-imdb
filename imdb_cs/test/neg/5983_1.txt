There is nothing that the viewer could point to "good". The meeting was boring and quiet. Kits and cinemas look as if they were developed by someone who grew up in Starbucks and tried to create a perfect commercial ad. Characters have no motive, motivation, or reason to care for them. There is such a lack of interest and tension that it is difficult to follow banal action and dialogue. And conspiracy ... if anyone finds him, I'm sure it would be as boring as anything else. It's not funny, it's not romantic, it's not a human condition. If you want a good stoner comedy, watch Half-Baked; if you want a good stoner drama, watch Trainspotting. The only reason I put these 2 stars instead of one is that it's a little fun to see some familiar faces in the mid 90s. Which is a shallow reason to give the film one star, but then it's a shallow movie.
