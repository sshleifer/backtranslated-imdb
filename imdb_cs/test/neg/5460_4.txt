I was also disappointed with this movie. For starters, things that happen to me don't seem to be too awful to me (Excuse me male chauvinist PoV). As one of the inmates said, "Most men should be in your position". What does he answer "but this is not _my_ choice". OK, OK, fair, so that was wrong? Please let us know. But now kicker: He won't let _anyone_ know after the end of the movie (invisible). Not his girlfriend, not the mentor, not the police, nobody. Instead, he comes up with a brilliant plan for every girl he knows so he can recognize a tattoo (or something) of one of his prisoners. I thought that during the twelve days of his captivity he just had a lot of unpleasant sex? Isn't it time to pause it all off? For me, his, to put it mildly, ill-educated actions violated the "suspension of distrust" of the film. I pulled out a book and watched the last half hour from the corner of my eye.
