The basic graph is good and can be engaging. The music is so big that it has become the theme music for the IRON CHEF (though it is exaggerated and too distracting). So, how did the movie end up so poor?!?! Well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were as extensive as possible. A dialog?! What kind of person would actually be able to get credit for coming up with the bullshit STUPID macho to be a dialogue? You get much more realism from most cartoon movies! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points, but is so spoiled by the hackyed clich√© and rotten dialogue that it quickly becomes tedious. And that's a shame, because firefighters deserve a better honor than this mess! If you don't believe me, check out the number of goofs listed on IMDb for this movie - THE BEST THAN YOU NEED. They just didn't care to make all the faults and problems. As a result, the movie seems to be rushed and needs to be rewritten and re-edited.
