I loved this movie 10 years ago when I was about 16 years old. The biggest mistake was to watch it again, ten years later. It's not the worst ever "I-wanna-be-a-pilot" movies ever, but it has so many flaws that you can hardly overlook them. Queen "One Vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this movie better than the average patriotic nonsense you usually see;) <br /> <br /> [**** ---- -]
