"Sex and the City" has some great things to do. The problem is that it is saddled with a number of negatives that really hurt the final rating and review of its six seasons. Good things about "SATC" are that many conversations ringed life, romance stories are interesting, and characters are fun. The bad thing is that few women behave like complete whores. These four women have so many partners in some episodes that they go lesbian in some episodes, that you have no choice but to turn your eyes on absolute absurdity. The men at the show are mostly depicted as shallow, degenerate, liars, crooks and buffons. The bad language these women use is far higher than what normal conversation means. Why do these writers do these things? Obviously, being over-top and getting your attention. Another thing that bothered me (without preaching) is how some relationships ended. They simply didn't tell me, neither with me nor with the others I talked about. But even though I showed a 2-star show, I'm finally glad to watch the show. Actually, I've been watching several times every season. I recommend the show to anyone who is not offended by the profound profanity and soft-core pornography. I could do less with offensive language and nudity and sexual acts, but romance was very good and the saga ends pretty well.
