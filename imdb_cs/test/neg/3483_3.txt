This film is one big stereotype. Acting (with the exception of Philbin & Harrison) is terrible, and the horrible scenario is only getting worse. I have to agree with another review that "local" characters sound ridiculous, as do "caucasian" characters. 3 Stars out of 10 for 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) Surf the scenes. (1/2 * out of ****) Watch "Aloha Summer" (**) and / or "Beyond Paradise" (***) for Hawaii done correctly, especially BP, which I found to be fun and brilliant .
