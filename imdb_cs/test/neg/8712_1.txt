I almost fell asleep during the screening. From a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of her tricks. After the heated matter, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways. A male prostitute then goes down a descending self-destructive spiral trying to find his "one true love", repeatedly returning to the same places they visit, looking for other clues or signs where he could find his love . Meanwhile, he joins one ugly guy (Who I thought was also a male prostitute), a gay basher and some guy who ends up with a "three-second sexual intercourse" with him in the back alley. It never ceases to amaze me as STILL movies show random sexual acts as scenes that can take place in a short second, as in this case, when the trick barely has its pants unbuttoned before pulling and pulling miraculously experience orgasm! <br /> <br /> All these random appointments end with a sexual partner asking him to call them to discard their phone numbers. There is a brief sub-overview including the main character visiting his busy mother, who seems to have no time for her lifestyle. There is also another short side conspiracy involving some casual conversation with a young woman who has noticed him standing on the bridge several times from the window. And there is one short side plot in which a letter to a male friend is shown, but the audience is not instructed about his relationship with that person. None of these things really connect to each other just to show us how this young man is really lost and confused. He seems to live like a ghost. There was one good scene throughout the movie that included him rummaging through sales in the yard looking for a particular record with the saddest song in the world. Otherwise, this movie seems to go forever. Filmed in black and white, it may seem very dreamy, but sitting in a theater for almost two hours and watching this drivel will resemble something like a nightmare! I found the ending that would be confusing when I wasn't sure if the young man died and went to heaven? That would be a nice payoff that would end the misery that the audience and the main character had to endure in this pointless class. But since it is an "independent movie", movies with endings like these should encourage you to "use your imagination." <br /> <br /> For those of you who are looking for nudity, there are only short scenes and most of them are shot so that something suggestive is artificially hidden in the shadow. In other words, don't waste your time with this. <br /> <br /> My rating - 2 of 10
