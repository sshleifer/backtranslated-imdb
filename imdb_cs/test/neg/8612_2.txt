First, I admit that I haven't seen the Vampires: Los Muertos, but I've seen the original Vampires movie and loved it. I rented this movie when I heard nothing about it. I didn't expect to be impressed. I was not. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​moving the action to the Far East, which should open up a lot of new paths for action sequences and story, but not enough of it. Combat scenes and chases were painfully boring. There were some parts I liked as well as the fact that the slayer team was not portrayed as heroic good guys, as it was in the first movie. I was hoping I saw an old Hammer movie, The Legend of 7 Gold Vampires, a few years ago that someone would one day make another good Asian movie vampire. It wasn't it.
