My best guess is that this work will be released on DVD sometime before Christmas. This movie was terrible. Timeline jumps all over the place. That wouldn't be so bad if it left any tension at the end. It was completely predictable. Bitch girls pick on outcasts, outcast wants to know why she hates her so much, bitch girls die terrible deaths, scared girl goes home and looks crazy. Frightened girl brought evil spirits to her, makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other. A scary baby understands what's going on. And the younger sister is not good enough for Mommie, a sick mother sending her younger daughter to bring a golden children's home. Being righteous, here and there were some great moments. First, Sarah Michelle Geller dies in the first few minutes. Certain plus. I didn't see anyone coming. I didn't expect my wife to pour both her husband and bacon on her head. If the movie kept this excitement, I'd love to love it. The beginning showed so much promise. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I enjoyed the first one. It made a leap, I didn't expect what happened, and although I asked about a movie, it was still a fun watch. I didn't keep any insights on this sequel because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.
