That was a horrible movie! I did it for about 50 minutes and started skipping the chapters to the end. The plot is nothing special, and the dialogue from the film deviates from the main story so much that your head explodes out of rage. Many unnecessary minutes wasted unnecessarily just listening to jabber characters about something unimportant to conspiracy and / or something that could be said in less time. Working with the camera is shaky and grainy. Mr. Milligan seemed to need a zoom button to get his finger! I also noticed that at some points during this movie, Andy seemed to have seizures and to shake the camera uncontrollably. The connection between the scenes was still and did not penetrate. The murderous scenes were nothing special - incredible and laughing. Hardly any gore, as the name suggests. This movie runs for about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murderous scenes take up about 1 minute of the movie - if so. What a wasteful piece of waste that was this movie. In fact, Andy Milligan is probably one of the worst directors trying to suppress humanity with his talent direction and camera. I usually do it with really bad horror movies and later laugh at it. BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS, but I can't. I'm just upset that I missed an hour and a half and watched (what I wouldn't do to get it back). Take my suggestion, and you won't see this movie if you plan to fall asleep. GRAPES.
