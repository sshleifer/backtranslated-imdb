Where to start, it's one of the most frustrating movies I've seen because it makes sense in terms of this point, but it's so stupid. A film about a bed-occupied spirit? The first 2 minutes of the film show a black-and-white glimpse of a strange-looking fat dude who has dominated Fabienne of the Pulp Fiction winner and is strangling her tie. It is believed that factors can also fit into the story. Yet, if you wanted to open it to people interested or send away early, having strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present, the couple moves to the apartment with a friendly landlord and begins to unpack their stuff, so far everything is normal. Then one night, while doing hippity dippity on a single mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things go fish, why didn't they bring or buy a g * d damn bed frame before they got there? We learned that the door to the attic, where the first 2 minutes passed, didn't open, but as soon as the couple realize they need a bed frame, the door opens magically. They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it down and their love days are saved ... or they thought so. The rest of the film focuses around both of them being chased by a bedframe. A female is an artist, so she begins to draw ghoum images she dreams of, and a man is a photographer, so she starts to have her models that behave as if they are being tortured or tied up. 50 years, yuck) The woman is growing increasingly fearful and discovering the house she lives in, once a haven for serial murders and murders that cause the end of the film. He finds out that the friendly landlord has murdered (which doesn't make sense because the ghosts need to kill the human form) and decide to go to hell. As she packs up, her husband moronically goes up to the attic, where she is obsessed with a crazy fat guy, and the woman climbs her skull before the cops appear and takes her to the mental department, where she kills a man trying to hit her. Well, if you've read so far, you have to think about one thing ....... WHY WOULD NOT THE THIRD BEDFRAME OUT WINDOW ???? Seriously, they never said anything about a real house that's scary, just about bed .... so why not get rid of that damn thing and keep going? That's why the film is so frustrating because it's actually a good conspiracy and the actors follow it, but there are more holes than Sonny Corleone on the toll box. The couple tried to leave the city as it is in any other movie that has ol "oh allows to give this place a chance of honey" mode to go, so props on it. Still, I told me and my friend watching the movie every five minutes ... why didn't they just throw out the bed? Especially after they learned that it was scary, it would be a good time to put it on fire or something. to some extent, but the solution is so simple that you scratch your head to the end of the movie and think how stupid a married couple can be? The highlight of the film is when a husband tells a 50-year-old to stretch his legs and his assistant tells him he can't shoot her like that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (low budget porn The Man Show would like to)
