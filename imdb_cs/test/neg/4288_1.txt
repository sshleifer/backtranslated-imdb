A terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit, every aspect is terrible. The combined talent of top actors Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman is superfluous, and although they do well, one wonders why he bothered. Mark Kasdan's screenplay is utter mess and Martin Campbell has a narrative that jumps all over the place, but if you can't follow him, take him as a blessing. There are too many unnecessary, crazy scenes that don't make sense. Jerry Goldsmith's music doesn't help much. Even if there was potential in the plot, the director of Campbell's approach completely destroyed her. Avoid at all costs! Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
