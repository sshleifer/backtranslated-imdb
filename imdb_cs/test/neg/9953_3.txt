Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) starts because I can't start understanding, injecting wolf blood into my fool, Petro (Glenn Strange). Result ?? Petro is converted into outrageous (as outrageous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be) a killer animal. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to avenge those who have ridiculed and mocked his thoughts in the scientific community (and why they wouldn't do that would be Dr. Mad Monster being a boring and poorly made Poverty Row thriller. There's only one positive that I can come by to write about it in The Mad Monster George Zucco can be fun to watch a mad scientist play, just like anyone else His doctor Cameron is a regular loony he has no doubts about killing; and, as with most mad scientists, they break the "domain of God" (in fact I'm not sure anyone is accusing him of it, but it suits). But outside Zucco there's nothing to recommend. others, from monster effects to the support of the music cast, are old, and there are much better examples of Poverty Row horror than the Mad Monster since the 1940s.
