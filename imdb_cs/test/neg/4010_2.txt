This pointless film was a total disappointment. None of the characters are likable, so you look at what's going on without really worrying. Worst of all, it was to rent this film in a homosexual facility to find out that this story of male cheaters was filled with homophobic young men who dealt with lots of straight sex scenes and not the only gay sex scene.
