This is proof that filmmakers and their financiers, who treat the audience with contempt, are not a new phenomenon, as it was in the 1940s, and the DRAGULA HOUSE is a great example. Do you think a movie with Dracula, a wolf man, and a Frankenstein monster who would dictate a writer to the producer so that all three appear in the scene. They had a chance with HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN when they had a second bite of cherry, which they gave away again to the HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS. If you want to lose one chance, it's a misfortune to lose two smells of cynical money making <br /> <br /> Clearly, manufacturers are out of care. Larry Talbot appears again, though he has died in a previous film that summarizes the franchise franchise. It also shows what a bad scenario is, and we are mistaken for some terrible plot like Talbot's condition, which is cured by a special type of plant that softens his skull. I think the screenwriter Edward T Lowe might have a refined skull if it's the kind of thing that comes with <br /> <br /> Director Erie C Kenton will not improve on the script and fit her own in several keys. For example, Talbot is surprised to see that dr. Edelmann grabbed the lift on the trolley but watched inconspicuously as Edelmann climbed the wall and jumped in the castle courtyard. One cannot help thinking that Talbot's reactions were accidentally switched in the editorial stage. Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his horror roles, but he didn't have a great career outside of them. Perhaps it is because he is not a good actor and here he commits the worst type of acting - he is very wooden. But it's not entirely his fault, because all the characters put on a horrible dialogue, and they're all rather wooden because of the partially Kenton's lackluster direction. DRAKULA HOUSE feels a million miles from James Whale's 1931 film and its continuation since 1935 and would be it is a very sad message that should end. But ironically, Universal decided to do one more film that would wrap his series with horror comedy starring Abbot and Costello
