I really thought it would be a good movie, boy ... I was a mistake! For fast summer: B degree effect C degree special effects D grade for total film. Don't get me wrong, the story was pretty good and not childish, so adult too to ride along with him, "hero" is good looking, so most women will like it :-), not total chick flick because it contains some fight with scenes and some blood but the way he is shot ... horrible <br /> <br /> special effects-> would be more suitable for TV-> for kids show <br /> <br /> and eventually ... send one of the actors back to the acting school if they ever attended a class there. Believe me there are much better ways to waste 2 hours. /> <br /> You have been warned.
