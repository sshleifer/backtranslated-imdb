In short, skip this movie, it's so bad. In short, this film is about a gun factory where secret weapons are developing. Because they do bad things, they're not so popular. The new female CEO will come to make it clear and make sure that the company's reputation will improve. He does this by escaping confidential company information to the press ... Do you believe it? Moreover, he starts shooting people she has never seen. Incredible uh? The Pacifist Group is trying to destroy the corporate mainframe because there are these secret weapons. This mainframe is located at the bottom of a building hidden in a vault. Obviously, the film would not be complete without a mad scientist and a robot who is the perfect killer to resemble the Alien movie of Alien. Mad scientist likes wife CEO. Mad Scientist instructs the robot to kill everyone, thus protecting his work, the rebellion in the chain and making the film interesting. Pacifists contact the CEO and another board member to escape from the robot. Further down the line, she agrees to blow up this evil computer and avoid the robot. They also found that the factory was developing a partial man, a soldier on a partial machine. They can erase people's memory and replace it with a veteran soldier. One of the pacifists is transformed into such a soldier and will hunt a killer robot. I think a mad scientist has also written the script for this movie. This super soldier looks and works just like Robocop, though not so funny. People are running, chasing them by a killer robot, being hurt by it, but they don't seem to be bothered by it, except that it lacks a bit, and of course the female director is the lead character of this movie and can't be killed, ie, survive every attack, blast, you name it. I won't bother you with persecution, let's go to the end. They have a lot of weapons, yes and a pacifist, and they know how to use them. When they are on the roof of the building, they empty all the weapons on the killer robot. He enters the elevator, which is used to clean the exterior windows. And then the female CEO also knows a spell, complaining on the roof that he's out of bullets, and the weapon is reloaded as a spell. In this way, he can shoot cables and let the elevator drop by 70 floors or so, and let him stop right above the ground by pulling on the brake. And the police are waiting for it upstairs. The robot jumps over them and kills the cops. Luckily not? The robot is chasing them in the vault where the mainframe is, and when the robot is finally close enough to touch / kill it, it stops. Because a mad scientist didn't want her killed. A better name for this guy would be an idiotic scientist. Although he is the one who watched this movie. At this point, I was tugging for the killer robot to finish them, so the movie would end. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie is valuing this high value, so I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie as a plague. He's a monster and I'm not talking about Death Machine.
