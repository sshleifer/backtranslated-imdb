Zarkorr is one bad movie. Not so bad in its good category. It's just bad. From the (lack of) set design to acting to special effects, everything about this film stinks. For starters, the film seems to have been filmed in empty rooms with a pair of props thrown to make it look good. Then we get an acting that is so bad that it makes a high school game look like it was an Oscar candidate. And above all, there are special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them in the garage. The cities that supposedly crush the monster look like my nephews. So obviously fake that shouts at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is a monster suit. It's too bad that they spent all their budgets on it and left the rest of the movie. And maybe a decent script would also help.
