I completely understand the historical significance of Rocketship X-M, but that doesn't mean it's a good movie. To begin with, the plot (or what's there) is boring and lifeless. Five astronauts kicked off for a month? they knock down a course and end up on Mars (huh?) ?? Cavemen-looking Martians Throwing Stones at Them? they return to Earth and encounter a fiery death? End. Believe it or not, this crushing fence description makes it a more interesting sound than it actually does. To make it worse, John Emery's character, dr. Karl Eckstrom, feels it is necessary to give long testimonies of everything from the nature of man to the danger of nuclear weapons. It's just excitement-minute (sarcasm intended). Looking back at Rocketship X-M almost 60 years later, I'd call it a witty display if it wasn't so sad and misleading. There are some examples I could quote, but one exchange of dialogue is right after takeoff between male chauvinist pilot Floyd (played by irritating, plastic hair Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only crew member and permanent subject of Floyd's often spooky attention), which illustrates the attitudes of the film to women pretty nicely: <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "I wonder how the girl, like you, got into such a thing in the first place." <br /> <br /> ?? Dr. Van Horn: "I suppose you think women should cook and sew and wear children." <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: Isn't that enough? I think Floyd was supposed to stay with the cave people!
