All who criticize Soprano for his stereotypical portrayal of the Italians have seen nothing until they perceived this gangster film of a corn gangster who focuses on a family that is so unpleasant that you want them to be torn out. > <br /> Parents in this clan are not so bad, but their two little boys - one sheer dude, one cloyingly cutesy-poo - are unbearable while their older son with good nothing and daughter Pollyanna compete for contempt for the audience. But grandfather of them is, grandfather. Playing Chic Sale (in "Dag-nabbit!" Mode), serves as a film moral compass, throwing in many diatribes about "dang, dirty aliens" for good peace. When it comes to good guys, it's no wonder that the baddies of that time became big stars. Not that there are some stellar performances among the criminals, but at least better than the Leeds family. The incompetent police officers do not even have enough time to project to further reduce things. Only Walter Huston, as a district attorney, uplifts clich√©-riddle material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts. The film deserves credit for being an early entry into what would prove to be a very popular silencing-witness formulation, and it's not stuffing in its depiction of a hard-bitten underworld lifestyle, but there are quite simply better - and less xenophobic - examples in the genre.
