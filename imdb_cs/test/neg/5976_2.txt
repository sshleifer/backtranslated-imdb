Such movies give independent films a bad name! This is simply a boring vinget compilation that has no structure. I wouldn't be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned. If you want to see a good stoner comedy, watch "Half Baked". It's not a winner, but at least it made me laugh. Of course, the film was created on a micro-budget. Every scene takes place in someone's house, in a flat or somewhere outside. If writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, I'd ignore the film's budget (like Edward Burns's movies), but this time it's not. I quote Robert DeNir of "Bronx Tale" when I say, "There's nothing worse in the world than useless talent." Everyone in the cast is talented. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto - all the talented artists! And they were all in much better movies. Actors give it to everyone, but they couldn't go too far with such a lame scenario. The only scene I found interesting was Jack Black's camera, where he sings a song about being in the woods. And of course, at the beginning there was a short strip club scene, which I also found attractive. The characters are uninteresting and the story hardly exists. Many movies are terrible, but at least you understand their intentions. What was "Bongwater's" intent? The world will never know. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 (of 10)
