First, it has nothing to do with the much better 18 Kung Fu weapons in the lead role with Gordon Liu. I mentioned how my Kung Fu theater presents a DVD with a totally misleading picture on the cover, a bad plot on the back and mentions (without a clue why) a young hero starring Hwang Yang Lee. In addition to introducing the history of the 18 weapon styles that the monk has given to some of the children during the opening, and the usual mysterious guidebook they all find, weapons never really appear, and fighting is all boxing-style. The hero is Lee Shao Hwa, whom I have never heard of any of the other actors before. The film mentions another director, Wu Yuen Ling, as well as one IMDb list. Other actors include Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Chen Fei Fei, Wang Ki San, Suen King Kai, and Hwa Yue Suen, who apparently sank without a trace after the film. Fights are sensible and frequent, but not large and "star" does not have much charism. The twist at the end is just stupid, and the movie seems to end suddenly as if it was bored with it. The scenery and training sequences in the river are a little different from the usual. Unfortunately, a pretty sister drowns, not a very irritating (though acrobatic) young man.
