I'm going this game and I think it's okay. I expected a little more. The main problem with this is that hacking is extremely hard, even if you read the instructions you can't get. Also, graphics are not as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could do with some improvements, saying that if the guards are in the water and you shoot a sticky shock in the water the guard will fry but nothing will happen. In my opinion, it is the worst of the three. I didn't play first but played Pandora Tomorrow, this and Double agent. However, this game deserves 4/10. It could be with some improvements.
