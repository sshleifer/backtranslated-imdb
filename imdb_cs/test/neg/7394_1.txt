The ragtag collection of Western tourists in Africa suffers from the misfortune that their plane is falling apart, so they are forced to jump on the bus to travel across the Namibian desert to reach the nearest jump point back to civilization. Not surprisingly, the driver's compass will not work and find themselves out of the way, stopping in an abandoned ghost town that was barracks during World War II fights. They will find some kerosene (useless when it comes to refilling their bus tank), a storehouse full of half-poisoned carrots in cans and an indigenous hermit who sees them with indifference. One of them, who seems to have something on the ball in terms of survivalist techniques, goes to help. They have to remove tires from the bus and burn them if they don't come back in five days: hopefully someone will see black smoke. <br /> <br /> Is this sound interesting? Well, sure, though it sounds like * Flight of the Phoenix * or any number of movies in the "desert island" genre. That is why it is surprising that * The King is alive * is number 4 (if anyone still counts) in the ongoing series "Dogma 95", which, if I recall the ridiculous "Dogma 95 promise of chastity" correctly, stated that "genre movies" are strictly verboten, oops, well, anyway, you can say that it will try and it will be all that it compensates for the fact that it is a genre movie. The old actor, starts scribbling down - out of memory! - Different roles from * King Lear * to, Well, the role of paper.It is the idea that playing the game will help while away time.All that is really contrary to the advice of absurd survivalists to they remained optimistic (did the old actor ever make an evening performance * Weird couple * just once in life?), completely different from such an activity that was a colossal loss of precious time and energy. This film is so bad that really doesn't know It is so monumentally stupid, so full of absurd situations and characters that beg rational criticism. This may be an early moment to offer full disclosure: I despise this so-called Danish "movement" almost irrational degree. I think my face just turned red with a mere mention of Dogma 95. First, if your movement's name has the word "dogma" in the title, you have already lost me; Secondly, in this particular case, the insistence on the abolition of individual artistic success is a recipe for arch hypocrisy when you think filmmakers are plundering one of the greatest works of the greatest independent writer ever. (But, no doubt, the Dogma crowd believes that Shakespeare's works were actually written by a Elizabethan bigwigs consortium like Earl of Oxford, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and the Queen herself.) <br /> <br /> Hell, I could forgive the whole business, if he played the script for farcical purposes (attacking the precious Dogma - now it would be subversive!). However, the film is taken very seriously and soon develops into a clich√© that relates to the genre that it undoubtedly belongs to: people turn against each other; men growing beard; inevitable deaths of several major players. Everything with a straight face. "Is it a promised end?" Well, not entirely: we also have to endure the abysmal transmission of DV. For this, another rule in Dogma 95 is the Chastity Pledge: digital video only. Some friendly advice to the Danes: Your "movement" is in trouble when your finished product is inferior to the average home-school video. Professionalism belongs to the artist's bags of tricks, besides his own individuality. "Artisan" and "artist" are related words, Mr. von Trier: not every jackass with a $ 100 hand-can be a filmmaker. Pass it on. And by the way: let your directors Dogma add to their movies while you're on it. The fact that the writer * King is alive * gets credit while the guy (or girl) actually filming it is not just a bit hypocritical. Disgusting. 1 star out of 10.
