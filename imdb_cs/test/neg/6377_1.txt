Jon Stewart (aka John Liebowitz) constantly tears conservatism and anything republican. This liberal comic is different than he pours his "humor" into the throat of impressive young people. I was watching the show while I was stuck in the waiting room while my car was repaired and the guy was bordering on treason. He takes Al Qued every day for Bush. She's shameless and everything she says is interrupted by a false laugh. I remember four years ago when "interview" John Kerry. Both faces were facing each other, which seemed to make it impossible to meet makeup. It was like, "Get the room, guys." I do not like the emoticons of traitors who follow the propaganda. Call me shallow. The daily show had a long run and there are many sympathetic liberals who have hatred for Republicans and conservatism. I'm not surprised by his success, but that many people actually watch Comedy Central? The guy from Mancia makes me a barf.
