It's just 2 reasons to watch this show ... I've invested time in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all the Sci-Fi fans who love the new BSG, give me a break! Go read some classic Sci-Fi novels from real greats or watch some of the milestones and TV shows of the past days and see what the hacks these BSG writers are. Their only trick is "who's the fifth cylon". Bad writing and really no sense of character development. If Adam resigns or tries to take power or cry again or reveal an inner father, he should be once again ... ahhhhh! And Roslin is so annoying to be loaded on a ship at any time. Outside with her. I could take less care if it were six months before it arrived. These writers were out of tricks during the season. If you don't know, you just don't know writing.
