Indeed, here the French cinema hits the bottom and, compared to it, is the least attractive American horror movie, like "the fifth thirteenth" "Freddy" and what are the seventh art masterpieces. It's all the more angry that there were exciting original features: the forêt de Brocéliande and his legends, the Druids and King Arthur, all were a wonderful wealth of fantastic fantasy and horror film. Films, as the user aptly pointed to a fake forest, near Paris, the film is a fake horror movie, a false Celtic history, false remains - you should see a professor (Wilms who was amazing M. Le Quesnoy in "la vie est un") long fleuve tranquille ) shout for "invaluable scrap" - which production probably bought in a dime shop-fake figure, fake excavation ... <br /> <br /> Boys disguised as druids are unintentionally very funny, so are Girls that seem to be experts for martial arts. And what can we say about professors? Monster? A ten-year-old would write a better script than this grotesque farce. are still waiting for the producer! The Word Wisely: Maurice Leblanc wrote an amazing story about druids and old rites in his sledge Arsene Lupine called "l'île aux trente cercueils". 30 years ago. Stop this "Broceliande" garbage and try to see it instead.
