Please why on Earth did Bava have to add an insult to the injuries to make this pathetic piece of downstream crap? -bat, which informs us of subsequent events from a previous episode that shows humanity's triumph over demons, (right). - If it has something to do with Demons, it's a whole new story with a completely different background. Bava as usual, makes an occasional look that does not seemingly fit into the main context of the story at all. To act in this, beyond the scary and whole concept of demons that appear on television, Oh God, I'm not going to go on. Go see for yourself. As usual, you will be treated to laughter dubbing, bullshit that doesn't make any sense, and especially unanswered questions. How typical of a continuation that missed the first dose of crap. Overall, if you are one of those Argentophile DVD collectors then you may want to give it a different way of avoiding the plague, it's not so close first so you can avoid such a plague.
