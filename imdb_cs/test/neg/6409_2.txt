What the hell was that? I admit that there were some scenes that captured me, such as 23 crap, where the protagonist sees or counts 23 everywhere he goes, but that was basically a movie in a nutshell? For shouting loudly, it was supposed to be a tense video and being labeled as a psychological thriller I would expect it to have at least some catastrophic effect on my mind, but instead of what we got? We got something that is as crazy as a man who finds himself in the midst of a crisis in his life and his way to redemption. If you ask me, it's like an old man. I was probably supposed to rent Wild Hogs. Who's kidding, they should have done someone else's murderer for that girl. By comparing Sparrow with the protagonist of The 23, they were largely distributing the film to viewers by suggesting that he was a murderer all the time. How would we shake our heads? Shame on all of you voters who have chosen to show some generosity to this pathetic work you call film and which, most critics who have agreed to my reaction.
