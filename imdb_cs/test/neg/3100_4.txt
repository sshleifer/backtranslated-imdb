It is said that some directors make small budget pictures as blockbusters. Albert Pyun makes small budget pictures as high school A / V projects. This film was missing in most departments. Virtually every scene is overstretched, "experimental" lighting and camera work are horrible, Rob Lowe apparently likened to being ugly with acting, and poor drab Euro-pop numbers stop the movie from being stopped. On the plus side, Burt Reynolds is doing a pretty good job with what he has given (which is not much), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly respectable and Ice-T puts another long-standing chain of B-movie gangsters. Not Pyun's worst job (Urban Menace), but definitely not his best (Mean Guns).
