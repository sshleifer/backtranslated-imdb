The film gets a score of 3 because it dared to be so different. It features a cast playing while you can hear their thoughts and desires! This is a really weird movie and an experience I won't forget. The only problem is that the experiment, although interesting in some ways, is generally quite boring and unreliable. In fact, it is amazing that Norma Shearer and Clark Gable could be THIS Boring! The film is based on the play of Eugen O'Neill and it seems quite rigid. In fact, it would be best if I kept it as a production production - it just didn't translate to a big screen at all. and those who love Gable movies so much that they have to see all his movies!
