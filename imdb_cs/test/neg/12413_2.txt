Not so much for this movie ... either a stunt racer or a stock racer has a blazing car at the start of the movie, goes to the bar, is approached by a biker gang that destroys his chance with a very beautiful lady, offer him a job, return to his place refuses, the police will ask him to accept their ya go !!! What is happening is a very annoying little movie that sees a hero not really doing all that much, and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can't pin a crime on them. I'm not sure why a woman biker did what she did in the end, but hey, that's a bad movie, you always get scenes that don't make sense. I'm still trying to figure out if I heard it when they said the hero of the work was a stunt car. They could say they were the driver of the car, because why a stunt racer would race and I wouldn't think it was so unusual for a stunt car to crash. The actors are bad and all the cyclists are pretty annoying and the hero is a bit incompetent ... indeed this movie is not full of kicks, but they are holes.
