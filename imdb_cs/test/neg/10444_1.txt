This is one of the worst movies ever. There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and literally walk on the ground and add bubbles! The shark is boring and just this big slow computer has created a stupid thing. Antonio Sabato is terrible, I think worse than usual. How does it work? Direction is the worst and nothing is redeemable in films. I love shark movies and this is just disappointing. I've seen these studios movies before and everything they do has a star on the way down and doing a bad job. I'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about a good story.
