Another French film with absurdity. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) tells the story of two young women who are killed and killed. One of them is a porn star that escapes from its community after being raped and killed by a friend. The second is a hooker who kills her roommate and sees her boyfriend being shot. After these events they meet at the subway station (both miss the last train) and then the whole thing starts. They find bound and very close. Men sexually abuse, use drugs, ride the country and have a lot of sex. That's really about Baise-Moi. We see that they have no mercy for their victims. She even kills a woman for her money. Both actresses are real pornstars in France that affect the film in two different ways. They look so comfortable in sex scenes, however, they can't do the whole movie worth observing, for me, the movie doesn't require any more playing ability than that. It's a version of Thelma and Louise on a different level. I could recommend you a lot of things to do instead of watching Baise-Moi. So, bother to watch if you want to see a pointless, eccentric movie. * outside *****
