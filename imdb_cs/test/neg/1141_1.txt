I am a big fan of the "Holiday" series and I like Randy Quaid as Eddie's cousin, and at least a few behind the scenes were involved in this project (especially Matty Simmons who produced or directed) - produced all 4 theater versions, as well as "Animal House" ). For these reasons, I thought it did for a television spin off can be worth checking out, even without a Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> For the record, I didn't expect it to be very good; I just thought it might be a little fun distraction. Therefore, my high degree of disappointment goes to prove how badly this sheer turd movie really was. It was clumsy, falling into his chin, heart-stopping, head-exploding horror. Still, I couldn't stop watching him. It's a disease I have; I can't drop out on a movie or give up a TV show before it ends. Nothing made me want to go back two hours more than this movie.
