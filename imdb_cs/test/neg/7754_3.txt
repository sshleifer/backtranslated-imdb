This story of the American pilot Ted Brice, who is the only survivor of the Allied reconnaissance plane crash in Belgium in January 1944, is largely a mess. The title would lead you to believe that it is mainly a story about Belgian armed resistance groups, but it is just a background that instigates a stupid love story between Ted and Claire, the woman who takes Ted. he is a member of a devotee of resistance, but it is Claire who decides to give Ted a refuge in the absence of Henri and against his wishes. Important details of the plot do not make sense. The focal point of the story is to find a recorder in the descending plane that contains navigation codes and target positions. But in the opening scene we see the Belgians looting the plane, members of the resistance. Why, at that time, instead of arriving and patrolling the plane, did the Nazis gain valuable items? And the whole matter of transferring So from Area was done using secret instructions and code words when the transaction could be a simple exchange. Humble music attempts but fails to lend any weight to this lukewarm enterprise. The most ridiculous part of the movie is how love develops between Ted and Claire. Initially, Claire devotes himself to nursing Ted from near death and when Ted begins to recover, they become physically involved (while Henri is comfortably gone by doing business). Julie Ormond works as Claire, but she feels like a French accent that I often found impossible to understand. Her reactions sometimes seemed a little weak - when they were informed about the hanging deaths of several city members, she reacts as if she was just told that the local food is from peaches. As Ted, Bill Paxton seems to be just reciting his lines; his performance is so uninspired that it is embarrassing. A real American pilot could prove such a personality that would be convincing. I didn't feel any chemistry between these supposed lovers. The most typical thing is how Ted and Claire act like lovers on holiday. Perhaps sexual relaxation from such difficult situations is understandable, but it seems difficult to understand the seriousness of the situation. At first Ted is sent to the attic room and Claire is afraid he would even come to the house. But as things evolve, he not only comes into the house, dances with Claire and listens loudly to the music, enters a neighboring barn where he plays with a local boy with a local boy, and finally goes on a car trip with Claire to a nearby town. Br /> <br /> The young boy seems to be most devoted to his role, but is undermined by the script. He has an unusual ability to be in critical events without noticing. And when he adds lines like: <br /> <br /> "Have you ever seen someone hang out. They look like dancing, but they can't find the floor." <br /> <br /> You feel that this is a screenwriter and not a 13-year-old boy. By the way, there are scenes that show that the Nazis are pretty bad If we compare this film with the brilliant "Ash and diamonds" about the Polish resistance, or the same stellar "Lacombe, Lucien" about French resistance, man realize what a really dismal business is.
