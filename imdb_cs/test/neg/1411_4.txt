I found this Robin Williams vehicle slightly fun at the best. Williams is much more restrained and calmer than usual. I would say that the movie is more drama than comedy, with a little secret and suspense. part of the movie) worked best.still, i wouldn't rate this movie very high.for me, it was ok wasting 2 hours but nothing special.my best advice would be to grab it on tv / cable or rent cheap first before deciding on whether to buy.my voice for man of the year is 4/10
