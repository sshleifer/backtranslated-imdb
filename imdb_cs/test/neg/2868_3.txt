I just watched Fingersmith and I am amazed to see the average 8/10 score for the show. Not only was it difficult to follow the plot, but character development seems to have been accidentally applied. The actors were adequate, but in the process of trying to create twists and turns, their characters become quite one-dimensional. When that happens, the story really falls and becomes tedious. And just in case someone doesn't see predictable lesbian undertones from a mile trip, it's at the end of the house in the most banal terms. The final scene is disappointed and called, and anyone who sat down and went "Ohhh, so they were all rug munchers all the time!", Had to be for the evening. br /> <br /> Two stars for almond hockey in an earlier scene that was a little shabby, none for the rest ...
