This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect crime is executed and an investigating policeman who ignores all traces immediately knows who is guilty. Viewers have to wait for the film to be caught. The result is like every single episode "Columbo" or "Murder She wrote". The director himself refers to the story of hackney by showing police officers to watch Matlock's episode! This story will barely fill up to 90 minutes, but the director insists that every 120 minutes be filled with every clich√© in the book. Leave this, nothing is missing.
