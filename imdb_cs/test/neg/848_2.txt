The first watched March 17, 2002 - 2 of 10 (Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Stupid, sex-filled master and slave who has too many movies of intimate relationships. This film seemed to be more interested in sex than in the story and kind of sex story. Mixable dubbing of the original Italian language in a version I watched with an absurd ending where he tries to put an anti-slave statement (or I should say one line). What a waste of time for anyone watching this waste.
