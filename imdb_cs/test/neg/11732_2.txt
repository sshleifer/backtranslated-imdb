No no no. This is my advice if you want to see this movie. Anthony Perkins is one and only Norman Bates, as well as Janet Leigh in his role as Marion Crane. It looks like it's a colored version of Psycho, with a few slightly different touches that fit a more modern challenge. Vaughn is boring like a sick Norman, and Viggo Mortenson Sam Loomis looks too cowboy compared to the original. Please people, do justice. Don't bother with it. You may wonder what Mr Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins are thinking right now ....... <br /> <br /> * beyond ****
