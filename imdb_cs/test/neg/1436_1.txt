Sometimes I wonder if today's horror movies rely on human torture to fear people. If so, then there is the sad future of horror movies. Dee Snyder tries to make him feel frightened and terrified, this movie does it exactly, but not in a good way. There are times in the film when Snyder is able to save this film from falling into the hole, but frankly, this film did not fall into the hole, was already in the hole and Synder did not try to break free. When you finish watching this movie, you're sick, depressed, dirty and crazy. I feel it was the intention of this movie. What's lower than dirt?
