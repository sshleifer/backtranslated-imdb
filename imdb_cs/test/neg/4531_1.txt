After the joke and liveliness of Highway 61 and Roadkill, I expected this film to shine, but it was so cocky and self-deceived as hard rock stars parodied. The tempo dragged, not too long a hallucination sequence, the characters flat and unmistakable, and Art Bergmann not Jello Biafra. I had to push myself to stay awake.
