This film, like many others (Remember the Titans, Miracle), follows the basic sports film formula: There's a guy, he's a jerk. Jerk is wrong. Noise must be played by someone else's rules. Someone else's rules change Jerk, Jerk becomes good. Insert tragedy (death, drugs, riots, etc.). The tragedy affects Jerk, it changes. Jerk must now play a championship match. Lots of close-ups on sweating players and balls. Jerk wins. Quote from coach or news or something that explains the title. Credits. Were you not affected? These movies can now be used to solve the morons of society. Anyone who pays in the theaters must be slapped.
