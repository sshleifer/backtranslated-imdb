One day I was in a video store looking for a movie. I ran into it and rented it because it was a movie I didn't even see or hear. <br /> <br /> Now I like the slasher movies in general, but it's just nonsensical or good for laughter. In addition to being ultra ultra inexpensive and containing all the slasher film clich√©s and terrible gameplay, it has the most competent and uncertain direction I've ever encountered. Sometimes these features may be present in the movie, and some delights may still be, but not here. A painful example of domestic horror.
