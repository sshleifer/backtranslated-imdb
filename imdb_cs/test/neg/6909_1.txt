My friend and I decided to go to this movie after we heard on the radio that it's a good movie worth seeing, even there with cars. I was horrified in the first ten minutes of the movie. For starters, the cows to be females were male voices. Then I realized that they really should be boys. I laid the transvestite cows for a while and tried to watch an open minded movie, but it was so frantic that I couldn't help but shook my head. I probably checked my phone ten times to see if it was almost over. The plot was decent, if not predictable, but it took so long to reach its point. I was having trouble getting to sit with it and I was 19. Children in the theater actually got up and down the aisles. I felt them. But my biggest problem with the movie was that the drinking links were loaded, not to mention that the cows / bulls actually burned and stole the car, then drank and drove, broke into the boy's house to push him out of bed (but he deserved it) ), then escaped from the cops, which movie writers did look like horrible people. This is not what I want my child to be exposed to. There is too much in the real world, if I wanted my child to watch the boys drink and ride and keep the cops on the chase, I'd turn them off before the tenth message. Children's movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, not an escape into ridiculousness. What happened to the good manners and the happy endings that the children's movies boasted? That's why Disney's old movies like Beauty and the Beast, Lady and Tramp, Little Mermaid, etc. are classic. If you want your kids to see a great cartoon with essentially the same plot as "Barnyard", rent "The Lion King". You can get a great story without terrible drinking and driving and big theft auto links. The writers of "Barnyard" apparently tried to continue the big trend of making films for children, which the parent could also enjoy, but they did so in very bad taste. I would never have noticed children to see it, and I suggest you save your money and watch something else.
