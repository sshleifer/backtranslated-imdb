There is an endless offer of harsh horror movies. People seem never to be tired of trying to scare and excite. Unfortunately, these attempts rarely succeed. This unfortunate film has almost no redeeming value. The story is very predictable, most actors are very uninspired, or just plain wrong, special effects of very low quality. It took a lot of effort to turn off the DVD and go to bed. With such a limited number of foreign films released in the US, why in the world would anyone want to import this gossip. Apparently "Anatomy 2" for those who have nothing better to do is probably at the beginning of everything. I'd rather watch the paint dry.
