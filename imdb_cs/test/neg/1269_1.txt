I was excited about the concept of my favorite comic hero, who is on TV ... and very disappointed with the final result. <br /> <br /> The only "amazing" thing was going through the wall (despite the cable's visibility). I didn't think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he was visibly different from the one who did stunts. You could say they were two different actors. It is true that I can also see in modern Spider-Man movies when I watch Tobey Macguire and watch CGI. But that's from a trained eye and CGI experience. Still, the 70s version could have been better despite the lack of a special FX. The website was hockey and looked like ropes that seemed to stick around them rather than stick to them. And what was wrong with getting into a spider cell phone. Hi? It's a web slinger of people. Sorry ... I didn't want to get so worked out, but our beloved wall crawler deserved better.
