After Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) released a secret mission in Bucharest to reveal an international gang of arms dealers, she is in charge of protecting Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), a Romanian mafia accountant. But the CIA's safe house is broken by criminals, and Sonni realizes that this information has leaked from within the agency. Alone, trusting only his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni fights for the survival and protection of Nadia. Wesley Snipe's career is downhill. I just saw this movie and it's another unsatisfactory movie of this actor whose career is very similar to Steven Segal's film. The film has many explosions, shots and the pursuit of cars associated with a scary story and terrible action. First, Afro-American Wesley Snipes is being chased by the police in Bucharest, but they never find a black American. I've never been to Romania, but I believe there are not many African-Americans in this country. His character doesn't like to bathe, wear the same clothes for many days. There is no chemistry between Sonni and sexy Silvia Colloc, but she has sex freely, falls in love with him, and shares her possessions with him. The boy who performs Nadia's son is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Detonador" ("Detonador")
