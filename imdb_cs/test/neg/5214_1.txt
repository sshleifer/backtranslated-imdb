(Chances are, I'm going to spoil the valuable points when writing this, and since I can't determine and care about what you think is a valuable point, then if you're thinking of watching this movie and having a problem learning such things, then I suggest you jump directly for the next review.) You know, I don't mind the cult films that are presented in the "cult" section. And people who believe they can get there and fulfill "reality." Is it too much to ask whether pseudo-Christian propaganda films should be submitted with other films of particular interest? <br /> <br /> I couldn't be more impressed if Pat Robertson shot a porn movie.

" And we only had MET.
