Did you mean "Traumschiff Surprise" that a German comedy can't get worse? Can. This comedy is another attempt to keep homosexual stereotypes disguised as a nice comedy. The original concept (openly homosexuals in football sports) would be a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but ... The actual intended message of the film seems to be how homosexuals are oh-so different from equal men. Of course, absolutely stupid. Even gay sex is considered to be less of value than straight sex. This film seeks only to serve viewers who want to laugh at stereotyped homosexuals. Well, don't waste your time on German comedy movies!
