This film is the scene of the sci-fi film "Doppelganger" (an astronaut from our Earth who encounters "protio Earth" on the opposite side of the Sun and the totalitarian vibration of the Cold War in this world) and tries to turn it into a TV series pilot. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and television is probably better for it. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is absolutely sufficient in 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns his usual performance. Likewise, Glenn Corbett (who appears to be a sort of John Saxon of a poor man) who plays a harsh individualist whose existence constitutes a threat to the foundation of the "World Order" on Earth. Low budget and low power consumption and inconsistent scenario and lack of any real imagination in stage design and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure tied to the launch pad. Here's an example: in the original template for this pilot ("Doppleganger"), astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm and crash their ship in a truly frightening succession (it was clear that their ship would never fly again). The two astronauts then helplessly slam their smoke from the wreckage of their car in the midst of howling rain and wind, just to be defeated and overcome by anonymous men screaming through the speakers. astronauts are sitting on their seats when buzzing, things start to shake and the camera gets darkened (and, as a friend pointed out, it was quite clear that the actors were just shaking their seats, the director wasn't) shaking the camera or set). I saw episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits", which forced more effort to create a mood and setting than this average TV capability. And that's basically what's wrong with "Stranded In Space". No budget, no time, no imagination ... just a token gesture and hoping that the sci-fi Fan Boys imagination and enthusiasm will fill the rest. Sorry, guys, it didn't work. I'm sure everyone here has just finished their work on this and left and never thought about it, except for a listing of their C.V. And that's what the viewer does. If you remember, you will remember that you once watched a TV movie called "Knitted in the Universe", but it did not give you any lasting impression and you cannot remember it too much.
