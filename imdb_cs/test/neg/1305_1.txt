This film follows the tracks of The Riddle for all the stars of the British cast in a totally horrible movie! Bad cgi effects, bad adjustments, bad direction, cast that I hope have been well paid because it will be a nail in many career careers. Nigel Planer once again put on his wig Neil It was at least laughing! It was like a particularly long and outstretched episode of "Torchwood," but without camp the fake Canadian doctor fella ... it had the same overly dramatic music though, constantly repeated, in a futile attempt to encourage some tension. Oh humanity!
