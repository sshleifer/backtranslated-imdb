OK, I'm 26, so I went through all the action heroes of the 80's and Chuck Norris and Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, they fought against the bad guys, they shot dozens of shots from one Days - Chuck Norris threw some fireballs from his fingers. WHOA! "This is a necessary film!" I said. And it really was. Just worse. It is very difficult to see the whole movie - filled with some religious thoughts, ridiculous monster-like zombies serving Satan, all the idea of ​​a conspiracy forgotten in a forgotten community that represents all mankind - it is the burden of Christian fundamentalists wet dreams. I have nothing against Christianity, even in movies, but this lacks taste, lacks almost everything that connects with common sense, c'mon, Chuck Norris plays ANGEL, whose job is to look after a small town where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so damn straightforward and boring, not mentioning its stupidity (yes, it's no longer stupid, we're talking stupid as ... like a joke with a retarded child). people very devoted to the Catholic Church, because young audiences laugh at almost every scene. Technically it is wrong, fx are worse than the ones you saw in the early 1990s in the TV series, the story seems very stupid, the actors could easily be exchanged for cardboard stands without mentioning the music I heard . playing the piano for children. I have seen a lot of movies, even the worst (those from the bottom IMDb), such as "Space Uprising" or "Manos - Hands of Destiny", but believe me that nothing like this nonsensical, horrible, terribly fermented yeast movie, which brings some joke movies to my mind rather than regular production. Avoid it. Avoid it at all costs. There is nothing to laugh about. Chuck Norris has officially completed his film career.
