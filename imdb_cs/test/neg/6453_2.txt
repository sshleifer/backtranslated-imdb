I tried to love this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other one of his role as "Big Brain on" Chin in Pulp Fiction. But I didn't care about the characters at all. Kevin Spacey is pricked by the whole movie and even disliked the discovery of some terrible things he had. Especially the end - that made me hate even more. It was like watching a bad car wreck. Spacey played well (he does it well) but I don't recommend it.
