Crazy Six is ​​torture, it must be Albert Pyun's worst movie. Even Blast and Ticker are better! I can't believe how boring the movie is! How did it end up? I saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing I remember is how bad it was. That's not a bad bad movie, it's just a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 (½ out of *****)
