Ego. This seems to be the only reason this movie was made. This film is so bad in so many ways that it's under one's dignity to write a lot about it. Each character was good in praise and leadership (I use this term liberally, as the director expresses it in the form of stone). a small story, if not, fails in basic aspects like logic, feeling and drama. The direction leaves much to be desired. blatant deficiencies are everywhere (character motives are not defined, potential spouses are found overnight, broken car windows are being modified, among other things) Let's face it, Himesh can't act. Nor does Hansika Motwani seem to be. In her defense she is still a chubby child who looks like a ton of makeup. Raj Babbar Overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughed too much. The actor who plays Himesh's friend is the only natural one. a few questions come to mind: how can such a film become Rs.500,000,000 ?? where is the money? awarded that one pursuit sequence was slightly well shot and Mallika Sherawat was paid an obscene Rs.15,000,000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs. but the utter stupidity of the film stuns the mind. (Including a 3 mumbai auto rickshaw that appears and jump on a police car) Good: Himesh shows courage by making a movie to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark "topi". Let's give the devil his cause: Himesh, as usual, gives good music. Bad: Direction, Story, Himesh's singing is still hard to ignore <br /> <br /> Ugly: Dialogs and everything else !!! Final word: Painful in every sense of the word! Watch this movie only if you loved "Yaadein" Subhash Ghai
