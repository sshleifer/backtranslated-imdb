Just seen which way to the front? at TCM (UK) it's a really horrible movie. If I paid for the photos, I'd go out. Awful movie mess. Byers (Lewis) and his friends win around in uniforms from the sixties Italian sci-fi film. Were the uniforms of CND / Peace meant to be chronic? The sets were clean 1970s, I'm sure the Hollywood TV back-lot could provide a more realistic set. The movie takes mickey from veterans. It's not funny how Lewis has to make another film behind me.
