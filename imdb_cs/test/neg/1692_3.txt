I was 12 when this film was released and adored. The song was inspiring and I felt good, I watched it several times in the cinema. Actually, I had a soundtrack album and played the song's over and over. 26 years later ... I'm ashamed. He was just sitting and watching with my two daughters who enjoyed it very much, but my cynical older adult eyes hated it. It is very badly directed in many places and given that it was Lionel Jeffries directing I really wanted to get it. The character's animation was so rough, but the background was pretty good. I remember the critics at the time saying it was a bad movie and was horrified, but now I agree. It's an old movie yes, compared to what can now be achieved, maybe that's why I thought then it was good. But this does not excuse that it is bad behavior, direction and negligence. The main actor's voice seems to be nicknamed, which is also very disturbing. I can't see exactly what they were trying to achieve when it was done, all that happened was a weak film.
