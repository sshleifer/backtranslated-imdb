I rented this movie after I heard Chris Gore say "five stars!" about the show show attack. Well, when I turned on the DVD and showed three degrees of hell, I had to buy it. Just to see a spectacle of a mother screaming at her son to drop her second son into a flaming pit. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect ECW or CZW to last for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I waited for the least summarized version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie. Unfortunately there was nothing like that. The 3 stages of the deadly part take place right from the start and from there to a great extent downhill. Nothing really happens in this document. It was quite raw, bare and unbiased. It's not a bad thing, but that's the storyteller. You would expect to have opinions on the subject of this document, but not. What would be nice to have, a message or a reason for this doc. There was no real reason to tell the narrator, there should be just a text explaining some less obvious scenes. They really don't even explain the lives of these wrestlers. This shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes that sound interesting, but the reality isn't as big as it sounds. For example, Mum watched her son wrestle with bulbs and tacks, for the first time in a public park. Instead of seeing her reaction to the match, they show her that she is responding to the camera, instead of telling the interview later, or just telling her about her reactions. Legitimate document wise, this is not. The source material was fragile to the beginning. Nothing really deep or interesting really happens. No conclusion to several more interesting stories, No real point or final thought of a backyard match, poorly edited together and his and his basically inexpensive, failed beating Beyond the Mat. <br /> <br /> Wise match, it's pretty boring. better wounds are at the beginning and are slowly becoming less amazing and shocking. If you've seen a Japanese match, India wrestling, or even a Backyard Wrestling DVD than it wont shock and horror you. If you want a match, don't make the same mistake I made and I'll see it. Go instead to do some CZW ECW or XPW DVD. All I got from this document was how stupid people could be. Not to support self-harm or make dangerous pieces, but their reasons for committing these acts. The courtyards seem stupid for the match. Most of them are unemployed and probably have several problems in their minds and the match is a type of therapy for them. Then the supporters seem even more stupid. In principle, mothers take the whole "if you can't defeat em" to cope with the fact that their sons are basically killing. School office numbers support their students in their dangerous stunts because it is an alternative to joining gangs and, to a lesser extent, to drugs, which is somewhat funny because this segment took place in a rural town where, like people, they live 20 miles apart . People are stupid. This is what I extracted from this document. <br /> <br /> If you want to see thoughts and thoughts about someone who is tampering with the game and basically what the back of this DVD promises, get UNSCARRED: Nick Mond's Life. It's more amazing and interesting than a backyard and much more fun. Oh and his actually good.
