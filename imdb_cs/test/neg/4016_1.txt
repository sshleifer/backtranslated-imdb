An "independent" movie that promises twists, adventures, and emotional adventures from the back of the box we'll never forget. This film also deceives us to watch it by giving Rachel Lee Cook a leading role. After the first twenty minutes you realize that this film will give you nothing. The story goes aimlessly, revealing nothing new or important to be interested in. All three "disturbed" characters have only small grains of a back story that forces us to care. Just as you reach the end, everything about the story changes and instead of helping the audience catch up, you are left with no idea, and more importantly, no interest in "why". The director, who also thought it would be a good idea for his teammates, came to the film without any previous experience or knowledge of useful films. The whole piece looks like a college film "art" created by a first-year student trying to hide the lack of real talent.
