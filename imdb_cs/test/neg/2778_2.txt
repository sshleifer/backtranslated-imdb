Whenever a movie contains a dwarf or dwarf in a prominent role, the odds are 10-to-1, which the director threw him because he didn't know what to do to keep the movie interesting. In this case, the little boy is not so bad - he can keep most of his scenes dignified (except the part where he pulls the lead man down the dungeon stairs), but the film itself uses it as a dog chew toy. The problem is a common problem with low-budget films - here is the idea of ​​a decent idea, but the director and screenwriter don't know. A good director would take various story elements - brain transplants, crazy doctors with secret labs and dungeons, car chases, fist fights, blatant monstrous wizards, mind control, betrayal and conspiracies, etc. exciting, including a film full of cheap excitement . Instead, we get to a bunch of people meeting and arguing in the doctor's lab, and then kitschy surgery where the patient bleeds tempura painting, followed by some of the same people who stumble and argue in the doctor's lab. more, followed by another subgroup of the initial group that drove and had an accident, followed by a dungeon escape scene that is mostly about a woman who turned her shoes back, followed by a roof chase (real high point), followed by a confusing series of events where everyone apparently he will escape everyone else in the film, followed by a wonderful walk in the countryside, where everyone is chasing, hitting, attacking or escaping everyone else, followed by Well, nothing else. Somewhere here is a frightening peroxide blonde woman dressed in white, a well-known heroic type that is a bit of a good-looking Dutch, a three-meter lab assistant, a big piece of molten rubber embedded in one side of his face, a child wondering at the center of the film to provide a more "Frankenstein factor", a brunette who has fallen in love with a hero for no apparent reason, and a mad doctor alone who must be the happiest man in the history of evil super villains because nothing is in harmony with his plan, but things work for him anyway ... and all because he remembered an electrode in a transplanted brain at one point in the operation. This was by no means the worst movie I've ever seen, not even the worst movie I've ever seen, or even the worst bad movie I've ever seen, but just lying there, radiating cheapness and inattention to The detail of every place, and there's no real reason why even bad movie buffs can watch.
