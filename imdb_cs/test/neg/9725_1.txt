From the beginning of this movie, with his "The Lost Boys" rip off the opening sequence, to the wrong wire work and even worse the dialogue ends, this film slimed along the snail's pace. The "Covenant" has been highly recommended by some of my co-workers who are convinced that they have a practical joke on me. At least I hope it was the intention and their taste is not so bad! This film wasn't much longer than an hour and a half, but still felt much longer. The story was so basic that it could be summarized in about 15 minutes, at most. They could at least fill the rest of the movie with some fun magic or battle scenes, but someone decided (maybe the director, but I don't know if anyone really "directed" this movie) that it will be filled with some poorly done "artsy" camera shots and nonsensical scenes "boys" swimming and getting into bar fighting. About halfway through this movie, I thought it might be possible that I would think of a head against the wall, and partly to get rid of this terrible, dirty feeling that I thought I was watching. . So I get a bash head against the wall, and I get it more than a movie! I watched it all the way to the bitter end, hoping it would eventually offer more fun. No, my efforts have been rewarded with "How I Made Your Whee-aytch!" I vomited, and then I felt embarrassed for the screenwriters and sympathy for the poor actor who had to deliver it. The meeting wasn't as bad as it seemed to other reviewers, but even the most talented thespian couldn't save this job and the work I did on my nerves! I give movies a chance, even the bad ones, because they usually offer some form of enjoyment, and it wasn't really the worst movie I've ever seen. After it was over, I felt like I was looking at the movie "Stealth" again and this time it was much better! Oh yeah, the point thing, don't bother with this movie, really, no. Watch a few episodes of "Charmed" and watch "The Lost Boys" after you've had enough alcohol, and you'll be a much better person. If you find yourself in the same trap that I did and watch the "contract", make sure all the sharp objects far, far apart, you'll thank me for that.
