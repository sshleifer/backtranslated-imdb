** Maybe Spoilers Forward ** <br /> <br /> Whenever fans of bad movies come together for more than a few minutes, the name that comes up is Larry Buchanan's name. This amazing director has given us the opportunity to remake ZONTAR THE THING OF VENUS, dramas with a cruel crime like BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY and a shocking plot like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. LOCH NESS HORROR is at least a whipper. Looking back at the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry has shot this cartoon on a wide and round lake in California. The film boasts somewhat dazzling (for budget) underwater photography, and despite it creates an atmosphere. Then it degenerates into a windy dialogue pronounced not-naming actor with extinct Scottish accents, not to mention the soundtrack that will do nothing for much-spoiled bagpipes. At one point, campers sing "You Take a High Road, I'll Take a Low Road," Just Throw in One Another Scottish Clich√©. If Scottish people sometimes decide to jump on the Political Correctness, they'll be suing Larry Buchanan for this film, regardless of his last name. The monster looks like a huge puppet of paper and makes the dragon in Beanie & Cecil a scary comparison. In one unforgettable scene, Nessie lands on the ground and, to avoid some patrolling soldiers, tries to hide a fifty-foot long creature behind the tree - and the soldiers can't see it! LOCH NESS HORROR is a true thinker who has to be seen several times - to be believed.
