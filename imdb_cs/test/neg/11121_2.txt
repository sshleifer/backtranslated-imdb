In general, I prefer horror movies that creep so much that I'm afraid of everything for the next day or not, not where people behave stupidly and kill them indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. Chupacabra Legends is a green-gray monster that acts like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a series of sharp backs sticking out of its back and sucks the blood of farm animals. As in many horror movies, good and bad, this film is released with the legend. Not only does it attack people but eats the intestines and has a bulletproof, almost indestructible constitution. So tell me how the hypodermic needle can penetrate the skin when the bullets can't? And why, when marines find that bullets penetrating armor can hurt, they split up so that chupacabra can pick them one at a time? John Rhys-Davies performs a performance that rises above the bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal deserve credit for their performances. Otherwise the rest of the acting was bad or bad, just like the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons and Neal.
