I wanted to love the movie so badly ... I really did. But it was a terrible disappointment. In 1996, I read Jennifer Egan's novel and thrilled the story. In fact, he remains one of my favorite books of all time. Remember that the book was far more profound than this film, in conspiracy and emotional resonance. It is MADE you care about characters. It painted a complete picture of Phoebe, as opposed to the very bad characterization of a young girl in the movie. Although beautiful and showing some * promise in her growing career, Jordana Brewster was like an apartment and hollow in this performance as well as a script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was just a terrible choice for Wolf's role, both physically and logistically. What an embarrassing looking couple. The wolf was supposed to be dark, tense and more physically appealing than he was in the book. What's more, chemistry between the two actors was painfully enforced. Cameron Diaz, however, deserves his best for his performance. She took an incredibly average scenario and gave her the character of life, a real spirit. She is just beautiful and her careful mannerism makes her very believable as a hippie. It's too bad that her talent was wasted in this forgotten movie. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible translation in the book category for film, almost as bad as the message in the bottle with Kevin Costner. But don't get me on the first one ... <br /> <br /> I am not usually so harsh in my critics, but I was so disappointed here because I really cared about the story and wanted to see that it was right . Not delivered ... <br /> <br />
