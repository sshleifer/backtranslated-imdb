A desperate attempt to make a "film-noir" sci-fi thriller, but the film is inadequate. He has no believable plot, some of the key actors were a joke (NO Lars Bom is cool!). Although I like "limiting access to the maximization band". I finished it on principle, but I went home feeling like I lost two hours of my life ...
