Wow ... this is the kind of movie you're wondering who the idea is and what the soup kitchen is. To say it was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love. When I saw Guttenberg's name in a TV guide, I found it to be a spoof ... maybe it should be. He could do it for a better movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the scene where they are on the plane in mid-flight with the door open and there is no wind ever. They could have at least one fan. See a few Canadian and c-list actors in the movie. This is the kind of movie that casts b-rate cable stations that you never see except for rainy sunday.
