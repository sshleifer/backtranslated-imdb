Michael Caine could try to do a bigger than life character to a successful degree, but the whole story and character is around him where he is not likeable or interesting at all. It was all very boring and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau, my favorite actor, had no role. Michael Caine was a bit irritated after a while and the film couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine tries hard and well for him, but I felt the direction and story leave him. Don't waste your time. In the first 10 minutes it starts well and then it's about it. The film is for Die Hard Caine Fans only. Stay away from this ...
