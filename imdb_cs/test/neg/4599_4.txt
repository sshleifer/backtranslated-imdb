A boring film about a poor loser ... that's Factotum in a nutshell. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinaski, alter ego by Charles Bukowski, whose novel the film is based on. When we meet Chinaski, he can be a writer, but he is definitely not successful. He sails through life, fires from one inferior job to another and does not care a bit. The fact that he is always drunk may have something to do with his inattention. He meets the wife John, played by Lili Taylor and follows the relationship. Chinaski moves to John's apartment and now, instead of getting drunk alone, he can get drunk with someone else. Good times. Finally, this relationship is enough, so Chinaski hits himself. Unfortunately, he still can't keep the job so early that he broke. At this point, Marisa Tomei appears, and for some reason her character, Laura, decides to save this miserable drunken loser, whom she doesn't even know. Soon we will meet some of Laurina's acquaintances and this film will turn into a bizarre world with this rather eclectic game. Soon, Tomei and his friends will be out of the picture and once again with Chinaski and his drink and his miserable little life. There is even more time with Jan, but most of all, the time is spent drunk, unemployed loser. And then the movie ended and not too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the film goes on. Nothing happens. Nothing will happen. If you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching Matt Dillon, then it's a movie for you. If you're looking for an interesting story, well-developed characters or any fun value, then you're in the wrong place. Dillon's performance isn't bad at all. Too bad the movie that surrounds him is actually pretty bad.
