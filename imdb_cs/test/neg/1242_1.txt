Maybe I'm here alone, but this is stupid. I'm sorry, but I was tempted to learn about Lil 'Bill O'Reilly (which I didn't even have after a few months when I had a clue from this show, and honestly since I lost my challenge) . Spike tries to get into something that isn't, which means he's trying to be human. Fox didn't even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he came in. His sketches are trying hard, he himself is not funny, and writers are trying to write material for a host without talent. There are too many good TV out there wasting time with this show, and Fox ..... Fox we had some good times but you have to get f $% * ing to act together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another " Me-too "network.
