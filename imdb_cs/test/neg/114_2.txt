I saw this Mogul Video VHS. This is another of those old distributors of the 80's whose catalog I wish! This movie was pretty bad. Though retitled "Don't Look In The Attic," the main admonition that is repeated in this is "Don't go to the villa." T Just getting into the villa area is a bad idea. The character does not go to the attic until the hour in the movie, and it should actually do it earlier because of what he learned there. The film begins in Turin, Italy, in the 1950s. Two men are fighting and the woman tells them that it is a villa. One kills the other, then regrets it and the woman pulls out the knife and stabs him. Escape from the villa and after leaving the chair, she moves herself (what's the point?), But when the hand rises to the ground in the garden and pulls it into the ground. From here it is today, thirty years later. There's a session that suddenly appears and seems to have nothing to do with the film. The women of the prologue inherit the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. At least one of the two men from the prologue seems to reappear as another character. He is being persecuted by some warnings that they do not go to the villa, but they all do it, because if they do not use it they will fail. People are dying. A lawyer who has won all his cases is trying to investigate a little. The end is pretty poor. Why was the family cursed? Unfortunately, a boring movie. <br /> <br /> On the back of the video frame is a fun statement about a small print that reads: "The scenes shown on this cover may be an artistic impression and do not necessarily represent real scenes from the movie." In this case, the box case is an illustration that more or less accurately depicts the aforementioned woman dragged in the underground scene, even though there are two hands and the woman is different. It's true, sometimes the film cover has nothing to do with film. I also recall a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor, in which films with illustrations on the cover got at least one point instead of photos.
