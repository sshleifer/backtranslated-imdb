As a fan of bad movies (and MST3K and a member of MFT3K), I must say I saw their share. But geez! Even the worst I saw was at least a soundtrack. As George Lazenby wanders around Hong Kong and who knows what, you can guarantee that you will not be disturbed by any background music that fills today's cinema. Or some music that fills lifts. I don't think anyone shouts in this movie. Now it's not entirely true - it's a soundtrack. If you listen carefully, you will hear it in half a movie. Of course, timing will be totally inappropriate and does not last long, but something that could be classified as "music" occurs. Your best bet is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon in front of the TV with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. Rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offers. Watch Sammo Hung as a little villian in this movie. Aren't we all happy to find Jackie Chan?
