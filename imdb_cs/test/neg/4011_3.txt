I watched it last night at Sundance. Altman must be the most hit or missing director's notes. This show, despite its "star power", is absolutely irrefutable and its political observations, which I, as a proud liberal, do not agree with, are shallow and clumsy, and seem to have been torn from the headlines of USA Today. the fact that it comes out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as Mario Cuomo. The drama itself is not very dramatic and comedy is not funny. The only interesting points, really, see how New Yorkers live their lives, and the loyalty of cast and crew rebuild the show that insists some cult following from 1988. Sometimes it seems that Altman's only contribution to the film was the art of having all Talk to your actors at once, resulting in the person feeling depressed as if they were at the wedding of strangers.
