This movie is a terrible attempt to spoof. His attempts to parody various sports films are half-baked and not funny at all. really funny. The fact that the football team is studying and gaining good grades, which makes the coach mad, got no laughter. the team really had the potential as a spoof. This is a classic and trite sports theme. But unfortunately, the script was too weak for anyone to throw it. And this cast is no exception. Women in bikinis and underwear have a gratuitous use, so it's not bad from this point of view. It is not.
