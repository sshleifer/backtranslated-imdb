Connery climbs aboard the Moore buffoon train in this stinky movie. Discarding everything that made Bond a success first, this film further degrades the character of Bond who throws him into the Inspector Gadget category. This is not Smart. There is no style, just a second-class actor on a cheap set. It's a pity that Connery couldn't borrow an element of class here, but he didn't. Everything here is proud of mediocrity, including Connery's bad dull slave. Maybe if I was snowed and I had a choice between watching "Never Say Never Again" and "Howard The Duck", I'd choose the first one. If you want a real James Bond, pick up an Ian Flemming novel.
