Nice, stereotypical, good-looking cast, the story moves in a wide and confusing arc that walks you through a series of garden paths (without companions) before dropping to the end that makes you leave - hollow. If you are after a movie that has a climax or ends with a satisfying limb, it will be disappointing. In the spirit of the theoretically apparent sexuality of the main character, I felt he was androgynous, lacking a clear male personality, rather like his lacking clear French person. Although theoretically laid naked (or rather naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as unrecognized as the character of motivation - the little thing called conspiracy. Probably a stereotypically speaking English aspect, at least if you take the side of the movie.
