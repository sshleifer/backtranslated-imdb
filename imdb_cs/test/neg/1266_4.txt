I was very willing to give the Rendition the benefit of the doubts when it came to all the negative press I read about it. Even about three-quarters of the way I still thought it was messy and a little incoherent, but otherwise it's a solid story. And then the bottom fell. I do not necessarily want to destroy the film for anyone, but the conclusion overturns everything you thought was about what was happening on his head, and what was happening on his head, without any special reason, except that you might tell the world . , and I know it. I love a good twist, I love good ah-ha moment, but only when it's relevant to the story at hand. Filmmakers' total mismanagement by the filmmakers has no sense of the overall story, the timelines might not have been parallel, and they didn't have to be separated by a week. All the revelation was to destroy all the merits I wanted to give to director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Kelley Sane, which could be a good thing because when I looked back, it wasn't as solid a movie as I originally wanted to put blindly. credit for it. It is admirable to try to get the film's release to the attention of the film public, but rather to have a story that plunged deeper into context and politics than into the shine. over those matters for the story of a woman in need of her marriage disappearance and the rebellion of her daughter's revolt against her "investigator". I understand that a film visitor on the bottom line needs human quality to understand, and that is why I will not do it for taking that path. My only qualification is that we don't get enough to say that we should get. Instead, we have shown numerous lines of conspiracy, all of which are brought to the foreground confused before they are sent back to the non-field areas of our consciousness, never coming back to them. Is it so bad that you forget what to worry about, a woman? investigator? CIA Agent? sacrifice? senator? Middle Eastern daughter and her zealot friend? In the end I really gave up and left the movie to take me where it was, which ended up being completely different than what it first explained. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens happens as a result of an explosion bomb. This bomb is in the middle of every story and eventually ends up so harmless that you can't believe how big waves are spreading. The old butterfly wing waving the quote is in full effect, because the mission of one boy for revenge ends in the destruction of so many. Be it death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse, or career suicide; nobody escapes unscathed. At the end of the day, however, only the story of a man who was thrown into Egypt for torture is interesting. We are convinced that he is unequivocally innocent from the beginning, yet he is on board, electric, etc., to get all the information he could have. When those in power include a person who does not have compassion or reason to stop until something is poured out (whether true or not), and an observer who does not have the courage to participate or stop, the situation itself imparts some intrigue to how it could be. end. All three actors are the best parts of the film and once again prove that the film should be dealt with in full. I don't want to confuse people like Reese Witherspoon, the victim's wife, or her senate employed ex, played by Peter Sarsgaard because they do a good job with what is given to them. Even Meryl Streep, her harsh accent, and Alan Arkin are not too heavy. But it is Jake Gyllenhaal's three CIA agents, Yigal Naor's investigator, and Omar Metwally's victim, who really shone. Naor is brilliant when an Egyptian man tries to keep a sharp razor sharpness during working hours, but compassionate and caring when his father tried to find his daughter. This man is brutal, but it is because it requires his calling and why he relies on finding answers. He never gives a false second during the pain and suffering caused to him. Whether he is lying or not knowing anything about the terrorist who calls his cell phone, we are totally buying into his situation and we are desperate to see how the situation turns out. As far as Gyllenhaal is concerned, someone who seems to have one performance recycled with varying degrees of success over the course of his career will find the part that suits him. The demons enter his soul throughout the suffering that is forced to be part of the wear on his body and mind, causing both ambivalence and the need to intervene. These two feelings struggle with each other until he makes a final decision, and his stoic, boyish behavior that fights perfectly. It's too bad that one of the plot lines is never the main line. focal point, despite being appointed as a film. With all the edges around the edges, we as the audience get too much around, lullaby into time and succession, and then we slapped in the face when everything melts into more laughter at us and then, not seeing it come. "I felt cheated and unfortunately it is a lasting effect that I have taken from the film. If it were more straightforward, I might have enjoyed more, but as it is, one can still take a few positives from a seriously wrong whole.
