This is one incredibly standard western that contains some bad acting, a boring story and a stupid action. The biggest problem is perhaps this incredibly formal movie. It contains all the usual clich√©s, yes even the bar fight and the movie really has no surprise in it. It makes it a boring and weak western to watch, also not in the least because it's so badly executed one. Direction and editing can be called bad and all action sequences in the movie are incredibly stupid. Maybe it almost becomes a little funny to watch, for all the wrong reasons. His story is not that interesting either. It's a pretty friendly western (so no blood), where for some special reason they all seem to be against the younger brothers, who are portrayed in this film as good and friendly guys. The story becomes stronger and stronger when it comes to its end. The younger brothers actually existed and were part of the James-Younger gang, which included the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James. Of course, they weren't as friendly in real life as it is in this movie. It was customary that in the early 1940s they would have likeable characters. It wasn't really until Spagethi-Western that the main characters really became the main characters. Oddly enough, he always approached worked better than those of the western, in which the main character is on the good side of the law. color. That was something that was unique to West European western games and still adds something to the film. You may wonder why they shot this western in full color. The film is still finished in black and white early in the West after all, and I actually believe that this movie would be a little more credible if it were instead done in black and white. could easily do without this western. <br/> <br/> 4/10
