I'll give him a second chance, but I was very disappointed in the first one. The candle wouldn't be enough for another series. He has a lot of meaningless dialogue that doesn't add to the story at all. I agree with others that it does not seem that an interesting story is created. It's slow and predatory and I only know what Comanches are planning to do. Maybe he'll put it all together in the second installment. I'm an Apache heritage from Texas / New Mexico, but I don't recognize much of what's going on. Maybe I'm just unaware of the facts, but it's not much to raise me.
