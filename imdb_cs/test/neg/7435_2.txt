LTL is a typical, hopeless comedy that can be enjoyed by sheep that stop and listen when they meet a band playing in a shopping mall. I remember Murray promoting LTL in the miserable Larry King CNN show, where he said something like "if this movie doesn't hit, I'll stop making movies (or comedy)". It was not nearly as jovial as it might seem; he had to feel that the LTL was certainly hit and that his failure would mean his status as a star that had a noticeably declining - that is, an ultimatum vividly broadcast to his fans who spent their hard earned money. stupid elephant comedy. (Comedy is stupid, not elephant ...) Or maybe, while filming (or seeing the last cut), he just realized what a turkey it was, so he was desperately trying to convince everyone who's optimistic about LTL quality. "Go see it, it's really good!" Actors are prostitutes inter-behaved with car dealers. LTL is a kind of crappy project that comes from "Friends" School of Comedy; their motto: "If you have ever exhausted ideas - or if you have never had any in the first place - then keep the animal on plot and it will at least inject the element of cuteness". Cuteness = a sad substitute for the lack of funny gags. Another motto of "Friends" was: "Always include a nonsensical, boring sentiment" that this film predictably ends when Murray rather pathetically says "What they forgot to say is that you will never forget an elephant". Maybe not an elephant, but I certainly managed to easily forget this turkey I saw many years ago. I suddenly reminded myself when I saw a television scene on TV today (that is, this time, an unnecessary review). Murray wastes his talent on this step (disguised as an elephant), but he is not nearly as uninteresting / bad as McConaughey (or the man's name is written); one would think that M.M. he would have an easy time playing himself, hick, but he was so painfully indecent and unconvincing that I barely stood to watch him make such a jester. It was terrible. To complement this nonsense we have that generation-X buffoon, Garofalo, in a somewhat useless role. Then again, all about LTL is useless ... <br /> <br /> After the LTL, which bombed, as far as I know, Murray became a more "reputable actor". What is it with these comics and their inferiority complex? Is it all about getting an award, ie "Recognition from your peers" (read: voices from your Moronic colleagues)? This piece of bullshit marked the end of a series of good and great movies that Murray created in the early and mid-1990s, such as "Groundhog Day", "Quick Change", "Mad Dog & Glory", "Kingpin", "What About Bob ? "and" Ed Wood ". Recently we were extremely pleased to see him in trash / environments like "Hamlet", "Lost in Translation" (you just can't get out of these "extraordinarily talented Coppolas") and "Broken Flowers". Compare these two doses. One guy described LTL as "funny as hell". Now it's the kind of audience that hoped for this movie ... Shopping Malls and Trailers ...
