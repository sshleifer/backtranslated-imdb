When I was reading the book, I felt I was drawn into the castle rock again (perhaps the last part of the rock trilogy), and the story was a variant that comes with a little demon on the demon. All characters were described in loving details, both with good psychological and cruel horror. The film on the other side is terrible. Gone are the interactions of the character and the clever plot, and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but lacks a mile. If you haven't read the book, you can enjoy it, or you'll avoid it at all costs, just like most royal book movies.
