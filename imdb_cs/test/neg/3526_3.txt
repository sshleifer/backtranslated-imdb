** SPOILERS ** The killer in the movie doesn't wait for a second to see him sneaking into a girl's shower and hacking her to death as he took a cut and bloody arm as he escapes. Then we get this official-looking prologue as if we were following a real story that states that in the late autumn of 1985, a lot of horrific murders were committed in a small midwestern collage. Sheriff Ron Delboys is a bewildered and hearing-impaired murderer, and later, when the murders of local students collage, all women, continue to run for the state senator, they are at risk when investigating every step. He is there at least twice when Delboys says they will never be another murder if they are on the case and another murder occurs within minutes. Finding a Golden Amulet on the Place of Each Sheriff's Daughter Murder, Collage Collage, Tina finds this reference book on Withcraft, which suggests that the amulet is a symbol of the witch cult that originated in early 1700 just after Salem Witch Trials. This cult was avenged by 19 accused witches hung by local townspeople back in 1692 and they went at night to kill men and women of authority and to take off with part of the body. When parts of the body form a complete person, a fire would be burned in the occult midnight fire. You'll never get to exactly what's happening in the movie "Blood Cult", not only because it's a totally discontinuous story, but it's increasingly outrageous and grad-school level acing especially by Charles Ellis playing butterfingered Sheriff Ron Delboys. He got into more trouble and then the free killer could get him. The sinking sheriff Delboys ends up with his head busted spiny coffee as well as almost burned alive, after being dismantled. The only reason not to do so is that he seemed to have managed it all, under the influence of a powerful and unnamed drug. There is a strange sequence of dreams in the film that suggests that many highly respected members of the community are members of a witch cult that is responsible for the assassination of guilds. The film doesn't bother to explain if a dream that Dazed Sheriff Delboys had, was a dream or actually a real experience on his part by dropping the whole thing as if it was cut out of the movie! Sheriff Delboys stepped out of the hospital and pulled out a house with collage societies while he packed a bag full of McDonald's cheeseburgers and finally faced the killer. Shefiff Delboys finds his shock and astonishment not only knowing who he is, but also willing to let the killer escape! The very first movie to film shows. Not only would anyone who is their right mind be crazy enough to pay the entrance fee, at least with the video you can drag on it. the outrageous patrons, in the justifiable manifestation of righteous indignation, will tear the place apart!
