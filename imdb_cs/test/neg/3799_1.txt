An unpleasant mishmash catastrophe has a team of scavengers who come across an inverted S. Poseidon, hoping to plunder it before going on well. The sequel to Irwin Allen to his 1972 sensation "The Poseidon Adventure" arrived at SEVEN YEARS LATER! It doesn't matter that no one cares about why they give us such poor production, filled with dark characters and misguided actors, just to get rid of the memories of your biggest hit? One might end up really sorry for Michael Caine, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Karl Malden and Shirley Jones it wasn't for their lost-to-sea expressions (good for a stray couple couple). There is a moment when Saint Jones is tempted to take some treasures for himself and she shyly begins to fill pockets that are unintended hooves. The film was a career bungler for everyone involved, especially Allen, who never fully recovered from it. * of ****
