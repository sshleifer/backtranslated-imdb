This film follows a very similar storyboard for The Warriors, with less intensity and somewhat poor acting, about which there is nothing to write about. The story is generally not so bad, based on a small Aussie gang trying to get out of town when one of their members is framed for rape by another gang girl. They then have to fight their way through the streets as they were hunted by a number of rival gangs. He could assume that the writers took the page out of the Warriors book and rewrote it, but as mentioned above - with not so much intensity. Negotiations as a whole are not very good in my opinion, and that is clearly evident on many occasions that they are actually acting ... but the fight scenes are making it, but then the bad sound effects that go bring them back down with them. This movie has nothing about Once Were Warriors. <br /> <br /> Low budget, good story, bad gameplay that you shouldn't write about.
