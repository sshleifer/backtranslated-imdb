In general, I do not accept the slight attempts to create humorous stories, which means that "Anita no perd el Tren" cannot achieve a very high score for me. The story is good: middle-aged, but still a good-looking woman finds a new love. However, attempts to create this film as a romantic comedy have sometimes become somewhat comical. Rosa María Sardà has shown that she can be a serious actress in such productions as "Amic / Amat" (qv), "Todo Sobre mi Madre" (qv), "Las Amargas Lágrimas de Petra" von Kant "(Qv) and" El Embrujo de Shanghai "(qv). However, the forces that have taken over the years have deprived her of a lot of small things, both for cinema and for television. Something similar could be said about José Coronado: perfectly capable of producing serious performances. María Barranco is safe in this grouping. This is how I finally stayed with the feeling that I will be really pleased to see the new work of this film in a serious tone, allowing the actors to really show their performance skills. And the curious thing is that it should be done with the same leading actors. He wasted talent for a somewhat stupid movie that could have been really promising.
