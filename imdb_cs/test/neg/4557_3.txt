Another stinker from PM Entertainment, and fortunately one of their last. 'Firetrap' is basically a very low budget remake of 'The Towering Inferno' I don't mind the low budget of B Movies as long as some effort is put in them - there are no Dean'Superman efforts in the 'Firetrap' 'Cain, who is an awful actor, really has all the porn star's acting skills, but it turns out to be the best actor here and it says something, the rest are just a bunch of hopeless given shoes from different daily soaps. Special FX are just rubbish, footage showing a burning building from the ground is among the worst I've ever seen, fire looks like someone who sketched an orange pen on the front of the camera. Aside from the fact that there is not one character to actually take root, you all hate and hope that everyone will die before 90 minutes. The script is embarrassing - red herring is well marked in advance, someone else mentioned it, but "A scene where a janitor fights a blazing fire that engulfs a building with his broom ... a merry or the same janitor who goes into a room labeled "Dangerous Material", should these scenes be tongue-in-cheek? Some doubt that this is a good point and only one good point was that there was a fair event among my daily soap operatives that kept my attention. film, I can't recommend it - Watch 'The Towering Inferno' instead <br /> <br /> 3/10
