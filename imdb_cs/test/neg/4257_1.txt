Good cinematography, good acting direction ... cannot justify a story that is not and cannot be acceptable to any company. Amitabh often used the media to sell this unsolicited sale when he said that - if such an incident happens ... then what? I would like to ask him if such a thing happens to your own child or grandson (let's say a girl child), then what do you do? I think all parents will have to pay special attention before they work with a 60-year-old neighbor if you have one - with you. Such films should be banned and discouraged, otherwise you will inspire more Nithari cases. Such acts are villains and criminals in movies are punished .. it should be the morale of the story and not celebrate their deeds.
