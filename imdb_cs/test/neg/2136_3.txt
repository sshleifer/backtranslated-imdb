WARNING: CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, as in the following years, ripples were at the forefront of the first Jaws movie. Film monsters have gone from radioactive monstrosities to unknown and insatiable beasts lurking in unexplored corners of human experience (ie, Ocean, deep space, genetics). Although "Jaws" was a milestone in this particular area of ​​film horror, few films were able to match the visceral impact of the original. "Shark rosso nell'oceano" (aka Devil's Fish or Red Ocean), is an obedient follower of the original "jaw" formula. After several miserable ships and naval ships, they are brutally murdered by a sea creature, there is an initial way to discover the beast, then it is not possible to study without horrific results, and the final pressure to destroy it. Although filmmakers have tried to bring some new life into the equation by adding technology elements and conspiracy firms, the result is nothing less than disastrous. This film sinks under its own weight of terrible adaptations, fragile acting and cheap terror. <br /> <br /> The most dangerous feature of "Devil Fish" is cookie editing. From the beginning of the film, when 3 different scenes are crushed together, the viewer gets the feeling that the film has no technical credibility. It looks like editors are cutting scenes around the set music part instead of editing the movie and then making the necessary changes to the music. In addition, each cut is intercut and it would seem as if the editors have never heard of the terms "fade", "wipe", or "dissolve". The impact of scenes can never cope because they are immediately shortened when the last line is completed and a new scene is started. Silly camera tricks, such as when two basic characters share a private moment on the beach and some time-lapse image of their act is composed over their bodies. Music is just as bland. The theme of creation is a hopeless duplicate of "Jaws" with a slight variation. While I love to give my reviews without the influence of MST3K, Mike most appropriately described somber scores as "soft core porn music". If he is not in a film that leans so heavily on it, the tension is a deadly blow of "devilish fish". Negotiations are outdated, relationships disappear and the plot is ridiculous. The question is that if genetics moved to such a level that it would create a huge sea monster chimera that would protect oceanic interests, why couldn't the more practical use of mankind be better applied? One of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of ​​a monster, although his film presence is less than stellar. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is bad enough to sink below average. If there had never been a "Jaw" then the film could be described as an average, because its theme would be new and exciting, even if it was done inefficiently. Sadly, as a copy of the original Spielberg thriller, he sits comfortably on the garbage can.
