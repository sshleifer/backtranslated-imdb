This well-intentioned film is a little short, and unfortunately in too many areas. The scenery is beautiful, with views of northwestern Vermont providing an environment for this mid-century story. Quebec Bill tries to return to his past, which is led by whiskey to save his farm. Going back and forth between magical realism scenes and straightforward action, this film rarely hits its step. Kris Kristofferson as Quebec Bill seems quite embedded, otherwise it's his line; or else his crosses Yankee and Quebecois accents. By the way, he just walks away as a low-key blow-hard. His dialogues with Gary Farmer Coville, however, sparkle. William Sanderson's Kinneson rat is solid. Charlie McDermott shows some real potential as a young wild Bill; but its part is not big enough to carry the scene and never steal it. Luis Guzman appears on Lake Memphramagog (Lake Willoughby) as a monk with a boy's accent: who knows? And then there's Bujold's Cordelia: a fortune-teller like her namesake, she plays Yody when the inton line is like "Will you marry a Quebec woman!"?!? Just too strange and nowhere near mysterious enough. <br /> <br /> The end is really jerky. Again, a bad mix of magical realism and concrete. And Yoda never gives the answer we can understand.
