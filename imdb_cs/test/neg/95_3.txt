I am the type of guy who loves hooding movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy by Killa Season, from class B to Hollywood. but this movie was different. I am no hatred and this movie was pretty nice. but some pieces were just strange. Well it wasn't good compared to the performance of Silkk The Shockers in the Hot Boyz (pretty good) and Ice-T in the new Jack and SVU (great). the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills wanting to be a Jamaican dude, says something and lights up on fire burning as Ice-T, so another dude, that kills Jamaican, but Ice-T is unharmed, very similar to Ice's next movie Urban Threat (which both of these actors were a Snoops character is paranormal, however after this there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) gets stabbed first fought, but after he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh-s out of blood. and when MJ admits he killed a cop because the cop beat his friend Benny was strange, Benny is not introduced in this movie and the scene is not in the movie. It keeps weight on why Corrupt wants to kill MJ, but is still doing the scratching head. Wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones, who explains what happened to them after not mentioning what happened to the other two main characters, MJ and Lisa. the film showed the horror and poverty of the ghetto that destroys the lives of Latin and black words - it was a good part of the film, although the clip of projects was reused a thousand times. and the scene where Miles kills Latino's brother by breaking his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my Latino brothers car would kill him. the film was similar to the Urban Threat movie and half of the actors were in both of these films as well as the production team. it was OK. but i'm out of poverty i love hoody movies, but if u don't like me i don't watch it. The only thing that saved me from leaving is that he reminded me of the first movie I made and that was made with $ 100 and my love for the genre. Nathaniel Purez
