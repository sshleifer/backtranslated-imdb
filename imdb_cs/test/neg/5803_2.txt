Call me old fashioned, but I like land movies. I thought "stoner comedy" is just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which a lot of weeds are smoked and the people who follow it are better off to enjoy it. "Granny's Boy", however, decided that it's a full-blown niche and that stoners represent a piece of comedy pie that needs to be achieved. It seems that Allen Covert (star and producer) and Happy Madison gang were right, but that doesn't mean "Grandmother's boy" is less boring and unfair. They could be completely stoned - but the characters are mostly half-baked. Alex (Covert, longtime player Adam Sandler, first star) is a professional professional video game tester from the mid-1930s. whose roommate evicted them. He could look for a new apartment, but then we don't have a movie. After trying a few friends, Grandma Lilly (Doris Roberts of Everybody Loves Raymond) ends up with a good oil. She wakes him up at 6 am and has to do housework and soon falls asleep to work, so the new video game sequel may not get on schedule. Like most people, Alex is concerned with his frustration and wipes out boredom either by playing video games or getting high or both. His friends do the same. Most of them are virgins who live at home next to loving video games. Everyone is embarrassed and everyone except Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (only occasionally) their characters are not funny. Funny when you're blazing ... sure, I suppose, but I can't say from experience. Perhaps all we've been wrecking are getting taller, playing video games and annoyingly annoying women with specific attention on their breasts, but it shouldn't be the driving force behind the film. Even old women should not be high on the accident (seeing that one is coming) or that they are out of that gross sexual wit - but that happens when the movie is not about anything. No conflict will occur until the last 20 minutes outside the slightest trouble of being out of the bank, Alex is trying to get a hot girl (Linda Cardellini) to enjoy it and the guys are trying to finish their video game levels. Characters can be a saving grace for these meandering stoner flicks, but besides the dear Doris Roberts, the aforementioned Swardson as a virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and skills Joel Moore in making the robot sounds. , there is little character ingenuity. Covert is the main character who has no comedic dimensions, his dealer's friend Dante is an awkward actor and a waste of time on the screen, and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written so far on the periphery that it doesn't matter. Br /> <br /> If you love movies about anything and watch them in the state of mind and body that reinforce this void, "Granny Boy" will probably be just what you are looking for. Those who need a little more talent and a joke to get aboard with comedy will remain unaffected. The most I can say for "Granny's Boy" is that it is observable despite its absurdity. It will not be a feeling of total waste of time, but you will want you to do drugs to make the most of it for at least an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com
