Above all, this film has the dumbest plot of any movie I've ever seen, and unfortunately I had to see it. One day I flipped through the canals and came across this miserable apology for the movie, and I confirmed it for a long time. Carrots This is not an actor and is not the holiest in the slightest sense. He acts like a big comedian and thinks he gives the audience a lot of attention. Frankly, acting has the ability of a 10 year old clown, scratching that less than 10 years is the ability to compare them with Top Carrot would be a serious insult to their good name. This movie tries to be funny using a boring one liner that seems to be lifted out of 50 cartoons. By the end I would do anything to erase the memory of this movie, but unfortunately the memories remain with me. All I can do is warn others to never watch this movie. However it proves the reputation of a true Carrot Top can not act for it damn.
