I didn't even read any of the books, nor did I see the first movie, so I didn't have any expectations after receiving the demonstration cards. 'Angels and Demons' was a confused, convoluted film without direction or any credibility. The development of the character was very small and I never cared about the situation of the protagonists; the opposite was true, I was more interested in seeing how antagonists would be successful because the first half of the film was almost entirely focused on why the Illuminati are who they are. The film jumps from place to place with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everyone in the movie is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize it, it's very unlikely. The top is extremely clich√© and lets you ask what happened, wondering why none of these points were considered, it's very sharp and unnecessary. Actors are not particularly believable in their roles, mainly because I have found it hard to believe that church scientists, professors and men will act as they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. The events that happen are not at least possible, and the film's pace is questionable when the characters jump while in a tight schedule, and I have to wonder how the protagonists manage to get out of place in time, every time. The most enjoyable part of the movie is cinematography, I found it to be a beautiful movie that I watch, but it was such a mess that I found out that it wouldn't be worth it if you could watch the theaters.
