It is still hard for me to believe that a fine - if it is too long - has transformed Dean Koontz's novel into this sheer scream. This movie is so bad that it's disgusting. Boos to all involved. Shame on you! <br /> <br /> P.S. The fact that the sequel has proven to be just to show how little taste and discretion remains in the Silver Screen Land.
