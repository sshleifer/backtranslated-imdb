A few explanatory notes are fine. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a short introduction to the video of DOCTOR GORE (aka The BODY SHOP) where he touched his joint efforts with J.G. "Pat" Patterson, director and star DOCTOR GORE. Patterson invented "gore effects" for The GRUESOME TWOSOME and several other Lewis films in the late 1960s. Lewis notes that while 2000 MANIACS was a "five gallons" film (referring to the amount of blood phase required), Lewis-Patterson Productions were "fifteen gallon" images. Lewis does not describe DOCTOR GORE as "fifteen gallons" - he only talks about the movies he and Patterson have made together. Lewis admitted (elsewhere) that his introduction to DOCTOR GORE was improvised before he saw Patterson's movie! So take it with salt salt. This may be an "unfinished" movie, but like some unfinished novels it has an "end". Only some connective tissue is missing. Patterson has a clear presence on stage and a dry sense of humor, which makes this simplified show more tangible than it should be. There is an extremely bare-bone conspiracy - even BLOOD FEAST is a more complex - and grateful recurring musical score by William Girdler. A little nudity and a lot of skin. The entire middle of the film includes the construction of a "perfect woman"; This is a concentrated gore for bloodlust and laughter. Patterson's director is on his way over the head, but he tries to tell his story creatively if Frankenstein clich√© can be creatively used. But the best reason to see this movie (on Something Strange DVD, if possible) is that it has the perfect Nashville Weeper, Bill Hicks "Every Heart Dies." It's not true!
