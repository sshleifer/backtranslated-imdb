I'm sorry to say this, but this is actually one of the worst documentary films I've ever seen EVER. Due to its name "Darwin's Nightmare", I was expecting a documentary on the problems of perch Nile Victoria Victoria. What I actually saw in this "document" is a loose accumulation of individual stories, most of which have no relation to fish or lake. And for the most part, you can hardly call them stories - it's more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connection ... Why this film loses time: - displaying irrelevant information about families of Russian pilots ( for a few minutes they are unnecessary, for example, on their private hills of wives and daughters - Sadness over the death of an African child who bitten a crocodile (as if it could not happen without a Nile perch) - Shows us about 100 times how the aircraft land and start at the airport - It shows us strange religious events for a few minutes - we discuss in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport - we talk to children about their mothers, fathers - what they work and / or died (well, guess what: some died of HIV - who would it guessing?) These are just some examples, I could go to a few pages ... <br /> <br /> This movie is out of focus and doesn't know what it wants to say er. If you've never heard of Africa and you don't know that this continent has social / health / HIV / violence / war issues, then this movie may be right for you. If you haven't had your eyes closed for decades, 90% of what this film shows will not be new to you - and the way it is presented will try to make you sleep. Maybe my expectations on this movie were high, but I really didn't like it, even though it's a topic I would generally consider interesting. If this film wants to show how poverty is associated with the Nile perch, it should perhaps spend some time discussing this issue ...
