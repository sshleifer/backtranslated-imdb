In the midst of all the problems that make it a horrible piece of celluloid, it is the dumbest storyline in recent cinema history. Richard Gere determines who Jackal really is, through some form of revelation. Nothing works, just comes to him. When he is in doubt he is "following the first lady!" This movie blows bits.
