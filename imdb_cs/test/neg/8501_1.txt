How did this film go to the Berlin Film Festival? I understand he got into the Panorama section, but still. This film featured: <br /> <br /> 1. No conspiracy. 2. Terrible behavior. 3. Cruel videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video. One of those who participated in most of their festival acceptances is the presence of this old standby: homosexuality. This is true, the only thing that happens in this film is that one graffe performs with another and jerks him. Then they feel weird and have a boring old "crumbling" conversation that you might expect from your first high school crush (representing lines like "You kissed me first, dude"). And by the way, this is no Crying Game ... you see the gay angle coming in the first ten minutes of the movie. Besides, it's mostly just bad marks, badly dressed "secret" cop, some skateboarding and a train ride. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in everyone, I suggest you check out some underground graff videos taken by real graffiti artists. There's a lot of it ... and it's a hell of a lot more fun than that bullshit.
