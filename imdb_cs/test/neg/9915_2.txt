Unnecessary effort. It is a typical catastrophic film on the surface: we are involved in the lives of several people who are imprisoned in the Great Event. However, the script is so horrible and there is so much explanation of the background of the characters in the dialogue that we think is treated as miserable. Even Sesame Street did not explain Mr. Snuffleupagus's origins or Mr. Hooper died: we can solve it. Someone thought that entering "Enron" in a scenario would give him the currency to discuss energy companies. Acting is very large, except for older performers (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour I couldn't worry about who took the storm. But maybe there are special effects. Unfortunately, no. Even on a 20-year-old television, I saw one tractor and the trailer was computer-generated badly. Maybe there are budgetary constraints, so I can forgive. The shots of the plane trying to land seemed quite real, but I thought I'd seen it before. This place confirms this: it was from an earlier film, Nowhere to Earth. So in summary, the only good pieces are from another movie, and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30- second promo network, it makes Category 6 look pretty good. My advice: rely on your network to do some good 30-second clips, watch them and save two nights.
