I watched this movie and more and more I was bored with a stupid storyline that went nowhere, when the story suddenly becomes an incredible turn to the worse and has an actor. Oh, how I argued. Because it's sooooo funny, right? We know that Julia Roberts plays the character of Tess, and here they are in the movie cracking a joke that character Tess looks a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays somebody who pretends to be Julia. We'll never know how well it does, because 99,999% of viewers don't really know Julia Roberts personally (and reading about it in Hello Magazine doesn't count). And then Bruce Willis appears! She seems to be Julie Roberts' best friend. Well, he's in the movie ... how do I know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts know each other? I'm not in the minimum interest in the personal life of the actors - I only pay the money and expect them to do the job they have to pay. Anyway, conspiracy conspiracy jokes will start to crack, where Willis (somewhat unconvincingly) plays a psychiatrist ... the one with a small child in it ... you know? No, I forgot what is called. Willis even decreases in commenting on how well the movie did at the box office - how modest of you Mr. Willis! The problem is that not only are these scenes nonsensical and terribly awkward, they also remind viewers that we have just been watching a lot of actors who are moving and receiving huge sums for very little effort. You see, when I see a movie, I want to suspend distrust and forget to watch the actor - I want to believe in the story I'm watching. When you start pulling the scenery down in the middle of the movie, you simply destroy the illusion for me. You know that the TV series jumped when sharks began to feature celebrities, play (stand up and be counted Simpsons, friends, etc.), but this is the first time I've seen a shark jump movie. I usually stay away from such films (eg Scary Movie, The Naked Gun, etc.). The problem is that I honestly never thought that 11 ocean movies would go in that direction. What a shame. So, with the hanging of disbelief thrown out of the window, and the plot that it now leaves in the movie, the worst joke of all the audience will burst - the robbery actually became the way back into the story, and the last 90 minutes or so of the movie there was a pointless posture. Yes, that's right: Steven Soderwhatsit and his actors, all friends, get up, show us an audience and say, "Ha haaa ... you all had ... thanks for your money!". Then they give us one finger in greeting. Well, right on you. Actually, I didn't pay to see this movie ... I downloaded the DVD for nothing. How do they like apples? Now it's a conspiracy.
