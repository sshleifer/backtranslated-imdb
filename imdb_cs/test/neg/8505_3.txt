I like gay-themed movies, where characters are not stereotypically gay and that's what attracted me to this movie, that and the main actor, which is the only reason I give this movie one more star than it deserves (though not because that playing in the movie, let me tell you Many people complain about cinematography, but the camcorder feels that the film has added some "underground" quality to me and there are several scenes, usually around sunset or sunrise and between trains that would make all movie screens blush. But it is cardboard, the music is repeating (over the other half of the movie I have heard the soundtrack from another movie), for every dialog you have to wait almost twenty minutes. it is embarrassing and amateur, the theme of graffiti could make this film great if it was gracefully exploited and that art was more interesting in itself, but not. The film just crawls back into its silence and dies.
