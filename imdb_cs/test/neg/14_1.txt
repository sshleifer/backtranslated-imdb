Some may go to a movie like this, but I'm certainly not. College professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for admission. He almost takes the first child offered, the wrong choice on behalf of Adam. As it turns out, Adam doesn't have both oars in the water, which almost instantly causes countless stress and confusion for Dr. Norwella. This tale of sobbing has taken place dramatically with one problem after another, centered on Adam's inability and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained. He managed to get a good doctor to draw his wife to share all hell. Personally, I thought both of them were one beer with only six backpacks. Go around this yawning.
