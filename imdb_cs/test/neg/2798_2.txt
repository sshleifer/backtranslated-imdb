Dark Harvest is about a group of friends going to the farm (belonging to one of their relatives or something) to escape. But there are murderers scarecrows lurking there (there was something about the curse there too, but I forgot what it was about). Acting in this movie is terrible, I don't know what the director was thinking when casting actors and actresses. The script is the same story as the acting "terrible" (this statement comes very obvious, but ..) if it was better playing and a better scenario, it could become "okay". Also, the director's stink doesn't see any potential for this boy in the future. After all these negatives, this film still maintains a "fun" factor that hits two. The last plus is that they don't use CGI! My overall thoughts on this movie are bad, bad, but so bad that it's "fun" so it gets 2/10
