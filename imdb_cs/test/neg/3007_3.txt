This is one of the most beautiful films of recent years. The fact that it was done on a virtual line ($ 1.8 million, or so they say on DVD: they are based on even less funding) is all the more impressive. It's not just photos, but design and especially places (Eastern Montana) that are immediately authentic American and others. It is a pity not to have a coherent film with him. The extremely hopeful setting of the last 48 hours of clearing a rural city in 1955 before being flooded with a dam is washed up by a pretentious mumbo jumbo referring to angels and a dying child. And what is presented as a "real world" is a hopeless arc. Note for Polish brothers: Coen Brothers are funny - you're not. Many cinemas will no doubt find that "Northfork" has rich symbolism and indistinctness as signs of some kind of stupidity. The sophisticated types struggle the night with the cafes while the braindead masses watch "Charlie's Angels" or something. (Sigh) If you insist .... <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we only recommend as a case study for filmmakers for its perfect technical credits and photographic beauty.
