For me, this film is basically a feature-length pilot episode for the TV series. It reminds me in particular of the British remake of the TV series Wallander, starring Kenneth Brannagh. People interviewed by the police are hardened and often as bitter as the weather, the leading investigator has huge family problems, the investigation always leads to the cruelty of the ancient past, and the rendering is a labyrinth with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end. They both have excellent cinematography. Rendering Jar City is remarkably reminiscent of a standard British or American series of crimes. You could effectively take charts from the Touch of Frost episodes and transplant them at the top of the bleak national environment in this movie and have an effective sequel. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the script couldn't be obviously from the cutter. You will even get the most famous motives, such as the police, who go to the local jail to talk to a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the conversation. I am absolutely convinced that it is scones and jam for many people, but I feel that it needs to point out people like me who do not go to the cinema to watch TV. What I felt was a lack of news. The film takes genetic studies in Iceland as its theme. Icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world, presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics. Much of the information on population inheritance has been preserved, and many genetic diseases unique to Iceland can be traced in a population that has delayed crossing, and is remarkably genetically homogeneous (it's like trying to fold jigsaw puzzles). London underground map, instead of a daisy puzzle). The company called deCODE Genetics has tried to create a database that will contain all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire Icelandic population. Due to privacy concerns, the project was closed and deCODE genetics collapsed in Iceland at the end of last year. The episode is a rich topic for discussion. But in this film genetics and medical science aren't there for education, they're there for a strange atmosphere. It's a grisly movie if you're interested in it, and there's often a morbid focus on food to accompany events like a coroner who eats lunch between slices. The most unpleasant thing for me was when the Chief Inspector swallows the sheep's head. Unfortunately, it sometimes happened to me farcical. The film attempts a somewhat delicate task of blending grisly with sentimental and ultimately unintentional humor. This is equivalent, in kinematic terms, to attempts to prepare a fugue, if you are not well-qualified, hurrying your hand and the edge of the eye, you poison the client. This rather novice director was supposed to lower the tariff for his performance. I came out of this movie and felt a little bad about myself and life in general.
