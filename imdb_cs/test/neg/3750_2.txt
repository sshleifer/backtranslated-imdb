Martha Plimpton has made several prestigious films working with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but has never been able to expand her limited, theatrical challenge to the same class as Molly Ringwald said. This film, which has hardly been released, is just an extension of her late '80s / early' 90s attempting to find a screen-persona that was identifiable to viewers, and it presents another failure. Plimpton plays a troubled young woman who, on her 21st birthday, finds herself accepted, and - worse - was actually abandoned as a child on her parents' doorstep! She sets out to find her biological mother and father, but the viewer has no idea why she wants it (perhaps this curiosity would give her so much determination?). Unpleasant material given to sitcom handling; it starts on the wrong leg and never recovers. Plimpton gives a sour, sure performance, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are fine as her adoptive parents. * 1/2 from ****
