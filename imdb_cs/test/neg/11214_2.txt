This review contains SPOILER --- <br /> <br /> The movie is an American Ninja mysteriously trained in martial arts. He falls on the colonel's daughter and turns from the most spectacular grunt to the "hero of the people" at the end of the film. This movie is extremely cheesy and very poorly researched. It's good for people who don't care about plot development or reality. Good for children under 14 years. Military mistakes in this film are comic. I remember that during my three years in the army we didn't have to say hi or call NCO "Sir", the movie does it in different places. The colonel has too long hair on his ears. Master Sergent's mustache was against the military protocol. Colonel was the only officer in the post. No one else went past the post office. You had idiotic ninjas, who were wandering swords against m-16 troops, somewhat wrong. Michael Dudikoff is not that bad an actor who has a lousy screenplay. Ninjas were more cheerful than dangerous. Avoid this movie
