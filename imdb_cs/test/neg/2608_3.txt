It had a moment, but overall, when I looked at this cartoon as a child, I was bored from my mind. The only thing that followed me was the fact that it was a cartoon, probably my first exposure to anime. It is also one of my favorite anime, I recall others that relate to a giant ship in the universe that doesn't make sense, but was more enjoyable because they were in space. I also remember one with these people, dressed like birds, who were a little strange but more fun. I really don't like a racing car, though at all, I haven't done it yet, so it's probably one of the reasons I didn't care about this show, even though I'm an avid anime fan today. The characters were also a little goofy, and then there were horrible scenes where there was virtually no action that was probably used to cut down on the cost of animation and the show. The gadgets in the cars were cool and then they gave me some fun. Overall, it seems to me that this show is quite imperceptible compared to newer anime and some of the same era, but that's just a personal opinion, I'm sure many other reviewers love a show that's cool.
