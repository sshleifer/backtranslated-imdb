Today Die Die begins as an honorary criminal of Harlan Bank (producer Steven Seagal) is hired sinister entrepreneur Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) to drive a safety car with $ 20,000,000 cash back from Las Vegas 'A' point to 'B' Sounds simple ? What Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money was stolen and that he had just become an attacker in an armed robbery. Bummer. Things get worse for Harlan when local cops catch him and chuck him for a long time, but Harlan managed to hide the money before catching him and with a nice $ 20,000,000 at stake and missing for Harlan must watch his back as crooks want it anyway as government agents. Harlan joins Ice Kool (!) (Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in jail and they both escape when Harlan seeks revenge ... <br /> <br /> Don E FauntLeRoy has to say that the shot in Eastern European action films that Steven Seagal specializes in these days is no better. This is a horrible movie, simple as it really does. Producer Danny Lerner's script, Kevin Moore and Les Weldon give Seagal a new kind of character to get his non-existent acting skills around, a criminal rather than a government agent / cop / soldier / one male army clich√© he usually plays. In fact, if you were charitable, you could say today that you died today from the excellent Payback thriller (1998) Mel Gibson, where he also played a really nasty job. While Payback was an excellent uncompromising hard film noir type action thriller Today You Die is not and pale into insignificance compared. Unfortunately, Seagal is terrible, has no screen presence, no threat, and the audience is never quite sure if he is a bad person we hate or not. For example, initially his character is set up as a modern day Robin Hood, who steals from rich drug dealers and scumbags to give the poor (and keep a good profit for himself), which is ridiculous in itself, but then Seagal has turned and murdered a lot of people, which contradicts a sympathetic moral criminal, that the film went to such an extent that it first stood up. The story is full of holes, for example Agent Knowles is contacted on Harlan's escape & is then rebuked by her bent parent for meeting him & turns out to have found that he tapped her phone. In that case, why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch Harlan? The story is a usual boring predictable bland fight for a lot of money with a surprise surprise investigating government agent is actually a bad guy! Wow, I haven't seen me coming I have to say ... <br /> <br /> Director FauntLeRoy slows everything down to the snail's pace & Today you Die feels it goes forever, action scenes and set-pieces are also seriously missing in the amusement value. Occasional combat scenes are not great, most of them are either shot in the shade, cut out very quickly, or a camera that plays behind Seagal's character to try to hide the fact that most stunts are doubled. Again, Seagal looks fat & out of mold & uses long baggy coats to try & hide, it doesn't. On the streets of Las Vegas, there was quite a great chase behind the car on the streets of Las Vegas and I thought today's Die Die could be fine, but the whole sequence seems to have been stolen from another action movie called Top of the World ( 1997), which is a casino robbery in Las Vegas, as well as shots from Today You Die also edits scenes from the action film Charlie Sheen No Code of Conduct (1998), the action film Jean-Claude Van Damme The Order (2001) & Wesley Snipes Prison Action Movie Undisputed (2002) Quite How Much Of What You Are Dying Today Is Original Shots, Someone is Guessing. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is fine. Own footage is just about competent and consistent enough. All shots from US locations are apparently canceled from the films already mentioned with all the original shots taken on the cheap Bulgarian market. Rap style music that litter Today You Die is terrible by the way. Acting is wrong and Seagal mumbles his way as usual. Today You Die is a really bad movie made up of other bad action movies, Seagal looks old and fat, action scenes are average at best and most of the story is quite random and at the end it doesn't fit well at all. One to avoid if your hard seagal fan, if such an animal even exists ...
