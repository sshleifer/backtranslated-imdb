This story had a good story about four older men who share a deadly secret about a young woman they met 50 years ago. After this time, the young woman returns to men's revenge. Occasionally this story nodded during the film amidst the tiring music of the lifts and the ever-stronger storms. But it is worth waiting at the end when we find out who is a mysterious woman who is troubling old men in their dreams and interfering with the life of a young man. Most of what I liked in this film was the tension in which a young woman appears to men just before they die. Special effects were something. Every time I hear him ask them, I think, "Not your face now." But it was a good movie, I just wished that the pace wasn't so slow or the acting was not so tiring. And what I liked about the film was also the memory of the 1920s, very authentic and original costumes.
