I recently had the idea of ​​making a short film with a man hit by a car and waking up to be Chuck Norris himself. That meant I'd have to do extensive research on Chuck and find out about the man as much as possible. Later I find out that he is not really a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With a face that could doubt it at all? In the last four months I've been watching more Chuck Norris movies than any other person would have. I am proud to say that Bells of Innocence is close to the worst list ever. I spent most of the film wondering if I could return my copy to the local Wal-Mart without the confirmation I bite to avoid swallowing. The biggest reason I chose this movie was that Chuck wasn't there but his son Mike. I was impatiently trying to find out if Mike was detached from the old block that could not be grabbed for his journey. I came to a conclusion long ago; Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in the history of cinema for one simple reason. The only character he ever plays is himself, Chuck Norris. No matter what movie, whatever the situation, Chuck Norris is always. One thing he has over his son is that he is consistent. Mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work. In a scene where she talks to her little girl about her dead daughter, she seems very happy! Maybe it's because he actually pushed his daughter out, as shown in one of the strangest memories of all time. His action confused me throughout the film, so it was very hard for me to focus on what was there. The other two main actors were as painful as they looked at Norris's son. Anyone who wants to eat or tell a stupid joke all the time is just one of the most annoying characters ever to have a Direct-to-Video screen. The only thing I remember being in this movie was the Texas Ranger Walker episode, in which it plays an equally unpleasant character. Maybe he owes Chuck something. The other person who is the only name I think was so forgetful was your average Christian fanatic. I have nothing against Christians, in fact I am one, but this guy was too much for me. To complete this story, you have a lot of people who like to call people "friend", and a few rascals who aren't able to decide which one is in charge. Not to mention the scary kids who remind me of the version of the dollar stores of every other group of scary kids in movies. All in all, the film is perhaps one of the greatest failures of all time, on more levels than Chuck Norris can kick a donkey. Despite being one of the worst actors of all time, I can't get enough of Chuck. Maybe he was really sent from heaven ...
