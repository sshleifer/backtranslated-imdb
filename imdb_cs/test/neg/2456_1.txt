Greetings all, <br /> <br /> Isn't it amazing how much movies have on you after the first look? When I first saw this movie, I was so pleased that I couldn't stop talking about "Flatliners" to all my friends for weeks - I think I was very moving for 18 years and my taste in movies since then it has become a bit more conservative. Then somehow I forgot about this movie until I saw a DVD in my local department store and I remembered how great it was that I thought "Right! I'll rip you out of the shelf when they release Special edition". Last week I was thrilled when my best friend invited me to watch Flatliners on DVD. It was expected that I would like to watch this movie for the 2nd viewing .. How bad I was! Verdict: After 11 years, my view of this film has changed from a very scary first-class movie to Junk, which overlaps the religious and supernatural side of things superficially. I've never been a big fan of Julie Roberts (with the exception of Erin Brockeridge, in which she earned an Oscar). the director and the average script are definitely with this film. I let this movie feel like it has no real nature or potential, and just a few scarey cheap thrills that weren't very well done at all. Even James-Newtown Howard's score, which I like as a film composer, could not captivate and inspire me. In 1990 I gave this movie 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I would have been lucky if I had done 2/10 at best. <br /> <br />
