Synopsis Correction: The end does not show Ben cruising online for boys. Searches for Arabic language courses at Presido Military Acadama in San Francisco. Maybe I will join the Iraq war as a translator (FYI - many of the dishonest discharges from "D'ont ask D'ontu that they were translators (they are now the main drawback) Ben Also spoke Russian. Good time capsule life in Manhatten but quite a bit of non reality here. Mostly a good laugh at Lame social skills and sad depiction of "grown up" twenty something that hasn't evolved outside the university party mode. changing scene in manhatten (somehow it always stays close to the edge of the same BS) <br / Watch together the films "English in New York" and "The New Twenty", both good for Nostalgia. I think the "twenty" movie shows how far the blur between gay men and straight as it evolved. > <br /> These two movies are the time to travel GAY for sure !!!!
