My wife and I have bad science fiction movies. Some movies are so bad they're good. Mansquito was one of those. This one was bad, but he had some redeemable features. This wonders how a respectable actor approaches lines like "Hey! Mansquito!" This one is so bad that it has now taken its place as our bad standard. It's not just a bad movie, it really stinks. There was a power of fire, an "Indian" who rode in a black cloak and used SWORD for a loud call. Downed helicopter with arrow !! We tried to laugh at this movie, but there were no points on which it would not stand above the poor. We couldn't come up with any balancing functions except one. It was the words "End" <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no plot, no character development and no movie. Someone in Hollywood must be fired.
