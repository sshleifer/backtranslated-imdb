POSSIBLE SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I like Mega Ryan. I was looking forward to seeing them together, married and everyone, I wanted to see their chemistry on the screen. Okay, that said, I think the fact that the actors, their off-screen relationship, didn't have to get into their performances, especially with this scenario. How stupid a professor can be bonding himself. I don't remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably tied to his front lady, probably in the most inevitable way. If I were "connected" to someone, I'd be quite angry. The blowing I would have had would have swiftly dispelled. Meg showed that only a slight surprise was a little angry. Dennis will have to kick me and scream. The whole part of the film was so terrible - especially Meg, who had to go to the bathroom (# 2) between the landfills in the dark at night. Ewww. No f **** ing way! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with Dennis, who submerges each of the suspects in the movie. The sock asks later. Not once, not twice, but too many times - if I were so inclined, I could count. The most interesting part of the movie was Nick and his family drama. Too bad it couldn't be more of a conspiracy. An anticipated drama off the screen leading to this tragedy. I think it could be written without distracting from finding Dex. My guilt lies with the writer of this scenario. Unless the director and others have done so much, it's unknowable. I won't even get into the real reason Dex was murdered. How ridiculous it is. Although Dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained (the actual moment of the film "noir"), everyone on the screen looked bored. Oh, _____ it happened. Oh. (yawning) "Dex even says it's a stupid reason for triple murder. Oh tension, you can cut it with a spoon. <br /> <br /> If someone other than Dennis was in this movie, stars (just because I really saw worse) but in this case 1 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> For Dennis and Meg stars, see ANYTHING ELSE.
