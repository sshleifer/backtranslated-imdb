Actually there was nothing funny about this monstrosity at all! This film was an utter outrage. The absurdities in this movie made me puke! I think the people responsible for this film have used their viewers. They took a fairly decent series of movies (I said decently, NOT GOOD!) And I totally destroyed them by trying to put money in my pockets. Aircraft Production! There was a way to Hollywood to take on this crappy swing. The worst part is that even in 1979 no one realized the movie's asinine events (eg Concorde's door emerged at some headless high altitude, or Patrons shot a window in Mach 2 to avoid NUCLEAR WARHEAD! ?!? .... what they thought ???) were completely unrealistic or just not interested! I think it's the second one. The writers and director of this "movie", if you want to call it, really tried to suck this year's dynasty dry!
