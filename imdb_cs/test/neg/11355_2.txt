I never really thought about this movie. I still saw him sitting on a horror movie shelf in my local video store, and I never really thought about it. Just your mill run, crazy zombie with a little gore and sex scenes. Nothing special, like watching Python ... oh no waiting, that's a horrible movie. I decided to watch when some of my friends saw it on TV and said it was a terrible piece. garbage. So I decided to verify these stories before I realized how horrible is the film that hides behind the uninteresting and uninteresting DVD cover. It's not that the idea itself is bad. The plane is a closed area and would be a real deadly trap for people on board if the zombies made their appearance ... a good prerequisite for a zombie movie. But this movie made a good setting, and all around it collapsed with bad acting, unstable camera, unpleasant characters, and terrible scores. Characters have different levels of hate. There are two young couples who are basically friends on holiday in France. One pair consists of an athletes and his annoying girlfriend who has an affair with Mr. Jock's best friend who came along with his girlfriend who is a blonde psycho. There is also a policeman escorting a con-man (effeminate and very uncomfortable con-man). The policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters. Then there's a lot of air hostesses that mostly end up like a zombie chow ... no I was looking at the whole movie, it was just too painful to make over, almost as bad as watching a holocaust cannibal. And there is also a golfer on vacation with his wife, some strange air marshal who doesn't really seem important until he's called to help deal with zombie refugees, a trio of scientists who have all been victims of the undead and a few people. pilots. Working with the camera is often shaky, and although many people don't seem to mind, after a while they can really get on their nerves as if they still have a small buzzer on their heads. It's small, but it's there and it's unpleasant. The adultery couple is really uncomfortable. All they do is sex in the toilets of the aircraft, while their husbands are not looking ... in fact, all the young adults in this film are insanely annoying. They whine, bitch, quarrel and have the most intricate and awkward boring dialogue in the movie ... yes, you're happy to die. <br /> <br /> The score is cruel. It's so general and uninspired that it kills any kind of tension the scene could create, replacing it with the feeling that someone scratches the nails and laughs at you. In fact, it sounds like a score ... Python! The movie will never stop haunting me. There is also a character that filmmakers seemed incredibly deliberate to have in as many shots as possible. Sitting in a young adult and clutching a Bible that is included in many shots, a nun begins to wonder if she plays a significant role in the movie ... but no, no, so why does she have so many scenes? Was it because the filmmaker was the original filmmaker's project? No one will ever know. <br /> <br /> Zombies look pretty good. Their makeup is good and they are probably much better actors than live characters, they are much more convincing and sympathetic! The ranger responsible for overseeing the scientist's illegal cargo was quite amusing. It looks like a big crate falls on him and the camera briefly shows the viewer that his leg has been pierced by some sharp object ... yet he did not shout, feel or groan in pain. He just grunts and wiggles in an effort to get the thing off his leg ... in fact, it sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain. Oh well, all in all I give 1 for an interesting environment and 1 for zombies. Watch this movie only if you like young adults bickering and throwing things at you, and unfortunately there's really nothing fun about the whole thing, so watch out for laughter would probably fail if you're not on some psychoactive medicine high.
