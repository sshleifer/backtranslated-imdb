This movie is something terrible. I laughed all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought it was not polite to laugh when people die, but this movie looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into one tornado. The explosions of cars throwing wind power on buildings look like those of an old school scroller game called R-Type. Dialogues are very bad and I wonder how they managed to convince some of the actors to play in this movie. It's just amazing how such a bad movie can get on TV. The only real reason to watch this movie is to have some fun of nonsense and absurdity.
