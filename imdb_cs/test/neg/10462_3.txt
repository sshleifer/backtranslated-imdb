Construction workers disrupt the indigenous burial ground of a large, massive skeletal monster that breaks down its victims with touch, breath or bone sword! Krantz (Jim Storm) instructed his construction crew to keep his skeletal findings secret, stopping continued development if the nearby Katona tribe caught the wind that remained on the ground and was dug and disturbed. Aging Bruce Boxleitner, sympathetic as always, is the Swiss Sheriff Evans, who is trying to keep the peace between the crew of Katonas and Krantz. Peace was tense, at best, but with that skeletal monster running rampant, so that the victims disappear without a trace, soon Krantz wants answers, why members of his crew are missing ..Evans begins to lose citizens as well. Evans is warned by Katona Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) that an ancient demon, Bone Eater, has been relaxed and can only be stopped with a sacred ax (the ax was removed by a worker who found it to be still with the gun plunged inside) ) now in the back seat of her daughter Kelly's (Clara Bryant, who wears tight jeans and shirts to reveal how daddy's girl has grown into a pretty striking lady) where the car is. Evans must somehow defeat the demon if the killing stops .. and this must happen before Eclipse or her power becomes too strong for anyone to beat. <br /> <br /> A solid cast that collapses in an awkward horror trip. CGI is not very good, although a monster might be quite threatening if it did with a better budget. He goes on horseback from the dust chasing prey for Petesake! Some appearances included BUCK ROGERS Gil Gerard as Evan Big Jim's deputy, Walter Koenig of STAR TREK as coroner, William Katt of HOUSE, who took care of Evan's deputy. None of these portraits last longer than one minute or so. Adoni Maropis impresses in the underwriting role as a tense Katona, Johnny Black Hawk, who wishes to use Bone Eater to move a white man out of his tribe's land. Jennifer Lee Wiggins portrays Kaya, a tasty meal from a Katona woman whose hatred of Black Hawk as a white man and wishes Evans to follow his Indian blood to end the Bone Eating monster. It might be worth it if you saw Boxleitner dressed in war color and Indian clothing. I felt for the actor to be honest, because Bruce was trying to keep his face in that horrible movie. In another overworked and tiring clich√©, Bruce's sheriff has an alienated relationship with his daughter, whose 17, hot, and who want to date a "bad boy". conspiracy about the killing skeleton and many poorly developed characters.
