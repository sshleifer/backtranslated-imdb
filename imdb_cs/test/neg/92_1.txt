this movie has no conspiracy, no good playing to be honest, has nothing, the same songs play over and over again over horrible gameplay and if you can sit there and watch the whole thing and enjoy it, there is something wrong with you. I wish I could put it 0 out of 10, but I can't, so it must be 1 that is generous! ice-t is neither a good rapper and even worse to play, every bit of a movie is a waste, i have this movie on a DVD without knowing what it was for a price of Â£ 1.99 and thought i was picking up a contract, then i got I looked at the IMDb rating and didn't take it into consideration, but after watching it found that the DVD I bought was a complete waste of time, money and electricity. If you have this movie, there are two things you can sell to someone who doesn't know about it or burn it!
