This is quite typical of the Sci-Fi channel: one-dimensional characters, ridiculous plot, and severe special effects. We have some extraterrestrial sock puppets loose on the train and Lou Diamond Phillips is trying to get what he is given to do the performance. And save the day. Everyone else in this is totally useless; Of course, a former wife, who is passing through the time of the honorable clich√© of the first adverse Lou, then falls in love again at the end. An unpleasant State Senator who got drunk at the beginning and a crowd of blunt security guards running around. Then there's an eco-terrorist who has no reason at all for this film, except that it will give us 3% more run. He spends the entire middle of the film hiding in the box. <br /> <br /> Special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air, behind it is flames, about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this film, if you exceed the permitted speed limit in your vehicle, atmospheric friction can cause it to burst into flames. Then he lands on the hood of the car and walks horizontally. A little like a velcro velcro landing ball. It's really not damaging the car much, just bends the bonnet a little. Later, Lou gets into the helicopter and chases after the train. Even though the train had only a two-minute lead, it takes a good half hour. CGI is so bad that a helicopter seems to be as big as the hills it flies. Then it flies to the side of the mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. They seem to have taken a glass of gasoline and threw it on the wall, then put a flame effect over the flame. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter couldn't pick up in time, carrying five tons of nitroglycerine. Then the eco-terrorist finally blows up, but instead of exploding in all directions, like most explosions, it explodes upward like a gun pointed to the air. Then there is the whole agreement that it is not possible to stop the train because it would allow the small aliens to get off, but the extraterrestrials seem to be able to actually fly faster than the train on the road, so why would they keep them on the train. You have a couple of hours that absolutely need to kill, and it's on this movie or reps in the food network, well, come on, some of those chefs are kind of cute. These films usually have at least one or two things that allow them to sit in them; maybe there is a sexy girl, some T&A, or a character who actually has a personality or some tension, or something, something. I didn't really see this.
