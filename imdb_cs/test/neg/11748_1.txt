First, the whole idea of ​​remaking a classic like "Psycho" is nothing less than ridiculous. Lots of time and effort were wasted. I'm sure they're smart enough to know they can't improve on the original, so they had to pay tribute to Alfred Hitchcock on their minds. .This movie is poorly produced, badly acted, and useless to start with. The original classic stands well on its own, even after 40 years. Action Hitch is coming back from the grave and coming to the people responsible for this piece of garbage is unlikely, but if I were, I'd sleep with one eye open only in case. Don't waste your time.
