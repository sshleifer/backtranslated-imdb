I can't understand how this image was allowed. It is mostly, if not entirely, inaccurate that the main character does not resemble how history looks physically. This film made me go online and go through my books to make sure I remember Nero correctly. For God, I have a book that lists Nero as one of the most evil people in the world and the film made me feel bad for him. I must say that Aggrapina's character seemed close to my understanding, both physically and mentally. Although the actors did a good job, the movie was terrible and I'm sure I won't watch any more that this excused team would do.
