Both absurd, disgusting characters and boring film. Saved by short sex scenes, mad witch, beautiful desert island and Brooks body. The plot is weak, the characters are shallow and unlikely. I said I managed to follow it all, mainly because I was totally exaggerated by the trembling and the kind of hope that her character would finally come out well. The film was well filmed, well directed, but perhaps the cast lost in some ways. Disappointed. He really summed up the first line review, but this page dictates that you have to write at least 10 lines. It would be better to spend time watching another movie.
