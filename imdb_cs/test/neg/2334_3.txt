For as long as we have this persistent belief, as soon as the director produces great, pioneering work, all future work "cannot be so bad, after all," he did. Mulholland Drive is an example and in fact is an incredible waste. The performances are excellent, especially from Watts and Theroux, but a good movie that doesn't necessarily do. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that just an unnecessarily weird movie just works when it surprises the audience. When viewers expect the film to make no sense, then the film must have some substance to keep the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the film, a mysterious murder meets lots of twists and red sequences, and then ... plop! The story turns into a scarlet bizarre hallucination and unnecessary segma. Methinks Lynch realized how confused the film had become, and threw the lesbian and mastobator scenes to the viewer up and stopped the male viewers in standing and leaving. Watching the Movie in Preview, I was surrounded by Lynchophiles, who had no idea what was going on before I did, but I left theatrical commentaries on the "layers and layers" of Lynch's filmmaking. Excuse me, but these people are the same nitwites who stand in galleries and look at canvases that have been painted white with a note about "the artist's courage in painting such daring work". Such films are (a) Lynch trades on his previous work; and (b) because people are convinced that non-intelligible film is art, and therefore must be good. I asked about the number of Lynchophils who really liked the movie and the answer I received was not the broad "layer" of the type of answer that they liked when "girls got their kit". Nuff said.
