A couple of teenagers have little sex on the beach in the 1960s. That is all. They are said to be fifteen, while one of the actors is really twenty-five. Perhaps this film was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 when it touched taboo topics, but I can't imagine that at that time anything that was shown in Esmiko Limon was considered taboo. Shallow dialogs mingle with disco music that is even shallower. The selection of songs does not include anything but the well-known "classics" that are still heard on every other radio station. The American Pie story is not very different, but it's a little funny. Eskimo Limon is boring, flat and not aesthetic. Almost unbelievable that it had six sequels!
