Alien invaders in the desert. Small blue rocks that appear to be made of cheap plastic. The overall story is not bad if you like this kind of thing, but acting is so far behind the bad that amazes me that some of them really amused my in X files! And special effects? Hi?! Where did their high school crew get their FX crew? I mean, come on; there was so much more they could do! It was amateur and very simple. Especially I didn't enjoy it (and my dad fell asleep during it!) And of course our hero falls in love with the front lady! It's so typical and highly predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
