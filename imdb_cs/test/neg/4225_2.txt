I think the cards were stacked against the webmaster, because from the very beginning this itchy feeling was like something was wrong, but I couldn't give it a finger. Then it hit me. Dubbed. For a little while they had mastered most of the lines, either as a voice over the screen or off-screen, with a little hint of back and forth until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that grows on the nerves, and there's nothing funny about it. I hate dubbing, but at the very least, although poorly placed, martial arts movies badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humor about it. <br /> <br /> What I wanted was a movie about a hacker who does real hacking and the like. . Perhaps the opposite side of the Hackers movie table (it's about who tries to keep them instead of trying to get inside). What I got was somewhat badly written, a pointless occasional secret of murder with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly clumsy hacker who was castrated without his little ego, and a director who didn't seem to know how to handle the camera. I wanted to get there, catch the camera from the guy and shoot the same thing. The cut wasn't much better. Playing? Well, I think if the lead guy didn't have such a bad scenario, he should at least be observable. The main bad was also fine, but almost everyone else was a joke. Dubbing did not help, but acting was bad enough, even though it took into account. Before I get into the wrong one, let's do some good things. One two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoyed things from the cyber world, which was few, and would prefer to watch the movie mostly about the surroundings and around it rather than the lukewarm environment outside in the "real world". The false fingerprint thing seemed to be fine, but in the scheme of things it ended up being useless. The heart gadget that reminded me of Cronos by Guillermo Del Toro was interesting, though as a conspirator he ripped straight from the Escape from New York site, he was framed for a long time. There is one point where a bad person is unconscious and our hero is there. Why didn't he try to print the bad guy (because the heart was activated with his thumb)? However, some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff if only they could be used better. Now who dares to compare this movie with Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future and have some kind of romance in any movie. There is a murder investigation, but I've seen many movie with murder in its center that are nothing like Blade Runner or webmaster. Identity, for example. This is where the similarities end. Time. There is no comparison as well as between Blade Runner and hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a strong commitment to artistic direction and knows some of the basics of filmmaking, where to place a camera. Webmaster is cheap, not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than doesn't take an easy way out (like writing in a character that barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the end to bring her to point B alone without a hero, so that he could do his a thing, very comfortable, or an attempt at a compassionate factor for a character we have no reason to care for. He is trying to be hip, trying to exploit, even trying to twist the end, which isn't a bit surprising But trying to be exciting, but a bunch of almost identical chase sequences, bad writing, cut, terrible shot, bad play, etc. It's not an exciting movie.
