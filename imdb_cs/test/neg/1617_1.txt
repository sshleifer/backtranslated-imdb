* Spoilers here <br /> <br /> Where do I start, how stupid was this movie? 'Mole size people living under the garden are attacking the inhabitants of a big house' !!! When I first sat down to watch this movie, I did not know that the protagonists, who are not poltergeists, etc., but 10 inches of tall elves who looked powerful and easily kicked. I watched it because I enjoyed seeing movies to the end, even the horrible ones. this movie was terrible. My girlfriend, who went to bed in the first ten minutes, besides being a good sleeping aid, thought it was funny that I bothered to watch it all. Small goblins even in large numbers (the thought is stupid, I know) is about as scary and terrible as flat cola. The only man managed to "fatally" go and kill the cat before they were fired, The End. Did I mention it's right?
