Grapes. Absolutely terrible. Long, confusing and ungrateful. After about three hours of this painful mess, the last nail in the coffin is the end. Even the beautiful, sexy, beautiful goddess Francesca Annis can't save this bad adaptation of Agatha Christie's work. The story goes and pulls, and time goes slowly, and suddenly you realize you don't even know what's going on. Even with the usual explanation of the villain, there are still a lot of things left unexplained and then? it's end. A complete waste of time and undoubtedly one of the worst adaptations that bears the name of Agatha Christie.
