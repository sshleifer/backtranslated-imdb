The "Puffy Chair" was the ultimate waste of the 84 minutes of my life that cannot be acquired and spent in a more valuable way (even the "Blair Witch Project" was a better use of precious moments). It must be called a "Puffy Chair" because only "inflated" chairs could hold extremely "inflated", confident brothers who have lost it for public consumption; and, of course, they are so full of themselves that they assumed that the public would really want to consume their drooling. "The Puffy Chair" from "The Wooly Boys" look like a movie masterpiece! "Valley of the Dolls", "Beyond the Doll Valley", "Pink Flamingos", "Chainsaw Massacre in Texas", "Night of the Living Dead", "Urban Cowboy", "Blob," - all these would be better use of their time than viewing "Puffy Chair." The characters depicted are either too predictable or too lacking in normal emotional reflections to even come close to sympathy or credibility. Also, at one point in the film, as characters are to be in the same small town, if one closely observes, one can see that one part of the city is apparently in the southern United States, and the other half is located. in Maine. That's a city, huh?
