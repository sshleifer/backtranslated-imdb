I recently saw it at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2007 and I can't believe this is Sweden's official submission at the 79th Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Last year, producer Anna Anthony also had Sweden's official presentation for Best Foreign Film with Earth. I wasn't personally a Zozo fan, but at least it had some production value. This could be filmed as a high school film project. It may have worked as a short film, but as a feature film it is as lost as the characters. It is a story about twenty-five friends who live in a small Swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and love to live their long gone childhood in the past. Actually, Falkenberg is not like a distant northern Swedish village. It is a popular resort with a population of nearly 40,000 and is located between the two large southern coastal Swedish cities of Götborg and Malmö. Characters are nice enough guys, but if they were middle school kids with a bleak or confused attitude towards what they were planning to do with their lives, I'd no doubt be more concerned with them. However, they are long after the place where they should make plans to solve adulthood. If they want to stay in Falkenberg forever, before there must be any jobs in the tourism or fishing industry, instead of riding bicycles, drinking, smoking and sometimes painting the house. Maybe they would break up with a girl or two in a circle of friends, which girls are missing in this movie, which makes no sense. The directorial debut is Jesper Ganslandt, who, together with the cameraman, wrote a film I use freely, Fredrik Wenzel. acting is not too bad. I would like to give it 4.5 out of 10, but in spite of being submitted to an academic award I would not recommend it.
