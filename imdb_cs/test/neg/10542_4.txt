Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed. I was thinking .... Steven Seagal's movie! Cold! We'll see him kick people and overturn people and break bones. We can even see him fighting with someone! Great! However, I was in for a gross awakening. This movie can be summarized as follows: Take the A-Team episode, remove loving and brave characters like Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face. Then the writer / director pen plot and Ed Wood would be ashamed and who is too big a fan of The Matrix and John Woo movies for his own good. Throw a lot of people with really bad acting skills who don't have real names. Finally, add a main star that is still dropped around the midriff and it doesn't seem to be able to make its own pieces anymore. <br /> <br /> Result? Half of the dead. Action movie so ridiculous that at least he smiled. The plots of the plot are tremendously great - for example, prisoners who, when the prison is attacked, fight the invaders rather than try to escape. Or how about the prison itself, which has an armory that contains heavy machine guns and a rocket launcher? You also have a helicopter (bearing a strong resemblance to Huey) with some nose-mounted video game machine. Then there is Seagal himself. I like the guy. He can fight. It's even funny that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But for the whole movie I was hoping for one big, defining battle scene. It never happened. Instead, we have a lot of people shooting guns and not hurting hell. I mean, when someone runs down a narrow corridor and fires a partial machine gun on them, there aren't many places where bullets could go differently than down the hall and into the finish. Still, is it missing? Even the A-team would cringe in this stupidity. And then, when it comes to any kind of physical material, we'll be treated for a shabby Matrix rip-off. People get kicks twenty feet in the air and make more ridiculous acrobatic nonsense. C'mon Steven, you're better than this. Your career cannot be over. Let's say it's not! <br /> <br /> This is instantly forgotten (except that I have to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you look at it, try to find it in a fun A- Team kind way. But I doubt it will be high on anyone's re-watchable list. It is not for justice. More like Lunch.
