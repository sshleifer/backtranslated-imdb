Lame rip-off from XPERIMENT QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly boring, even grim - but the second phase is greatly improved with scenes that involve furious "monsters". In an accompanying performance (rather a dry matter for only 9 minutes, compared to those that were created for other titles in the set "Monsters & Madmen" in Criterion), director Day - who admits he is not a fan of the sci-fi genre - is trying to justify the shortcomings of the film by saying it has zero budget work (where all the scenes from the universe were composed of footage!) ... and I would be willing to be more lenient towards the film I did not watch CALTIKI, IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) - similar ( and similarly upside down) but much more stylish enterprise from Italy! Bill Edwards, as an unfortunate but unhappy cosmonaut - obsessed with achieving titular performance - is initially positively boring, but eventually manages to gain audience sympathy when his physical qualities distort and character develops. for blood! Marshall Thompson as his commanding officer and older brother is O.K. as a slimmer type of Glenn Ford; previously played in FEND WITHOUT FACE (1958), another (and more successful) sci-fi produced by Richard Gordon, which is, incidentally, also available on DVD through Criteria. The Italian star Marla Landi, struggling with the English language, leads to a lack of leadership; Even its entry into the featurette proves to be a little lasting value! Audio commentary is another fun song by Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon where FIRST MAN INTO SPACE was intended to be a double function with BLOOD CORRIDORS (1958). up - but eventually released as a standalone release to take advantage of the current intelligence value of the current space race; it is also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by Bonar Colleano (who, tragically, died in a traffic accident before the film release!). Weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time he was involved in producing a DVD of all people's feature film, ex-cult filmmaker Norman J. Warren: Landi, who then became a lady. the title, he was still ready to help transport the equipment needed to record an interview at several staircases! Edwards was supposed to contribute to the featurette but, once in London, he proved unwilling to cooperate with Weaver - eventually, the latter learned that the actor was recently diagnosed with cancer and, in fact, he died in 2002!
