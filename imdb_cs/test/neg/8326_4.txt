"Black Vengeance" is an alternative title "Ying hung ho hon" AKA "Tragic Hero" (1987). I just saw it on VHS, along with the first part of the story, "Gong woo ching" ("Rich and Famous"), also in 1987. (Poster and 2 photos on the page are for 4-DVD set starring Rod Perry (Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist) Strangely, while characters retain their original names in "rich and famous", in "black revenge" the Chow Yun-tuk character is named Eddie Shaw Alex Man (Tze Leung's man) is Harry, and Andy Lau is called Johnny, also confusing is the fact that 1994 is listed as the date of copyright on both films, perhaps it was the year that Americans were dubbed. "Tragic Hero" was released before "Rich and Famous" on IMDb. Was there any reason for the first release? Despite some users' comments, I enjoyed these movies, even though they are not among the best CYF like "The Killer" and "Hard- Boiled, which are really amazing. if one day I come across a 2-DVD set of "Rich and Famous" and "Tragic Hero", I won't hesitate to buy it. Hopefully these comments on "Black Vengeance" have cleared up, which was also a mystery to me where Chow Yun-Fat filmography belonged.
