I bought this movie and hoped it would be another great toy killer movie. I am a big fan of the Children's Play series and I was hoping to see it here. Boy, I was wrong. Most of the movie wasn't a bit scary, and the only time we see Pinocchio "alive" is the last few scenes of the movie. The little girl in the movie, her acting performance is so bad that it's almost ridiculous. In addition, the end never showed what happened to the puppet, or what made them put the girl in asylum or anywhere at the end of the film. So, in my opinion, this film is the worst genre of a "toy killer". If you want a good series of killer toys, stick to the Child's Play series. Pinocchio's revenge is a waste of money and time.
