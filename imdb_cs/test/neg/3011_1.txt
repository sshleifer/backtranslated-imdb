The VIP key is just another of the terrible T.V. shows that you can and see at this station. The show is terrible with boys claiming to be real players competing against each other (there are two of them competing in each episode) in silly games where they try to get girls on the bar to talk to them, get number girls, and so on. The judges are four other guys who also claim to be pick-ups, but they also look like huge d-bags as well as competitors. The show is not at all funny or interesting, it's just boring to watch these guys desperately trying to convince us what astonishing players are (they talk about four judges more than the contestants). Nothing happened at the shows I saw, and of course the shows are rigged. Do you really think they've invited all these guys to the club, have them sign messages and put them on tape, while these guys do the same silly games with them? It's not a reality at all, it's just silly, probably even tapes in the daytime. Someone else wrote here how they knew somebody at the show and it was fake well, that's obvious, it's a fake show and it's still not funny with the actors. One of the worst exhibitions I've ever seen.
