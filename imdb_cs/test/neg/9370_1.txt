All he has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack, their choices and opinions and philosophical issues he raises. Tru feels that he is helping people who are not to die, and Jack feels that they are to die, and that he is playing with a fateful plan or with a plan of the universe, or with what he is not. It is obviously capable of changing things, so there is apparently nothing like fate in the series's metaphysics. Jack has no basis to believe he exists. And very comfortably Tru never asks him the right questions. No one will do it. Which obviously proves that the serial manufacturers have no answer. <br /> <br /> There's just no chart! Instead, they leave a smudge on the show to be able to continue with the boring girl thing, only occasionally interrupted by Tru and Jack's race against each other at the end, which are not known ... <br /> <br /> that none of this is nothing. A teen pop series that pretends to be something else. <br /> <br /> Your time will sleep better.
