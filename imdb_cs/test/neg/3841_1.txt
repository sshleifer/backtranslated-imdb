I would like to start by saying that I wouldn't see the movie again if they were distributing popcorn from solid gold and the ticket gave me eternal life. This movie was terrible. I can't really give it honesty because there are no negative stars. Playing is absolutely awful. This film is travesty, based on the classic, "the most dangerous game". If you really want to torture for 90 minutes, rent something like Gigli. At least J-Lo provides some better scenery, Ben should calm the ladies to view it. I'm not upset at the $ 7 I paid to see this move, like 90 minutes of life. <br /> <br /> "Can you give me time back!" Samuel L. Jackson, changing stripes
