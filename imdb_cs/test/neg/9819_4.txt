Disappointed movie with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler. When discovered, he is forced to sign a document that he has acted on orders from England. His refusal to sign the document brings us to the storyline of the film. Pidgeon is persecuted back to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness. Along the way being watched, Pidgeon meets Joan Bennett, the latter showing a gorgeous cockney accent. The story gets set down somewhat as love develops between the two, but again as we approach World War 11, realism becomes the subject of the day. The almost ending cave scene between Sanders and Pidgeon is well done, but we know where the arrow will go. Very interesting that while Pidgeon flees from Nazi Germany, he again meets young Roddy McDowall, one of the many Pidgeon teammates that took place in the same year. unforgettable "How green was my valley." How Green Was "Man Hunt"?
