** May contain spoilers ** Terrible. Just awful. I loved Stephen King's novel and it's just a terrible adaptation. It will change the end. It changes the storyline. They changed the character of Alan Pangborn from a grieving husband to a happy fianc√©. If you're a fan of Stephen King's novel, stay away. Even if you're not, stay away. The book was amazingly dark, even for Steve King. An 11 year old kills in a novel. A high school director is found with child pornography in the novel. This is nowhere near as good as a novel. <br /> <br /> This movie is my favorite movie of all time. I hate the revenge movie.
