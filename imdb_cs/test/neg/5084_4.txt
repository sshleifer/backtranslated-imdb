It could be exciting for the audience in 1946, but the movie is now a bit boring. I was hardly sitting in the whole thing and it was very predictable: I think we know from the beginning of the film that Welles is a Nazi war criminal, and I'll tell you if he's caught and properly punished at the end. <br /> <br /> It's not worth watching. Sadly, Welles made only three films in his long career: Kane, Ambersons, and A Touch of Evil.
