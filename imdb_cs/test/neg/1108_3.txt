As someone has said that living dead dolls were cute and if they came out as a new series of bad things, I would buy one or two. Basically this movie was dark, not in a creepy sense, but I can't see it a bit. And it was boring. Three women in the house, the youngest, said not to go to the forest under any circumstances (well, they didn't sink) and it would be better if this council included their death. And no one will do any cleaning or bleaching, or something like that, you think it would result in a lot of coughing. A sexy young mother, where you are wasting your time trying to find out her age (34 or 36 in my calculations). And it looked like it was more than 20 years since someone lived there, so what was with a young adult father photos on a much older album? I'm so tired of the cliché that it's just lazy writing, and here they come in strong and fast. Teens get stoned and drunk in the car and you know well where it leads .... death and seeming deafness too, as Tim seems to forget about his friends screaming. I mean, I pushed many cars where the driver wasn't yelling and I heard them. A strange weird man in a forest nobody believes. A plumber who has been living in them for years and that is his first experience with these kids, so riding on him avoids pickaxes who control the young man at night ... run him over you idiot! Cliché ... roaming in the woods without knowing where you are going, armed with the knowledge that picking up children with an ax (yes it is again) is out. The Gratuitous Scene Brutalizing the Pig ... Why Don't So Many Directors See Any Problem with Animal Mutilation and Slaughter? I'd rather see the guys start running and bite people on their thighs than this. Zombies don't seem to have so much energy in other movies. His big part was in the shop. What was no busy man. Why didn't he kill him before the family got there and avoided doing the movie or doing it differently. I put my stamps into the house, into the woods, and into the little gothic dollies.
