Four things have caught my eye on this film - first, it's the star of Carly Pope ("popular" fame) that is always a pleasure to watch. Secdonly, it represents the great New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Third, it is filmed in collaboration with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend recommended it to me. But I was completely disappointed. The whole story is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. The Pope's actions are fine, but Owen is unfortunately underused. The other actors and actresses are fine, but I don't know them. In addition to the nice puzzles that are scattered throughout the movie (and Pope and Owen), this movie is not very good. So the moral story is ... don't look at it unless you really want to.
