I saw this used DVD cheap and got a laugh for it. I recently also found "The Octagon" on DVD and bought it to remember when I saw him in the theater as a preschooler and loved him at the time. The problem with "returning" to these American karate films is that since then I've seen so many Hong Kong and Thai action movies in which the battle scenes are long, fast, and jawbone. I am thinking especially about fighting like Jackie and Benny "The Jet" at the end of "Dragons Forever", or fighting Tony Jaa with the "The Protector" circular staircase. Hollywood kung fu offers just aren't "filmed correctly", and even someone from certified skills like Chuck sometimes looks embarrassed. And what's worse than fighting in slow motion? Then you know that it looked miserable at normal speed, so it slowed down. It really emphasizes how ridiculous a rival looks as he stands and just wait to kick his chest. Poor Chuck, he just has no intensity in this movie, nor a project any just threats. Compare it to his former co-founder Bruce Lee, who had a spell and attitude to burning. When Bruce stood up against an opponent (s), you almost saw the air around him crackling with what was supposed to happen. In "Breaker, Breaker" Chuck seemed to accidentally kick people, with total negligence. When the judge sees him in jail and condemns him to death, Chuck looks at him with a sad look and thought "OK ... he makes" the third eye ", he focuses on the thing and throws the judge out of his throat and gets to out of it, "but he will do nothing but look with his eyes fixed. Terrible. And while the DVD case gives you hope, running time is 1 hour, 5 minutes, it's actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so there is still 20 minutes of attention. <br /> <br /> For a great combat action, go watch Jackie Chan in the first "Police Story" .... fight in the shopping center at the end is pure gold ......
