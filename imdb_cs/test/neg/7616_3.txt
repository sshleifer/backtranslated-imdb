It's too slow pace and complicated for kids, and too light and boring for adults. None of our family (6 weeks to 66 years) could bother watching the whole way. Are there jokes? I couldn't say it. Surely there was an unnecessary adult cue. Probably there was a bludgeoning report, but I wasn't involved enough to take care of it. Living talent just stumbles and intertwines with it. I have to wonder if they were actually paid, or whether it was some form of community service or a plea negotiation. <br /> <br /> "Please watch," Kitsch Daniel; honestly, I wouldn't bother.
