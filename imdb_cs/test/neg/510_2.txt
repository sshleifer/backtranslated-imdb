It is worrying to see so many people who give an incredibly high rating to this movie. Some praise uses such twisted considerations (and transparent agendas that betray a simple love for something that is in any case critical of the US) that it is approaching hysteria. The Heaven's Gate is a bad movie, it's terribly terrible. Endless scenes using sophisticated shots that serve no purpose, muddy dialogue, dark narrative, no sense of any subject aside from excess ... <br /> <br /> The high rating of this disaster is the result of revisionist history and temporary shifts. in perception. From a point of view, watch Lawrence of Arabia before looking at the Heaven's Gate. You will see how this film is truly aimless and lost. "Problems" that may be trying to deal are lost in the miasm. I don't have a problem with movies that are critical of the US itself, but when a horrible movie gets such undeserved praise purely because this element ... it's worth a try. The film is worth seeing for two reasons; Curiosity, and as a warning story for young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw it free at home, imagining torture of being in the theater and sitting in it ... for 4 meandering hours!
