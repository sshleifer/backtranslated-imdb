I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and I liked a lot. I don't know what happened to the movie version because it was horrible. Maybe some dialogue that works on the stage sounds incoherent on the screen. By the way, I couldn't wait to see this movie end. Acting is universally over the top. Only Kevin Spacey has it together and looks like he knows he's in the wrong movie and can't wait to get out.
