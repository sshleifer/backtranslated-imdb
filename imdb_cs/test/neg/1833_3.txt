Okay, I had quite high expectations. The controversial theme was a good concept. As a horror fan, I admit that I was fascinated by it and very excited. It turns out they had a great idea, but it was terribly executed. See you. This movie seems to run in 3 modes: Happy, Sex and Dark. The problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be. The parts of "Happy" that I believed were supposed to be in contrast to "dark" parts, but that doesn't work. The soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> The film goes badly between the three modes, I can't even start to say how much directing and editing to suck. There's sex in the most unpleasant and non-erotic way. I'm not complaining, but even for Horror standards they were unnecessary and filler. The characters are all unlikely except Paul (Potente). Her friend from Munich is a bitch and maybe one of the most annoying characters in the movies I've recently met. <br /> <br /> There's a little conspiracy I can't go into detail ... It's not stupid and in a more talented hand would be a good movie. There's even a nice procedure and conspiracy. Don't try to understand everything because there are huge holes in the holes. And to think it could be great. I can say ONE good thing about what the movie is to shed some light on today's unethical medical practices. With advances in genetics and controversial sciences, it could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these issues. But you won't find it here, just a series of scenes freely embedded with people and things you don't care about. Skip it and go check out the Flatliners site, you are welcome. <br /> <br /> 3/10
