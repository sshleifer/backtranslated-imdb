I saw it with my children who love it, but I don't understand that it would be a reindeer in the song, but what the hell in this crappy film that hit the sled is what the heck is, why, when my kids heard the sinking, they thought you think it's good, but we watched that they were like "daddy, why grandmother" is how my kids call grandmother how my kids said "daddy why grandmother hit sleigh" I told them the movie he was miserable, they agreed, it is sad why there would be one name of the dog "Doofas" that is just stupid and when everyone dressed in black who looked, so I think Daphne looked like dang emo goth girl every one looked like Goths & in the song found grandmother on the ground I think she died in the song, but in this strange crappy movie she was gone I think they should take this show OK everyone would like this I give it 1 of 10
