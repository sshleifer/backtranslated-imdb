How better to describe it as scuzzy criminals on television? And I don't mean the COPS show; here, they are actually being presented as protagonists. I don't see any corrective value in this show unless you have a perverted passion for human tragedies. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of a fallen star; a star that Bobby Brown helped pull out of the sky. Bobby Brown is nothing but a low-life criminal. Why are you following him? Why is Whitney behind him no matter how despicable? This couple should be locked up and it's a shameful shame that they make money and reach the glory of glory when they watch the septic that is their life and human waste that is their character.
