I went to see it because of snipes / statham, but frankly, Chaos is terrible. This movie has absolutely nothing for it - it should not be done. <br /> <br /> Do not read this review if you do not want to read spoilers because I will deal a lot of fence-holes here. <br /> <br /> First of all - the opening scene. It's a great big event that caused two half-figures (Statham and Snipes) to turn around. But it's boring and ordinary. Only at the very end will we see what really happened and at a time when you no longer care. Also - this whole event, where one evil man and his hostages are killed, is hardly enough news that would be enough for hundreds of newspaper articles as stated in the film. Get out of the ground for a while. A bank robber makes some unnecessary references to chaos theory (which, by the way, has nothing to do with the whole story). The way Statham is called is very "Die Hard With Vengeance", but boring. Then the things that happen in the bank are strange and unnecessary. What's with the safety deposit box. There seems to be some conspiracy, but then no. - Why go through the problem of threading two people when it leads to nothing? It's a lot of preparation and nothing is used! - Why does SWAT leader not listen to the appropriate officer when they tell them to stand up? And that's just the first 10 minutes. He's getting worse and worse. The whole romantic story / love story (with the fact that he wasn't just a better cop, it was a better man to finish him) is painful to watch. It is simply unnecessary - why would Statham's character point to a change of camera position in bank images. This basically leads to finding a "virus" that will bring him all the money. -Why go through the problems with forging some guys' signatures and kill him, but then he WILL NOT kill that guy who can identify you. ... useless. The whole scenario is a mess. "Intelligent" references to chaos theory are really ridiculous and quite pathetic. The twists can be seen from a mile away and the main characters still seem to be mistakes. It's really painful to watch a movie like this, where the viewer is taken for granted as a stupid popcorn crispy people from which the director hopes not to see all the plot holes and over-all ridiculous scenario. The "explanatory scene" only adds insult at the end. It's a really good movie. In each case. <br /> <br /> People who come to the action movie won't get what they came for. People who come to film with a friend won't get it. People who come to see a clever thriller don't understand. Basically everyone gets the same thing - a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip this.
