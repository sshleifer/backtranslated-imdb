This film has some good performances, as others pointed out, but suffer (as others have pointed out, except for people who are apparently either friends of a filmmaker or cast otherwise explaining why they would consider it "10") of some self-conscious and self- absorbed film school padding and surplus charts. This is a type of conspiracy that could handle Sex In The City for a half-hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be an 88 minute film. A perfect example of unnecessary shots is quick assembly in the first third of the film. Some back story is meritorious, but too much time, for example, was spent on Daria's character with an anal sex friend and on the back story for Paulie, who was not realistic in character, although the actor did a decent job with was set. The worst aspect of the film was the level of amateur parts: from misspellings in written material, to bad jumps and adjustments, bad camera positions, angles, lighting problems around the world, and a very scripted script with a badly developed concept. If a writer (and director and lead) collaborated with someone, he didn't have to end up with a 100% rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes, further enhancing anyone's ability to truly trust people who gave him 10 points. evaluation system.
