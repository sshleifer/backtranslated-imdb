I'm a dance teacher and I was looking forward to some good dance routines in this movie. How sad she was exposed to such a painful experience. I had big problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alexa extremely repulsive. The beal 's face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this is very incompatible with Alex' s very disturbing obscenity, especially at the disgusting restaurant. He also has toddler excitement bouts. It is very hard to believe that Nick would return to such a moody teenager after frequent screams and fury, especially after opening a moving car door and hitting it with a needle, deciding to go home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe !!! . And what about her idiotic behavior after a night in ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - a 30 year old man went after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. As for dance, I'm afraid this 80's style is completely old. What was the dance sequence in the world? Who was to dance? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in the move! And even the famous final sequence is quite disappointing, especially with regard to the ballet company audition. The camera shots of her jump will actually destroy her effect because you don't see what she is doing. And what did she do on Earth when she went past every panel that pointed at them? And as many other comments pointed out that she would never get into a ballet company on the basis of this bankruptcy - maybe therefore at the end they wouldn't say whether she was successful or not, the closure is that she eventually overcame her fear. In fact, I thought 'Flashdancers' was Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You saw he's a real dancer, and her acrobatics are very impressive. This is, of course, if you can get through her scary costume and makeup. There were two good pieces in this movie - ballet dancers stretch when Alex first auditions - they look so beautiful and elegant and at least helps to emphasize the difference between her current dance career and the one aspires. The second good scene was a street break. I also liked the parents of the skaters, they were funny. Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex recognize her? What was an 18-year-old living in a converted warehouse alone? How dare the beautiful barre and all the furniture? Was this scene really necessary in the "naked" club? A person who wrote in her comment that it was like a Disney movie needs to explore her head. Anyway, what happened to the skater? Many people have said the film is bad, but they liked the message - don't give up hope, try to continue and your dreams will come true. Watch "Little Mermaid" instead.
