Blind man could make this film better ... seriously! The director is clearly a newcomer. He must be a Dennis Hopper cockpit dealer or something that convinces him to be in this movie. I felt so embarrassed for Dennis. John, the director ... PLEASE leaves the director. Your post is not needed or desired. Film medium is stronger without you. You're terrible at directing. Stick to food bagging or something. <br /> <br /> This movie should bypass "directly on video" and get off "striaght on the trash." I'm a stupid man for seeing this movie. DO NOT SHOW THIS FILM IF YOU COME AND RESPECT TO FILM!
