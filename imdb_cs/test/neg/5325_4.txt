Unfortunately, Koontz seems to have died without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. Whispering follows the original book very closely, seemingly until the production companies run out of money. All the files in the first half of the film were carefully crafted from the book - something missing in many other Koontz movies. Despite its many more falls, I continued to follow the expectations of some really great scenery. Poorly. At a time when detectives appear in a crack head apartment (in the book), the film is from the funds and one of the most exciting scenes from the book is destroyed. Where the book offered a horrible discovery, search and persecution through the boys 'apartment, the movie offers the back seat of the boys' car. Let's face it - Koontz writes without a budget because the imagination is free, relax. If a Koontz novel came into a decent movie, no one will see it because they have been released so many, many times before. That's why Frankenstein is Dean Koontz just Frankenstien - if you saw that your job was many times lost, you should get early if it looked like it was happening again!
