Although it can be very boring at times, this movie is really not that bad. Acting is quite well done if it is stereotyped, and production values ​​are very high in relation to some sci-fi films that were to come later in the decade. My biggest problem with this movie is some very outdated characterization. There's a guy from Texas, a "professional" scientist, and the worst of all the scientists who finally realize her womanhood. For a film that tries to make a statement about humanity, it loses some of its influence by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.
