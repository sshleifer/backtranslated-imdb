With NBC "Thank God You Are Here", the network may be trying to copy the achievements of ABC improv sitcom, "Who's the Line Is It Really?" in which the host Drew Carey would judge a handful of regular casts asked to improvise scenes of some sort. In the NBC show, Dave Foley and co-host Dave Alan Grier oversee a handful of notable comics who must improvise their way through the different scenes that all start with "thank God you're here." viewers are repeatedly warned that actors have never seen sets before), both co-founders seem less enthusiastic. After watching the unsuccessful unsuccessful attempts of the actors for some laughter, I wondered if the live audience really laughed at what was going on or whether they were improvising. Expect this winning time to be very short.
