Here is a movie that was 90% of pedestrians on the fact that at the end he had no right to become so challenging and frustrating. Has the director decided to suddenly become an author, 80% through the making of this film? Yeesh. SPOILER ALERT The thing typically begins to be enough for a young fifty; there are tramps, good girls, bad girls, gangs, kindly old canteen manager, and the city is crawling. Things follow the expected journey up to about 15 minutes before the end, when the only likable character is killed and the anti-hero is blamed (that would not be so unexpected if it were the main storyline of the movie ... but all the things are going to happen and melt during the last Then the strange, kindly old coder forms a crowd and beats a hero on a bloody flesh, the mere presence of a hero's friend somehow pulls out a confession of a real killer - an ugly, haunted walnut (which in any real universe that should be the main suspect) even if an anti-hero was found) with her body). We stayed with a somewhat weak "happy" end, which is about the same as the character of the movie with the rest of the movie as an event 10 minutes ahead of it. Br /> <br /> Even more strangely, this film insists on playing a homosexual allusion to the handle, but constantly presenting both male leadership as equal. Maybe it was intentional - perhaps Bix's resistance to settling with a girl was more about his sexuality (which in the 1950s would have to be kept in a totally suppressed form and therefore would not have to talk to her or confess it) his need to be a "rogue". If the director's intention was to shoot like a sexual yarn - the drifter drifts because he feels he's sexually driven; that his fatherly relationship with Danny is not really paternal but married; that his inability to stay with Carrie is rooted in sexual anger that even he does not understand - it could have been clearer. Instead, we get this very bizarre alchemy of homoerotics and behavior that is completely heterosexual. These young men sleep side by side, even though they may be allowed to spread. When Danny is designed (and even in bed with a woman), Bix jumps up and takes him away. Danny pays Bix's trip (there's another explanation for that, but every time you see Danny buys Bix's lunch), it's still. Finally, they live together. Not since Hitchcock's "Rope" has homosexuality so blatant, but denied. <br /> <br /> MST3K did the right thing by taking it. Apart from Jack Elam, there is little to appreciate the film.
