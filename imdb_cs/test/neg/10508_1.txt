Don't avoid this movie. Simply because it's so bad that it's totally cheerful. Maybe it's the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was so bad that my friends and I could laugh at every moment of this movie. Sometimes we have actually debated whether it was wrong intentionally, but we are sure it is not. The characters appear out of nowhere, as if they were already created, the scenery is changing into the scene all the time in the middle of the scene, and Vampire Assassin ends up with about 6 climate battles with enemies before finally reaching the vampire's head. You will also be able to enjoy one and the only face of Vampire Assassin because he will never change his expression despite his obvious attempts. So if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, then I suggest this one if you go out with an open mind. Don't expect a good movie, expect the worst ... and it'll get worse. I really want to buy this movie and place it on my comedy movie selection. Right next to Anchorman.
