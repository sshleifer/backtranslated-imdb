Well, now this movie is a piece of work. It is full of stupid jesus refrences and dialougue that would make most human biengs question whether they should ever watch movies at all. Big names like Roddy Piper and David Carradine are pulling you, but take it from me, this movie is upset. The story is incomprehensible and missing in intelligence. Sets, veihicles and costumes come as a cross between the five and the slavery. I'm sure it's porn with better dialougue.
