I only saw it because I was bored. He and his friend hated him, but of course they liked movies. This is the first time I have strongly opposed Ebert in recent years. There is no single thing to recommend this movie. Willis is good as always. But the story stinks, is incredible, there is no real story, no action, no interesting movie sequences, no surprises, and the worst of all is that the baby star is a thoroughly repulsive slug that will surely turn off any parent who doesn't have a dweeby fat pet for child. Stay away and save your baby - if you don't want to punish him. There is no excuse for such miserable management or writing and one hope that these filmmakers will suffer accordingly.
