First, separate the story from the film. The story of the second ongoing war in heaven is good, very good. Religious thematic films are not the main choice for many people, but angels in war. I really loved the story, and some of the images provided it to back up like an array of angels on tiptoe .... amazing images. The real movie, even if it was poor, I can't find the reason for the main character - the priest-cum-cop is there at all. The leading bitch also ... no reason she should be there, the main characters dialogues were simply empty, they had no essence, the story could be well told without them. Now, some sterling showing made a feature, Walken, Stoltz and Mortensen withdrew some wingers, though their scenes were mostly with lifeless leaders. Native American rituals purify the dark soul. The child who carries it is apparently of original American origin, but there is nothing besides the end of the script to end up with this heritage. The conspiracy about the dark soul itself barely told, strange, that the dark soul is the driving force behind the entire premise of the film. The back story of his original owner (colonel) is briefly touched, but not enough to allow him to understand why his soul is strange. I can't find a justification for the scenic shots in this movie one, several plains around 'chimney rock'. I feel like they have a helicopter and want to make the most of it because none of the shots have any meaning or mood -> Horror. The film is more than a horror movie in science fiction. There was no real shock or scary scene, some mild gore and blood, but no fear element. So, besides 3 roles played damn well this movie is a big ole 'bagpipe. Unfortunately, the factor of bagpipes exceeds the good factor, just too many weekend actors.
