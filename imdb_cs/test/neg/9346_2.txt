Oh man, this movie was bad. Bad look, horrible story ... a list of good things is shorter than a list of bad things about this movie. Yes, it's definitely a comedy and everything that tells me this movie was supposed to be a real deal. The film certainly does not start as a comedy, but rather as an adventure film with fun elements. Especially you can say that it was serious about acting, it was a serious and uncomplicated way, with the exception of a few over-the-top sequences. It seemed to me that they were initially trying to make a real and serious science fiction adventure movie, maybe even permission, but soon they noticed how bad it was and simply decided to insert more and deliberately exaggerated comic sequence. to make the film look more like a comedy and prevent it from becoming a complete catastrophic mess. The film is a strange attempt to mix pirate adventure films with serious science fiction. Of course, the film was inspired by the "Star Wars" films and its success. The film is not too embarrassed to copy entire sequences and even the way the story progresses, files, characters and robots show similarities. They tried to hide it by putting some apparently spoofing sequences, but I wouldn't fall for it. And so despite its original concept, the film is not original. You can say that this movie is "Spaceballs" a poor man without being really completely spoof. The movie is bad looking, with some special effects for video games (in some sequences, literally), horrible looking costumes (post and swords in space?). The sound is sometimes even ridiculous. It looks like they were shooting some sequences without sound, and then they forgot to add all the required sounds later in the postproduction. mixing is also really bad. They tried to hide it by occasionally putting the sound to a minimum and tuning Bruce Broughton's musical score. Sometimes the film is so busy that the film tries to look funny, it's totally forgotten to tell a story. It makes the film's story look extremely messy and poorly written, with an almost completely underdeveloped main plot. It also does not help to make the film really flow. Many things aren't explained and some are even dropped after a while. The film begins as a "pirate" movie that constantly seeks and steals water because it hardly exists and there is only one water planet left on it (yeah!). However, this plot line soon gets abandoned, especially in the middle of the film, in which the film seems to become completely different, with different motivations. It's just like the strange and bad, stupid sequence after another, without actually making a click. It also keeps the characters too shallow and uninteresting to take care of them. Sadly, actors like John Carradine, Anjelica Huston and still young and unknown Ron Perlman have been connected to this disastrous film. /> <br /> OK I admit that I liked some moments, especially the end, when they go through the time warp, was original and fun, but really, all that wasn't enough to save the movie. I didn't like the movie at the camp. <br /> <br /> 2/10
