I am a regular reader of Kathy Reichs' novels Temperance Brennan. As such, I am extremely surprised that she even consulted on this exhibition. <br /> <br /> HORRIBLE compared to books. The character of temperance Brennan is in the books down on the ground where the alcoholic and the divorced mother of the daughter in the college age are recovering. In 'Bones' he is arrogant (rhyming with the rich) who, in typical P C fashion, is not a mother. The emphasis on its assistants, complemented by sheer detail about who has how many sexual exploits, is totally at odds with the books. <br /> <br /> In full respect of the PC movement, he portrays US enemies as peace lovers (!). Some of this information is not correct, for example, with a character from Afghanistan as an active member of the Arab-American Friendship Group. Since when is the Afghan Arab?! I'm sure the negative references concerned "disadvantaged minorities" or women, or GLBT, so the show's producers / writers / directors would have to apologize. However, in a typical far left fashion, all racial curses go to the highest reaching minority group - Asians, as David Boreanaz 'Agent Booth constantly refers to Angelo Montenegro as' squint'. Forget it and forget about this show. After "The Man in the SUV" episode, I thought I'd try the second episode to see if it was better. It's just worse! Nor do I care if the teenager who was involved was murdered or committed suicide, and I will never watch the show again.
