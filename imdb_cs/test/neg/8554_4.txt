It's not the best of WIP, but not the worst. I sincerely feel guilty of laughing with this film because it must have been for everyone involved. But acting, dialogue, nonsensical scripts, and the ever-present boom mic will always come to me and certainly add to his bad movie spell. Like many Linda Blair fans, I am (or topless) honored to go to Sybil Danning. Also, a strange kudos to Henry Silva, who is only in cast who does not play his role too seriously. But the film, now, makes me look at Stella Stevens's character closer. She plays a manager, and I wonder if Hilary Clinton decided to accept her present appearance and performance. After all, I'm sure she should look no further than a video of her husband to find this movie. Not that I judge. I've seen it myself several times, and all of this makes me wonder what would happen if Mr. Clinton could install a hot tub in the Oval Office. Hmmm.
