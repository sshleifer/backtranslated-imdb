After three hours in Cinema, the strongest impression was that something was wrong. It was clear that the directors had forgotten to direct, act actors, and most importantly, the writer who wrote. Whoever shouted unreasonably and did one saying. The screenplay continued on and on with lots of evasive twists that only end now, too well-known Priyadarshan's theory of converging actors in one place. This theory worked well in Hera-Pheri and Hungama, but somehow she managed to irritate this time, so the habit of each actor's inability to respond directly to them. The simplest questions like "what is your name will be repeated N times". Finally, what was wrong was that the director forgot that his audience had something called intelligence.
