I was looking forward to seeing Bruce Willis in this, especially since I remembered being young when I was young when I was fascinated by the original. This film is a perfect example of how film companies can take a very good story and Dumb it down as long as it's just another formula ridden hype of the legendary American law enforcement system / (VS). Not sorry Cold War is over to make it with the Russians) VS TERORISTS, similar to about 50 other movies. Besides, he treats the audience as a bunch of idiots. The choice of weapon is good, absolutely absurd, we are seriously expected to believe that the world's most feared and experienced man / terrorist would choose what would be appropriate for the assassination? The whole idea of ​​the original story was a tense pair of intellect between an ordinary detective who is given responsibility and a professional who makes a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his goal and then get away. None of this survived. All we have is a tired old American CIA / FBI / army vs. a bad terrorist conspiracy, we've all seen 1000 times before. Of course, the MBA film company realized that here is a new intellectual angle would lose revenue from a short gang, so the answer is ... Bruce Willis, BIG Explosion and Crippled Land. They assume that the American audience will not be able to relate to the threat to a foreign statesman (where France is on the map after the end), so it must be an American! Another example of a filthy meeting room movie.
