"Apartment Complex" is a comedy that is full of kookie characters created instead of a real story that tells a young psyche student (Lowe) who takes a job that manages an apartment complex and becomes involved in the secret of murder ... um, if you can say. These low watches contain no tension, no excitement, no drama, no action, rare funny moments, a nude dash and almost no romance. "Residential Complex" is a passable, unforgettable junk food only for the most needy potatoes on the couch.
