Quentin, in my opinion, wrote and directed just one good movie, and that was the multiple award of Pulp Fiction. Most films, especially recent films, were REAL turkeys. People still evaluate him and I can't really see his things today. There are many other directors and writers who today produce much better fun in all aspects of their films. From now on, I will not believe that the hype that is the Tarantino movie. Inglorious was too long and even worse. Humor was, well, minimal and not so funny. Violence was nothing new (minus the end of the scene). The dialogue was sometimes very much pulled out. For some, they will love this movie; and for others they will hate it. and I thought the Nazi theme was finally put into bed with the amazing German film 2004 Untergang.
