I didn't buy it, I didn't borrow it, it was on PPV and someone burned it and lent it to me, so I didn't waste any money on it. For someone who has done Darkness, Nameless, Devil's Spine, it's a pretty lame movie. She seems to have something to do with many of the girls who were on the Convention Day, and now they're all growing up and being watched and killed one by one by a sister coming out of the kitchen sink, to the toilet, and even negotiating a revolving door in the hotel. And what makes this nun so ugly (and wet?) I don't know, it was so boring that at some point about halfway I stopped her, put it down, and watched something else. He wasn't even interested in finding out, really. Sure, there are some beautiful young ladies watching, but hey, are two of them lesbians? I think there is a picture on the bedside table of a young lady's bedroom that couldn't be completed without a lesbian couple these days? Oh yeah. 2 out of 10 if you want to see a valuable nun horror try "Desecration", "Dead Waters", or "The Convent" (and that's the one with Adrienne Barbeau, by the way, not the one with John Malkovich).
