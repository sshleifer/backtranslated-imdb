I saw it at a local independent station in New York. The cast showed promise, but when I saw director George Cosmotos, I became a suspect. And certainly it was so bad, every bit as senseless and stupid as any George Cosmotos movie I've ever seen. It's like a stupid man Michael Bey - with all the terrible promises he promises. There is no sense of conspiracy, no burning problems that compel the conspirators. We are left to combine dots from one piece of graffiti to different walls in the film to the next. Thus, the current budgetary crisis, the Iraq war, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without health care, stagnant wages and middle class death are covered by total terror graffiti. /> <br /> A truly amazing idiotic movie.
