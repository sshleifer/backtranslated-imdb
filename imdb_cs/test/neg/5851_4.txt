RAT RACE's ads allowed me to look too youthful, but since my friend adored this movie (and the soundtrack), I finally tasted it and watched it tonight. I do it to watch David Lynch's movies and all kinds of dark indie stuff (I recently forced him on URBANIA), so I felt I owed him a harmless Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I didn't want to hurt his feelings so I saved my bitch for y'alls. Yeah, RAT RACE has its moments, but I was very upset. Let's start at the beginning. RAT RACE was sold as a "family movie" so I was a little surprised to find that the first scene was focused on porn movie. (I hear it now: "Mom, what does AFRO WHORES mean?") This scene has no other purpose in this film than to imitate some stupidity in the PG-13 movie. And while we are still on the casino segments, it's quite appropriate that all the characters played in the same timeframe slots that held the gold coins. What would happen if not? Could those millionaire players just sit and wait? And how did the gold coins get into the slot first? But I am plotting a point that is necessary for a film to exist, so I'll print on. About Whoopi and her long-lost daughter: they meet for the first time, but they don't talk about themselves about themselves all their time. Why is their relationship so complicated? Couldn't be, say, a mother and daughter on vacation together? Why is it a business that is long overdue? And why portray a daughter as a serious career a woman strapped to her cell phone, who never needs contact with her business again? Did he forget the script for this subplot and the character trait? This illustrates the main weakness of this film - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; it is exhausting when all are equally passionate and have no distinctive features. And another thing - events are not plausible. Sure, characters can do some weird things, but the characters themselves must be believable. Take for example NAKED GUN (another movie by Jerry Zucker). Frank Drebin has some pretty exaggerated moments, but everything he does is theoretically possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but it's a different kind of joke that makes a difference.) The character in RAT RACE, which goes beyond natural laws by jumping on a train of disproportionate speed, destroys any film probability; these are not really real people, so why should I care for them? Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral problem. Characters get their modes of transport almost completely theft. I know, I know, it's just a silly comedy and I didn't mind the same events fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but there are a lot of laws in the RAT RACE that bother me. And I'm not going to delve into the whole airport-sabotage sequence, rather than wonder if the writers have considered the impact of such action on real life; Was That Scene Fun Before 9/11? I will skip over the disgusting bits of the heart, drug family and Nazis (whose construction and payout worked better in the "Seinfeld" episode), and continue to complain about the talks. Rowan Atkinson started uncomfortably; I don't know when I liked the comic character less. Three Oscar winners need new agents. Whoopi fell out best but didn't have much to do (though he loved copper perm and purple lipstick though); Part of Kathy Bates was pervasive but graciously concise; Cuba, he was ... oh, man. Cuba, girl, please fire your agent! After INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR it's your third hit (be glad I didn't see PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS) - it's time to give your '97 Best Supporting Actor Oscar back to his rightful owner (Edward Norton, for PRIMAL FEAR). Your character's actor has no pilgrimage that runs half naked across the desert and has been cleared by the Lucille Ball impersonator. You can even read the scripts in your movies, or do you reach into the bag and pull your next project randomly? <br /> <br /> There are other little points that bother me (how does Grisham and Hooker get on the booty so fast?), but basically, RAT RACE is a little more than your base lot of character types, which are prevented by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a somewhat erratic and inexplicable end. Do they give money to charity? What's the end? Yeah, it's a "noble" thing. It doesn't matter if the likelihood of cross-promotion / licensing is Smash Mouth (sometimes they say they sell it out?) Putting on a benefit concert in the middle of New Mexico's desert, but who would sincerely do that? Yes, they say it's a journey, not a goal that makes the trip worth it, but there is no road without a goal. If there was an example of a "bad lucky end", it would be. What is the sudden end of the movie, which, despite my nitpicking here, I enjoyed the part (I admit I enjoy a bit of a cow and some things Lucy along with a character with a tongue piercing - at first I thought his incomprehensible speech would be she ran me to the wall, but he became my favorite. <br /> <br /> If my friend knows, RAT RACE has noticed quite funny and charming. <br /> <br />
