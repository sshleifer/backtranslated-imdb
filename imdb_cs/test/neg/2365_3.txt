"TNT Jackson" is not completely unnoticeable. But either the version I saw on the DVD has been modified with weeds or the scenario itself is the lowest level of grind-house / blaxploitation sausage. Or maybe both. Jeanne Bell is supposed to be Playmate in one place in her career, and the film makes the most connections by displaying her breasts at least twice as much as necessary (including a merry fighting scene without being sure it was funny). I admit they are pretty nice. Still, she is somehow average looking and doesn't have Foxy Brown's charisma, even Cleopatra Jones. But she has her moments in the film as an actress, but it would be nice if the director pushed her a little harder, or the scenario gave her a chance to do more than "attitude" and kicking people. Br /> <br /> Speaking of kicking people, fighting scenes (another supposed reason to watch a movie like this) is pretty badly done. general direction of their opponents. One minor exception is a nice moment with a competitor equipped with a butterfly folding knife; another is a proximity to the very end, where the apparent double twin for Bell (and possibly for Stan Shaw) jumps around and makes a decent turn and the basics for a minute or two before Bell / "Jackson" plucks the enemy's liver, Shaw it collapses and the script stops. (I admit that this is in the tradition of Shaw Fraternal Expresses since time immemorial). There are several supportive actors who are actually better than the film they deserve. Think of "Joe" and a colleague playing the true man of the drug master. There is a half decent decent laden soundtrack that adds action to the screen and add a star to the rating itself. There is a semi-dodgy sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself. <br /> <br /> This one is strictly for hardcore blaxploitation fans. I saw it from sheer curiosity, and I'm sorry to have taken the time. But I can't imagine wanting to have time to see it again, unless I decide to write a dissertation at the pop culture intersections of "Kung Fu Theater" and "Foxy Brown".
