Every Blaxploiation fan now knows the ingredients: big Afros, topless babes, surreal bad fashion and some 'jive' talk. In this case, add lead that can't act, a conspiracy that doesn't make sense, edit someone who doesn't have hands that are blindfolded and the richest fighting scenes and you have 'TNT Jackson'. It's not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, it's an amazing mess from start to finish. I loved above all infinite errors of continuity and a double lead. It's such a 70s bad Far East martial art meets the black power it hurts, but the boy hurts so well! I am ashamed to admit that I almost enjoyed it.
