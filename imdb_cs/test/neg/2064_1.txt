I saw it today on French TV and was very disappointed! The film starts pretty well, but nothing is clarified and at the end we are no further than at the beginning. As for the husband's view of murdering his wife, it's not just plausible. You need tangible proof to condemn someone, and minimal proof. There is nothing at all in this case, so it's just not credible. Remember the old adage "innocent until proven guilty". The fact that a woman disappears without a trace is not proof that her husband would kill her. So I really don't know what point this movie was trying to make. The result is totally illogical and incomprehensible, with no convincing evidence to the viewer. So frankly, viewing is a complete waste of time. After all, the film must be fun ... in the case of this, it is absolutely untrue and I suggest that it be irrevocably sent to the dustbin where it belongs!
