A few years ago, Sara, a young girl witnessing her parents being murdered, now as an adult suffers from various mental disorders (have I mentioned that she has an imaginary friend?) but rather a feeling of sleepiness. Sadly boring, I found it hard to sit because I could feel my eyelids growing and heavier with every infinite minute of thoughtless babble and supposed "secret". Is Sara mad? Or is it paranormal? The better question would be: Who cares? And the answer to that, no one. Nobody at all. Skip this movie, save yourself some time better suited to do other more valuable tasks. <br /> <br /> My class: D-
