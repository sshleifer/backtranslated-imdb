Great gangster movie, with great performances by famous actors with big action scenes? Well, not this. It's amazing to see such a wide cast of well-known actors who have a lot of good movies in their filmography in this movie, no doubt it could be one of the worst they could appear. First of all, it is a conspiracy, as you would expect from an average gangster biography, nothing new, nothing fancy. The way it is said that the movie looks much longer than it was (when I thought two hours should be almost over, I was quite surprised that only 45 minutes had passed). <br /> <br /> Action scenes look a lot like those of the 80th TV series - such as the A-Team. It was in the 1980s (especially with the A-Team) that these scenes were more sophisticated than those in "El Padrino". It is especially fun to see how the guys have directed their weapons into the air and still hit something (not talking about people hiding behind the car doors that later look as if they were shot). <br /> <br /> pretty nice at the event. Either you get the same response to everything that happens (Dolph Lundgren style), or it's so exaggerated that you might think it's a parody (but unfortunately it isn't). My advice is to stay away from this movie, every other gangster movie is better than this one.
