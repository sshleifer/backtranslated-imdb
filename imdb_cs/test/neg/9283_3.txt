Anthony Wong plays Untold Story in this and the original (far superior) story, but the similarities stop there. Apparently, Wong is not surprised, and instead plays a beating policeman who joins a somewhat suspicious woman, Fung (Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun), who is a repressed mother. But her tame jealous "wanting to be with a girl who is a girl" is not where it is as convincing as what Wong played at first. The film itself looks tired and numbers. Yeung Fan as an unfaithful girl who is interested in physics love tries to keep a person from total boredom by getting rid of him whenever possible, and Sun has a nice butt but not even one who can't save it. <br /> <br /> Mei Ah DVD Extras: Sub-Titles Talks to Cheung Kam Ching & Paulyn Sun; Anthony Wong's Filmography; very brief outline; Theatrical trailer for film; and trailers for "Chinese Erotic Spirit Story" and "Twenty Something"
