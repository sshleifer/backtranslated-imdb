Honestly, this movie is weak. Very weak. Something can be just a character of capital. It works like a supercharger on the wrong engine ... so if you like red Valkyries - you see it. But you better find Brigitte as Sonja and put her on the desktop. This will save disappointment. Well, Arnold is also doing his deal ... but it's definitely not his best role. Other characters - bad is not the word. Sword fighting? Monsters? Ridiculous. The fence is really a shame. Why was rape necessary? Especially we don't see it. Anyway, the movie is weak. Although there are worse movies ... Without the main characters it would be just ******. And if someone talks about it, maybe ...
