They gave you the settings and then defeated you with the constant chase of cats and mice. The main characters take part in a permanent stand where they threaten each other, every five minutes or less. And I'd like to see the police forces who would have one of their officers ripped out of A. Garcia's bit. It's like some local policeman who walks Charlie Manson out of jail to get a cup of coffee. Take it easy!
