The average best horror movie that deals with stupid, not so horny teenagers who discover a bad video game (GASP) kills those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This film is the permanent mystery of the Mystery Gang in "Scooby Doo". I was waiting for them to pull a mask of one of the villains. I could deal with it for 40 minutes, even as a science fiction movie, but going to the theaters to come to people. The effects were very average, the whole scenario is something that could be said to be his cast. As always a great thing about video game systems is the famous power button. I recommend using this browser. * 1/2
