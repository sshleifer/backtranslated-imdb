From an artistic point of view, the film cannot be confiscated or given any moral decision. The plot is hard to follow if there is one at all. Action is a severe stomach. The dialogue is clich√© and clearly written by someone who doesn't know English. In this film, it was worth watching only cinema, though you still see deficiencies in the picture. As an Asian-American woman, the film angered me because he proved how anxious people could be. Politically speaking, putting women into such shameful roles should be banned. Maintaining the stereotypes of Asian prostitutes is not only bad for Asian women's self-esteem, but also for the whole country. I feel like the main actress who played Maya and the exploitation she had to face in such a role. <br /> <br /> As Americans, avoid this movie. Art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for one another, not to hold back.
