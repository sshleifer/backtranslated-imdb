Critics are special people. Some of them are ordinary people like you and me. Some are not. When the critic says Subconscius Cruelty is beautiful, I wonder where they grew up? What is beautiful when you are filming a field, some clouds or a tree with an old camera, unless you can do it in style and capture the mood of the environment. Certainly Karim Hussain can't. I saw that the kids were doing better shots before Karim was doing in Subconscius Cruelty. But that's not the worst part. The worst is the whole recording, I refuse to call it a movie, it's just a bad excuse for nudity and extreme torture, rape of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, urination, cannibalism, child murder and much more. I love gore / splatter and I love horror. This isn't one of them. This is total crap, and if my comments make just one person skip Subconscius cruelty it was worth it. Always remember that your life does not last forever, do not waste two hours of precious time on Subconscius Cruelty. You were warned.
