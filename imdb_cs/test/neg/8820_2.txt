It's always interesting to watch a horror movie after listening to so much praise from other fans. Experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan appetite within the genre. My expectations of this movie were much higher than my opinion. Children should not play with dead things is a movie with a good intended plot that will go too many times to do it. The whole idea of ​​a band of actors representing a reanimation of dead corpses captivated me. But everything broke into film chaos. Actors who were largely competent and incredibly expressive were offered roles that failed to maintain consistent characterization. Some of these characters are based on the inconsistency of the whole act of tarnishing the cemetery, open criticism, back to ambivalence. It's one thing that characters change during the movie. it is another way to create a too dynamic, circular stance that rotates every 10 minutes. Another inconsistent feature of this movie is the premise. Does the main protagonist intend for the ceremony to become a theatrical joke, or does it actually conspire with dark spiritual forces to resurrect the dead? Even with the above shortcomings, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans because I believe only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and will be able to ignore conspiracy inconsistencies. A scene where the dead rise from the grave is extremely creepy (even to zombie enthusiasts) with an excellent combination of scenery and sound and a large selection of experienced actors who have been chosen to play dead. Current filmmakers should learn from CSPWDT about using the right video and audio techniques in mood development. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're a zombie as a comic like me, you should take the time to find this movie. It's a fun watch.
