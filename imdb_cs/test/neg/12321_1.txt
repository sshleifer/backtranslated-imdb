A slightly temperamental and true humiliating adaptation to the classic children's story not only lacks the magic of his grandfather, but lacks any talent. Mike Myers should not be ashamed of just his terrible performance, which is a clear detachment of what Jim Carrey did, but he should give up together. He is so uncomfortable that you want to beat the crap out of him if you could jump right into the movie. Kits are ugly and cinematography is very bad. I've seen a lot of bad movies this year, but it's not just a cake, but it's undoubtedly one of the worse movies ever made.
