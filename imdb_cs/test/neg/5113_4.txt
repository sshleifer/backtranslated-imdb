Orson's 1974 "F for Fake" documentary investigates fraud and fraud, focusing mainly on two men who have been subjected to fraud. Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly false autobiography of Howard Hughes, but at least it seems to be his innocence. Another main theme of the film is the artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who spent his life painting counterfeits of famous masterpieces, sometimes selling them to museums as the true work of original artists. Between these stories are scattered pieces, where Welles does magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and also discusses the fact that his career began as a scam when he first lied about his biography and then created a radio feeling with the "World War". I really wanted to love this movie and consider it profound because I'm such a devoted Welles, but I couldn't get it.A part of the problem was that it wasn't just nonlinear, but it was completely scattered. While I appreciate the style cuts and quick jumps and approaches, especially when used in an unusual format such as a documentary, it was just too much in "F for Fake." They created a distraction as opposed to style lending. brighter and exhausting, I think editing wouldn't be so unpleasant. o Really interesting subjects, especially Elmyr de Hory, his artistic fake brings the subject of fraud in the art world and can truly determine the authenticity of some works; and if the works are not authentic, what does he say about those who admire the pieces in the museums? This is one document that I would say to at least make a shot, but don't be afraid to turn it off if you don't. It is undoubtedly the most discouraged documentary I've ever seen; it is a cross between documentary, artistic and experimental film, none of which is properly represented or isolated. I have no less opinion on Welles after I saw it, but in my opinion it certainly does not stand out as a glowing specimen in his work. 4/10 - Suddenly
