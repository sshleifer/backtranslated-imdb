If you are not interested in seeing 2 hours in picturesque mountain shots featuring hysterical characters, lots of histrionics and cheap 70s gore (not much of it either), I'd like to avoid this movie. It is long, overhanging and has a somewhat unpleasant amateur feel. Masterpiece? No, the average thriller, shot in moderate fashion, in the beautiful Italian landscape. I'm a huge fan of slow-motion movies in the 1970s, where you can enjoy and have fun. In this case, it didn't work for me. The storyline is trite, interlaced with superficial and stereotypical characters, leaning on a cheerful angry mob and your typical Italian widower dressed in black, sobbing. <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the country of Italy, the film could be worth seeing because the scenery itself is spectacular and rather breathtaking. But this film is nothing unusual, the Italian horror fluctuations are much better. Nothing but yawning fest. 5/10
