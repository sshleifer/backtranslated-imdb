I only saw the first twenty minutes of this film, and I personally think this is the worst movie to be done in recent years. The plot was so bad that it might be possible that a 10 year old boy wrote. Acting was also careless with an almost unknown cast and not only that the action sequences, especially in the first half of the film, were so terrible that it was incredible. I don't know how manufacturers got the Budget for filming this movie, but the production company has to regret it. Anyone who can encounter this movie in the near future, I suggest you avoid this movie joke. .
