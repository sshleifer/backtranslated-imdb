This is the perfect example of the 90s mainstream horror crap. Nothing is scary here and the movie is almost bloodless.Yes, there is some violence, but everything is politically correct, like in a TV movie. This is not a completely bad picture, I can safely say that I found it quite nice. The lack of originality really hurts "Voodoo" .All in all, if you're part of the main audience and pseudo-horror movies like "Scream" are your favorite then you'll love "Voodoo" but if you want something very horrible to avoid this movie.
