I think it wasn't entirely a filmmaker's fault. The film suffered from an unimaginably stupid decision to tell Clayton Moore (who had done a role in the 1950s and was the Lone Ranger we grew up in old people) couldn't wear the mask in public. Now, remember, the poor man didn't do so much money, and it wasn't like he wanted to take something out of this movie, but the whole thing seemed ... unreasonable. Another thing the film suffered (except the leading man whose voice was so terrible that they had to play it) was the fact that Westerners were not so strong in 1981. John Wayne was dead and we were just exposed to decades long major liberal guilt about how the West was built on the genocide of Native Americans. (This and Blazing Saddles sent the entire genre! Campfire Scene. Enough said!) Hollywood avoided Westerns because Science Fiction was COOL then. One scene that underscored was when after the rescue of drunken President Grant (and seriously, I let Grant stay with the bad guys. The country would be better!) Grant asks Ton what his should be Reward: "Honor Your Covenants with My People". Yeah, right, like it happened!
