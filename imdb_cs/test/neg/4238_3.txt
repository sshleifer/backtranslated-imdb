Maybe this movie was special on his day. But five decades later it looks curious, just another film relic of the terrible 1950s. Stereotypes in this fluffy story are teeming with three female gold diggers who have set up a penthouse store in Manhattan in an effort to attract rich husbands. Shallow theme doesn't bother me. However, the assumption of the film is lame. And the design is worse. It's a romantic comedy. The plot of an extremely short-sighted bimbo is about the only clever element of the story. The overall dialogue is flat, as is the fulfillment. The script structure is worrying. The plot still jumps back and forth between the three ladies. It is as if the writer could not fully associate the file roles. The result is a conspiracy that seems jerky. Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for her role. But Lauren Bacall was too old for the role she played. And Betty Grable, with her loud voice and terrible hairstyle, was simply uncomfortable. Color cinematography is common. But there were plenty of shots on the rear projection, which contributed to the old look. The visuals are even worse costumes that smell of kitsch "glamor" 1950; they are just terrible. Viewers must endure a fashion show, a conspiracy that intensifies as the film's director strikes the prettiest rags. And then there's an orchestra. In what is probably the worst film opening in the history of cinema, the first part of the film has an orchestra that plays some overwhelming melody. At first I thought I was watching an introduction to upcoming attractions. But no, it's actually part of the movie. And the orchestra plays on and on and on. He has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the story. What did they think? I liked Marilyn Monroe, with her breathing voice as she danced her way. But the film would be much better if they threw two more roles off the orchestra, reinforced the comedy dialogue, and lightened the gaudy costumes.
