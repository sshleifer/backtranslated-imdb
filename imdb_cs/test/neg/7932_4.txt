This film is now exploring the infamous Wannsee conference, where the Nazis gathered to discuss the organization and implementation of the "final solution". First of all, I am amazed to see Kenneth Branagh playing the Nazis. He was sure to look at that part with his shiny blond hair, but he didn't really act well. There was no threat and cruelty, and eventually he came out to look like an angry cheerleader holding the meeting. The real Heydrich wouldn't let the conference get out of control as it did in the movie. The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth, who played Dr. William Stuckart, the man who wrote the 1935 Nuremberg Racial Law and who gave "legal respect" to all Nazis. Firth's performance was overwhelming, a major voice opponent of what Heydrich had proposed. Best of all, he put his word on one of the Nazi criminals. The thief murmured "I remember you" and Firth replies "You should be! I'm very well known!" The film is historically accurate, but let's boil it for what it really is - 90 minutes from a group of men around the table who discuss, scream and boast. There is no excitement, no real conflicts (except for a brief argument). It's just 90 minutes of talk! Same room, same desk, same people. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the DVD is worth the money. For one I felt short.
