This film is supposed to be a study of the character of perversion. Some reviewers have been implicated in the assumption that since perversion is portrayed, the film is psychologically profound; Since it is a strange material, it is surprisingly tedious and shallow, with no motivational substance. Why is the main character the way he is? You won't find out from the script. For better processing of the same theme (and more fun movie), try Bunue's Belle de Jour.
