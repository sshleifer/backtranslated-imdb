I live in Rome, where the Turkish director of this film lives and works. I heard a lot of good things about his films from my Italian friends ... so after seeing the preview I really wanted to see "Cuore Sacro". I am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, highly improbable and naive films. I love the movie, but this is really hard and bad. The main character is really crazy and should be locked in a madhouse ... to be sympathetic to the negative character of an aunt who runs a dirty business that wants to make money ... and consider myself anti-capitalist. .. that bad !!!
