Nothing could be more attractive than the idea of ​​a good love story with Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. Great, refined English beauty and warm-blooded American - what could be more beautiful? Well, this isn't the movie. It will destroy it by throwing Kristin Scott Thomas as an American Congresswoman. This is like casting Hugh Grant as Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is exactly the kind of woman you don't draw with shaking hands with greasy ex-junkies in dirty slums, or squeezing into stinking crowds and kissing babies. It should be much better occupied as the widow of an English-born aristocratic senator who belongs to a hunting club and goes to flower shows, but has no idea how the other half lives. Harrison Ford as a regular cop. I'm sure he's pretty tough for this role. But the idea that this amazing beauty of society will behave in a romantic way is a little hard to swallow. Why couldn't he be a hard but rich reformist with roots with blue collars who inherited the Christian residence of later husband Kristina? Both of them are quite cold at first, but Kristin is cordial to him, and in return he starts to show her some of his life rawer - the things her husband has protected her. Her political awakening coincides with the fierce enthusiasm of a newer, blue collar, a lover - one who appreciates her cushion and sophistication much more than her aristocratic husband. This is a love story! Instead, you get an empty, meaningless "thriller" where action goes and nothing happens. Well, there is one ghetto style "disk" scene where Harrison almost gets killed, but it's so sudden and unexplained that it's more like a welcome comic relief. The sky is always gray in this movie and our refined, beautiful Kristin always looks a bit chilled. When dreaming of passion, she looks more like a dream about a woolen blanket and a cup of tea! Most of the time, she also looks a little sleepy, as if she were sleeping in bed rather than screwing Harrison Ford. <br /> <br /> I think all things, I guess you can't blame her.
