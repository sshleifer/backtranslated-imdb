It's a pity that so many people "love" Family Guy because it is easily one of the worst shows on TV, there are many points you can turn to. Flashbacks: Now, in season 1 and 2, which in my opinion was exceptional, flashbacks were quite common and actually somewhat tied to what the conspiracy was about, and it was even funny. Now season 4 and beyond, flashbacks are even more prevalent, and has nothing to do with conspiracy, not funny, and really long, boring and insignificant. Family Guy thinks that a long scene that goes nowhere is fun when it's really bad writing. Stewie: Wow, a child who sounds British. How can it be funny? It is not. His character is so unstable that it's incredible. Remember in the early season when Stewie was about world domination and killing Lois. Now she has a scene that is awkwardly gay with Brian. From wanting world domination to homosexual = bad writing. References: How do they keep bad links to 80 TV shows or events? Well they just reuse the same old garbage. You know, in 20 years, hopefully Family Guy will be canceled by then, if they're still making jokes about 80's shows, it will be even more irrelevant than before. Because they will be forgotten. I still wonder why they can't just write good episodes with quality jokes. Voice Playing: My God, the voices on this show are so bad. Seth McFarlene should only focus on his miserable episode and stop making voices. All the extras in the already bad Family Guy episodes sound the same. Simpsons get 6 or 7 people who will do ALL votes. Some of them say 15-20 characters ... they sound very different. But why can't Family Guy do that? Yeah, it's a lousy show. Stuttering: Usually it is Peter, Stewie, Brian and some add-ons, whenever they are talking or offended, they have to stammer from the sentence just to try to get a cheap laugh. I can't believe Family Guy can't even speak normally to get people to laugh at their "jokes." Offensiveness: OK, short and simple, Family Guy is trying to break the barrier and be the blades, but they always fit. Look at South Park ... <br /> <br /> Terrible Land: Land and storylines are just utter waste. The Simpsons Started Their 20th Years Are Still Better Land Than Family Guy. Approximately 8 or 9 minutes is flashbacks and drag scenes that have no meaning. Popularity Lots of little kids have Stewie shirts and think they're so funny when they don't really have terribly written sex jokes. They just say, "Oh, ha ha, stewie!" if they don't even get it. Family Guy canceled twice and brought back the sale of the DVD as sad. I first canceled it when I think after the second or third season, and I sincerely believe it should have been. these episodes were then excellent, they should stay on high note. <br /> <br /> Drag and drop scenes There are scenes that go too long. One that only aired this last Sunday, Peter went to a executive bathroom, in which about 2 minutes was spent imitating the intro to the Jurassic Park, and that episode plot is stolen from the episode Seinfeld as well. Also, the scene where Chris works in the store and talks to the employee about a 5 minute film that also includes stuttering. CHICKEN HOURS ARE STUPID, 3 of them, each longer than the last. unnecessary, unfair writing, thinking that people enjoy long scenes of repeated combat, between SMOKE, yeah chicken. Now, every time someone falls down, and by the way, FAMILY GUY FAN DENY HAS NOT THAT every time they fall, under a fraction of a second and ALWAYS they land their arms over their backs to look funny. guessing his was used at least 30 times. Herman Oh jeez, everyone thinks an old pedophile is so funny when it's a really bad run gag. they even went in length to give him the singing of the scenes (which are very poor) and set up episodes on it, they did the same with other characters like the doctor who knew he had an episode around him. Simpsons Well, there's not much explanation here. There is so much evidence of Family Guy stealing Simpson's jokes. How is a family guy is just a poor man Simpsons. So I'm sure I forgot some key points somewhere, but I'm sure it's enough to prove that a family boy is a really horrible TV show that seems to be they all love when they really go to watch Simpson, Seinfeld and Frasier.
