Roeg's takeover of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Although the film is based on one of the most studied and interesting texts, it has become a bit boring. The story simply never grasps the viewer. It just seems indifferent. The tracks of the text are easy to see, but it's still not Conrad's "Heart of Darkness." Benedict Fitzgerald's (who also wrote "The Passion of the Christ") script only uses Conrad as inspiration, and thus becomes Fitzgerald's "Heart of Darkness". The film is not worth it if you are not interested in Conrad or perhaps John Malkovich.
