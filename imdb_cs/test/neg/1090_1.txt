Terrible in a bad / good way ... this movie has officially become the worst "made for TV movie" in my book ... in addition to the camp's value, I give it 1 in quality and 10 for camp value. Suggestion: Watch with friends, champagne and lots of popcorn ... you'll want to throw some on the screen! Top friends who love Chris Noth from his 'Sex in the City Days' ... this movie is terribly funny. This is definitely the lowest point in the career of all members occupied ... honestly, I don't know how they controlled the laughter, how the lines were delivered! Daniel J. Travanti is completely pathetic. EVERYONE has joined the school of overreaction; and poor Joan Van Ark, I believe she was the only one who takes this theater absurdly seriously ... but she is considered a producer. Her "mom" jeans and poor plastic surgery are scenic theft scenes. The film also goes beyond the delicate line of social misstatement by introducing a mentally handicapped person into the plot. This is an obscure movie that shows Lifetime listed as {With Harmful Intent}.
