Oddball black-comedy romance featuring great cast and less than stellar script. Brenda Blethyn ("Lovely & Amazing") is the title character 'Betty', a woman imprisoned in a helpless marriage to a man who obviously has an affair with his beautiful blond secretary. Guess who's playing this little part, yup! Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") has to embed this project before her superstar status is insured by the thriller "The Ring". On the male side of the cast list is the pitiful miscast Alfred Alfred Molina ("Frida") an old-fashioned businesswoman who suddenly decides to reveal her desires for "Betty" who has been sleeping for decades. Maybe Miramax hopes that Molina might be interested in this little trinket that belongs to the DVD shelf in the upcoming "Spider-Man 2". But the price for the wildest ungrateful performance goes to Christopher Walken ("Catch Me If You Can"), which goes all the way over as a "modern" venture with his Las Vegas funerals in a small provincial town. His character must fall into the village because in this scenario he has no reason to exist. <br /> <br /> If you'd like to see some of the top actors dealing with some humor then this is for you, and if it's not your cup of tea, try to rent "Harold and Maude," the ultimate funeral film that's still fun today.
