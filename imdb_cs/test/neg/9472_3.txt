Aging Roger Moore is back again as Bond, this time trying to find out why 009 was killed, and why Fabergy's egg counterfeit and where it came from. He will end up in India, New Delhi, then in East Germany after learning about a Russian general trying to detonate a nuclear bomb in a circus, hoping that NATO will seek full disarmament to take control of Western Europe, then the rest of Europe . world. Despite how it sounds, it's really more romance, I think between Bond and Octopussy than the action movie, and long, but still somewhat fun. But there are too many humor attempts in this; at times it seems to be comedy. Timothy Dalton would also be better than Roger Moore, so there wouldn't be much difference between Bond and Octopussy. Useless trivia: a small aircraft used by Bond in preliminary ranking is now suspended in the Quaker Steak and Lube restaurant in Clearwater / Largo Florida, USA. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ****
