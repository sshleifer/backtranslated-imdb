And you should be right. Black Mama, White Mama, also known as 'Women in Chains', is exactly the kind of cheesy and lousy b-movie she expects. Pam Grier has been thrown into prison on a small island with many other women, and this place is being taken seriously by a summer camp where Martha Stewart is locked up as a prison with maximum security. It's not even five minutes into a movie that one of the Hungarian Guardsmen says 'Strip' em and gets 'em wet', and then we're introduced into prison life that resembles the imagination of a college freshman in what the interior of a sorority house is like. Prison with soap and run and fight with each other in the shower as if they were Gone Wild girls, then they all meet together in their dorms, openly smoking and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways how to escape. I have never been in prison myself, but I feel that escape plans are things that few people, prisoners or guards, want to know. The biggest difference between this prison life and some life of fantasy is that women in this movie wear orange vests (and no pants. Go in the picture) that say PRISON on the back. It must be the general prison equipment for prisons that can't afford expensive accessories like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniforms. And, as can be expected, a prison that cannot afford to identify prisoners on the backs of uniforms cannot, of course, expect to be able to find guards interested in prisoner guardians, just as they have sex with prisoners and each other. The film title conflict refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) spends a lot of time bound to a blond prisoner named Karen as they are on the run from cops after jailbreak. I will not go into details about how they escape, except that you could see something like this in the Refugee, that they could not afford to hit the train, and this leads to a confused story of conflicting interests that also chases these two women for various reasons. Karen and Lee both have their own gangs of people hoping to rescue their escaped member, and cops are both of them all the time. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) Karen is dealing with so many people. hippies who want to revolutionize life as they know it. Meanwhile, Karen wants to get out of the island, something she is trying to do for years, and it's not perfect that everyone has to go to the other side of the island to meet their goals. So, we get this pair pairing couple and, since they are a special couple, it's not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the movie, but they grow happy to end each other. In a film with so many conflicting interests, especially when those conflicting interests not only drive two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals, it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climax of calm involving rival gangs at some point in the film. I do not want to satisfy anyone, but at the end of the film they throw away silly gangs, where everyone shoots machine guns on themselves, killing each other, while two women fall safely over the river in a small boat. . Nice. Better yet, at the end of the movie, after a huge massacre in which a lot of people shoot and cut a bright red color all over the place, the police captain searches for the masses of dead criminals to cover terrible, terrible special effects, and we learned that he will be a major before dinner. It's not a bad way to end the movie, all the criminals kill each other and the cops get all the credit, but here's the last line in the movie? "It's better to win, isn't it?" Is this why the captain gets promoted to major? Because he figured it out?
