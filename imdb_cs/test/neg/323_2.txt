Ugh. Pretty terrible. Linnea Quigley gets top billing, but her character doesn't have a big role to play. Who should be her character, a little boy's aunt? Another user commented on her getting naked in the shower. While there was a scene in the movie, it was head and shoulders. Perhaps there are some alternative versions of this film. Quigley has a bigger part than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell, and Brinke Stevens, though. Carradine appears briefly in a monk's robe, where he gives a vague dialogue. There are no other characters in the scene with him, even if it's in the song, or else there are shots over his shoulder. There is also a really bad photograph of his portrait (it looks like a bad photocopy) and a decent picture of his family in the family bible. He originally conjured Jack-O or something like that. Cameron Mitchell briefly appears on television as a host of television horror. Brinke Stevens is in a movie that shows "The Coven" in which he runs around a cemetery in robes. Obviously, there are more Brinke shots as a bonus feature on the Retromedia Double Feature DVD of The Brides Wound Blood. Jack-O: What is it about? Darn, if I know. The little boy is told the story of a pumpkin-headed demon killer, and he and some other kids are afraid the woman thinks he's a witch for some reason. He watches him at home and offers help to his family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand over the hole and feel the eyeballs that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin head killer appears several times to hold branches while looking at people or holding his scythe in front of the camera and posing for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around and actually kill people. There are also some flashbacks to western or prairie families, with a little boy playing a little boy in this family too! : His ancestors, I think. I think they'll get into Jack-O's backstage, but I'm not sure how. The little boy is said to be the main character, but we don't really learn anything about him except wearing glasses, having nightmares, and fighting bullies even if he gets beaten in the process. More time should be devoted to his nature. I couldn't care less if he died. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for Halloween.
