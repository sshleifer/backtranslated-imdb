Like many people, I loved the original; "American Graffiti" was one of the great films of the 1970s. The following, "More American Graffiti" is a terrible, depressing film disorder. It wasn't funny, wide-eyed, likeable characters became cynical and tired and stories were invented (eg "Laurie" character with another brother, because Richard Dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and "Terry toad") "Pharaoh Joe" somehow managed to serve together in Vietnam ). They even have a policeman named "Falfa" (Harrison Ford in the original) who makes a "portrait". Nor does it look like Harrison Ford, who was too big a star to 1979 to bother with the garbage. The operative word is "funny" here. This movie isn't even funny. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper mixed with lots of sleeping hippie drugs and trying to save her dealer from prison; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), lovebirds in the original, have two children and become an unpleasant, bickering couple; Adorable little tomboy Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) became "Rainbow", yet another hippie baby. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a loser racing car driver whose fortune was predicted at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was such an integral part of the original, and gave it such a great flow, is heard only sporadically. Maybe they were other writers, another director and a complete lack of a coherent story that makes this film such an unfortunate failure. The episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere in the sequel. It was a movie that didn't have to be made and its best to just remember what a great movie "American Graffiti" was and avoid the movie with "More" in the title.
