I saw it with high expectations. Come on, it's Akshay Kumar, Govinda and Paresh Rawal, who are amazing in their comedy, I was really hopeful for laughter. Unfortunately, that's not what I got at all ... Unfortunately, nothing in this movie really made me laugh aloud. There were times when I laughed at one or two things, but nothing really smiled at me. In short, it was a poorly tried comedy, and in a way, a little Hera Pheri wannabe. Of the three main guys, I think Paresh Rawal's role was the strongest. It wasn't the biggest role, but it was worth more than Govinda or Akshay. Their performance was fine. Nothing special, just average. Although Govinda stole the spotlight from Akshay in more than a few scenes. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also make appearances in this movie, and both were pretty bad. Lara's role did not move me, nor did she smile, and the character of Tanushree Dutty just got on her nerves! Music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Tere Bin", followed by "Afreen", which I really liked. "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag" are also worth listening to. <br /> <br /> You either like it or you won't. And judging by the bad comedy and lack of direction I don't think you'll be.
