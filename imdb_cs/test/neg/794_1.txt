BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Really disappointed adaptation of the genre legend Richard Matheson, sci-fi cooler "Button, Button", to the crazy filmmaker Wunderkind Richard Kelly, who truly draws a small, well crafted piece into the bag 'WTF'-a-thon! Mysterious (and ridiculously crippled!) The man, Langella, assumes he will offer a million dollars to "struggling" pair Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla blanks to the handle!): A box with a red button that kills some stranger in the world when pressed! ) Certainly the strings are attached, but does it really matter here? What is it, why in the name of God Kelly trowel on so much weirdness (ie, nose bleeding; watery transport systems? Is that true? Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tension should be as strained as possible (oh options). If it sounds like a bad episode of TWILIGHT ZONE, you're half right ("re-boot" the 80's actually made a decent adjustment on a small screen; it actually rented it instead!) One of the worst movies of the year.
