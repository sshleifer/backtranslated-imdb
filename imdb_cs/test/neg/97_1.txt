Lowe returns to the nest after another unsuccessful relationship to find himself assigned to the jury duty. It is in the plans, somehow to get out of it when he realizes that the defendant is the girl he had been seriously crushed since the first year. Through life in the past by telling others about his feelings for this girl (played by Camp), Lowe recalls these feelings and does everything in his power to clear the camp of attempts at Murder while keeping away from the real bad guys and succeeded in creating a successful movie on I heard St Augustine is the oldest city in the US, and I also know it has some links to Ponce de Leon, so the background is a good place to start. Unfortunately, it's the only good thing about this movie. The local police are incompetent, the judge is an idiot and the attorney does everything in his power to look like Joanie Cunningham! I don't know if I should blame the director for the wrong direction, or just for letting the cast cast in such an unfortunate effort. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was so boring, I couldn't even sleep over it! 1 of 10 Stars!
