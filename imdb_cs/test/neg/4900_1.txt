For starters, I am not a person who would rate films I have not seen, nor do I who rate films 1 when they do not deserve it. This movie was really so bad. The basic plot was very formal, and although it wasn't great, the conspiracy deserved about 5. The part that really bothered me was something that referred to swimming in the movie. I compiled a short list of things with swimming aspects of this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. No character development. 2. No sense of time. 3. Totally inaccurate swimming scenes, which include: A team of six swimmers goes to something called "nationals" and "regional" with no mention of how they qualify. b. The same team that went to whatever the hell was, was a real meeting at any point in the movie without swimming. C. Opposing program goes from high school to club team back to high school and then club team. d. In a scene where Ellis conducts a job interview, the banners show state honors and public school placements, but the team consists of 5 to 12 swimmers, depending on which of the three meetings are taking place. E. A team of 5 boys and girls wins nationals / regions. F. She said the girl wins 100 butterflies of men. G. In this race, the girl said beating two guys from the team that was in the previous year in the top 3 in the nation. h. The Announcer changes the race from 200 breasts to 100 breasts back to 200 again in about 45 seconds. i. In the last relay, the 4X100, which is flooded at a 50m long course, one swimmer is seen doing two turns. j. In the same relay, the swimmers' anchors are pouring out of the blocks and encouraging an inspiring conversation that lasts about two and a half minutes, or about three times longer than the foot of a national caliber. k. The film begins in July or August, assuming Ellis ran before the start of the school year, and the pool was to be closed in 3 months, so assuming these things are true, the swimmers pay for not being able to swim. to the victory of nationals / regional, in less than two, because the pool had to be cleaned and the children did not start practicing for a while. I. I'm sure they're a few hundred more, I'm trying to block them from memory. 4. During the film, there is not a single mention of the time of swimmers. 5. If you have a movie about swimming, it would be a good idea to hire accessories that can swim well. 6. A scene where a child is kicked underwater is physically impossible. As already mentioned, all swimming scenes were too slow, swimmers had a terrible technique and the idea of ​​qualifying for a national meeting within three months of learning to swim is just an insult to swimmers everywhere. OK, if you still don't believe me, let me say that this movie is one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and this is from a guy who owns Gigli, Soul Plane, Manos: Hands Fate, Skullduggery, and some amount of other bullshit pieces that have been put on film. Please don't go!
