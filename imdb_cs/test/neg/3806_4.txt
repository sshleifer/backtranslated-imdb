Stodgy drama with Pat O'Brien as a washed-out reporter who appears in his former boss's house to ask for money to fund his son just to find him dead on the floor. Since O'Brien knows the identity of the culprit, he will offer to return for what he needs. A decent assumption is wasted on a film that pretends to have surprises, twists and turns, even if it really isn't. The performances are rotten overboard, the film dresses like a hard-boiled American noir, but a mixture of devious accents doesn't work, and the story is barely grasped. And it contains perhaps the least attractive kiss of all time.
