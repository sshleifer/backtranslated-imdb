I managed to avoid reading Hemingway at college. From what I could say, along with his reductive verb, he offered reductive storylines. This AF2A film transformation into a simplistic, shaken, narrated story does not relieve me of my suspicions: A guy who hardly sees action on a European battlefield (Hudson) falls into a sister (Jones) and conspires to spend time. Was Hemingway's great contribution to narration a romantic travelogue? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They're so general. The film never brings the utter irresponsibility to leave the queue for the adventures of lovers. Two have a season in the Alps, directly from the J. Crew catalog. A number of better scenes are threatened by corals, conventional melodrama elsewhere. The film continues to accumulate tiny, unlikely, unspecific details that fight epic treatment. The cavernous hospital in which Miss Barkley works is virtually empty, so no secondary plot can distract from the fragile main story. Complicated, not. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is better than average, with amazing location photos. Director Charles Vidor (or perhaps Huston?) Attacks in the first hour with a camera on a widescreen display. Vidor shows massive, panoramic tables, pans over a row of hundreds of soldiers walking on the mountains; and then, by turning the camera 90 degrees, the Hudson ambulance, which falls down on him, is caught. <br /> <br /> Hudson looks great. He is a better actor than he deserves, but with such uncut material he can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional sheik. Jennifer Jones is puffy and sick in insignificant female leadership. The movie is best when it's off screen. Love scenes are just like the effect on coffee.
