I don't mind continuing; sometimes they are better than the original. However, many times the originals are best left alone ... especially if you can't duplicate the cast. One of the biggest reasons "The Magnificent Seven" was such a hit was a very popular cast. It is hardly "spectacular seven," when only Yul Brynner returns as one of the members of this famous group in "The Magnificent Seven." With six of the seven guys missing and being replaced by much less known actors, it loses its appeal in a hurry. In other words, besides Brynner, these guys have no charisma! It's like a championship sports team that controls all but one. Brynner is good, once again: fun to watch, fun to hear with this distinctive deep voice, but the story, not just the rest of the crew is lame. This film should never be made. In the original we took care of "seven;" we couldn't care less here.
