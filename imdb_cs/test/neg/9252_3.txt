'The Mill on Floss' was one of the less novels by Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the male pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this boring and very turgical novel years ago, but I couldn't finish it. I will only review this film version on the basis of my own merits because I do not know how faithfully follows the original novel. The introductory films of the film are printed in Old English script, suggesting a medieval period, and so it is a very bad choice for a movie with a nineteenth century. (On the other hand, probably in the middle of the movie, we see a close-up of a handbill advertising a real estate auction. This handbill is set in authentic Victorian fonts and looks * very convincing.) Most of this film is extremely convincing in its depiction of architecture and clothing of the early 19th century England. The exact location of the film's story will never be published, but - according to actors' accents - I'd place it as somewhere in the Cotswolds, perhaps in Warwickshire. The story of it is a mill that changes hands several times (over several decades) between two rival families, one rich and one working class. I disagree with another IMDb reviewer who claims that James Mason has a minor role in this film. Mason has the biggest and most important role in this drama, as a descendant of a richer family. As a spoiled and grumpy Tom Tulliver, Mason is darkly tense and impulsive. His performance is part of a better film: I wanted me to see Mason return with W. Werhering Heights as Heathcliff. As it is a multi-generation saga (something that George Eliot did much better with "Middlemarch", several major roles in this film are divided between two actors: prologue children, adults in the main story The prologue of this film is characterized by a very well-written scene that Tom Tulliver has set up as determined and bully-ragging from an early age, and young Philip Wakeham is polite and thoughtful, and despite hard work, Philip has made half: Tom is trying to discourage him, but he's not willing to take the coin with brute force: he wants him to give it to him, all the actors in this film, both men and women, are talented and attractive, unfortunately, all the children talk in their classy accents that are totally different from the actors and actresses they play the same roles as adults.This irregularity draws attention to the rigidity of the material.Unfortunately, none of the later scenes are as good as this prologue. <br /> <br /> The highlight is the crowd workers in the storm, much better pace and photography than earlier scenes, but modern viewers (at least in Britain) cannot take this kind of material seriously. So far, virtually every British comedian has done "trouble on the pier, squire" comedy routine, parodying just this subject, so I have trouble watching this straight face movie. The character of the actress Martita Hunt is good in a small role, but the introductory credits (in that old English script) misrepresent her name as 'Marita'. I will rate this boring movie 3 points out of 10: one point per piece for James Mason's performance, an early childhood scene, and an authentic Victorian rate in this auction package.
