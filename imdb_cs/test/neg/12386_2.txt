Okay, this "horror" movie was supposed to be a joke, right? Please tell me it was supposed to be a joke, then I understand. Big cat bird with giant claws - or one claw - anyway - unsuspecting people on the ground and engulf them. up. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow go far enough to keep things interesting, but at least you'll enjoy a hearty jerk when you see a monster. It looks like a cross between a derailed chicken and Mortimer Snerd. Either director Fred Sears just made this picture in a hurry and knew that the bird looked totally ridiculous, or really thought that his film and creatures were really scary. I prefer to think - and I hope - that was the first. <br /> <br /> P.S. The bird needs a haircut.
