I'm on a blockbuster, picking a random movie, I got this and yeah. This was a good sex porn ... quality sucking, and that gave me a heck of a headache. For me, this movie was good for his sex stuff, but not so much for horror and tension. It was ... magic ... <br /> <br /> Tension .. not as good as I would expect. I wanted to be on the edge of my place, hoping to jump in fear, but instead I lay on the couch and didn't see much. <br /> <br /> Quality .. not good at all. I mean, when you watch carefully when people are in the cold mountains, they hardly wear anything. It doesn't make much sense too. So if your looking for bullshit, not really exciting, and pretty sexual movie, you have it.
