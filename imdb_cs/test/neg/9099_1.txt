When you watch the first few moments, you realize it's going to be a parody - and it's definitely a * parody, but I'm not sure what (fairy tale? track. It's just a pointless movie (cf. Good Parody is everything but senseless), with opulent, shallow expressions of very superficial characters. It's like commedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a chained commedia dell'arte. And scores ... sung intentionally incompetent (something that Greenaway will use much more efficiently) is * painful to listen to (if you don't wear some earplugs, haha). Go to quality movies (eg A. Mitta, as Czar Peter the Great took his Moor, 1976) and avoid this error.
