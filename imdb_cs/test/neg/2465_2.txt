Too predictable for spoilers, but I won't be below, so don't read it if you care. . So let's start with a criminal who was looking for the whole of France ... no matter what he did, we'll think about it later (don't). some seconds of tension, but not too much, and nothing unexpected because it requires art. half an hour to complete the film; I have it: let them rob a jeweler and take a lot of time avoiding alarms, etc; Everyone robs jewelers in movies just like that, he is bound to work (not). No humor, no character (ok, yves montand gets to get the ham up) and everyone talks in a quiet, quiet voice that should think of a noir but only make the actor depressed. if it is silent, it will look somewhat grim - but it will also save us writing their lines. we should rather add something to stay at home for women who will look at these things, so let's have something to make them empathize with their husband (we forgot to put all the women in the film). he got it: son na (gasping) marijuana - oh, and let him try to suicide for no particular reason (shame? his father is a mafia boss for a loud call, but the audience will feel his paternal care, and if not, drool them) ). oh, the crooked cop was the guy's classmate who eventually gets him; gaudy, huh? let them at the end all die, or we'll never finish it. is it in the can? That's the end, thank God. Who will we be for the director?
