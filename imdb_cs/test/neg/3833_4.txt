I can't imagine any possible reasons why Madsen and Hopper would like to be in this movie after reading the script. Maybe they blackmailed? Or are they wrong with the money? The main problem with the movie is that it's boring. Interviews between Madsen and Hopper are useless as well as bored chatting between two friends while drinking beer on Saturday night. You never feel any of the characters (even though the psychological murderer Madsen is very sympathetic, compared to other characters). Hopper has always been a good actor, and Madsen is doing a great job as a serial killer, otherwise acting is almost ridiculous. There are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is going on, each of them takes about three minutes. Although "scenic and thoughtful murders and the nature of murderers" would be interesting if they were scenes in the book. The whole concept would be interesting for the novel, but the movie just can't be plain with a story with such a great inner thinking and so little action.
