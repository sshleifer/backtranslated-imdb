"Black Friday" has done this much better, which is why he is remembered and "The Man with Two Lives" is just a forgotten cauldron. "Shed No Tears" was a working title and it would be better because it was bad for most of the movie. Philip Bennett is newly involved when an accident is involved. Dr. Clark (Edward Keene) participated in some experimental animal operations - brought them back from the dead. His colleagues are calling him to test his operation on Phillip, who has died. When he works, the dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, goes to the electric chair and trans migrates the soul. When Phillip wakes up from the operation, Panina has a soul. He's a changed man, is rude to his family, and starts to hang around Panino's old ghosts. He Takes Over Wolf's Old Gang - Regards the name of Philip Bennett, he also romance is Wolf's former girlfriend - who smells a rat. Bennett, like Wolf, is determined to increase his score and start eliminating his enemies. Points accumulate, including girlfriend and policeman, then his own family becomes a victim. But - I hate those "bad dreams" movies - you always feel released. This movie would be better if he stayed in the character like Panino and had the final shot. Eleanor, his fianc√©e, would have been sadder with his brother, but wiser. Edward Norris, a star, has had a great career mostly in B movies. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
