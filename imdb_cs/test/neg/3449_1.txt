I'm glad I never saw this show when it came out. I was just wondering why it took 4 years. It reminds me of a terrible 80 years with fake people, fake clothes and fake music. How did I ever survive in this era? Playing in most of the episodes I've watched is forced. This is for a very boring show. The plot lines are not very interesting, as the old Twilight Zone shows. The old show inspired the imagination and made one look forward to the next show. <br /> <br /> Stick to the old Twilight Zone and save your attention while watching the trash.
