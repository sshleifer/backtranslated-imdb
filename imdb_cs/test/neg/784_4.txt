First. Should Cameron Diaz Be Allowed to Act Again? Call that poor performance would be an insult to poor performance. That was a historically terrible performance. Every little chance Diaz had to be a serious actress is completely done. Sadly horrible. Two, the film was extremely boring and not very provocative at all. I can sit and think about human nature without watching the terrible actors playing a terrible story. Third, it wasn't the only likable character, and even worse, it seemed that the design made it. You didn't like or feel compassion for any character. It was quite effective. I wanted everyone to die to be honest. Included foreigners. Child included. Everyone was just one big mope in this movie. All literally just a moped around, and they called it a movie. You could scarcely recognize zombies "employees" with ordinary people because they all looked like zombies. Finally, nothing really makes sense. From character reactions and emotions to the literal story, it all seems random. This is just a really bad movie, disguised and conceived as a "thoughtful mans movie" to be confusing. Give me a break. Bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
