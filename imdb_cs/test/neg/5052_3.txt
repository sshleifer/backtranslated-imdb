You know, I'm really tired of all the generic music used in these types of movies (see Jawbreaker, disturbing behavior, etc.). Every scene of true tension here (and there is some) is immediately undercut with some raw pop tune, completely thinning the tension. Why are they doing this? To of course sell some soundtracks, but in this case the mission is not met - someone bought a CD? Yeah, Mrs. Mirren is challenging her role with enthusiasm and pleasure (with some cheez-wiz to add a kick). But what is Molly, Leslie and Vivica doing here? Their roles (so little used that I can't use "characters" here) have no sense in the story, so I can't figure out why three famous actresses were cast. Oh, and the end is so incredibly hackney and irresponsible. Children stand without skirmish and behave as if nothing happened - all the graduation smiles. They are criminals, people! No consequences for their actions (kidnapping, assault, class handling) - nothing. So little things - was Tingle's story about her husband true? What's with the crossbow? Would Katie's virgin figure lose her icing from such a whim? (Great news, guys.) Why did McKean go home to her? How did Kate's academic nemesis walk through the door at that moment? How do students receive teacher home addresses? WHAT IS JEFFREY TAMBOR? On what basis does McKean Fire Tingle? She is bloody, battered and held hostage by students, fer cripe's sake! Well, I spend more thinking on the script than Mr. Williamson seems to have done, so I'll stop by. br /> 3/10
