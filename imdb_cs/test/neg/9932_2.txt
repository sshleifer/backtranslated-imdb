I caught it on HBO in his "Guilty Pleasures" category, and I would agree that I felt guilty (and delighted) to watch it. One, it's waste, and really shabby waste. Two, the plot is slow and predictable, and once you learn "who did it," you think, "So what?". However, I have to admit that it is enough of a male chauvinistic pig who wants to sit in what is obviously a bad movie if for a different reason than to make Peta Wilson quite naked. Do I feel dirty for watching it? Yes. I'm sorry I watched it? No. So there's a contradiction between a good film lover and a female anatomy lover, even if he's in the wrong movie. Sigh!
