Thinking that it might be better was the worst assumption I've ever made .... <br /> <br /> Not only is the graph thin, but I get more emotional action from my pet fish! I think Stephen Baldwin's cardboard cutout would do a better job and actually be more animated. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any cost! This could be really dangerous to your health!
