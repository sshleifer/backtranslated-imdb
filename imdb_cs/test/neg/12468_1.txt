Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the worst movie I've seen all year, and I ran in some doozio. There is no redemption of this basket, from characterization to land. Even the brilliant Dominique Swain couldn't save the film. None of the characters is at least sympathetic, with the possible exception of Eloise (beautifully portrayed by Lacey Chabert, the only clear point in this unfortunate failure). <br /> <br /> ******* Maybe Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with Tart is that it spins without saying anything. Instead of guiding us along the path of the story, he annoys drunkenness. It also introduces numerous potentially irritating details (hypochondriac brother, mother's possession constantly being repossessed, anti-Semitic classmate, murderous father of the other classmate) without a successful exploration of one of them. And just as I finally thought there might be some distinction for the characters, the film would fall to an unexpectedly violent end. I left the film and felt that it was trying to tell me something, but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. This is the first film by a writer / director who really needs to spend much more time working with more established filmmakers before working more on unsuspecting public. The movie I gave 1 out of 10, and I'm usually very generous, even with bad movies.
