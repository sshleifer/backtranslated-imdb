The book is great. It's one of my favorite books ever. On the other hand, the film is incredibly bad and bad! When I heard Damon play Ripley, I knew that this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be so bad. The actors go around and act very spectacularly. With the exception of the Fa (and even he is guilty of some striking acting), all the actors here are close to amateurs. Talking Italian and moving your hands or hair about should not be considered playing. Damon's wrong. It's too hard for a character to be a chameleon. Paltrow is forgotten, and Hoffman plays yet another effeminate slim character. Discuss how to write. The script (written by the overrated director) is truly unforgivable to completely renounce all the fine details of the book and come with many of its own. ! Adding Jazz Music is absolutely wrong! I think that Minghell's idea of ​​Italy in the late fifties, in the early sixties, is shrouded in images of Chet Baker roaming in the Italian countryside and spreading amore. Yeah, Minghella is a true visionary. The film is so bleeding obvious. The stupid scene when Ripley passes through a narrow street full of mirrors. Very laughing. Yes, we get the point !!! Every point or detail is miles away, so the film can give the viewer a false impression that they have psychic abilities. For example, we know that the Blanchett character, which was introduced at the beginning of the film, will only return to complications later on. And the soundtrack is sometimes totally unsuitable. Whimsical when it shouldn't be. The film continues too long and in all directions. There are too many boring characters in the landscape (many that were not in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! Minghella's son seems to have told his father that his favorite is Ripley. Mr. Minghella then continued to direct him as the kindness of his son. Well, the director has achieved what he wanted to do: The talented Mr. Ripley with his Hitchcock ambitions is a film strictly made for 12 years!
