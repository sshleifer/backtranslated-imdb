I don't think it really depends on what the movie's story is about, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurism of the entire production. Acting is what you would get if you accidentally selected people from the street. The sound is really annoying - the medicine box closes with all the wonders of a shot that runs in the ear, while the dialogue is perhaps one-fifth louder. The soundtrack is controlled by various sounds on a large scale, with dialogue on the far back seat. The theme music sounds like it's about a quarter when the movie was released, as much of the movie have no music at all. Working with the camera is best described as a twisted mess, with detailed shots where the middle angle would be much better, cameramen walk around and rotate the camera in every direction, absolutely no attention to framing any scene, just shot everything from anywhere it was for the cameraman most appropriate. If the cameraman were one foot taller than the actors and you'd end up looking at the tops of each of them, well, that's it. Editing is just a butcher's task; Everything is thrown together in the most unfavorable way, nothing escapes or passes in any sense of the word. I don't know if it was a video shot or maybe a rented video camera, I tend to think it was the second. I did it just about three quarters of the way through this thing before I turned it off, I'm just so angry at the low quality production I couldn't take it anymore. It's like the ninth year of an audiovisual class project.
