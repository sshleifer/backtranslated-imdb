This movie is really bad. Most of them seem to have been filmed either in the park or in the basement. There's a huge spider, but all we see is one foot. There are some worms who live in a cave that are just cheap socks puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that doesn't make any sense. The whole thing is just ridiculous.
