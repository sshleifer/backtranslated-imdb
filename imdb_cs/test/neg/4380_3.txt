That's just another bad Chuck Norris movie. Norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women. Three years ago he gave this guy away, but the guy gets somehow through the bars in a nut house that has what looks like a dental floss. Then the killer escapes in the cleaning tub and drives him over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around the theater that is undergoing reconstruction. Irish Jack O'Halloran is the best in this movie, but like Superman II, he doesn't say a word. Somehow it should be more frightening. Ron O'Neal of Fame Super Fly and Steve James are wasted while playing the mayor of the city and Noris' Sidekick. The film also includes the idiotic subplot Norris and his girlfriend having a child out of marriage; it's the 1980s. When Norris's "serious" play combines with top-of-the-line music cues that signal every scene being prepared in a predictable way, the film becomes a chore to sit. Building a search for a murderer in a theater is so interesting that Norris went through the shadows to find shelter, but the end of the fight is disappointing after he has started in a promising way. It is another disappointment with cannon movies and is played as a movie made for television. * of 4 stars.
