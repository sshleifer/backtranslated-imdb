The first two Critters films were basically stupid, but good and fun. This movie is more than a B-movie that is stupid, but for all bad reasons. This is the first sequel that does not really stem from the plot of the first two films. Basically, all the characters are new, and this time there are no reward hunters (well, like no one, because the hunter in this movie is appearing too late) and the budget for this movie has clearly dropped again. To save even more costs, the film was back-to-back with Part 4, which I displayed just as badly as it follows this movie and got away from the same people like this one. It's just a typical B-genre movie that doesn't really have any originality or fun. This makes "Critters 3" a real redundant sequel, you can easily do without. It is true that it may have been worse for this film, but it is not a good one. The film simply falls as being science-fiction / horror / comedy. Also kind of weird to notice how the Critters suddenly changed in this. This time it is about twice their usual size without explaining it, and they are even more Gremlini than in this movie than it was in the previous movie. The film is interesting just because it was Leonard DiCaprio's feature debut. He was about 17 in this movie and of course he looked like he was looking the same as now. I like to watch these famous actors in their early roles. It's fun to see how they behave and whether their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course DiCaprio just got better, but he was already a bit of delivering his lines just like these days. <br /> <br /> Really too stupid and lame. <br /> <br /> 4/10
