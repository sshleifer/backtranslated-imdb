... BREAKER MORANT and ROMPER STOMPER. It also gave us traceable movies like BOOTMEN and ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately, for everyone involved in this debacle, WOG BOY will not join in any list. I was looking forward to seeing this movie just because of a politically incorrect title, so politically wrong that when it was broadcast on BBC 2 late at night, the notifier even mentioned the name of the movie, so I was expecting something so insultingly anachronistic that my jaw will fall in disbelief. It wasn't believed that I wasn't able to believe that the financiers thought it was going to be a big international hit. I know that Australia with a small population does not have a large number of actors, so I will forgive most of it, but it does not stop my criticism of Nick Giannopoulos as Steve. For this type of comedy to work you have to be amazed by the comic skills of the lead actor and I'm sorry to say, but Nick G just doesn't have the skills. I've never heard of it and seen anything else that is, so maybe it's better on other performances. However, here it is simply irritable, unconvincing and I have lost the number of times for the camera. Jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and get back to the scenario, which seems very developed, I think he thought running gag about a woman Minster Of Work who has him in the back of a limousine is fun to start? You get the feeling that someone in production should be more honest and say, "Look at a friend, this scenario is not good enough. Go and make it softer and more structured "<br /> <br /> I was rough and hardness was required in this review. I gave the film four out of ten and it would only be three if it wasn't for one really funny sequence, when Steve watches the current show just for flashing on the screen and marking "Down blodger". This shows that the screenwriters were aware of the comic timing and social commentary. Such a pity they didn't come up with a much better written film
