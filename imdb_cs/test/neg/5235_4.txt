After a lively, inspiring aerial shot in the fast-moving movie, it slipped into complete boredom and one tonal tone to the end. <br /> <br /> Where to start, I'll start the characters well. I really enjoyed them in the book, all of them were types and one-dimensional morons, who either had "Victim" or "Asshole", written on the forefront of the way. As someone has not seen through the owner of the Lealand Gaunt store (in the hammy and out of the Sydrow place) he is out of me. This film lacks excitement, tension and, in a sense, yes, fun values. It stretches too long with not much to repay. Why introduce too many annoying types of characters that should die and then forget about half of them? In the book, virtually everyone who went to the shop met a terrible fate. Here, besides one of the decent scenes that came out of the novel (the fight between Wilma and Nettie), it was disappointing and didn't have much balls. I'm sorry, but once the screen turns off, a boring shot and some bickering and then a few blasts didn't do it for me. Unfortunately, the book's brutality and average mood are missing. The burst of the church scene was so over the top and poorly executed, suddenly the whole city was in a brawl? That didn't make sense, and the characters that were not presented at once are who these people are and why should I care? The story is everywhere and no scene has any momentum. I thought Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors, but the film doesn't give them enough substances to give me a hell. Amanda Plummer was trustworthy, but too pathetic to be really sympathetic (there was a sad and depressed character in the novel), there was too much of a comment. J.T. Walsh was fun, but the role was far from interesting or layered. Too predictable. The soundtrack was too elegant for the material he supported. It stood out like a painful thumb. Easy friend, easy. Something a little less theatrical I would assume would work. I admit that some of the holes she managed were good enough. although. If you are going to shoot a movie that reaches point 2 hours, remember to have a lot more than this disaster adaptation kings better novels. I often laughed on the scene that was supposed to be taken seriously (Ed Harris's speech at the end, or the character of Hugh the priest in general), and was bored and not interested most of the time. Personally, the director should do much more with this story, his approach is too tame and hides behind too sharp a movie to ever break up like a decent movie. The film looks good, but not the view I think this story deserves. This ALASKA dude is not a good sign. I'd rather just read the book as you should, as if it were a lot more fun, layered character development, terrible violence and chaos, a nasty sense of humor and much more oomph. It is a cut version that has nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> ** Except ****
