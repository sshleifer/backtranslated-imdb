I respect Mike Hodges and enjoyed the fact that Carter was extremely excited to see it as a bleak view, but the Grocer seemed to be a particularly boring ITV drama. Dedicated, cool gaming is not just a lead character, it is extended to the entire cast, which means there is nothing to contrast with Owen's character. <br /> <br /> None of the characters make any feelings except boredom. The end of the movie is also, at best, disordered. Working with the camera etc. It's pretty good, but if you want to see Hodg's best Get Carter watch, don't bother with this uninteresting, unimaginable network. emotions he covered better than 20 years ago
