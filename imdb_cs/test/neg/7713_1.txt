I'm furious! It's been a long time since the last zombie movie I watched, so I was really looking forward to watching a good movie. HoTD2 was very disappointing. Reasonable story, but terrible gaming, filming, dialogue and educational clich√©s and punch lines. I didn't even see the first one, which is supposedly worse than this one ... now I'm curious to see how bad it could be! The film is full of mistakes and stupidity. Who on Earth analyzes DNA using a blood sample? Why are these "special forces" who "were in hell and back" fighting as a corrupt 6 year old girl? We see furious zombies who take a bite in any case that they get hundreds of those who are waving their hands at our two "heroes", take them to the ground and then let them go without scratches. I could go on and on, but life is too short and I've spent a few hours watching this pathetic film, which is an insult to the film industry.
