I am currently watching this movie and I have no hesitation in its revision. Acting is ridiculous. Half of the cast must be retired porn actors, and you can imagine the quality of the games in order to kick the portions. The graphics are unlike anything I've ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more credibility. They can't even afford the gaps for the weapons they shoot for a pathetic apology for the monsters. Maybe I should also notice how incredibly I am impressed by the number of "bullets" that their guns can hold. If I was asked to summarize the film, I would say that someone went to the local embassy group of total unsustainers, hit them on the island, added unnecessarily intense music and left a 6 year old editing. <br /> <br /> I can honestly formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released, recorded on DVD and cost $ 6 from my local video store for one day. If something I have received the advantage of being much smarter than all the parties involved in this movie. I hate this movie with great intensity. Why? I wish I knew the captain.
