This show should be called "When Bad Writing Becomes Good Actors", as most players have shown immense talent in other places, such as Andre Braugher in the killing: Street Life and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I hope the frenetic stimulation of the show is adjusted as the series evolves along with obvious clich√©s and dialogue so absurd that I wonder how stupid the writers imagined the main audience to be. We beat our heads with the main points of this show, instead of inventing it, almost as if the writers thought they had to explain that the main character was a vengeful angel, condemned to redeem himself from sins, both defective and mortal, There are many things to go through the butt. Watching the premiere required a great deal of distrust that Mike Olshanskey's tickets would spill their guts so quickly and he would feel compelled to intervene in the lives of completely unknown people. That he has these "Super-Cop" abilities to be all things to all people, gun experts, martial arts master, psychologist, confessor, locksmith, etc., Ad infinitum. Pure drivelesque fantasy. What is it about recent TV shows based in Philidelphia that they all seem to be filled with ugly ex-wife and very irrational brothers? Exaggerative. I wanted this show, I really did, because it had the privilege to have a premise somewhat different from the many clones appearing in this year's fare and it's the star of my preferred actors. But I'm afraid it's just another maybe good idea destroyed by careless executions.
