No doubt one of the worst movies ever made. The film is slim and free of structure, tension or story, the film extends into a thin premise of "composing a show". Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their creation and the dialogue is random and random. Everything is assembled in the order slapdash and often "Stepping Out" feels more like deleted scenes than the real movie. It seems that the film only exists as a showcase for lizzy and totally random Liza music numbers. Shelly Winters can be seen in the far better octo-epic "tentacles" and REAL Liza can be found in Showtime's release of "Queer Ducks: Movie".
