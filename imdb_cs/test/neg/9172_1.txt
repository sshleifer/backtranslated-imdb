This movie is undoubtedly one of the worst I've seen. It was so boring that I just couldn't wait for it to end. I talked to my girlfriend to watch her after the site had good reviews and after 30 minutes she looked at me as if to say "your nuts." The wind blows shrubs around. Acting was uninspiring, and the film was simply a waste of what was a good idea for wasting a dvd. Guy Pierce should stick to his neighbors, at least wash his hair. All he did was talk about his phone, but he didn't sell anything to the seller. He would be fired a few weeks ago. His girlfriend (once in Coyote Ugly) was supposed to stay in the bar because at least she looked hot. The one who played Vincent (those who knew it) was so uncomfortable that he was on the phone. that every normal person would go to his house and hit him a little 4 to 2. <br /> <br /> I don't know what he liked about this country. Actually, I want people to watch it suffer from the torture I went through.
