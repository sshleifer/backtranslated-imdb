When I was born and raised in Odessa and graduated from high school in the late 1970s at a high school in Odessa, I had mixed emotions in this movie. I no longer live in Odessa, but I will always be the heart of Texan. I didn't like how this 80,000-plus town was portrayed as a poor town. If I am wrong, please do not hesitate to fix me, but I believe OHS is also playing in the city stadium and the "Home of the Permian Panthers", which was displayed in the stadium, was in the Permian training field. I would like to see every year a little recognition of the city-city competition between us, OHS vs Permian. I wonder why the result of the game was changed, I think it would be as dramatic if the actual result were displayed. Overall, the movie was fine, he made me a little home and remembered the good old days of MOJO.
