What is the deal with all these groups of ethnic crimes that copy films related to the Italian mafia? We all know the Godfather as in Vito Corleone's Don, now we have this Mexican who is just tense Copy. I cannot understand why other ethnic groups have to imitate and imitate Italian mafia, but they certainly make them stupid. They seem to be wanabee italians. I'd rather see the Mexicans get their own ideas there and like to see their own culture and the way they do it, instead of copying the thoughts of the Godfather Trilogy. Besides the film being disappointing, seeing the Mexicans and trying to be Italians is not my thing. After I noticed it, I will watch the "real" godfather, so this movie can be erased from my memory.
