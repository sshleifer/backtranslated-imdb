Although our Gang comedy still has its followers, I must say that their attempt to complete feature films, courtesy of Hal Roach, came shortly. Why Roach had to choose a civil war with all the accompanying racism that would follow. Dashing southern cavalier Phillips Holmes takes Spanky McFarland and his young black buckwheat friend Thomas after Spanky unexpectedly puts a cheating card on the boat. Everything is quiet and peaceful in the Old South, and then civil war destroys them for everyone. But even kids can charm the worst in the world and there's nothing worse than the damned Yankees. They just come south and destroy it all. Criticized, even though it was for his southern view, Gone With The Wind did a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed, though servile, they wanted. Being out of necessity are still three-dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would win an Oscar if it weren't. Prissy's character Butterfly McQueen is so stupid and obscure that he has a dimension. But here is perhaps one of the worst racial stereotypes he has ever brought in Hollywood. Escorts of Spanky and Buckwheat shows that children get together, racial feelings are not obtained inbred. It is not the servility of blacks, which is unpleasant, but its complete acceptance. Right from that terrible melon song, sung over the title credits, General Spank's message is bad. Still, she managed to get an Oscar nomination for Sound Recording, probably one of the few Hal Roach ever got out of the short subject area. But General Spanky is far from Gone With The Wind.
