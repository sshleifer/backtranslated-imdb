Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this movie was misspelled. First, during the kidnapping scene, Irons sits too comfortably on her chair ... she seems to read something, and rather calmly too! Maybe the director shot the actor with each other? The kidnapping violence was also a long delay. Slow-mo, flying bullets - as his wife and daughter kill them is just not so interesting and the tension is lost. His sadness then wasted another 10 minutes. Then he decided to "take revenge" and talk to all his friends and ambassadors in the industry (he is a journalist for a cloth that is clogged by an economist). How do they know? But what really made me turn off the film halfway was when Irons found herself in a baddies store - BUT NOT BADDIES THAT ARE FILLED IT - and blows them away anyway. so he's just a killer. He leaves and, well ... I turned it off. I think I couldn't figure out how his friends knew something, and I thought he was the remaining two boys in custody who were the original kidnappers. Instead, he goes after his friends, I think, or anyone who hangs in the warehouses and leaves automatic weapons around him. The tension was totally conventional, and the dialogue was lame ("it's okay, the son is crying," he tells his son. "Son doesn't say that, and father says," You're right. excellent in Brideshead Revisited, which is a completely different animal than this lukewarm thriller.
