I bought a DVD of this movie for a dollar in a big warehouse. This is probably the best and kindest note I can offer. At least I didn't cheat on lunch. The problem with "Chiller" is Craven's problem as a director. The man has his apologists who claim that his travel documents prove that he is a really smart man and a versatile conceptual concept. However, it is no secret that as a director he never had a vision of the visual and narrative meaning of Hitchcock. As vigorously documented by "Chiller", he is much closer to the legendary flat feet of Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven lacks as a director is the main element that would have led him out of the director to a higher level of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Let's be specific. The transient moments of this film are elegant. Creating shots gives a sense of quality production. The film looks professional together as a film made by a commercial TV director would do. (Idea: Films are only visual resolutions, these transitions, which at least look professional, may also be the work of some other unit directors.) It's part of bridges and smooth transitions - a drama - that breaks down. <br /> <br /> The core of the control is always perfectly solved. Critical shots (after, say, a departing car goes to a well-positioned camera, then we cut to the hospital's night exterior, then to the waiting room and hallway, then quickly sets off on the phone booth in the corner where the next bit of action occurs) so we can hurry up and get to the next section. Craven never comes close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. The net result of all this misdirected attention to the least important parts and the groping rush to keep things moving is a film that feels like a nascent art student who sharpens all pencils, adjusts his stand and light set. up, grind all his pigments, stretch and prepare his canvas ... and then he has nothing to say. Craven, like an art student, never gets to the mass of exercise. For Craven's apologists, who point out that this movie was made for television, I'll point to Spielberg's "Duel" and say no. more.
