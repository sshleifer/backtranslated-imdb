Dreadful. I hope you can save two hours of life by notifying you. I just finished watching the movie, BTW. <br /> <br /> I love good genre movies. This is not one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce, or a religious action movie, I'll see them all. But you can't just throw epigrammatic quips at the rambling, camp, schlock-horror festival and draw my applause. I love philosophical films. This is not one of them. Anyone who is impressed by the depths of intellect in this film has not read a good book lately. Or sometimes. The "provoking" dialogue is at best banal. Maybe he lost something in the translation. I love good horror comedy. This is not one of them. Laugh! I thought I'd never start! Squirm? Only when we try to think of a polite way to express our opinion on a film to a friend who recommended it. Rupert is disproportionately good at setting this movie, but he can't resurrect it either. I just wish that instead of being a zombie, he shot the director. Because of the shame that the country that gave rise to Inferno, it should also be the reason why it should be the reason. Dante is spinning in her grave.
