Everything you do in this world should bring some sense. Unfortunately, very few "Delusion" makes sense. Jennifer Rubin is adequate in her role as a major hit hit by Kyle Secor's hit man. Secor, on the other hand, surpasses the point of annoyance. Jim Metzler, embezzling yuppie is very incredible as a newcomer, revenge seeker, adversary. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money she has kept secret, all credibility flies out of the window, and the weapons for the ultimate showdown between Secor and Metzler are out of ridiculous. Avoid "delusions" if you are not illusory enough to believe that there are incorrect positive reviews. - MERK
