This film is a desperate attempt to ride the skirtales of the success of Star Wars movies. The film uses recycled footage from "Battle Beyond the Sars", another Roger Corman Sci-Fi Turd, but at least this one is better than "Battle Beyond the Stars" - there's no real gaming in this movie (but its Roger Corman) What You Were Waiting for) The whole soundtrack was made on keyboard / Synthasizer, the sound effects are recycled from "Battlestar Galactica" - There are no special effects because they were recycled / rearranged spatial scenes from another movie, costumes look like something from 1981 saved by the savior army. The little boy in this movie gives one great performance and reappears in the movie Sylvester Stallone "Over the Top" - This Movie Gives 3 Stars out of 10
