1) Men over 25 years of age who, without irony, refer to "play" or "player" or "ballet dancer". Gentlemen, from now on it is a quick descent into the main version in its actual version of "The Night at Roxbury". <br /> <br /> 2) Says "V.I.P." The term "V.I.P." itself is not bad, but when it is preceded by "The", it immediately becomes part of the Douchebag Dictionary. This is doubly true for white people. 3) People who make TV shows based on things they don't know are not cool and then they go on IMDb as "fans" (... right ...) one of them is from "United States" (hey, me too!) To bitterly insult the members of their potential audience inevitably thinking that their show is upset. Minus 1 another point demerit if they use any change to oh-snap-nice-one-bro justification that "If you don't like a show you obviously can't get." 4) Canadian Hip-Hop / R & B Feel Massari ... random addition to the list at a glance, but at the end of the day Massari gets a gas face for the simple reason that his particular low-rent brand American-aping uncool and general Aqua Velva douchebaggery combines with the overall sensitivity of "VIP Keys" <br /> <br /> 5) Last but not least, "VIP Keys" ... for all of the above reasons and more.
