The film itself is not bad ... until you see the original film Hitch (2005) with Will Smith. The film is directly translated with even dialogs for most of the movie simply translated from English to Hindi! The land in the original is fixed. Hindi version can't keep viewers interested. David Dhawan's exaggerated comedy seems to have gone overboard with Govinda shouting hysterically every time ... sometimes more time is devoted to understanding the cause than the plot. :) <br /> <br /> If you know the English I think you know you are reading, check out the Hollywood original. At least look at "Hitch" if you were looking at a partner who would be able to compare. This is the least we can do to support the creative genius whose work I am sorry to say is brazenly raised by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
