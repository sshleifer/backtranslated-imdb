Killer (John Karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (afro wig on white dude?) Goes in his van to look for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easy by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for someone who looks weird (again the afro wig comes into play). Watching the killer in his house, DeCarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist. Inspired by the crimes of Ted Bundy before he was caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a pretty predictable and inexpensive serial killer movie. Director Jeremy Hoenack has no idea how to film a movie or even tense it. He knows how to show a lot of close shots of a killer waving his hands! The only thing that really goes is capturing the 70th atmosphere (watch out for the bathroom wallpaper). Well, this is a positive ending. Media Blasters / Shriek Show DVD has a lot of nice stuff, including audio commentary Hoenack and Karlen, plus video interviews, trailers and alternative openings.
