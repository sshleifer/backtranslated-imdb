I liked the Takashi Miike movies I've seen so far, but I found it quite disappointing. I bought it, but I won't keep it. I saw it on DVD Adness, which has only two episodes. At first, the killer kidnaps women, cuts the top of the skull off to reveal the brain, plants them in the ground to the chin, and plants a flower in the brain. You can find out from the DVD field. In the film, the top of the head is digitally blurred by TV statics. If you didn't see a DVD box, the viewer wouldn't know what people were looking at until the younger cop made a small body model. The strange thing is that there is a lightning bolt that is not censored on the woman's head. Besides, I'm not really sure what's going on. Some women get phone calls and shallow animated characters around when it happens. Sometimes an animated character appears on TV screens. It's not clear if anyone sees it. In the second episode, pregnant women are found open and their children are missing. The cop in turn makes a model of what the corpses are like, which is useful because the real body is censored again. There is also a natural birth in the film, but strangely enough, this baby and umbilical cord are censored! According to the DVD box, the uncensored versions were not left when they were originally made. Maybe even if they knew they would be censored, maybe they wouldn't bother to show anything ...? Not sure. <br /> <br /> If I hear later episodes are better, maybe I'll look at them. How it is, I won't bother.
