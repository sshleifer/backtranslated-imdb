Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe the one who managed to get it up to 7 has a soft spot for kids with AIDS. But really people, manic laughter and chaos during the scene download? Didn't you see it? I'm surprised that no child crawled across the ceiling and my friends turned to the camera. Surely it was fine. But for me it is just one example of a film from a time when the situation and the theme can go through the film language. Things happen, but that's it. There is no glue or motif that could be detected on the screen, which would allow the subject to use an already existing emotional connection that would allow the plot to be rendered without the script doing so.
