This is the fact that this is the first Saudi feature film to be shown in cinemas, but not in Saudi Arabia for the simple reason that we do not have cinemas in our Great Kingdom. Not just one cinema! The government banned the opening of cinemas after Islamic extremists OR religious police (or both) asked for it to be closed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They blamed 7. art for promoting bad sexual relationships and things like that. I don't see a powerful reason not to open the cinema !! .. we have many videos of shops all over the kingdom, we watch movies on TV from some satellite channels, we can install "Showtime" set channels and after all movies in general it seems harmless in many ways .. I know many people how to go to neighboring countries just Watch a couple of movies .. I personally went to Bahrain several times just watching movies in theaters because watching it is great fun as opposed to watching a movie at home. The Saudis pay the most expensive cinema ticket in the world, travel to explore movies, while the rest of the world has cinemas in every city. This is one of the problems we have! The film is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, a major company belonging to the Saudi tycoon-prince Alwaleed Bin Talal (the 8th richest man in the world). The title of the movie is a word meaning literally "how are you?" but it is also slang meaning "what's up!", sometimes used as slang to say "bad" about something and sometimes is used as slang to tell someone respectably about his business and not to interfere with someone else's affairs. Anyway, I think they meant (how are you) & (what's happening!) At the same time, I could be wrong. Male actors are from Saudi Arabia as Hisham Abdulrahman, who is very famous and has some popularity after winning 1st prize in Arab reality to show more as "American Idol", working on some television programs, like the Arabic version of "Cash Taxi" .. another famous actor is Khaled Sami, who is funny and has a very good sense of humor .. other actors like Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turki Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and working on some TV series. Female actresses are non-Saudis and they have done a very good job talking about the Saudi accent .. Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan in the lead role of & Emeriti actress Fatima Al-Hawsani .. not that we don't have Saudi actresses but are few and not that good. Saudi critic "Rja Al-Mutairi", who writes for the newspaper Alriyadh (the most popular newspaper in the kingdom), wrote: "He doesn't expect much of the first Saudi feature film." He was born under unusual circumstances, so we cannot judge him according to the usual standards, as is the case with other films, which is the fact that this film hit a huge financial success in its first days of opening only in the Kingdom of Bahrain. is about a Saudi family trades (interacts) with controversial fresh issues within Saudi society like: women driving cars, low-shallow ideas of art, custody of society by a certain group, and differences between conservative being and being Thoughts are good, but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie. One of the advantages of the film is the beautiful musical work Rajeh Dawood, which was good, but sometimes it does not match or express what is in the picture. Turki Al-Yusuf did a great job .. his performance was best with Mais Hamdan .. the biggest loser is the leading actor Hisham Abdulrahman, who came to accompany the actors Mishal Al-Mutairi, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami, who did the job their role. After all, "Keif al-hal?" Even with all its drawbacks, there is still an OK film and it's a very good first step Rotana. Until He Realizes the Importance of the 7th Arts and Other Arts PS: There is another Saudi filmmaker "Abdullah Almohaisen" claiming to have directed a Saudi film called "Shadows of Silence."
