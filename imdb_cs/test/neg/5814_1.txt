I found this gemstone in a rack that had a local video rental shop that was exchanged between different stores. 'The Man Who Skied Down Everest'. Hmm ... he never heard of it. The box reads a Japanese colleague who always wanted to go down Everest and actually did it. Sounds interesting. I rented it. As expected, it was a documentary style. The first part can be summarized as follows: "I always wanted to go down to Mount Everest". Here are some shots of preparation for the event. Lots of preparatory shots. OK, I think it takes a lot of preparation. Then we looked at us for a lengthy piece of skier, Yuichiro Miura's philosophy, etc. There's another filling and I'm starting to wonder where skiing can fit into this show. Another preparation is shown and they begin to embark on a mountain trail. More philosophy is shown. Finally, he reaches the mountain and maybe he gets on skis to pack up. Lots of mountaineering footage later includes a description of the parachute device designed to slow down Miuras's speed on a steep slope. Finally, the straps are jumping and ready to go. He is gone ... Skis about twenty feet and skis are shooting from under him, putting on a parachute and throwing himself on a decent package. some distance down to the mountain and that's it. End of the story. What the hell was that? OK I can buy that he always wanted to ski on Everest, make extensive preparations and actually try it with the camera crew on the move. It didn't work and he ended up falling down and almost killing himself, so what scary heroism would inspire men to release the movie from it and call it down skiing Everest? Maybe the title, "The man who is the shooter from under him and he Slid on his Ass Down Everest" was just too long on the tape box.
