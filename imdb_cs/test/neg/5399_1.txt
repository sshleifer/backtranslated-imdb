Should it be a comedy? Black mask and skeleton mask are merry. There is like a zero plot. The film begins with an archaeologist and his assistant. They make little mention of their site of excavation being cursed. And then, behold, behold ...... in the drops of Halloween costume A man dressed in a shiny black raincoat, with a mask of a skeleton mask, holding an ax. So he'll kill these two people. Then we cut into the forest with a bad Predator imitation, only commandos are hunted by Halloween, which now rides a horse! Other commandos appear, but these people are supposed to be disguised as a tourist group. Yeah, production probably ran out of mosquitoes. Can you say a low budget? By the way, they come to a lonely old Indian guy sitting in the woods. He's just too funny. And he starts to cry about something, but you really don't know what he is mumbling about, so they remember some of the Indians killed. None of this makes any sense. And then we return to our commandos where they are killed more. And that's basically a plot. It's so ridiculously bad, you just can't turn away because you want to see how low it falls. You could make the same movie with a video camera, Halloween costume and a lot of your friends with fake weapons. You don't see it if you want a horror movie. If you want a comedy? Or just skip and get something like a real predator.
