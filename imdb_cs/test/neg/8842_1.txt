I look at all the good reviews about this movie and start thinking about myself ... I'm crazy ..? Can't I see this beauty from the movie? Am I just stupid enough not to understand the message this film is trying to make? I don't know ... maybe one of those lizards came into my head and ate all my brains. The film thought was nowhere ... I was sure it would have a hazy end and of course ... it did! Nothing special ... Even landscapes (I hoped the location in the mountain village at least the landscape would be nice .. but not). Just a lame story about a crazy teacher, and of course her crazy pupils ... now everyone has grown up, each with their own ideas. And a guy of some of those ideas was stupid, like a lizard story. At that moment I thought I was watching x files. No ... from my point of view, this film is a waste of time (if they don't tell money when U pays for a ticket) The only part I did was the acting of a young blue eye of a "German" boy ... your age ... the rest ... nothing! I read the previous review and I think the screenwriter and director were both on drugs when they came up with these ideas. Well, considering that there are a lot of people who enjoyed this movie ... I think I'm getting it again ... Maybe I'm crazy. Advice .. Don't waste your time with this!
