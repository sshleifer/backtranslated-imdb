This movie defines the word "confused". All actors remain faithful to the script. More is a shame because acting is fine, but the screenplay is confused with the pastis of pseudo-psycho-analytical random ideas. Stimulation is notoriously slow and cinematography with a soft focus quickly gets on the nerves. I give it 4 out of 10.
