We all know that special effects cost money, but they seem to be able to use the money they saved while writing the script to get some better pictures. The train is probably the model in most of the moving shots, the helicopter is probably computerized, the alien looks like the one at the end of the Spaceballs, except that ten years later Spaceballs apologized. The only clever thing they did was blur all the special effects to make them harder to see. Even the actors couldn't compensate for this badly written script, and it's pretty obvious they didn't really try. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Please.
