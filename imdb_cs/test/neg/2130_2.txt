This shock is a cheap way, it's something really bad, with the kind permission of the spaghetti director Lamberto Bava, who wisely left his name out of this junk. The basic essence of this trip is the discovery of some brutally crippled individuals ashore in the Caribbean. The authorities initially believe that they are victims of shark attacks, but as the investigation breaks up, it turns out to be something more sinister. But all of this does very little, but we have - bad dubbing complimented by a similarly weak scenario, which often consists of meaningless jabbering, and is mostly really small. Negotiations can only be described as partial par, which in this case is par for the course. Really lax direction doesn't help things either. The special effect is mainly for numerous close-ups of various bloody bodies of missing limbs and so on. Of course there is a mandatory creature that periodically appears at the time of feeding, which looks like a large monster octopus, where its animation consists only of pointed teeth rising and falling in rhythmic division. Finally, the end result is not too convincing, confident, but certainly is almost entertaining in the cheese type of fashion. It seems that what filmmakers did was a sort of low-industrial hybrid of Jaws and Piranha, but the end product is just a bloody scale, just like the corpses constantly shown in this picture. I find it difficult to think of any redemptive attributes that deserve it, and more strictly for incurable drug addicts.
