This person is a so-called entertainer who has to resort to vulgar, vulgar and slanderous efforts to make others believe he has talent. I have often seen the comics use a little of everyone with effect, but when all you can say is snapped with it, it's a sign of the drug affected by the distorted mind. I wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be in the next few years of abuse. Poor !!! I admit I couldn't watch it - too stupid for words. An amazing part of this is that someone really believes he's a philosopher !!! No wonder self-esteem and decency are diminishing and perversion grows. Could it be that UFC could have been a factor in his dead brain?
