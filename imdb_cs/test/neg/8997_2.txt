After reading mostly glowing comments about this film, I decided to rent it despite some suspicion of TV films. I should have followed my instincts. I tried to get so hot on the film and find merit in it, but I just couldn't. The story never attracts or recognizes circles and acting is at best perfect and worst. Everything in this production is amateur. Mary McDonnell, who always likes to watch them, can be the only player to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation. I will not even bother to control the name of the leading man - hopefully he is back in advertising. Even the poor Vanessa Redgrave, whom I adore and respect, seemed to develop Katherine Hepburn all along. if she was really dazed at home. Maybe she needed money. <br /> <br /> If I can save one person from wasting 100 minutes on this lie, I will feel defended.
