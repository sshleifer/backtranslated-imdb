Based on the excellent novel, The Rangers, by Dean Koontz, this extremely horrible film is something that no one should ever see. Not since I saw a book that has been recognized for recognition so far. The difference is, the movie "The Running Man" was as enjoyable as a fun action movie loaded with a million phrases. This movie?? No, nothing remotely amusing. In fact, if you like a book like me, you will hate this bastardization even more. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** Rightio, basically I'll tell you the story here, almost in its entirety. Why? Because you, dear reader, also do not need to suffer this abomination, it is fine for me because I enjoy watching crap. Because I'm complaining about things. Now, on the ugly: This film revolves around a boy and his mother running away from the government and a mutant-monkey-creature-soldier who escaped from a ruined government genetic lab with a super-clever golden retriever who "hero" calls "Furface". Groan?? Believe me, this story shuddered in this novel. I'll get to it later. Anyway, the hero is none other than dreamy boy-child Corey Haim. Oh, I'm not kidding. Our hero is running around, crackling his voice and all, trying to convince his mom to help save this dog from the "bad government" that has born him and made him genetically ultra-smart. Monkey creature, retarded as "Oxcom" (God helps us), is also a genetic goulash of creation that will be built as the ultimate warrior on the battlefield of the future. Michael Ironside (Total Recall, Starship Troopers' always playing fake) is also in this movie, and no, I couldn't figure out how someone convinced him it would be a good idea. He plays a government agent with NSO hunting dog and creature. Yeah, there are some spoilers here: It's also a creature from the government and the same lab, and, lo, most of the film spends being pricked and killing people? soldier. Instead of rockin 'kick-ass, a haunted horror movie, we have rectal bleeding from horror. Dog intelligence is discovered too comfortably and believed more easily than we believe we can see the clouds by looking out. Breakdown !! Changing from book to movie: <br /> <br /> - The character (Travis) has changed from person to boy. The man's love for the book (Nora) is now his mother? and all its depth and growth of the character is completely gone. Lem Johnson, a Negro, is now White Mr. Ironside. This depends on how the strength of the character was built on his heritage in the book. - The relationship between the two figures of authority completely ignored, Lem now kills a guy who was originally his best friend. One basic character in the book is now totally absent, "immortal" that hunted heroes - maybe it's supposed to be Ironside, but why is anyone else? <br /> <br /> --Dog never gets the name "Einstein" in the film. - No part of the book took place in high school - at least nothing that would have a strong impact on the storyline. Br /> <br /> - It takes a few days, rather months like a book - unrealistic stimulation. - Haim's girlfriend appeared in the film in more than two chapters in the book - and they never met in the book. Lem Johnson is no longer cool; Instead, he is a total asshole who bullies his way through people. Hero Travis was part of the Delta Force (a military segment specializing in terrorist hunting), instead, his father, who is never seen in the film, was part of this group. Remarkable intelligence in the monster is now completely missing. - The riots that relate to the Soviets and Mobu have completely ripped out of the story. - These are just those unpleasant changes and the one I could remember from my hand (and a day later). Good: <br /> <br /> - After a 90-minute minute of pain and mental anxiety, the movie is over. I didn't hurt it, it didn't help: -Michael Ironside? Usually, I like him. The dog is still quite nice. <br /> <br /> --Wacky "absolutely 80" title screen. Bad: <br /> <br /> - Well, writing for one is extremely horrible. The direction is so half-decided that anyone who watches the film will feel superior to everyone not involved in it. The action is poor and weak, especially from Corey Haim. - Free, Weak, Diluted Story. Monster looks just pathetic, that is, when we are actually allowed to see a bloody thing. His head is excessively large, the yellow eyes that were so much part of the book in the book are not visible for more than two seconds. Instead of a slim, powerful, fast, intelligent killing machine, we have a drawer in an ugly monkey suit that is forced upon us. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no character development. Even violence and gore are done wrong, for f * ck sakes, this is HORROR !! Usually, violence is at least well done! Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The idea that Dean Koontz fired his brilliant novel to become this filthy piece of sh * t makes me dangerously close to vomiting all around me and anyone in my Surroundings. There are films worse than this (headache-inducing that thought may seem), but so far, just "Alien vs. Predator", at least for me, is more travesty and more painful disappointment. <br /> <br /> Memorable Scene: Track Credit Start. Acting: 3/10 Story: 4/10 (the novel was really good, it's just awful) Atmosphere: 5/10 Camera: 4/10 Evolution of the character: 1/10 Special effects / make-up up: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 0/10 Violence / Gore: 4/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 3/10 <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br / > <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I would recommend that no one ever watch this movie. a few extremely dying horror fans? and only if you haven't read the novel. Instead, I would recommend that all those interested in it avoid completely and buy / control / borrow a book. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
