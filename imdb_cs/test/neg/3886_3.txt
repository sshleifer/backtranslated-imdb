With Knightly and O'Tool as leaders, this film had good possibilities, and McCallum as a bad guy after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw him away on a silly evening call and later with the remnants of the war. It was, of course, superficial, beautiful English land and sea or not. Error number one was that in the movie he shot Knightly so early that she could play someone a few years older instead of choosing someone older ten years. play a role. They missed all the chances of a big conflict between cast and instead fooled into simple and cheap heart elements.
