Jawbreaking is the most vulnerable of all Italian genres, and director Joe D'Amato is in second place behind the brilliant Jess Franco in film production stakes. Put together two and what do you get? Of course, a huge piece of waste. Unfortunately, it is not even a waste in the good sense, because Deep Blood adds more boredom than it does in merriment. Actually, something bordering on the plot is trying to make the film; but take the credit away from the movie - the plot is waste. It has something to do with a group of friends who have an oath (friendship) and then an Indian curse that manifests itself as a shark. Or at least I think it's happening. But most of the film is boring with boring dialogue and "drama," and a shark that does not forget itself is the only thing we really want to see - it is only a role. Or even the fact that most sharks are actually footage! Despite being a garbage genre, there is actually a lot of fun. But with this, Joe D'Amato makes it clear that he can't bother to try, and the result is what must be the worst Italian movie shark ever. Avoid this tearing down.
