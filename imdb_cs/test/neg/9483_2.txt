the boys were the most pleasant things in the whole movie. The girls were lame and pathetic, I mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, studio studios, and feel this bomb from a distance? in order to get some responsibility, which I really do not see in punishment ..., they are sent to Paris, far from home, to live with the so-called strict grandfather who has an important position with Paris. I can't really remember what it was, so who's really old? detail doesn't help, girls are sent to Paris to learn something ... so what exactly are they learning when they meet two French guys and are able to manipulate a guy who should watch them to meet them on scooters? A typical pre-teen movie, having all the pre-teens who wish to be poorly behaved and able to afford a trip to Paris or some distant land far from their parents? I don't really like olsens anyway, they could never really shake the michelle image, the whole house ... in case you didn't see it, then you were lucky from the start. (F F-)
