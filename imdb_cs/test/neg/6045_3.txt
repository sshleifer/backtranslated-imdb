I saw this movie just a few days before Halloween 2004. I noticed it around noon and it was an interesting description in my menu so I decided to watch it. Seriously just a movie suitable only for late night television ... you know, after Conan, but before the infomercial sorta starts running. Although this movie has little to do with websites, it has a lot with spiders, a link to my header if you need an add-on. The idea behind the story I found absolutely fascinating. Hidden nuclear generator, scientist and credible portal ... It would be a good start to a fantastic fantasy, but then after 15-20 minutes going down the hill. The cast is bad, without remembering the show, a poor queen who has her breasts strengthened ... because the spiders carry the breasts. Like bad sound effects. Visible low budget movie, even though the cast tried. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> Four electricians came across a hidden nuclear generator while on the job. They play with buttons and open the portal. Two workers close to the portal to find out what's going on, the party still in our world looking for help while the other side is watching its surroundings. <br /> <br /> Help will not open the portal and follow a parallel-sized meeting. They encounter a race of human spiders called soldiers. After death and persecution, they are saved by the survivors. Now it's bored ... hiding, talking, trying to build another portal, then attacking the hive. After losing 2 more electricians, they opened the portal and escaped returning to our world ... 200 million years ago. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting?
