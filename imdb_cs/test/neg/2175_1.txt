This excruciatingly boring and unreal film made me think that Chaplin was a real Hitler, as only evil as he could torture people with this impertinence. I saw how this film was transformed, which only caused the suffering caused by this cruelty to be more serious. This film is nothing more than a pathetic, repetitive film that has caused two hours of suicidal urges instead of inducing two hours of laughter. After the first ten minutes, I wished the gas from the theater loudspeakers to leak gas. <br /> <br /> If I could give him ten out of ten, I'd like to do it. Avoid at all costs!
