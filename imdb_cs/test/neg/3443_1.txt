I honestly do not know why this exhibition lasted as long as possible. ah well, humor is subjective? But yeah, this is incredibly incredible when you ask me. Tim Allen is uncomfortable. Jill is uncomfortable. boys are uncomfortable. Al is uncomfortable. neighbor is uncomfortable. it's just more annoying than funny. The lands are all the same, Tim makes Jill mad and has to do things again. and in recent times? the less he said about them, the better, who the hell would he do cancer for a damn sitcom? Yeah, great idea. so yeah, home improvement isn't a very good sitcom. I would recommend you look at News Radio or Seinfeld. If I had to give this show rating I would give 1/10 to see it because it never made me laugh once. at all. Okay, it's still better than The Nanny.
