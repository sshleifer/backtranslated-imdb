35 years after this action was taken, Castro still rules. Unfortunately, we crawled scratching our heads wondering how dull-maniac played scenery-chewing Jack Palance did it until 1960. I came across it recently, and was amused to notice the incomparable Sid Haig and "B" movie favorite Paul (Untouchables ) Picerni among the insurgents. Apparently Fleischer was quite good at driving this folly. Some of these lines are classic in "Did he really say such a way?" Another thing I noticed is that score and sound (NO dialogue) are actually excellent - the only first-class elements of the entire production, so don't look at anything to learn about history or acting, but if you feel like that you watch it like goofy, bring beer and have fun.
