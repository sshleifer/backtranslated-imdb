Two films: "fifth element", "armageddon". Same theme: save the world. Same lead actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: "Armageddon" is very worse than Luc Besson's movie. Some spectacular special effects cannot hide the stressed and globally conventional scenario. Several parts of the film show it. I'm thinking about the President's speech and especially about Willis's relationship with his daughter "Grace." At the beginning of the film, she tends to neglect and overload her, which makes her tired. At the end of the film, there is true love and understanding. On the other hand, the film falls into the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the film is trying to be funny, but the result doesn't work because the humor introduced in the film is often rude and pretty low-level, while the "fifth element" was zany humor, involuntary and overlooked the serious side of action. The film suffers from two other disadvantages: it often falls into a ridiculous (Russian astronaut) and almost all actors are evil. Bruce Willis is the opposite of the "fifth element". He's playing the guy, he's gonna sit him down and sometimes he is unbearable. Other actors are barely credible in their own roles, especially Willis' sinking crew. This crew seems to be here just for fun. One of them is considered very skilled, but he looks crazy. And poor Liv Tyler! She's at NASA just to be decorative. When the film was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed fatigue from saving the world. His fatigue was probably justified by this magnificent but bad film.
