I'm sure some people will enjoy it and find it powerful, or have a personal relationship with characters and story, but it's not very well done from an unbiased perspective. The film revolves around atypical angst-ridden teenagers, each playing a different stereotype that makes us believe that this is what it is to be a teenager. We'll see a little lifestyle for each teenager, but the whole project seemed to be just as demanding, whether it is a constant low angle shot of tree branches in the wind, or black-and-white "interviews" with students, there was nothing new in this movie and nothing what I needed to see. Yes, he is dealing with some strong thematic material and dramatic scenes are played and behaved well, but the whole project seems unnecessary, especially when it is almost an exact replica to Van Sant's "Elephant" (one dealing with suicide, the other with a suicide) with school shooting). As I said, some people will probably enjoy it, and the director / writer clearly had some inspiration for this movie to be based on the death of a loved one, so it's nice that the movie was made with some heart in it, but it's incredibly inefficient and while working with a material that can be so clich√© easily to have something original with it. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
