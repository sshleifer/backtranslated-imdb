I thought this movie lacked the dramatic tension of the building that had the first movie. This is difficult to achieve when the film takes place during the week. The original film resulted in the final climate scene for one year and was still less violent than the sequel. One good thing about this movie was the movie went relatively fast because the plot seemed rushed. When Rachel's best friend died, there was no funeral in the film. Another downturn was Amy Irving's participation. All her scenes have reduced the pace of movies. The dialogue in this film was terrible. In no way does it reflect the way children talk. Finally, this movie could be a hit, but it broke up after the opening scene.
