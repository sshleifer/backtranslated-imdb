I consider Herzog's documentary work to be very uneven. Fata Morgana, a common composition for the lessons of darkness, lacks not only a harsh spectacle, but above all, the eye of the author. Compared to the amateur-looking, aimless pans left and right across the desert you would expect from any German camcorder-equipped tourist, the camera was leaving the car window, picking up all kinds of nonsensical images, wire fence, abandoned buildings, and dirt stains passing through the lens in random order, cut shots of sand dunes. In one place, Herzog meets a group of starved cattle that rot in the sand, but the picture is presented just like you and I, maybe worse, a camera looking at one hand from one cattle to another. For a documentary that seeks to be a visual holiday, a hypnotic, surrealistic trip in unexplored landscapes, it lacks the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author. It is everywhere, half carefree and tiring, Mayan creative myths voiced in the voice, then some other text of Herzog that has devoted himself to literature. It is not until the end that Fata Morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters. First with a man and a woman playing music in the room, a man singing in a distorted voice over a microphone, both of them apathetic in their task. Man picking up a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the country. Otherwise, it seems that this has very little to offer, or the visual beauty it offers.
