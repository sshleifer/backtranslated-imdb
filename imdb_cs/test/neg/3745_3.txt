It is unfortunate that many other critics of this film are influenced by previous prejudices. (ie, anger at gay characters, thinking French thrillers are bad, etc.) I admit that I do not know the novel, but as a film, after about 45 minutes, I rolled my eyes. Hopefully I can explain in writing my complaints eloquently enough before I get sick spending already on this movie for 2 hours its running length (2 hours that felt like 3), don't get me wrong, I can sit over an hour and a half silent movies, 3 hour epics, no short attention, nor so tired of mtv generations that i can't appreciate the gentle and slow building movie. here comes my complaints list. first, end. Yes, it had scooby-doo-esquire, the character explains everything at the end. I actually think of this movie, it was necessary .. the film had so many conspiracy-twists, emotional revelations, new facts of the finishes and were discovered .. one reviewer said it well: ".. eyes, that's a very logical story, but Without a very substantial story (children's stories, the relationship between the three parents, the relationship between the two lovebirds and the Big Man's son), it just doesn't feel well. But according to the reviews on here, there are a lot of people who seem to really love it, so I don't want to give anything away.I personally can't build soap operas. Until the end, I didn't really care! There were not necessarily any holes that could be observed, it seems that it could be a great book, it is absolutely logical in WRITING, but if I believe it e is a reality, something does not sit right with pieces that have been randomly inserted. Too often, I felt that the key figures that we have never been able to know, were thrown into further complicate the plot, raise emotions and develop a secret. I did not have any complaints, directing, eh, not bad, but the conspiracy, and especially its development, is NORTH. I apologize to those who felt it was a perfect thriller, but I couldn't get into it. I gave it 3 simply because I don't want to look absolutely unfair, and it had moments of mild intrigue and excitement. MAJOR SPOILER * and I must mention it .. but when my father makes his appearance to alexandra and just when you think the plot could not fit into another twist ... "your dad didn't" die in a hunting accident ".. I ALMOST DIED .. when was my father ever developed or even really mentioned a lot in the back story?! do you mean it! like already a complicated plot that includes characters from all families and their relationship, not enough! ! The protagonist needs another emotional whale more than he has already been fed?! Sorry that I had to throw such a spoiler, but that bothered me as much as I ever bothered in any movie.
