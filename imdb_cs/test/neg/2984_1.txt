I saw the movie last night and I almost screamed. No, it wasn't because I was completely petrified, no. It was absolutely HORRENDOUS! Sometimes you see movies that interest you in the near future - this film is one of them. It's like being a writer, actor, director and co. They just met and copied and pasted the scenes of their favorite horror movies, beeped it all together and said, "Hey, this is Satan's whip !!!" After seeing this movie, I couldn't help but be tortured by the eyes of people called "actors"; waltzing around like it was some talented art interpreter ... don't be fooled by that suck! Don't bother wasting your time or money !!!
