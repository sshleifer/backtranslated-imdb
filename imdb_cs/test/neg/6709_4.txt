Making a movie boring is not something I would usually count as a valid criticism. However, when the film is ruthlessly made from spare parts from other films that were not so good to start with, and is slow as molasses without real reward, I think it is fair to call a spade spade. And the Ghost is a very boring movie. The film, which is about as original as its name, the Ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia being chased by a spirit that holds the secret of her past. It is only much more complicated and less interesting than one would think. The plot line is almost incomprehensible to most of the image, and the hook, an element of amnesia, just makes it worse. No one, including the screenwriter and director, seems to have any idea what the hell is going on at the moment. Instead they chose to do as roughly the amount to the movie equivalent of the clip show sitcom. There are scenes taken directly from the Ring, Dark Water, Shutter, Grudge series, and Pulse Fuss for good measurements. Worse yet, half a dozen women keep all the clothes and read their lines in a similar way, making it impossible to discern. There is nothing to understand with this movie. The story is not so well thought out. Amnesia trick is lazy. The mysterious element is unclosed and processed with little grace. The characters never draw anything, all the information is being passed through the lead, remembering her past whenever it is suitable for conspiracy. The camera, full of reflections and shots of water, at least attempts to add to the subtext, a thematic connection with amnesia, and a final twist (which I don't reveal) is nice, but often exaggerated. Even the score feels borrowed and clich√©. Worst of all, the incitement to curse is not very interesting and the last twist is predictable and lame. "Wait, you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen, but seems to have nothing to do with the plot, will eventually come back? No!" Viewers are too subtle for this kind of audacity. Anyone who has seen any of the movies that turn off the rips will find very little to keep up with this feature. I thought Shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap (remake of his grudge movie not less than 5 times), but also his second speed work as a reincarnation, a movie that I couldn't bring even to the end is a mile before this. <br /> <br /> Visit www.collider.com for more reviews
