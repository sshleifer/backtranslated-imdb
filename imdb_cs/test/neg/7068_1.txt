This film has no heart and no soul; it is an attempt to exploit the cult film from other, better, directors, especially David Lynch and Tim Burton. It seems that Rifkin thinks that if he overloads some sort of rotten visual style and fills the street with cross and garbage, he makes a statement. But it's not a statement about anything - except the director's screaming scream "HEY LOOK AT ME! However, he has no idea of ​​the artist, just a good memory for things that have worked - for example, some actors who have been imprisoned in this matter - for other directors. All this would be almost acceptable if this film was not a turgical, boring chore to sit.
