If you've never read a book and never want to read it in the future, go ahead and watch the movie (6/10). It's a nice fantasy movie with great CGI, nice acting, beautiful surroundings and an above-average fantasy story. <br /> <br /> If you read the book like me about ten or more and I really love it, don't wait too much (or better: don't expect anything at all). The story is completely different from the original book. This may explain that the film is chosen 1/10 from people around 40 or more (like me) and much better from people who most likely never read the book and expect nothing. Most differences between film and book are not really necessary and setup (in my opinion, much worse): <br /> <br /> - The magic in the book works with rituals for classic magic effects. (Changing weather, creating illusions, transforming into animals, ...) In the film, magic is rather "jedi-school for the Middle Ages" (TM) (wooden sticks instead of light swords). That the devil looks like emperor palpatine (after Part III) doesn't mean it's really better. In the book, the story is located near Dresden, which Krabat once visits with his master and also visits some nearby villages for festivities. (This section could be changed to reduce costs.) I also don't understand why the mill is in the hills while the nearby cemetery is in the high mountains. <br /> <br /> The whole neighborhood is an average run of medieval mill-style fantasy. There's plenty of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not proper kitchens, just very rough houses. The book has never designed such an environment. - In the book, the master tries to make Krabat his successor, but Krabat refuses. Krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the film Krabat, the master always refuses openly as a stubborn schoolboy. The film takes place in 1647 instead of 1720. This makes it impossible for a master to tell some stories of his youth about 170 times. Well, the stories in the movie are missing. Some of the explanations given in the book would be useful and not worth so many minutes: <br /> <br /> - In the book, all daytime work is easy and night work is like normal work. This explanation is missing in the film. Sometimes the boys sweat and sometimes they are happy. - The book explains why only a few "Gesellenes" try to face a master: If a master dies for some worldly reasons, "Gesellen" is to free and maintain their magical powers. If a master dies in confrontation, they all lose their power forever.
