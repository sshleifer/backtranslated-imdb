This is an adaptation of Edith Wharton's work, whose writing is amazing. Sadly, this film will never shake the feeling that these 20th-century people have misunderstood 19th-century repression and despair that Wharton's work shows. Ward and Dalton are not so bad, but the wooden performance of Alicia Witt made me blink. She was supposed to play on the restless element of the story, but the long film character was like a stick, and I never believed a word from my mouth. When she asked Sela Ward, "Why can't I move you?" at the end of the movie I couldn't help but the answer: "That's what I was thinking about last hour and a half !!!"
