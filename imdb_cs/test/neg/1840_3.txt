The Doll Master is an example of a miserable horror movie, somewhere in space with its two not so well established genres, a horror film and an emotional dramatic film. Looks like Doll Master is trying very hard to be a very scary horror movie, but he won't. The noise of dolls while moving is similar to that taken from Kayako in Ju-Onu and walks are like sadako esquire. Killing dolls will remember the cute version of "Chucky". But compared to a child's game, this movie is more great. However, the story seems to be nothing, the brilliant shots of the camera and the brilliance of acting have been eliminated by the cause of the conspiracy. Don't look at it if you expect big shocks.
