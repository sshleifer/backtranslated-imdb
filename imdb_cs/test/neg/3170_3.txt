Usually, I don't consider turning off a movie unless it's really bad. Homegrown is a movie that I wish I wouldn't even turn on. The storyline is interesting, but playing and writing are too low. I didn't care about the characters. Any film that has drug use and unjustified nudity as its peak is not worthy of praise. The characters spent their time believing it to be the only way to sit in this movie.
