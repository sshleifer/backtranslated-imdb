So I was when I went out of this "movie" (staggered). I couldn't leave because it was at the film festival and the cinema was full of people. I got stuck in the middle. Caught. <br /> <br /> A small fragment of the original shot, which tried to tie this film together, contains some of the worst actors ever on the big screen. The daughter was an excellent performer - she excelled in the wrong way. The movie scene was horrible, consisting of incoherent frames and the strangest lighting conditions I witnessed. <br /> <br /> As for stock footage ... at first ... <br /> <br /> Wait. Why did I view this movie? Why do I recognize his existence? Please don't look at it. Do something useful with two hours of your life and go look for some dry color.
