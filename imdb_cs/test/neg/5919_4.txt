I'm a movie collector with Mrs. Weaver, so I bought it just because she's in it. I find it really strange that her early career is full of so many horrible movies. She started with an incredible promise at Alien, but then she had bombs. These bombs include this movie, Deal of the Century, One Woman or Two, and Half Moon Street. She also appeared in The Year of Life dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than remarkable. In the time between Alien and his 1986 sequel, Aliens, the only film she made was worth something was Ghostbusters. Before the release of the strangers, I'm sure they all thought the woman was on her way out. Fortunately, it wasn't. But back to the Eyewitness, the film is boring. This does not cause any tension. William Hurt looks like a cardboard stand and the atmosphere is just dry. Sigourney is decent, but nothing worth remembering. Watch this movie if you have to, but don't go with the expectations of a decent movie. Watch better movies with these two stars like Random Tourist and Working Girl.
