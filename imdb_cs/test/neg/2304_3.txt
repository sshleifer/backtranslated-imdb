The idea of ​​having Dionne Warwick sing for this film adaptation of Jacqueline Susann's best-selling book ("Valley of the Dolls") ... though it's really bad, this sudser doesn't have Neely O'Hara Patty Duke to make the story appear. "The Love Machine" is inexorably boring. Even the last battle (with an academic prize as a combat title!) Can't save her. Dyan Cannon seems embalmed in her heavy make-up pancake and cumbersome fall (although her tiny, tanned figure is the beauty to be seen), John Phillip Law is a block of wood, David Hemmings embarrassed in gay fashion as beautiful photographer. And where is Robin Stone at the end? Is he on the waterfront to pick up some sailors? After Cannon expelled his manhood, it would be a safe bet. In that case, "Love Machine - The Final Episode" might be more interesting. It is certainly better than the visual opera. * 1/2 from ****
