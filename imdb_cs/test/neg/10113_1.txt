I don't even understand what they were trying to achieve with this movie, I mean, really. You got the guy running away from a pile of cats because he's dead, but to be really dead, the girl has to shoot them? And they leave the corpse, even if normal people don't see them because of their dead? The script already has a Nebraska-sized hole, then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno, who casts herself into her lines in a monotonous, boring voice, and has so few emotions on her face that she can play just like a female robot terminator. It's totally awful and I don't even understand how I managed to see it until the end of the movie. The end is just as stupid as the whole movie you think and absolutely no reward for the viewer, what ever. They could also call this movie a "little movie that choo-choo ka-choo."
