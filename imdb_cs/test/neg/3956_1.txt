I didn't laugh at the theater in those years. The only problem is that it wasn't the intention of the movie to make my throat raw from laughter. This movie is totally overflowing with bad CGI, absolutely horrible duologue, absolutely horrible * gaming * and pretty geek links to make the whole thing happen as nothing but complete cheese. As a player and geek-type girl herself, I have acknowledged all the obvious references to games in this movie, as well as geek STUFF, who has just been thrown into the background as eye candy (Poster of Steamboy, T-shirt from Thinkgeek. com and j-list.com), and who did not buy the movie at all. The only thing that could be good for EVERYTHING was the ghosts of children who were deliberately poorly made in CGI to look like they were out of the game, and were OBSERVERALLY stolen from Japanese horror movies . To be honest, it was cheerfully bad and something I'd expect from the midnight show of Sci-Fi, which was made for television on TV. film. Don't wait more than that and you'll have a great time. Don't get soda or spit it everywhere you get great lines like: "Why did you bring this game into our lives?! WHY?!"
