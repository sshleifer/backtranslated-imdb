Everything about this movie is terrible. During the first five minutes you can say that this film will be terrible. However, you cannot measure how bad it will be. We'll start a movie with a seemingly endless intro scene with gay music support and no dialogue. Having a camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals does not evoke the slightest emotion. What then seems to be one of two separate stories. The first half of the film consists of wogs going around competing in paid, midnight matches with other ethnic groups. Of course, Wogs always win because they obviously raise weights and have "respect". It is in these scenes that we first get to see the level of gambling, editing, scripting and hatred of the people who funded the film. Finally, the main character and his friend are sent to jail. The whole prison section of the film is not related to what I consider a conspiracy, and consists of a lot of struggles. Once in jail (3 years for murder?) The main character and his friend come to terms with wogs. They then go on "the other side of the city" and try to lie low because apparently everyone wants to kill them. Early wogs prepare to rape another gang member members, and run around the city battling hordes of different gangs. This point of the film can be compared to an arcade game because the Wogs simply run and fight against enemies who seem worse and worse as the film goes on. The climate battle scene in which the remaining wogs (two main characters) are on every gang that fought so far. Other gangs do not seem to have a problem unifying themselves with other remaining wogs (Asians don't mind skinheads). After about a million other people, the invincible wog brothers are defeated, the film ends with the main characters heading home. However, they do not do it at home because they are burned to death by a thousand angry film critics who storm the set and leave angry letters everywhere. This movie may be more like a computer game then a movie because it would explain how two guys can take a million people into the face of a million people who most of the time are twice the size of theirs. There are also tons of stupid inexplicable events in this movie, such as Asian fighting off your own gang and taking a katana to the head just to get the wogs out. Like someone else mentioned, this movie isn't so bad its funny, it's just so bad.
