I've heard this movie is stylish and interesting, but I just found it unpleasant. It's been a long time since I saw it (and hopefully I won't find that all my memories are bad and that I condemned the film unfairly), but I remember that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victims of anti-homosexual society, and that somehow caused their terrible crime. I totally disagree with this view and I think it is unfair to both homosexuals and Bobby Franks, the real victim of the story. I can't imagine why anyone would want to claim the two as martyrs. I also thought L&L was portrayed as a little more sophisticated than they really were - after all, they were teenagers who lived at home. The film places them in a fantasy world that looks like Morrissey should score. I just read an interview with one of the filmmakers who suggested the film anachronism, such as the button phones that used characters, meant "adding a Brechtian distance". Certainly they do, but it seemed to me that it was very annoying. Many people seem to find this film interesting, but I would prefer a less "stylish" and more realistic exploration of homosexuality. maybe they played in the case of Leopold & Loeb.
