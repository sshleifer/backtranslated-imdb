Despite John Travolta's testimony in interviews that he was his favorite role in his career, "Be Cool" proves to be a disappointing sequel to 1995's funny and clever "Get Shorty". Travolta delivers a pleasant performance in this mildly entertaining movie, but in the end the film falls flat due to underdeveloped conspiracy, unlikely characters, and the surprising lack of chemistry between lead Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there are some laughs, this unfair dialogue example (which has often appeared in trailers) kind of says it all: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hey, I'm from Brooklyn. The film suggests that everyone in the entertainment industry is a gangster or is trying to be one of them. In "Get Shorty", the gangster's assumption was "legitimate" in getting into movies, a clever fish idea, but in "Be Cool", biz seems to have been completely twisted since then. The film is interestingly cast and the absolute highlight is "monolgue", released by The Rock, whose character is both an ambitious actor and a goon, where he re-enactes the scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst of "Bring it. he thinks he is black and he is often seen dressed as a pimp - it was pretty funny in the first scene that takes him and gets tired and embarrassing almost immediately afterwards. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Be Cool" may be worth for it to rent John Travolta die-hards (of which I am one) but you may want to keep your finger close to the fast forward button to get through it without feeling that you are wasting your time. in fact, wanting to avoid this problem because the continuation lacks most of the things that made it a winner, and I rate this film as a rough 4/10.
