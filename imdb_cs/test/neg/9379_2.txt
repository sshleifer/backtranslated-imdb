I will be honest and say that I have given up observation somewhere in the middle of the road and then, with a few breaks, quickly moved forward. then I came back here and read many of the reviews already made .... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me, and I can't help it, but this cartoon for North America seems to make sense "Let them be saved" and Iraq will come to it immediately. it seems to me that this is a justification, or a part, for another "good intentions" invasion. A lady with me seems to be a devoted person and I sincerely pissed at her portrait of trying to arouse compassion and "feeling" for her. in this case it would never have happened, because just as the history teacher mentioned here, I need to know how her family was so rich that she managed to keep it (if both sides were playing?) Paris !? If it was done after a biography of a poor girl, I would see that I have some emotions. but as it stands + its timing release it's just pure movie propaganda; Even worse because of his caricature, it overlaps the "soft" side tings too well for his own good to be taken seriously. besides, there are clich√©s about homosexuals. well, a woman who fights against the victory of her rights should not have at least some sympathy for those who are subjects of society like her ??? the message is obvious from the perspective of the ruling class member. I give him only 2 stars because of his production and related stuff. Apparently, the propaganda film has interests in convincing manipulations with my thoughts, and therefore it is generally well done to appeal to certain visual emotions that I cannot deny.
