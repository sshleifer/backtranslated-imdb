Actually, I was looking forward to this movie. The ads made him look really cool and packed with action. And I heard Claire Daines' character was arrested for assault, so I thought she could kick a lot of ass and that would be fine. BUT NOOOOOOOO !!. Their barely any action at all and the character was a bit bland. The only saving grace was Omar Epps, and even this film didn't help much.
