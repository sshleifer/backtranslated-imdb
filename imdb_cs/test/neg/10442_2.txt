Now from all the shark movies I've seen, this will take the cake! The plot of the film was good, but the excitement got a little bit. Antonio Sobato, Jr., has an outstanding role as the son who is looking for a shark who has killed his father. Megaldon is one of the greatest sharks of all and the most dangerous. The view of the shark was really scary at some angles, but the effects were blurred and the scenes were somewhat weak in some places. With mini-sub weapons that would take out a whole shark school. It was great that the son would get revenge on this monster, though it would also cost him his life. How do they say revenge is worth, but was it worth it? This answer could go on and on, and the film was a long delay. The start was fine and at the end he went like Titanic. 1 of 5 STARS!
