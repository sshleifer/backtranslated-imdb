Just like the French, Tedium can do it. For the first time I checked my watch for 7 minutes and, with 143 minutes, I was also thinking of leaving. I will not even try to discuss the mismatch of "conspiracy" or the inability of characters to be personal, because in about 1 hour I realized that none of this was important. It wasn't just confident or conceited, it was a vacuum. Soul Sucking Vacuum. This film has no saving grace, no pleasant character, nothing fun and nothing sad. He's not smart enough to be a drama, and that's not a moment to be a little far away. The most interesting thing about this movie is how he managed to get mostly shining and positive reviews. These reviews have deceived me, but you don't have to be, a gentle reader. I just want three hours back for Christmas.
