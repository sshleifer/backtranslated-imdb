I am a fan of several holiday movies, but when the movie series goes from big screen to TV, you know it's from steam. Made for TV National Lampoon movies don't do well on TV. This film is another reason. I think many of us were thrilled when it came out, but we also had to face reality ... it's a TV movie. Randy Quaid is fine as cousin Eddie, but he has a better role than the leader. Dana Barron sets history as the first actor to survive his role as one of Griswold's children. It's just as pretty, but not even a thin script. Why was this movie even created? Probably because NBC recently picked up a couple more years of X-mas Vacation. There is nothing wrong with acting. It's all in the script. It's not so fun. People have to think before they write such things. It's one Christmas movie that I don't recommend.
