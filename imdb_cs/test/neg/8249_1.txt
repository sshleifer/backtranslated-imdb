Sappy. I liked the way they went to "Haaavaad baaa" to quote books to themselves to impress the ugliest girl there. Probably a janitor at my school is a genius too, but waiting for a landing that big job. Just because you get your nose on grindstone, there's no reason to try to cut the steak with it.

Robin Williams can't paint and keep good books on the top shelf. And there's a professor who always wears a priest's scarf.
