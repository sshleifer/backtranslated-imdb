For me, Bollywood movies are generally not much, although they are still in great demand and Bollywood is a big file maker because they have their own fans. The only motive that followed me was to find out to what extent an American actress could change or influence the logic underlying the Indian film. Not only did this not change the film's story, but even this blending caused some ridiculous series of events. movies. But as soon as you find that such incidents have happened to the American, you laugh. For God, you might think that a famous American actress was stuck in a desperate situation and felt helpless. You can imagine that an American actress falls in love with a dance instructor whose fianc√©e has already fallen in love with an American friend and has met. There were a lot of similar things to mention. The less they said, the better. Maybe I was wrong when I was expecting too many Indian movies.
