It's a horrible movie. that is the past mute. First, the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what they like. they are in 7th grade. I'm not saying I'm prude or anything, but it sends a bad news to girls of all ages. to be nice and popular is not everything. But that's what twins are doing. The land is even worse. The girl's grandfather is just the ambasitor (sp?) To France. He has an associate who looks around Paris and meets two "cute French boys" with motorcycles. they ridicule them to meet boys, they really like ETC ..... they meet the supermodel in the process and go around Paris with quite unknown people they think are cute. do I need to say more? This movie can be up to 8 and 9 years old. twins play ditsy losers who want lovers. It makes sending bad idea to girls. the film itself is not big. I do not recommend this to anyone. I give passport to Paris 2/10
