This film was one of the few that actually caused me. Anyone who thinks it would be fun to see his mother make a totally ridiculous dance in an utterly misleading effort to be "sideways" (in age language) could please him. Ingrid Bergman's vision of such a pitiful disco performance was difficult to follow. I was embarrassed. To make matters worse, the music at the disco wasn't realistic at all - it's a false idea of ​​a Hollywood director about what pop music was at the time. It is always total embarrassment in most films of that era - ersatz music is conserved and carries only painful, passing resemblance to music that was actually popular in the 1960s. Mathau is hopelessly mistaken as some ladies man; it looks just exuberantly grotesque. Hawn's wide-eyed innocence is too stupid. A handsome neighbor in his apartment is shown too seriously and seriously. It looks like a Brady boy who got lost in this farce. Painful, pitiful mess.
