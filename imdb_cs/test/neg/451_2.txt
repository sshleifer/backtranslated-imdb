To be fair, I haven't seen a lot of this show. Probably because it wasn't as good as the original M * A * S * H, but I seem to remember them moving around the weekly schedule. Some shows are just not worth the trouble of following around every week. But at first I tried it, so it wasn't bad. Maybe I was just expecting it to improve, but I can't give this show 1. In all honesty, I can't give anything more than 2. <br /> <br /> It wasn't MASH (I won't always write you stupid *). And he tried to be an MASH without making any effort as if it were magical. Well guess what? No magic. The best thing I can do is to compare it with other shows. Trapper John, M.D. was a much better show. But they should have called it B.J. Hunnicut, M.D., because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an older BJ, but nothing like Trapper John. Keep everything else the same, just change its name and show name. Fast! After the MASH was not the only continuation to completely bomb and dishonor the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame following All In The Family. Did he have no heart, no conflict, no depth? all the things that made All In the Family so memorable. Similarly, MASH was funny because doctors responded to the impossible absurdity of war. Remove the war and remove the disk for 99% humor. Potter can't scream at Klinger because he's wearing clothes because the Klinger isn't wearing clothes because he's not trying to get out of the army because he's out of the army because the war's over. (Breathe) All jokes were forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the viewer to stay and watch the show. And from what I remember, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy, who stood there unnaturally, faced the viewer as a trio of Vaudeville artists. It reminded us of the Good Times, where they spent 90% of the show standing behind the couch and chatting with the audience, trying to make it look like they had a natural conversation. They weren't. And it was even less natural for After MASH. Another random tidbit I remember that the people who made the MASH have never received any spin-off royalties. The studio used an absurd apology that After MASH was really the spin-off movie MASH (which they owned) and not the TV series. Nice try, but Mulcahy was the only one in three in the movie, and he was never deaf. I think studio execs will do something for a buck. Anything other than making a worthwhile sequel is.
