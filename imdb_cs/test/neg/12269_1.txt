I love watching Australian movies, but this smoking pile of crap was just embarrassed. The DVD cover looked promising, but you know what they say, it doesn't evaluate the DVD by its cover. I also noticed that he won the best actor for the price, but the competition had to be really bad because the acting in this movie is pathetic. The director seemed to think he had enough talent to manage and act when he really had to focus on one part of the filmmaking and get it right before it was too thin. The music was pretty common. The story really didn't go anywhere. It was just a series of struggles linked to a bad script and a kitschy dialogue. But I'll tell all the beginning filmmakers. Watch this movie. This will give you hope that your film will win something at a festival. However, it is good to get there and go. I hope they have learned some lessons and their next business is a little better.
