Would you be surprised to see my ears and eyes almost watching and listening to this horrible movie? My eyes almost bleed from watching a horrible animation and a mysterious empty story. The ears almost crept out of listening to songs that sounded like they were sung by the monkey monkeys. Then my brain almost melted because this film doesn't have enough intelligence. It's formulating every step on the road. Talking animals are one thing, but a penguin that can only fly to "fulfill dreams" schtick? Show more faith in children's intelligence, please. Besides Rock-A-Doodle, it's one of Blut's worst.
