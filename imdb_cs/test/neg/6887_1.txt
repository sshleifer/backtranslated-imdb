I think that when people say it's beautifully filmed, they talk about the close-ups of frogs and cooking food. It certainly does not apply to a file that seems to be made up of about 3 rooms without external shots at all. Also, it is all too close up. ? Some rough look at least the way this movie is displayed - one of them would be a lot of not a dozen or more. girls with a perfect handsome rich man who spends all day playing the piano (He's cultivated). Pretty maid steals him as a banned green mango fruit. Deeply. Except for a few pretty tight shots, this movie is a bagpipe. It's a kind of soap opera with dialogue. It's covered. How beautiful is it? The set looks completely fake. No, don't make the mistake I made and I rent it because someone recommended it. I expected beautiful shots from the coastal mountains of Vietnam or something I heard was a visual jewel. I also like foreign films that prefer them. But this movie is stupid and boring. He'll let you upset that something like that has won a lot of prizes.
