Hilarious!! I'd swear it was Ed Wood. Grapes. I loved every picture. Bad movie fan, that's your trophy! I'll watch it again. Words can't explain how fun this movie is. Pare's career must be submerged, but I think it's heading to Leslie Nielson. He was perfect for that. Terrible, just awful! You'll love it !! Take some friends, lots of beer and you will have the time of your life. It's the MST3000 page that waits for it to happen. Enjoy!! It's worth the rental! You like the "Colombo" policeman and the comic book coroner. The bad one will have a laugh on the floor. He is also in another Pare movie, Komodo vs. Cobra, and is just as good there. I don't know what that budget was, but get it back because this film is destined to be the best unintended comedy of the year.
