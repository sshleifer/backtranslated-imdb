When I watched this movie, I might have thought it would be better, but after 20 minutes I couldn't watch it anymore. I don't want to waste too much on this line, but it's actually a complete waste of time. All the actors say it's like this. If you're still looking at it, don't say I didn't warn you. Maybe if you're a hooligan or something, you might think it's a tribute to your hobby. The film is a term that encompasses individual films, the area of ​​film as an art form and the film industry. Movies are produced by recording images from the world with cameras, or by creating images using animation techniques or special effects. .
