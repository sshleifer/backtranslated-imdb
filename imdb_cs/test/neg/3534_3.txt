That's Wes Craven at his worst! this is the worst horror, if you can call it horror, you will ever watch, from one of the horror masters Wes Craven, poor director, poor acting, poor set, poor atmosphere it's the biggest pile of garbage ever! the bad guy is utterly unconvincing, you can't excuse him! Gore, and the horror involved in the movie is ridiculous, it's just plain waste! The only good points I can think of are: The Natasha Stars Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriksen, but not even the cast, could prevent it from getting out of control and into one of the worst horrors ever. If you don't watch it yet, don't bother, you'll just hate it.
