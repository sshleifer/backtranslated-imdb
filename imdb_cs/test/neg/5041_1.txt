there is only a way to describe this film. so bad his hilarious. <br /> <br /> Acting is so bad I laughed my ass all over. The male lead in this film trying to use a gun is so ridiculous that you think he's trying to copy an action figure with a toy, I know it sounds ridiculous, but if you see it yourself, you can't help but agree. > <br /> The monster looks like a guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in old Sinbad movies. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this movie is only good for one thing that is really a big laugh as bad movies can get. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the wrong bad script and special effects go wrong <br /> <br /> THIS IS YOU FILM FOR YOU
