OK - I just gave him "3" just because they didn't seem to have the money to do this movie, but I feel that it might deserve the "2.3" rating he had when I came here. In fact, I help to increase his rating, despite the fact that I was bored for the last hour and a half. I save "1" and "2" for higher budget bullshit pieces. At least the creators of "Rise of the Undead" didn't waste so much money. I managed to waste 90 minutes of my life. The film is too claustrophobic for me. The whole film takes place in the same building, in dark rooms and corridors. With such a setup, there should be more actions or character development, but there are plenty of nonsensical conversations. I didn't know any of the characters. There is a schoolgirl and a Goth chick, but we never learn more about them. None of the characters seem sympathetic. <br /> <br /> A horrible zero-budget movie. No scary special effects. No tension. Really nothing interesting here, people. I admit I pulled it off the net. It was free, but I'm throwing it away. <br /> <br /> Sorry to the filmmakers. Better luck next time. This one is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.
