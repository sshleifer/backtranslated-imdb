The title leads viewers to believe that it is a fun movie that looks and probably much better when it is being watched, but it is not good at all. One fifteen-minute sequence with Jack Black, who plays beautifully one of his songs and stumbles over the acid when he embarked on the forest, does not store this film at all. Every actor in this movie went on to do better things besides the main girls that I couldn't think of one movie where I saw them before. I hate bash movies, but I also hate that I can't find anything decent in movies. The film is sad, not too funny and had such potential with its amazing cast. If it was redesigned and written, it could be amazing. If you want a good movie to be stoned, look at your grandmother's boy, or half baked or dazed and confused, but this is not a movie that should be seen at all.
