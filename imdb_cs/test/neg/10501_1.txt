So, this is the WORST movie you will probably see. It's there with "Crossbones" and "Southern Comfort", but if your a bad movie fan like me, this cruelty movie will be the funniest you had in years. Why does the camera make old-fashioned kung fu sounds when it approaches? Why does this casual guy in the bag take a nascar plaque? And who is it? Why do vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is it? Mountaineer? Dracula McCloud? Who cares! Just laugh at it. This film has no continuity, no conspiracy, nothing, really. The range of emotions Ron Hall is always gone. He looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. The rest of the crew couldn't get out of the paper bag. Special effects ("Short bus") are randomly placed and never need. Most scenes are illuminated by a table lamp if it is lit at all. Mel Novak has AUDACITY to look at the camera and it's not even modified. They just keep shooting. In fact, half of this film is not on film at all. It's 1/2 film, 1/2 sony hand-cam. For most of the movie, they seem to have left their mike boom at home. This movie doesn't just have a few holes, it's my field of confusion and mental pain! But I love it! Thank you Ron Hall, for this film abomination. I went out and bought it because it's so damn funny. ($ 1.99 on Amazon, and I added a rush!) <br /> <br /> "I have guns! I have guns! I have WEAPONS!"
