Picking it up with the rest of the Marx Brothers box, I find myself disappointed most of all at the Night at the Opera. This stinking is the worst I've ever seen of them, with clever lines left out and characterization woeful. The playwright is so obscene in this game that it's hard to deal with the TV and try to strangle him. Marx seem to do better when they are perishable from the outside and are much better off when they have a good gag or at least two. All the material is probably written for anyone and it is a waste of Marx's talent. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
