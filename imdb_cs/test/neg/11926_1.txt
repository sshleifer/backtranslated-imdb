Right up (or down) with toys and Jurassic Park 2 and phantom threat. The assumption was cold, some ads looked semi-promising, but unfortunately the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat footage, and it was shown on a small screen 30 seconds slot. <br /> <br /> If you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and versatile snoozefest by all means of watch it. The plot is recycled sci-fi feed. Too bad too, because I thought it would be bad, but hope. It could be the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line - Don't Play It. Of course, if you don't like any of the above 3 movies.
