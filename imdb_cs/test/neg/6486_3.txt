An interesting assumption, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd like to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flip together, talking about furious cheekbones!). The soundtrack wasn't terrible either. But playing - even those professionals like Drago and Debbie Rochon - was horrible, keeping the worse (perhaps contributing to the former), the chimpanzee dialogue, and the camera barely tolerable. Yet, they were SETS that have a large "10" on my "oy-vey" scale. I don't know where it was filmed, but I was to guess it would be either an open-air museum or one of those rediscovered villages where everything is just a little too well maintained than to design a "real old west". Okay, so it was shot on a university budget. This means I could forgive one or two of the above errors. But taking everything together and being generous, I couldn't see it was more than three stars.
