I couldn't believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors appearing in this terrible effort that should never have been done. The plots are terrible, and the dialogue embodies (initially I thought it was a spoof) and an acting abysmal. Everything about it is bad, from cheap sets to fake scenery, an increased number of images. Respectful filmmakers are trying to get their vision right, but this blasphemous, pathetic, miserable attempt at a mini-series does it for our television, with three Oscar winners doing appearances. I can only guess that everyone involved has somehow hurt the writer and director and were forced (possibly at the shooting range) to play in this worthless garbage.
