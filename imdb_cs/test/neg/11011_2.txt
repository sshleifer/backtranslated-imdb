For me, this movie was simply confusing, slow and uninteresting. Why did the aliens decide to communicate through ants? It makes no sense. The end was confused and made no sense at all. Finally, I was hoping the ants would kill everyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. Even MST3K couldn't save it.
