A spacecraft in an unspecified future, where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser weapons for weapons, falls on a strange young planet where dinosaurs have also accidentally evolved, and only in this world has not disappeared yet. The survivors of the crash, roughly ten bland characters wearing blue, white and yellow suits, are fighting to survive against alien prehistoric monsters. "Dinosaur Planet" is a special movie. As I mentioned in my summary above, stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colored actors. Models are coarse but effectively animated. And they are much more fascinating and interesting than these characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and talking lines from a script that had to be written overnight without a single revision. Most of the budget was probably put into the dinosaurs, and although there is a fair share of them, there is not enough to save us from our boredom. These human figures are there just to scream, run around, and murmur these poorly written and sharp survivals. And unfortunately, not enough of them eat dinosaurs. Overall, "Dinosaur Planet" is not a movie I would like to see again. Some people just love it for being so cheap and so poorly made. Sometimes I like these movies. But this film is too long, too boring and very exhausting.
