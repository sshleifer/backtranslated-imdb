Great performances, great production values, good direction. But the script starts with great stimulation and interest in the first half and then breaks down in the second half. In the first half, we are clearly aware of character and motivation, but the other half leaves many questions unanswered. The conflicts are convincing, but the follow-up is weak. For example, we are very clear that Rudyard Kipling is a pro-war, but we do not know whether this philosophical attitude changes throughout the film. This is the image that makes me want to see the facts in the historical books. I don't feel like I can count on a movie to get a clear idea. The depiction of the war itself is cordially accurate, although the lack of enthusiasm of women does not reflect the war hysteria that swept Britain at that time. Maybe it's historically accurate; Just like in this movie, I just don't know.
