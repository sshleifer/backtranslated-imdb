This film was so bad, I don't know where to start, probably not the filmmakers. It starts with a guy in his mid-thirties until the 1940s watching television. The report tells the story of a corn maze that is open for Halloween. He has a "vision" of God who knows what and rushes to save his children, who go to the corn maze and are somehow associated with this "vision" How do you ask? I don't know, and as I said, the filmmakers. They are simply visions of people's feet. How did he get to these "visions"? It is never explained, we should go with it. He enters the maze to find his two daughters, who are lost inside, and twice the girls who are walking behind him, actually get to him once. What does? Are they following them? No. He is standing there like an idiot who calls them when they have just run around. Girls stopping? No. They run and ask, "Was it Dad?" Then someone dressed as a demon jumps to a "star" (daddy character) who beats him in a pathetic struggle just to find out he's an employee of a haunted maze. The police are called and after finding a "star" (which is a really bad term to use) to be a husband. They pull their hands in front of them so that they can find something they can choose the lock he does. First, anyone who has ever been arrested knows that cops will grab their hands behind their backs, and secondly, why this "average guy" knows how to choose a lock on handcuffs? But eventually he gets away from the cops who give up and leave after the "star" wife issues the siren in the police car as a distraction. By the way, it's now night time, and all the maze workers seem to have after sunset. Leaving a man who attacked one of his workers and two missing children in a maze. Since it was a slow night, it's their only customers, why not. The cops seem to have a better job. By the way, the "star" that goes by the name "Walker" will find it to be his surname, a name in which his wife even calls him. He knows that there is something buried in the middle of this cornfield maze and begins to dig. I say 'somehow' because I couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place. Find a locket, what does that mean? Nothing to watch, but for him it's some kind of trace to crime. Someone killed his children in his "vision" and I think that's what's going on, real detective work. And now he knows that there is a free killer in the corn maze that he has known, been there since the beginning of the film, and therefore he is looking for his girls. Every time we see a murderer, or rather a killer's foot, we hear a weird robotic sound like a science fiction toy that changes people's voice to sound mechanically. Why do we hear that? Is it in any case related to ... something? Who knows? Definitely not filmmakers. The peak of all the bad games and the wrong dialogue was when "Walker" shouts "Hey you, Mr. Bad Manu ... I'll get you." At other times, his wife is attacked by a "bad man" at the entrance to a corn maze, which, as I have already mentioned, is strangely empty from employees or policemen. "Bad Man" calls "Walker" on his cell phone to tell him that he plans to kill his wife and children as well. "Walker" can only answer "Hey. HEY!" before starting and running. With nobody on the other end talking, killer drops his phone too, he pulls a woman a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film, losing the first opportunity to stick with his presents. If this script wasn't written by a child, I'd be surprised. It wasn't Opps. He was written, directed and produced by the same guy. And not only that, he did so much miserable work with the camera, where we get random footage that went through a muddy maze and insignificant footage of cornfields wasting 90% of film time. At the end, "Walker" uses cuffs on the cuff "Bad Man", which also seems to know how to choose the locks with the same metal object that "Walker" chose. There are apparently many small metal objects around this cornfield. But after the killer insists he still kills the children, "Walker" kills "Bad Man" and everything is back in the world. In fact, the "Walker" murderer, he killed a man who "allegedly" murdered his own daughters and tried to kill himself. He knows that, not for proof, but for his visions. He never found a body, no one else knew that the guy was even in the maze. And the medallion? He gives it back to the ghosts of two dead girls. No proof. So he kills a man for no reason. I can't imagine what the filmmakers think. It must be a way to cover up the misuse of funds for a manufacturing company. I'd rather watch Blair's witch project five times before I see the movie again. The actors should be ashamed. The director / producer / writer / cameraman should be ashamed. In fact, the entire production company should be ashamed. If someone is associated with this movie, please respond. What did you think?
