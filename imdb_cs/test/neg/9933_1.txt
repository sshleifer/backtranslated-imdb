First, even the IMDb with this movie is falling because the cast list is VERY "merry". Even the main characters are missing like Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this tortured me for 82 or many minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And the reason why I'm so worried is that I was pretty excited to see it in advance. The plot line itself is good. It could be a great movie if it was done properly and carefully. Golden Brooks was a huge disappointment. Now I see that the only role that can be good is a loud, entertaining, energetic sexy chick playing on Girlfriend. Melodramatic roles are not for her at all. She basically killed her character, Rachel. I like some of the casts like Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson and Darrin Dewitt Henson, but even they couldn't save this disastrous movie. Of course, it's just my personal opinion that I can't put Hill Harper as a man, and he didn't help me like him more. Golden Brooks' voice bothered me so much that I had to force myself to finish watching the movie. It looked like she was whispering around the joint. The director I won't waste on doing so bad work. Editing, photographic / camera focus and almost everything about this movie was SAD. Not to mention dialogue! Absolutely unreal and many times straightforward (when it would make you cry and look deep inside). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a very nice video, but it was really bad. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are chief cameramen and want to see 'What to do' example for their future work. <br /> <br /> Have a great day, everyone !!!
