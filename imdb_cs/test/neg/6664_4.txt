Eh's not as good as the other Dragonballs. Demons are actually rip-off from other Z villains like Cell, Frieza, and even Majin Buu. With Baby's Frieza clone, Super 17 is a cellular clone, and shadow dragons are Buu clone (s). The story is also very bad because it deals with Goku shrinking. SHRINKING !! It deals with how it breaks down to the age of eight, just to do it. Let's not forget how weak the characters are. Gohan can no longer go mystically and is even weaker than Pan. Speaking of Mrs. She was so cute at the end of Now she lost all that cuteness and become a tantalizing little girl whose sole purpose in this series is to get in the way. Goten has no sense in the series and Trunks ... well, I don't know what to say about Trunks. The GT is just a milk attempt by the popular Dragonball franchise. If you really like Dragonball then avoid this series. He doesn't feel like Dragonball either. But I will be fair, because the end was really good and actually it is quite sad (at least for me) and thematic songs ending and open are better (Japanese, not American). It could be better if Toriyama san worked on it.
