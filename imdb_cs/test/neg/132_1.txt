Let me start by saying that 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie. It's unfortunate that the IMDb doesn't have tenths of a star ... I watched this abortion movie in the middle of the night because of insomnia and it was utter garbage. The story was terrible. The deal was terrible. The film was completely boring. "Malachi" looked like Shadow with Alec Baldwin (Shadow is infinitely better than this) Eva's character was so underdeveloped and two-dimensional that I didn't care. I didn't even know her name was Eva. Don was interesting when he held his mouth shut. "TWIST" (if you can call it) was ridiculous and pathetic. When it came, the film did such a terrible job of building tension or attachment to a character I just thought: "Who gives S ***." The only thing that made me raise my eyebrows about this movie was the fact that honey. The teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (also a movie that was light years before this film massacre.) Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of losing 90 minutes of countless people. No wonder any actor from this movie has never had a fruitful career. In summary ... This movie is so bad, I feel dirty and I need a shower. The worst movie in history, Gigli was better, Prom Night (remake) was better and I dare say Saw IV was better ...........
