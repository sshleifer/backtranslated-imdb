This is a great example of what could be a great movie and a great idea, but it turned out to be really bad in the process. I was mainly tempted to get it because of the DVD cover, stupid of me, but I am the same and I was blown away, in the wrong way. This film is basically about El Chupacabra, which is causing Los Angeles confusion, and it's up to the local animal cop and writer to save the day before the two spoiled cops and the two evil scientists bring down. The main reason I didn't enjoy this movie was the great continuity mistakes that were hard to notice. Along with some bad acting, proper lighting and nothing terrifying, this movie didn't hit me as it should. However, compared to other Chupacabra films, this definitely tops the charts, hardly. First, the continuity in this film is the way off and I mean off my shoulders and into the ditch. There were so many points that the characters said or did something and then they didn't do it in the next shot or the change never occurred. Example: the main character has a weapon, attacks from Chupacabra, pulls the atmosphere from nothing and disperses and the weapon is missing. The girl runs while defending itself in a mysterious atmosphere and she has no gun, then the main character runs with the girl and has a gun. Where the atmosphere came from and what happened to the gun. Time of day breaks. One minute is the sun and you can see the sun and then the next minute it looks like midnight. There were some plot holes, why were the Chupacabra there, what did the scientists do, what happened to this guy, and why did he shoot the animal and still live? These things tore me out and none of the questions were answered. Next on the list is acting. The boy was wooden and bad. The main character, Navarra, played by Eric Algeria, seems to be too calm and too dedicated to find out what killed a few dogs and when the tragedy hit, his emotions just weren't there. Elina Madison, who played Starlin, did a pretty bad job. She was the author of the best-selling book on Chupacabra. Her actions were a little laughing and poor. He even knows too much about the subject and knows how to ban a high security defense system in a hidden lab. Tony Criss was fine, but he seemed a little calm for some things that were happening. The film reminds me of a bad reenactment for murder for some show of crime solutions where actors and actresses aren't really so dedicated to their work. Rarely do I get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie I couldn't help but be cruel to lighting. It took me several times from the movie because the lighting was so badly directed. There were times when they were trying to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more "comic" but not successful. The worse part is at night when the pith is out, but the scene is so saturated with light, it seems to be the day. For random scenes, they shift from high intensity light to soft light, and the lights seem so bright that the actors squinted. It shouldn't be so clear that there are dark shadows at night. During sunset, when the lighting was perfect, that's the only time when the light was good, other than it was awful. There was no concern in this movie. I was only once when I jumped, but otherwise it wasn't scary. There were points that might be scary, but it was such a damned light, you saw Chupacabra approaching the man, but if it were dark, it would be better. Even the design of the creature for Chupacabra was bad, it looked good, but it was a short man or a jump boy. They did not cover their face; they showed him that he had no mysterious or mysterious appearance. There was enough gore, but it seemed unreal. This movie just wasn't scary, that's all. Overall, they did Americanize a great South American legend into a bloodthirsty human eater who is not Chupacabra. In fact, it was scared people and it just killed goats, sheep, dogs and deer because it was said it hated the smell of people. But then was the story? I did not use this film for any reason, but I will give them credit for trying to make a good film with good intentions. I wouldn't recommend this movie to a horror fan, but if you like indie or B-movies, you should check it out. Also, if you are easily tempted by the iconic classics, you should get this movie. No, I won't see it again, but in some deep sedative way I like these kinds of movies just to see what the other side of Hollywood is doing.
