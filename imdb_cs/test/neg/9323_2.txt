I have nothing against Paul Schrader. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite movies. But some horror fans were prematurely upset when his original version of EXORCIST prequel (DOMINION, the one you just read about, as it turned out) was eliminated by Warners and when Renny Harlin was replaced by spruce and created a new version that was "scarier â€œ. In my opinion, some viewers have been prejudiced and have become succulent because they hated Renny Harlin taking the topic (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) before the first film was even cut off to be judged. And I should know; because I myself went to the theater premiere of BEGINNING with fixed weapons and ready for the absolute worst, which I must have come up with. Imagine my surprise when I found out that Harlin's BEGIN is much more serious than I have ever done, with good performance from Stellan Skarsgard as a young version of Father Merrin who struggled with his faith in God. In any case, it wasn't a great movie, but nowhere near the garbage I was preparing, in advance, an invisible sight. Well, now I have finally seen the right version of the garbage - and that is Paul Schrader DOMINION: PREQUEL TO EXORCIST. It was inexorably dull, uninteresting, and unpredictable. Stellane Skarsgard, a disturbed priest, was not nearly as interesting as he was for me in Harlin's film, and the actor himself was not that good in this role. For all those who pointed out the obvious effects of CGI at the beginning, guess what? They are also in DOMINION. Remember the silly ending in Harlin's rendition (which I also agree with defiling the rest of the movie)? Well, you'll find that this Schrader ending is no less limp. Let me also say that I hate the nonsense that those who appreciate this film better than Harlin by saying that we are "retarders" or "we cannot appreciate the subtle filmmaking". As a man who despises the 1997 MUMMY movie by Stephen Sommers, and who is a true fan of very suggestive and discreet old horror movies from the 1930s and 1940s, I can assure you he is not. At least there was a "some" degree of terror and Exorcist-go going on in Harlin's beginning; Here is just a real exercise in the tedium and a big challenge even for the most certified insomniacs. It will be quite interesting to hear horror fans trying to convince them that DOMINION: PREQUEL TO EXORCIST was as good as they thought it was in advance; just as they had already been overtaken by the lambardian Harlin BEGIN, the second who had learned that Paul Schrader's name was drenched in White-Out.
