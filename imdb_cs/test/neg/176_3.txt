The creators try to paint the influence of Mondovis and Robert Parker on the par with the German occupation of France and the government of fascism. But in this movie they never find a victim. We hear winemakers, critics and distributors that while the wine industry is growing, it is becoming more homogeneous. But the film never makes a case of losing any good wine or exploiting any person or culture other than the naive reader of Wine Spectator with a lot of money. If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for blunt wine, let it be. If it was a diamond trade movie where DeBeers Corporation's domination would lead to human suffering, the style of muckraking might have been appropriate. But as it is, it just gets lost as anti-American, anti-modernizing and anti-capitalist. If they were filmmakers in the 1870s, they would most likely protest against the grafting of American vineyards in an effort to save French wine.
