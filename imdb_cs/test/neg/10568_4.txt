I was more amused by watching my wife almost pull her hair in frustration over most of this movie. I thought something that would tie it all would be around the corner of the dairy every now and then. So I cheated, grabbed the remote control and was relieved when I found out that it would end in just 20 minutes. I should have turned the channel. Cute, it had the potential, but yuck!
