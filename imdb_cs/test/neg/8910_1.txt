Really? It is necessary? How can anyone do such a movie? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Stunts all the time, chase cars with an unpleasant soundtrack. Not to mention the end. Nonsense with the presence of a little girl. Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood !!! Well, at first the fortune teller answers something, no one asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and sees the future. He has to be kidding. Steven Segal fainted after chasing the car and I know he can't act. It was terrible. Nothing can save the movie. I've lost 90 minutes of my life! See you
