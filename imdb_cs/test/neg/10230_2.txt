I loved the first movie, the second was okay, disappointed John Cleese wasn't jean bob as my favorite character. But the third ... what happened to the animation ??? it looks low budget like sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback that was taken from the first movie. They really should stop after number 2, it just makes the rest look bad! Derek's voice changed, but not as recognizable as the jean bob. I also don't understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he died! This movie wanted to turn me off just as I love first, I was very disappointed with this installment. Never beat the original! :)
