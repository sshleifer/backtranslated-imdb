Essentially, this film attempts to portray firefighters' heroism by revolving the film around an American father with a good heart that puts others ahead. Now I know he's trying to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father who is a firefighter, but as if nothing interesting about him has happened about him, so when the movie gets to the top, it's little. emotion. This film is essentially trying to make life firefighters exciting, but it just comes as boring as any other work, except to save lives or property by extinguishing a fire. John Travolta plays the captain of the fire station, but anyone could play his part and he is a dull character like the rest of the movie. What might be a good movie is that the firefighter is built as a hero because they are firefighters and transforms the entire script into an uninteresting melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
