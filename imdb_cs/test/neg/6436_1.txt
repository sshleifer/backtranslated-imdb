Other reviewers with the lowest rating have summed up this wastewater so perfectly that it seems little. I must emphasize that I had only a Cockney Filth money while visiting my children who insisted on watching Sunday's summary. My God, it's depressing! Like all soaps, it is made up of totally unlikely characters who are uncomfortable with each other, but it is ten times the worst of it. The reviewer who mocked the "loyal life" that his defenders burned was in place. If someone lived in such a social environment, they would break their wrists in a few days. And I can assure someone who is not familiar with the real East End that it is more "ethnically enriched" than you have ever seen. Take my advice - avoid this nadir of the British television industry. It's EVIL.
