Of course, all of this nonsense raises the question: "Is the genre confident because the teen comedy really needs another parody movie? Malicious 'Scary Movie' (I and II) took the formula about as far as it could go - 'Not Another Teen Movie' really has nothing that would be intelligent or shocking too much. The storyline, basically based on fairyfloss teenflic 'She's all', goes uncertainly between parody and homage ('John Hughes High School'). Everything from "American Beauty" to "Varsity Blues" benefits from references. The result is an unfulfilled viewer experience. The disadvantage of giving us a copy of "She's all" is that we all know where she is going. And if we didn't, the jokes would be insignificant. <br /> <br /> There are very few recommendations. The token-out scene (toilet eruption) seems to be wrong in place among all 'feel-good' links. There are moments of humor - the song is pretty funny and the odd good line is to send the audience in the way. It stinks, don't look at it.
