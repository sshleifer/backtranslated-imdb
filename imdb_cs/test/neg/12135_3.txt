I was deceived by VILLA to think I would watch something similar to GOSFORD PARK. The film opens in the ballroom in the 1930s in Italy, where it is occupied by vulgar Americans and the excitement of the British upper class, but in fact, UP AT THE VILLA plays much more than Merchant production, which is very bad news because it is very slow. and I think a very slow romantic drama with some romances are very unlikely. If you like slow romantic dramas, you can enjoy this movie. No
