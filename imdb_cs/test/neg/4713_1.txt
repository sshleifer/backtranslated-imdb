I remember seeing it on my local blockbuster and picking it up because I was curious. I liked films about mythological creatures. I like werewolf, vampire, zombie, and so on. It's based on half caste, half human half-leopard creature, who feed on African people. The film is terrible! Actors are terrible! There is no script! It's all improvised! The whole thing is filmed at night because they say it's the only time you see it. It's obvious bull * beep *! They're filming at night to scare it. But they couldn't scare me. After the first person was killed, I put it back in the holster and took it back to the blockbuster. One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Now you're probably saying I don't have the right to control the movie if I didn't finish it. Well, this is one of the movies that doesn't deserve to be watched all the way. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. That's really BAD!
