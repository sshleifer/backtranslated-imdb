Okay, so it never changed the world, and it bombed at the box office, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those movies I fell in love with as a child (the BBC showed it several times during the 1980s and I happened to have a good tape in the machine) VHS - lucky that!) And watched endlessly. Last night I watched a DVD and unfortunately the time for this eventual blockbuster was not kind. Either that or I just grew out of this kind of wide humor. Come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate for laughter, he gives us close-ups of news that is with "fun" slogans, what can you say about cast or script? It is certainly ambitious, interesting, unusual and sprawling, but it must never laugh, loud and cheerful. I would describe it as a children's movie with some "adult" overtones - you can safely keep track of over 15 certificates. They won't get links to medication, so you don't have to worry about it. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that I had forgotten how catchy the title song and the songwriter songwriter "Everybody's Going Faster, Faster" were songs, not to mention the town of the patriotic anthem Ticlawa. The cast gives praiseworthy performances, the photo is sharp and perfectly captures the mood in different places, and there is a real-time capsule feeling about fashion, cars, aids (especially the dash-mounted drum apparatus), interior and interior. links to pop culture - I was more than a little surprised when I heard in the bank loudly rummaging people who said to everyone: "I am OJ Simpson!", especially now the Simpsons legal patch overshadows his sporting achievements. The catch is that there is almost nothing to talk about, it's too obvious it's funny and not funny to make a lot of real laughter. I wish I could leave it as a pleasant memory.
