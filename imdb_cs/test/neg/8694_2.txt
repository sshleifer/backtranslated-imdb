It's hard to compete with the classic size, but once you have chosen this option and the decision is in play, you need to find the best and brightest sources to keep the top product socket and top quality. If you intend to seek the second or third (or fourth) best, why try it? This is why this version of the Ten Commandments is attached, produced and broadcast. I would like to ask the producers: "What did you think? Are you trying to create a planned deficit?" If the producers were to think, "We want to examine this biblical story from a different perspective ..." Then I would say "OK, I was watching the show, what kind of point is it?" The idea of ​​this "possible theory of view" escapes me. I can generally watch programs and (right or wrong) at least get a sense of what the creators have tried to achieve. Not here. I recognize names like "Robert Halmi" (producer) and I can combine his work with some interesting product; Tin Man, Earthsea, Flash Gordon, Jason and Argonauts. Low budget entertainment based on myth, history and comic book entertainment. The perfect genre for the Sci-Fi Channel. So I still have to ask Robert Halmi ... "What was the purpose of the Ten Commandments, what do you think?" FJS
