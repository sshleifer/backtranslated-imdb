Compared to the recent HOSTEL movie, which reminded me of this movie, I'd say See No Evil is a little better, but not much. A very complicated plot involves a handful of offenders who are sent to clean up a neglected hotel for a shorter prison prison. The children will soon end up killing them by a pious religious psychopath who cleanses them from their sins (I think). One thing I was most concerned about was the fact that he was watching WWE wrestler Kane. He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-line lyrics in the movie. There are a couple of pretty gory moments, mainly involving eye grooving and a pretty memorable scene in which the girl gets a cellphone stuck in her throat - probably the most effective demise in the movie. <br /> <br /> I say that this movie really shows us something new and is definitely not great. Not recommended.
