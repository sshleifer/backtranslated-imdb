I have to admit that when I saw the movie trailer, I was looking forward to it. I am generally a fan of light romantic comedies and trailer, that is the impression I have from this movie. But I spent most of the film waiting for a comedy. Although there were several entertaining scenes, the general view of the movie was quite depressing. I also found it difficult to fall in love with some of the characters, as everyone seemed to be a little backward, the time the director could use to explore the characters who captivated Opera's overuse would result in slow motion of the film. All in all, though there are some moving scenes, the trailer is pretty deceptive and I'd just suggest you go watch it if there's really nothing else that tickles your imagination. Not fantastic, and as I said before; Bland.
