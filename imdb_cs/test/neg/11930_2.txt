In the animated series: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel that was completely separate from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, corrosive, confident, sarcastic, deadly, unreal, ambiguous. The original Aeon had layers on the layers of depth. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to manifest. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and provocative. You could never say what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist, while Trevor was a radical idealist because they could never have any appearance of a stable relationship. Aeon Flux works for Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was beautiful, loving, vulnerable, easily twisted, emotional and very predictable. Aeon in the film had at most one layer of depth. The story was obvious and invented. Everything is completely unloaded from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophy. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides. The film was a terrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of ​​one of my favorite animated characters of all time, squeezing out the depth and personality of it and drawing it full of Hollywood clichés. The essence of the animated series has been completely lost in this film. The only reason I won't give this film "1" is that the visuals were incredible. It was nice to see some of the famous animated scenes, like a fly in the eye that was done with CGI.
