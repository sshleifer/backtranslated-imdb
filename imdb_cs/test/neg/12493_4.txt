Yet another version of the mother of all the gangsters is whipping - the classic "Godfather" and yet another case of excessive hype due to the media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindu film Ram Gopal Varma as a director, is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy, including two other outstanding Satya and Company. Charisma, the magnetic personality of two Bachchans playing father-son duo on the screen for the first time, is definitely a treat to watch out for. Not only strong performances, but their perfect chemistry is the biggest point that Varma should be applauded for. But the same duo equation is missing with other characters in the movie. The reason - other characters look more like cardboard cartoons. villains are typical Bollywood baddy. The character that attracts attention is the older son Kaykay plays, but he is again unable to stick to the half-characterized characterization. . Drama and conflict are revived by the excessive use of Close-Shot, which has brought a claustrophobic effect that is essential to create the atmosphere. The scary score (Amar Mohile) and sound design (Kunal Mehta, Parikshit Lalwani & Anup Dev), along with a dark, murky background overlapping with brilliant powerful images (cameraman Amit Roy) contribute to the visual style that is typical of Ram's style. But there is overuse of music, but fortunately no songs are in the movie. But can the interest of today's "intelligently growing" viewers be kept on the shoulders of two performers and powerful Visuals? I do not think so. Sure, the audience of the "maangey sea" and here the film can't deliver. In every adaptation to add a new dimension, the scenario that is slow, not sharp, and therefore the tempo is often reduced. What the audience is finally exposed to is a very predictable, very common drama with very little surprising elements. Top stunt director Allan Amin Ghani is also not in his best form. Some scenes that require different treatment include: the minister is talking about Sarkar's foul and the son is overheard; very amateur filming in prison at Sarkar, Sarkar Jr escapes from the clutches of his enemies, son easily motivated to kill his father, son secretly enters his father's room to kill him, police officer slapped Sarkar Jr - all this requires a more realistic approach that is necessary to create the desired conflict. Dialogs are weak eg look at an amateur line where CM tells Sarkar Jr. ?? "Wo yo police commissioner tha on usay maine hata diya" .. Women folk take on work Sarkar is completely ignored. The constant criminal negotiations, while Sarkar is with his family, also look a little. In fact, the film follows a graph that is very similar to Ramu's own production - Ab Tak Chhappan. In portraying the battle between good and evil, the other side of life - the law, the police, the administration, politics is completely ignored. Of course, more is expected in content. The film certainly lags behind and could not stand above the average price. Dear Rama, you agreed to laugh at the bank now, you will have to do some drastic reworking of your film production plant before it's too late.
