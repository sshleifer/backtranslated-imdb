This documentary about Miles somehow contains very little music and no complete melodies. Although Miles appears in the film, 95% of the interviews are other people, not Miles. There are huge chronological gaps, many aspects of his life (his childhood miracle, his drug addiction) are omitted or overlooked, and you will learn something about what a person and his contribution to music so groundbreaking. Skip it.
