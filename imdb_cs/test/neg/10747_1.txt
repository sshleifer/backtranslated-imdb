The last sentence of this review is the main spoiler. I enjoyed the work of Joe Dante by Piranha. He did a lot of different genre parodies that were both funny and honest. But this is pure crap. This is a kind of satire - consistent with thank you for smoking - it is so literal and direct that it leaves nothing to a) laugh and b) let viewers think about it. It's a shame because the plot and the material are so rich, timely and mature for intelligent commentary. By the way, there's no reason why the main character would shoot Ann Coulter's character. film. It's just being absurd.
