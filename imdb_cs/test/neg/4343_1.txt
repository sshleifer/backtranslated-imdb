"This life" is really as bad as it is. His cast of mercenary, lascivious, ruthless, duplicate, shallow characters is intended to reflect on his post-1980s, and I have to admit in this respect that it is a precise creation. Unfortunately, he does not let me sympathize with or take care of them and consider it another step towards a television premium phone in fraud; Incredibly Bad, Cheap, Realistic and Saturated Television Celebrity; and another cut and run of attitudes that destroyed this medium and a lot of British society. Does it sound exaggerated? I don't think he is. In this respect, programs such as "This Life" were really as influential as they are often called.
