This movie is really incredible in every sense of the word. I couldn't believe what I saw and hear, so I didn't believe it. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but it was ridiculous. To be yourself as a fool, I know how it should sound, and that's not the Kate Back Bay accent. The only thing I found was the fact that the one who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was cast as another of the hills, with an emphasis on match. Maybe it was a practical joke, think about it. I can't think of any other reason for such a special casting. Well, maybe this. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell on the island of Gilligan, appeared in this game on Broadway. Can you imagine what part she could play?
