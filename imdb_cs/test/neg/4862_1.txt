Funny thing. Charlie Sheen, Donald Sutherland, Sam Waterston and Stephen Lang had incredible performances. Who can forget Sheen as a nailf in Wall Street, or Sutherland as a cynical Korean war surgeon in MASH? Waterston and Lang have both successful television and film careers (Law & Order, Killing Fields, Tribeca De Niro, etc.). So what would any of these great actors do in such a smelly bomb in the world? The conspiracy of the Washington Conspiracy Shadow Conspiracy is not so bad, not original, but not so bad. . Sure it was done (seven days in May - a great movie!), But with a little tuning it might be even more fun. The main problem with the Shadow plot is execution. Soon in the film Sheen, a political strategist extreme, ridiculous and unlikely to resolve a potential public relations gaffe by blackmailing Congressman. Later, gunplay with Lang's silent hitman tear half of what is to be Georgetown is explained on the news as "gang wars". Did anyone remotely connect with this movie ever lived a day in Washington? Sheen is too young for twenty years, a way too young to be so high in the White House administration. Sheen's reaction to the political crisis is so charged with false machismo, it looks like he was taking part in David Hasselhoff's acting school. And when was the last time the Gang Wars spread to Georgetown? We are talking about a part of Washington where citizens voted against a subway stop to maintain their exclusivity. <br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer that this movie would be unbearable without a button forward. A year ago I recorded it from HBO and then I made 3 separate views to stretch through it. Don't let this movie be rented. If you see it on the blockbuster, run as fast as you can.
