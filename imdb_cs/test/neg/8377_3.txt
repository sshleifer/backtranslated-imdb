This movie looked fun on the cover and I honestly thought it might be? I knew a little bit. The diagnosis was outside the gate. It was inventive, unrealistic and not interesting. The UPN syndicated TV shows dialog is more natural. The story was unlikely and at the end he had almost zero playoffs. The snake end is almost confusing and seemingly staged. The only remotely interesting character is Rose McGowen's, who is muted, preventing her from being destroyed with a clich√© that has unfolded from the trash dialogue (well, at least to the end when she has to speak). The only thing that even gives this 3 over 1 or 2 is Rose McGowen's nude scene. Really terrible. Save trouble and rent something more interesting, such as the Barney video.
