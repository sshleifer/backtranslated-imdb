This is another film I missed on Italian TV as a child: notable for its quintet of aging stars, most of whom have never made a horror movie in their lives (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Houseman and Patricia) Neal) dealing with men is a long-hiding past crime to return to haunt them. She has the form of a haunted dead ring for a girl they all loved (Alice Krige) but was forced to get rid of after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated her egos! Fairbanks, who was responsible for the deed, has twins (Craig Wasson), so Krige drives their revenge. Soon one of them, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman all ended up dead. Therefore, the remaining Wasson and Astaire decide to confront the ghost at the crime scene, where they also have to deal with several sinister tramps who somehow sacrifice Krige's offer! I was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs (Douglas died before the film premiered, even though he had already completed another role at that time, while proving that Astaire had its own unfavorable swan song), but GHOST STORY also went through Many of the mood changes - while maintaining a slow pace in the process and appearing over them - are different from the unsuccessful curiosity. Having dollops of sex (including full-frontal nudity from Wasson!) And terrible makeup effects of confused water all the more and mared old-fashioned elegance of Jack Cardiff's own (other notable long-term) cinematography.
