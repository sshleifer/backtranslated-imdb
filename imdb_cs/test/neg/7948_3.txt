Assault on Precinct 13: 3/10: Forget a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of classic action movie. Taken entirely on your own merits Attack is a debacle. We'll start with the Rio Bravo scenario. About a dozen people are trapped in a crumbling Detroit police station (If Robocop gives you warmth instead of Detroit and the fuzzies stop right now. It could simply have said Topeka in the opening credits and nothing would change. They are surrounded by our evil ones. corrupt cops. <br /> <br /> Now I know what you think. Corrupt cops? Were the Nazis and drug cartels busy this weekend? Of course they are not ordinary cops. These guys are right on the cover of Tom Clancy's latest video game. Yeah, we have a body armor; helicopters; laser sights; night vision glasses work. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. Members / Special Forces Armed To Teeth Verses 4 Cops (Drunk Mind That It's a New Year), 2 Girls in Party Dresses and a Half Dozen Criminals. So how are our heroes defending themselves? The truth is they can't. Everyone should be dead in ten minutes. (Not to mention that the characters inside have an unpleasant habit of walking around the windows.) Now the illogical scenario is not the reason for the whole film to succeed. an action movie in the style of B. However, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters looked like a comic relief. (At least I hope they were) <br /> <br /> While Ja-Rules and Leguizamo are bad enough. It's Astrina's minstrell show that takes the cake. Rarely has a stereotyped African American character appeared on a modern screen. Her performance resembles boys frat in blackface and drag ghetto. <br /> <br /> In the original attack, a gang member takes over an ice cream truck and drives around and shoots little girls in the head. Since then, I have had an irrational fear of ice cream trucks. After this attack, I have a totally rational fear of remake.
