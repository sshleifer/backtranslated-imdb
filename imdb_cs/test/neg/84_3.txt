When I saw the title of this movie, "Stupid Teenagers Must Die," it convinced me that it was some kind of spoof. Later I discovered the original name "Blood and Guts". However, both titles are misleading. This is not a spoof or a serious film. This is something in between, failure in both areas. A group of teenagers attending a session in a haunted house and then begins killing. Sounds too good, no. Well, these movies don't add anything to the endless stream of similar movies. And it's wrong. Due to the lack of light, the entire film is grainy. Now this effect can be highly effective, but in this case it is not. The young cast does not act too badly, but the director has no idea what to do with the actors. In many scenes actors are clearly waiting for directions, but they are too late. Of course, this can also be an editor's error. The characters are unrealistic and the story just stinks. The sound is sometimes horrible: the conversations are indecipherable, but when they speak loud or scream the actors are really loud really. one. For me 3 out of 10.
