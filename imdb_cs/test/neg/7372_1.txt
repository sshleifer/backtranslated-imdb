Please don't waste your time and money with this smelly turkey. This is an over-the-top melodramatic love story set against the background of New France (aka Quebec in the 18th century). Or is it a New France historical saga with epic romance? I don't know, and at this point I don't care anymore. There is a rich story to be told there about the intrepid French adventurers, villains and other assorted characters who settled in Canada and parts of the US. That's not it. Characters are total clich√©s, the story is crowded, breathless and without any magic, and before all viewers want to do it, get the fuck out of the theater, have your head checked and grab their own. This film was the biggest disappointment of my year when it comes to cinema, especially because as a historian and French Canadian or Canadian French origin (or anything) I am a) believing that the story of my people in this country still needs to be revealed, as well as it may on film b) be interested in this subject c) a film lover who thinks the cinema can do wonders these days with this magnificent and tragic story. <br /> <br /> As I said, don't waste your time with this frustrating piece of clapper.
