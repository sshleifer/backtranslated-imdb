Kairo, or Pulse, as is known among English-speaking viewers, takes place in Tokyo and begins as an employee of Sunny Plant Sales Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decided to visit his friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to ask for a computer disk on which he works when he gets to his place, puts it on the disk, but then suicides himself unreasonably before her. Meanwhile, a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) has recently joined the Internet and keeps scary news and pictures on his monitor to ask about the computer whiz Harai Karasawa (Koyuki), what she is, she doesn't really know, but it seems that a place where ghosts go when they die is full and need to go somewhere else and the Earth is as good as any other place, right? These spirits don't like sharing, so people try to commit suicide or turn them into ashes, or something like that, I don't really know because movies are a little messy ... <br /> <br /> This Japanese production was written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and right from the bat I have to say that I hated Kaira, I hated everything about it and it proves that it's just a shadow of doubt that Asian cinema can produce something like any American filmmaker. The scenario is an insurmountable mess, the thing just doesn't make any sense to scenes that look like they were from another movie, sequences that have no logical meaning or are by no means explained and Kairo is also a totally boring movie I sat this year. After two hours, it's a real chore to sit down, I really wanted to move it fast, but I'm fair, if nothing else, I ripped it to the bitter end and sincerely wished I didn't. There are so many things wrong with Kairo; Then there's the whole internet thing I couldn't relate to at all, I use the internet all day and in no way is it kind of scary for me. Then there is the fact that Kairo, as a film, provided me with no amusing value, maybe I am Neanderthal, but I like movies that I enjoy having fun, making some sense, and bored me to death. > <br /> Director Kurosawa has done the utmost insomnia to cure when it comes to me, if you are having trouble sleeping to keep it on DVD & you will sleep fast within 10 minutes guaranteeing you. I didn't think Kairo was scary at all, the whole internet thing was ridiculous, and as for the scary you should see some of the pop-up ads of the penis enlargement I get, that's scary now! I hate the movie, I hate the movie, I apologize for having to make the point again, twice. Forget any action, tension or gore because it isn't. If you have a very nervous disposition, then maybe a few scenes you might sneak up, otherwise it's a child friendly PG rated material all the way. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The film looks so boring and boring that it is untrue, the camera just sits there for very long shots and when it moves, it moves very slowly, all in the style of a Mexican soap opera. Since Kairo is under the name it is difficult to assess the original performance, so I will not bother, it is difficult to care for someone when they do not speak the same language and do not know what they say. Kairo is stupid, I hated it and it's as simple and straight as it is. Just because it's an Asian movie, it doesn't automatically mean it's good and the story's mess, conspiracy holes, the fact that it doesn't make sense, and it's an absolute boredom, means that Kairo would be rightly torn by people if it was American production. The worst movie I've seen this year. Kairo got a Hollywood remake as Pulse (2006).
