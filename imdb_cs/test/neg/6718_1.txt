Lord have mercy! Why was this film made? Why Seagal and the rising star Max Ryan agree to be there? The alien is so excruciatingly bad in every conceivable way he thinks. <br /> <br /> The film has a very cheap look. As a budget a few bucks were far beyond their reach. What's worse is that manufacturers know it and try to make it look smooth to compensate. The result is a movie that just doesn't look good. Combat scenes are so boring and edited "discreetly" to hide the fact that Steven Seagal is no longer in good shape. None of them is engaging or exciting. The plot is nonsense that doesn't care for the slightest way, nor has it any uniqueness. The places of Eastern European countries (foolish movement of producers to keep the budget down or not) look uncomfortable and should not serve as a backdrop for the "action" film (what action?). And what is the deal with the title? If I could tell everyone in the movie, it was strange. Which ONE refers to the title? The DVD is in 1.85: 1 anamorphic widescreen format and in Dolby 5.1 audio. Neither of them is so remarkable that it would require a single rent. The alien is not worth one second of his time. I have to love that slogan tho! "If they think they can stop him, the dead are wrong." Sheesh!
