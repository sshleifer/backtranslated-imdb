Let's start by recognizing that there are three types of horror movies: good, bad and totally awkward disks that the genre suffers in every way. The dark harvest promises great with the Artisan DVD cover, but you can be sure it's where the show stops. After an exhaustive initial installation, we soon discover that the film is a very poorly written script, extremely skilled (even for beginners) playing, catastrophic lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, no one could afford anything more than a villain mask, or just thought it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, so is it good enough for us? It wasn't about creating a scary villain. In any case, it's one of the movies that lets you control your watch, sigh and curse your own credibility. The timing in each scene is painful, and the entire production has a high school feel for it (figure out I've seen better high school stagings, except for special effects). I'm trying to figure out some way to end this review positively, so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be donated as beverage trays, frisbees, chimes ....... "go look at yourself" but it would it was just cruel. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of this company review and find that it's the same for each of their movies. He claims to honor the contract between the film and the audience (ie, please the fans), but all they did is laugh and throw our heads for cash (which I am sure they saw very little). Sorry people, high ratings and good reviews are probably sent by those who are directly or indirectly linked to this aggravation. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 because it's the lowest possible rating. Giving it one more annoys me.
