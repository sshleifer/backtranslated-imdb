This movie is a pointless comedy, in The Airplane or Naked Gun lines, but it is not even close to these two because it lacks originality and a little more intelligent jokes, rather than just throwing you the same old simple jokes. <br /> <br /> You can find some links to other movies, I've identified Dodgeball and Rocky from the top of my head so you can have fun and try to find out what movies are spoofed. The movie also offers intermittent laughter, but nothing that could cause you an injury, nothing really funny. I liked the nature of IPod (even though some of the jokes with it are standard 101 comedies). I think this movie (and like most nonsense / spoof comedy) depends on the mood you're in, so if you think you'll laugh at some joke watching this movie. If you're in a serious mood to forget about this (re) watch instead of the plane, it will definitely make you laugh
