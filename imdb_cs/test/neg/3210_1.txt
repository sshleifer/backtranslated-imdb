Now it's a real turkey overrated by Franco, who has given us such classics as "Las Vampiras / Vampyros Lesbos". Yes, I think bad movies can be great fun. I adore the cheerful cooks Doris Wishman, Dwain Esper and Ed Wood jr., But this proved to me too much. It's the first movie I rated 1. Where do I start? The scenario is most idiotic. Dialogue is incredibly bad. There seems to be no overhead. The best musical cue (used repeatedly in this film) was taken directly from the movie "Der Hexer" (1964). And it's BORING! Poor Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one film, Sanders reads a comedian while his follower tortured a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this film). The only thing that confused me was that Franco immediately showed a woman's nudity whenever I thought the film would get her - that's the director's real skill! However, I am afraid that the film in which the actors pretend to shoot with machine guns shaking is not really good.
