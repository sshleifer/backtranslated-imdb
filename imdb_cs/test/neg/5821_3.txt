I saw this film at our film festival at the crossroads and I was looking forward to it because it was shot in Mississippi and played by karen black. I was terribly disappointed with the clumsy scenario that had never flowed and the apparent lack of actors and directors to understand something about the culture they were trying to portray. How leeward and griffin became such deep friends in five minutes? Which of the two was under the tree? It was unclear. And there seems to be some law of southern accents in Hollywood, and you rarely hear anything remotely approaching everyday sounds in the south, despite the horrible, "it has to be, just as it sounds, to soften" r "access to dialogue, the actors expire. Most of all, Aleksa sounded like a New York street that was tough during "emotional" scenes, and none of them sounded anything. The character of Walt Goggins was supposed to be from Morgan, Louisiana, but it sounded nothing that meant a mix of new Orleans and Cajun accents. The second annoying point seemed to be the compulsion of the writer to make us all feel that every person must have a homosexual compulsion. Before I start this storm and I am accused of homophobia, I have enjoyed many homosexual movies, especially "punks", "when love comes" and "b monkey". But it seemed to be some male desire for all the young men. Well, Tennessee Williams has already covered this country and done a much better job. So, I wonder if brothers brothers can get regional accents and culture into dead films in Minnesota and Mississippi, why can't someone else? That's a waste of my time.
