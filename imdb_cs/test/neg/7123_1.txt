Grudge 2 is one of the films that I want more synonyms for "terrible" in English. With a fence full of more holes than trawlers, this movie doesn't necessarily follow the fans of even the most popular movies I have. I felt I had to stay in the cinema until I made fun of $ 5.70, even though I was afraid I'd be there for years. A better film could be made from what happened in The Grudge's first installment, although I'm not quite sure it's not the result of such an exercise. As one might expect to pass to a conspiracy in this terrible example of cellulosic wastage, it ends without any distinction, leaving producers with the chance to impose "The Grudge 3" on the public when it comes time to feel even more pang. a real hatred for civilization.
