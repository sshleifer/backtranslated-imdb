The White Warrior is definitely one of Steve Reeves's weakest films. Set in the 18th or 19th Century Russia (??) Steve plays a Cossack fighter who tries to defect the Russian Tsar's madman by running on the mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy-looking Russian white tunic ..... the biggest part of Reeves the figure is hidden in a goofy, knee tunic, with an even stronger Russian hat. The action is somewhat minimal, only with a good half-waist match scene showing Reeves the great character. This is an obvious attempt by producers to move Reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historical era, with poor results. The scenario dialogue is hard to understand at different points, and only the narrator's commentary allows the viewer to understand what is actually happening from scene to scene. I'd picture Reeves regretted doing this film, but in an effort to try to get out of his toga and sandals and tribune armor it helped launch him into other historical characters such as Morgan Pirate and Baghdad Thief.
