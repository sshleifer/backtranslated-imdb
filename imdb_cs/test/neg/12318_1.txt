This movie has upset me! When I think of Cat in the hat. Im thinking of a cat in a book hat. You know, one of the few years my parents read to their children. Well, but I think this movie would be so much! But to my surprise there was nothing like books! It's more like a movie for young adult humors. In one part the cat speaks with a horticultural tool (hoe) the cat speaks to him like his hoe (agin adult humor). naming his car i'm all a little bit tired for baby movie. under rating you will find: mild naked humor and a few doubles. In short it means adult humor. I wish I could return this movie! wal-mart said they wouldn't be because the movie was opened. If you are thinking of buying, I suggest that you may borrow before you buy.
