This movie has too many things. Another reviewer comments on the discontinuous, episodic character of the film, which reflects the director's memories - that's fine if it's the way it was written and done. Instead, we get a straightforward story - from time to time - that jumps around, under and over, leaves us in some cases, interrupts flow with unnecessary deviations in other cases and otherwise simply doesn't work. <br /> <br /> There are also some plot details that just don't work. Why, for example, drag a body to a beach in an urban area in broad daylight, as opposed to night time? Why leave your flat sheet on your body? Why would an artist who knew Joe for a short time decide to leave him "everything" (though not much)? This sub-graph was poorly developed to make this point work. Why should a person be invalid or an artist other than to give money and gratuitous naked posing scenes? Was it just as easy to be a photographer or an opera composer? How come someone evaluates an apartment in Opera - especially without a clear connection with Opera? The accidents are also too obvious and unclear and inexplicable. Why would guys take everything to the warehouse and "disappear". If Tim was a 10-year-old school friend in a city as small as Bangor, how could Joe lose track of him for 8 years, especially if they knew each other so well that someone would recommend another job. Some of the other subplots (like a mother and her friend (s) and a sister who wants to escape have felt like cushions. There are some good ideas that could create an element with full development or could to be Interesting Shorts, this film, which has been completed, makes no sense and offers even less.
