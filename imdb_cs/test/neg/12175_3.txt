The appeal of this film must be a style of artsy euro because there is no substance. There are a lot of things that seem to be somewhere ... but they never get there. It's hard to come up with a full ten comments because this movie is a completely empty experience. There's a lot of nice photos of the cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some glimpses of what might pass surrealist humor, and a weak, existential ending. These elements undermine each other. Just when you can look forward to a spooky mood, there's some stupidity with reflecting heads or zombie sex. If you want to avoid screaming boredom, you will connect with a minimal story - and fall into ridiculous illogical. It's as if someone has taken some half-baked B movies and tossed them into a blender. What comes out is mostly a movie * about * absurdity - and * not * good. Obviously, this will give the impression that the category of an art-house fan who sees emptiness as indistinguishable from depth. Everyone else should avoid this daring mess.
