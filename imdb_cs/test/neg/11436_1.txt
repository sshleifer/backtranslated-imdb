I can't figure out what Jon Voight might think when he joined this tenth rate, an incoherent, pretentious, insensitive shock. He helped write the alleged "screenplay" himself and should be ashamed of it. The film (I can't call it "film" because it barely moves at all) is a surreal, embarrassingly challenging drivel - something like a really bad Oprah Winfrey show, but worse. It's pointlessly revolving from the Middle Ages to modern Los Angeles, with Voight as a TV producer who thinks he's a reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother and in some way translate it into a modern age where Voight must save the earth from the evil machinations of the oil company manager. If the bizarre casting (Wilfrid Brimley, Frankie Valli (!), Kaye Ballard and Armand Assante, among other things) is not enough to kill him, it's an incredibly awkward direction, a washed-out photo (looks like it was shot with a really inexpensive 16mm camera ), an almost complete lack of editing (scenes either continue and turn on infinitely, or are cut off in the middle of a sentence), and Voight's embarrassment, apparently the flow of consciousness, is "playing" enough to bury him, which is exactly what it was supposed to be done. Experience with jaw dropping. Avoid this dog at all costs.
