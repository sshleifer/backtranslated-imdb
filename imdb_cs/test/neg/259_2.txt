Where should I start with this movie. All I know is it's a mess. Either the script, the story or the actors. Above all, this film is disappointing from Salman Khan, who had given us Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega. The second Rani is still annoying, appearing in every silly movie by Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (glad Saathiya stopped this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer, but destroys a witty movie. Missing dialogues. Maybe I laughed here and there, but did I have fun? NO!!! Salman Khan was tolerant in the above films, but he's crazy here. His character is poorly written. One minute is poor and the next minute you wonder how poor he is. Rani Mukherjee looks like ordinary Jain and does not make any effort. She happily redeemed her career with Saathiya because her career went haywire around this time. Pooja Batra has a little glimpse here, but it's not enough. Jackie Shroff is useless. The beauty and acting of Kashmira Shah ran away because she chose such a horrible scenario. Raveena Tandon looks beautiful but gives little power. Mohnish Behl wins for the worst (minor) actor (they need Razzie because there were horrible movies in India). He says silly dialogues, terribly dances, looks weird and not in his regular form. To tell you, there's more to cast who are also terrible. If it wasn't for the amazing beauty of Raveen at Aa Meri Life Bana De, I wouldn't make any sense to the film. Otherwise Salman's dance was terrible. Pooja Batra danced like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I would like the costumes to be replenished and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dance) blown off the wind. The good song of the album was O Priya O Priya which doesn't have a good enough picture. The same is true for half a decent title song. Otherwise, this film (and the rest of the songs) is not no for everyone.
