I saw Rick Mayall in Blackadder and New Statesman, so I thought I'd try this movie. About 4 am I bought it, around 8 pm I started watching, around 11:15 pm I quickly forwarded the remaining movie to see if there was anything that could be observed for the human being with the brain. .. but it wasn't. At about 8.45 pm I threw the DVD in the dustbin. And this is where this "movie" belongs. <br /> <br /> What happened to British humor? Humor is so gentle and witty, intelligent and refined that you can find in Yes, Minister, Blackadder, Vicars of Dibley, Fawlty Towers or The Fast Show? Britain's black humor is so famous? I don't want to offend anyone, but I suppose even stupid kids won't find it fun. They deserve more intelligent fun. And Rik Mayall, you can do better, so please!
