This "movie" will give me nightmares, I'll wake up soaked in sweat, shout "I didn't make this movie, please don't blame me!" Honestly, I think it would be more fun to look at a fat guy eating lard in his mother's basement for one or two hours before watching this crap. I know the money was tight, but damn what the hell they thought there was no thought, conspiracy or effort. This movie needs a warning "Please do not fund theater departments and local JCs for the love of God." On another note, they are the least likeable characters I've ever seen, and I've seen Hitler movies in them. So finally take my advice when you next think about going for a few hundred Adivl and letting you sleep.
