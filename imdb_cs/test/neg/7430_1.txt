I really like this movie. The second movie in the series had the stupid, disc in the movie felt it was fun (of course I was also drunk). I watched this movie with the highest expectation of a similar film merriment experience, a-la- Mystery Science Theater 3000. I was bad !!!!! This movie is a terrible god of wasting film, and I like the other day !!!! From the effeminate villain with the creepy wig of David Bowie, to the cheap, unpleasant female villains with a laugh that could tear off the garage door, the whole thing was just a painful mess. Actually, I felt bad for Sue Price because the material was under the actress of her character (that pretty much says everything). Terrible, horrible movie (it's not a recommendation).
