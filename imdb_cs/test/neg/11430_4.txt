Irvine Welsh builds on Screenspotting as three stories in Edinburgh, all with several Welsh trademarks, drug culture, depression, working class, and Hibernian football club. It is annoying to watch in places, it's no less than very well written, 2 of the stories that have a darkly comic twist to them, while the second story is a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot to it. He will not appeal to the majority, including himself to the point, but will undoubtedly accept a cult following.
