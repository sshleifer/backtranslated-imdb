I'm talking about physical and cosmological physics as a physicist who runs through me. However, I found that this presentation is too slow and does not have enough information for those interested in the lay (who are most likely to see it). If you have more than curiosity in this kind of thing, go to the library and check out some books. You will find that they explain contemporary scientific cosmologies with much more detail and at the same time fill you with more sense of miracle than this film does. Also, to keep the record straight: Hawking is NOT considered the "greatest mind" or the world's "smartest person" as commonly claimed among the user reviews here on IMDb. Hawking himself said that "It's a waste. It's just a media hype. They needed someone to fill a handicapped genius model. At least I'm handicapped." To be righteous, he is probably a genius, but among the greatest historians there are people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss, and many others are easily considered more. It is not about disregarding Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist, but does not respect others who have done even more than he has. Anyway, check out the movie if you're really in science. But if not, I think it would be boring for you.
