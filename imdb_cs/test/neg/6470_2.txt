"It's like this city has the power to suck the brain off." Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenage girl, bored with her over average city. She is bored when a woman is kidnapped, and she finds what she believes is the guide to the poor lady's residence. With the help of his rare cat "D.C." and a clumsy FBI agent (Doug E. Doug) must find her. That Darn Cat is a bad movie. It's pretty stupid and has humor that often falls quite flat. But there are several buds of talent in it. Doug E. Doug was good at Cool Runnings. His performance "Senga" was really funny. Here he is wasted as a dull FBI agent. But he has a good scene when he mimics a cat. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. His character must be the most reasonable parent ever. This poor guy has his dear cigar crushed, gets arrested for taking his own cat, and gets his angry wife and STILL is not angry with his daughter for causing all his problems. I wish my old man was like that. The only really good performance is Christina Ricci. She is entertaining as an ever-angry Patti, but her occasionally very bad dialogue attracts her performance down. In this movie you can also see Peter Boyl (Young Frankenstein, Everybody Loves Raymond), an old lady from Wings and Cliff from Cheers. This is a movie that all these actors would probably want to forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I really can't recommend 1997 to Darn Cat. Some young children (up to 8 years old) can enjoy it a little bit, but everybody else should look elsewhere. If you're looking for a good movie by Christina Ricci, I recommend Addams Family Values, Opposite Sex or Sleepy Hollow. If the fun family movie is what you watched, try Snow Day instead. <br /> <br />
