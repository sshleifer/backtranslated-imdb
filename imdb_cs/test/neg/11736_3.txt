Norm (a) ally I don't mind remodeling. There are some pretty good ones out there, but this is smelly! Since it was practically a scene for the scene, she had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction virtually flawlessly and added color (I'm not one of those who thinks it must be a B & W to be classic). It was supposed to be at least an average movie ... but it was a pee-pee caa-caa! I don't understand how it could have been so bad. If you have to, watch it like curiosity, but I would suggest you not bother.
