So I got it from a rental shop where I work before it was released (8/21 release), I just watched it today and now I'm out of words. They could have had a decent movie, but in some painfully obvious ways they screwed it up. First, the parts with John Krasinski were funny, and that's the only reason I did it above 3, but they are divided by bad behavior and terrible "serious" reflections on life among the main character (Andrew Keegan ) and his girlfriend (annoying Lacy Chabert). It would be much, much better if it was a direct comedy ala Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barelels. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like it because I think Krasinski is fun and wants to see him well. The story wasn't bad, just not very original. But directing (and a lot of acting) was terrible. I swear they had difficulty keeping the peoples face-to-face, and so did they. Their negligence is shown when a weapon expert repairs another character and says the "Dirty Harry" weapon is not. 357 magnum but .45 (that was how everyone knows .44 magnum). So check it out if you like 1-2 like John Krasinski 2- you want to watch low budget (and bad) -directed) or 3- Have too much time on hand (it's me!)
