'New Generation' is the third Amityville entry to establish its plot around writer John G. Jones's premise of an item taken from Long Island House, which causes spectral poverty and death for its new owners. First the lamp, then the clock and now the mirror. However, this is also the first of Amityville because of the 'Possession' directly merging with real-life events that began the entire series. This time Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, gets one day a homeless male mirror. Soon, the people around him will begin to die, which eventually leads to his discovery that the mirror once hung in Amityville's house - really at night when a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror is not entirely accidental, and he soon learns the truth of his past truth that he has been buried since childhood. This 7th installment in a frequently worn franchise is something disappointing for me. Things began to rise with a silly and uneven, yet entertaining "It's about time" and given how much this film tries to draw from its roots - not from the first episode, but from the source material itself - it was supposed to be better than it was . However, three journeys to the same well with yet another evil Amityville house artifact with yet another explanation for spoiled paranormal visits are on their own. One of Amityville's biggest weaknesses is the relentless commitment of each set of producers to completely ignore every next episode in the series. On the one hand, it is perfectly reasonable that they do not want to be tied to the continuity of someone else, but at the very least they could recognize the lines of stories that have already been made and may not repeat them over and over again *. There is also something somewhat rushing about the way the story unfolds, no doubt due to the inevitability of this repetition-fest brings. Because you already know what's going to happen, carefully running building is just slow and tedious. Or maybe it's just as tiresome. Director John Murlowski may have done more to increase the tense atmosphere that is associated with the mirror than to make it flicker red and make loud "evil" voices lacking any subtlety. There were times when his characters seemed quite unspoken by their qualities. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we? Which is a shame, because the 'New Generation' has more than a cast. I wanted to watch it until I saw the name "Julia Nickson" in my credits. She took my attention as I always did, and if anything, I was upset that her part wasn't more extensive. Terry O'Quinn was just as charismatic and unused again. Partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits into the early 90s of the exaggerated wood-shaking hero, and when I'm not sure he really needed it, it's not like someone's doing Ibsen. The kits are also worthy of note, ranging from a dramatic drawing to fill the Suki's room, to claustrophobic corridors emerging in flash / supernatural sequences. Obtaining the appearance of these rights is particularly important given the fact that certain sequences repeat throughout the film to simulate fragmented memories. Murlowski is more of a visual director than an actor or horror director. Unfortunately, it should be a horror movie, after all. <br /> <br /> 'New Generation' sees the same race running for the third time in 4 years. To do this, add a lack of direction where it really needed, and the whole effort won't stay as high as it should. However, it should be recognized for its strong ties to source material and some good actors, not necessarily their best lessons. Frankly, the ideal person for this is someone who has not seen any of the continuations of 'The Possession', for which the story will not be such a massive journey deja-vu.
