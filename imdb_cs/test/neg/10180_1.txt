This is the third movie in a month I watched it didn't go as I expected. The first two are The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, none of which gave any new ideas about who committed the crimes. I've always had a fascinating UFO and I was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of a UFO investigation that wasn't a comedy. But after about 30 minutes it all went terribly wrong. I could stand up for acting, for camera angles, for stereotypes if there was a good UFO hunt story, but nowhere. I'm not saying anything would be wrong with the subject, but Netflix shifted this film as a UFO skeptic and a believing UFO that has examined several sitings. I stopped looking halfway. I can't believe I've spent so much time with this. Please don't make the same mistake.
