I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad. I was surprised that someone was taking it seriously. Characters are one-dimensional, even good guys and especially bad guys. The only credit is that it's so lame it's funny. Actually, for me, there is another advantage of being shot in a state park not far from where I live, so seeing some local sights on the big screen is hooves. The leading character is an off-duty cop, and makes a big point of a good guy lecture that vigilante justice is not just a bad idea, it's against the law. Imagine how long it takes ... <br /> <br /> Most of the characters in Northern California film are blown dried Hollywood balls, they look like they have never been in the fight. The story is completely predictable. This film is mature for MST-3K lampooning. CAMP only. I am quite forgiving movies in general, but seeing the old positive reviews I had to talk to. This is a dog. I'll give it 3 out of 10, and then just laugh.
