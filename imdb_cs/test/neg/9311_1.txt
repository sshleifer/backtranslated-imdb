I feel stupid after watching the first 20 minutes, fortunately I went out and saved the rest of the brain, people should watch better movies and note why they are highly rated, not because of movie budget or special effects. just simply doing good things and getting simple things right, and what's important - it's not LAME-- but I think it was made for those tasteless sheep and not a guide to what's a '' good movie '' Fear of low rating movies, save your underestimated high scores for movies once in a lifetime. Keep in mind that many people use IMDb to trust reviews and opinions, do not spoil the broth by sugaring Peace & love grass
