The film has strange unpleasant characters, a strange inexplicable grotesque and an insurmountable dialogue about smoking. The film has a fictional plot of scathing, empty female head (Jeanne Tripplehorn) seeking love. Although who would ever like Jeanne's character, personality, or reading dialogue, I really can't say. Besides, she likes to smoke. Sarah Jessica Parker gives an interesting character (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott tries to look nice and soulful (as he smokes). And hey, what is Jennifer Aniston doing there? Oh, actually, it's not enough to take care of her. (But she likes to smoke). This is a waste of time. I don't even know how I managed to sit in as much film as I did. I can't even believe I spent time writing this, except to warn others of its banality. Who needs a cigarette?
