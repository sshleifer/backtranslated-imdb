Steven Segal's film career is a tribute to a horrible film. Each of them was tragically bored as soon as I realized they were even more unrealistic than Jean Claude VanDamme. Has anyone else noticed that he would never get ?! I mean, give me some roots ... a hard-fought battle with a bad guy who's scary. Twenty years and still filming the same battle scenes. Combat scenes can often turn you away from the fact that your hero cannot act. The boring choreography of Segal puts his painful lack of acting skills in sharp relief. Worse still, she's woefully out of shape. Just what we need is a tough stiff one who thinks he's a leading man. In all these films, ninety minutes is not even one iota of redemption of film value. Don't look at it if you don't throw away an hour and a half of your life.
