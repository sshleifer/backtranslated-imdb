In the mid-1800s, Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) emigrated to Australia to find the continent's gold share. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself on the mark and throws himself into a torture prison; There is a gang-raped. Upon release, Hopper joins the aborigine David Gulpilil (as Billy), with whom he seeks revenge on sadistic Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring), and others. Eventually revenge becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by ordinary people and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities. Hopper's "hardly human" performance certainly matches the film's discontinuity. Mr. Gulpilil embarks on a strong supportive cast. Staff involved in "Mad Dog Morgan" make it not only worth a look but also a huge disappointment. Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philippe Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, Bill Hunter, David Gulpilil
