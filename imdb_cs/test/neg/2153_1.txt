Experienced actors in this know how to act and have proven that earlier, but the director, who also wrote and produced this travesty, is incompetent on so many levels. OK. It's a low budget, but I know film students with lower budgets and lesser-known actors who can do a lot, much better. For example, because there were people involved who should know that some weapon kits were absolutely in place and never existed in those days. The stunt was clumsy - the story was musty and hockey. If someone gives you a copy, use it for track. By the way, I love westerns and I know a lot of stuntmen and even went to high school with one of the actors, so I was looking for it to be good.
