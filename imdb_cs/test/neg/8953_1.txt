This show is the worst show ever! Norris and his family write, produce, direct, etc. The only reason I saw it is because my goofy wife likes her. How many times can Norris fly through the air from plain sight to land a kick at an apparently blind villain? No trees, no building, just horror ..... air. ALWAYS solves a case or is the best in any skill it is. No star ever gets fame. It's all Norris. It's really obvious that Norris is terrible stuck on himself and won't let anyone make one into him in any scene no matter what content. Terrible playing, terrible scenario, terrible series.
