First, the "Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is not a werewolf movie. This title is a bullcrap. The story is actually about Chupacabra, which kills all the local villagers in the small town of Furlough, Texas. I suppose the distributors renamed the original title to make some extra money or something. And I think it actually works because that's why I bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. Anyway, the film is not good. It's actually bloody horrible. When I bought it, I didn't expect anything else. It's a low-budget horror movie with a monster Chupacabra. If you like a low budget horror movie with bad dialogue, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. But I have to warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This movie has some of the worst games I've ever seen. The actors are trying hard and it's totally ridiculous. They almost never say the line in the normal way. They always have this very bad tone about what they say. It's so stupid it almost looks like a scary parody. It is as if they shot every scene only once and were satisfied with it. The worst of them is the blond girl who is supposed to play bimbo. It's the worst of all. I've never seen an actor as bad as her (And I saw Pteradactyl). Even if her boyfriend dies, she can't stop being bimbo about it. I hate her. Some of the shots in this movie were actually pretty good. Those shot by day are pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the movie is shot at night when Chupacabra hits and the lighting is too dark. Gore scenes are short and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are really happy, but I like it. Chupacabra looks pretty confused and it's easy to see he's a suit guy. Overall, only extreme low-budget fans should watch this movie and it's very important that it is not possible to watch it alone because you're probably bored to death. I recommend watching this movie with friends and some beer.
