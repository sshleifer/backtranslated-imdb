Where should I start? I can't even imagine that I want to introduce this inconsistent pathetic apology. Imagine it: a boarding school where children whose parents are rolling in money are simply there to flow around the world. He couldn't get more devilish than this. <br /> <br /> If you taught these children, don't upgrade them to the term teenagers because they barely act as a homosapiens, they were focused, thinking again. About 23 minutes, it suffocated with so-called problems, boyish worries and the like. The heroine of the show, of course, Mademoiselle Zoey, played by Polly Pocket Little Miss, who is Britney. Of course, the sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, has a lot to learn about acting. However, I will give her some face because her superficial, one-dimensional character does not allow for a great depth for depth. She plays the Pacific Coast Academy's Sun, Moon and Stars, the Crusader fights for the situation of all women, equality of all sexes. Perfect in everyone, always with their two loyal sidekicks, Nicole, daffy bimbo, who obviously has too much daddy money and a hard chick, Dan, who proves a hard nut to tear. They both left the show in seasons 2 and 1, not that I blamed it. But the horror of horror comes in Lola, who is considered to be Natalie Wood's greatest actress, with green feathers in her hair and a fake tan. It's even rougher than Zoey herself, if at all possible, and worse than Nicole and hell, we know it's not possible. This show, as well as all the apologies for television programs Nickelodeon has been spewing since 2000, is a major victim of stereotypes. Get the girl side by side and densely to her best friend, what's for her Zoey, big, though ambiguous, sometimes the best friend, Chase, the cool, arrogant man, Logan, the crazy little girl that's not very clear, Nicole, which everyone thinks is weird just because he's extremely smart, nerd, Quinn, an overly dramatic, annoying but yet super slim, perfect Malibu model, Lola, and a tough but gentle woman, Dana. Where have I heard these characters? I'm sorry, but what's so bad about having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionate about science and in fact cares about her future and does well in the academic aspect, where others should also be interested in being "weird" and "nerd"? Lola at the beginning of the series proved to be a potentially great character with her harsh ways and different views of life, Zoey just had to go, pull the pitchfork, burn it at the border, return to Weird Town and all the jazz. So much for women's rights. Unfortunately, Lola just became another OC clone in her anorexic fame. Probably so as not to miss her mistress. But hey, 2000 generations of MySpace sluts seem to love Chase / Zoey's typical fairy romance, the tension between relentless, "hot" Logan and "kick-ass" Zoey or Dana, whichever you like , and nice people. "Please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a hard, shallow and ill-considered lifestyle. Sorry to divide it into sweetheart, it won't happen if you don't have a big fund trust and parents who will cushion you.
