After I couldn't ignore the hype about the show, I started watching the season one and it struck me as really good and I was addicted .... about 5 episodes, then it started spinning down. Why? First, Ethan Suplee is written to function as a complete idiot, confirming that very obviously by spewing out semi-quirky things in great expectation that he will somehow become the next best joke. Jaime Pressly has a stunning look, but if he thinks he is flexing his lips to explore parts of his face that he usually never goes to, and make strange grimaces to emphasize everything he says, he's happy on the way away. Perhaps she thought her figure was too flat, faded, and wanted her to be varied and spicy, but she flooded with colors, swept over the spice, and screamed loudly to attract attention, and my eyes, ears and intellect hurt. Indeed, I really wanted to love this show, as I said, the assumption is great, (comes from the same shelf as The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain) and Jason Lee does a pretty good job here, along with some of the other actors But there is no way I would get 'sucked in' and forget that it's just a show because Pressly and Suplee are unreal, extreme characters suddenly wake me up when they appear. It is worth noting that their characters and performances would be fine if it were a series of something other than seventy, and if they didn't get as much time on the screen.
