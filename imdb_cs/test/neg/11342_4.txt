Thunder Alley discovers that Fabian has banned NASCAR's tracks after causing another driver's death. Stanley Adams would like to put him in his team of riders, but the other riders aren't worth it around. Desperate for a job Fabian joined Jan Murray's car seat, who pays him peanuts and tries to get the Fabian bad rep. He has to take it, but Annette Funicello, who has Murray's daughter, is another reason why stick. The rest of the movie is Fabian's fight to get back into the NASCAR circuit while juggling with Annette. and his current friend Diane McBain. Personally, I'd marry McBain, she has it all over Annette. Thunder Alley is helping the location of filming on NASCAR's southern tracks and good movie footage of NASCAR races. It didn't help a somewhat stupid story that plunged into the real reason for Fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from the same. NASCAR fans could go for it.
