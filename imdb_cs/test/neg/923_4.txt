As a recent convert to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which made me watch all the episodes of the season, I expected more, much more than Jeff's efforts. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie that offers a piece of the average movie "Joe's Life" I need reasons to care, care, feel and trust. And with Jeff Garlin at the helm I also expected to hear a lot of comedy moments. This film failed me again and again. Jeff plays with his mom's life, a chubby sad bag that is a social disaster. For many years he had no real or casual relationships. He seems to be mostly unemployed, and, as has been said, shacks with his mother the most expensive. Can things get worse? Sure. In short order, everyone around him, including Silverman, Second City (his comedy) and his agent. All this reinforces the condition of his "loser". Silverman's "greasy" experiment was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of "Marty" as a means of salvation of his career also hits a big dead end. While the last moments of the movie offer a look at the better things to get on the film, though with occasional golden flashes, it is unfortunately missing.
