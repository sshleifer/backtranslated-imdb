Based on David Ignatius's 2007 spy novel, The Body of Lies tells the story of CIA operator Roger Ferris (DiCaprio), who is sent to Jordan to trace al-Qaeda's spirit while following a narrow line of loyalty to his Jordanian hosts and his manipulative American chief Ed Hoffman (Crowe). Anyone who has seen trailers could be forgiven for the story revolving around the action of two agents and betrayal by Ferris Hoffman, but the real story is much more luminous. Instead, we served a lukewarm broth of ridiculous shelter as a white handsome boy American Ferris moves with virtual impunity over the teeming streets of Amman Jordan with a nary worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of locals' attention. Only during a scene where Ferris takes his newly found Iranian tea-tea, the reality is disrupted because the couple is bombarded by the eyes of Jordanian men. like nothing more than padding. Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris is expelled from Jordan, Ferris flies to Washington, Ferris flies to the UK, Ferris flies back to Jordan, Hoffman flies to Jordan, Hoffman returns home to take care of his children? it goes. This is the kind of thing you expect in The Amazing Race episode, not a spy thriller. <br /> <br /> In a body that values ​​loyalty to its craft, Crowe has earned an impressive 63 pounds of loaf. role portals Ed Hoffman, thus linking a small selection of actors club consisting of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale as thespians who have undergone massive weight gain or loss for their roles. It's too bad that all the other participants didn't share Crowe's level of devotion to quality, because if they did, we would have a much better film on our hands than this partial par.
