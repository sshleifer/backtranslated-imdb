This was the second MST3K'd movie I have ever seen, and still holds a place in my heart as one of the most horrible horrible movie experiences you'll ever have. Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is using his carved figures to score another payment on his mortgage for his apartment. It is stiff, wooden and unconvincing, but still meets a cool, sympathetic guy and at least is photogenic. That's the only decency I can tell about the movie, so I thought I'd get it out of the way. The fact that he's in the film adds another point to the score and stores it from being "1 out of 10". In no particular order are there examples of how badly this film is composed: <br /> <br /> 1) OK, clone Tanya Roberts (Mila) is looking for "country ends" to find Ator, which takes 3 minutes of screen time, including the time they spend stumbling around the dying of poisoned arrows in their shoulder (which I would assume would slow it down quite a bit). So Ator will heal her and take Thong's trustworthy help and embark on a journey back to her castle ... and continue the next 50 minutes of a movie that is recovering from the land that Mila was driving in 3 minutes. How does it work??? I know that the intrepid crew is bothered by magic forces and enemies, etc. On the way back, but still ...! 2) Apparently the writer / director felt the need to add "depth" to the film by adding a run of debate / Socratic dialogue / game of 20 questions between Zor (the average John Saxon wannabe) and the wise man Akronas (Richard Harris wannabes). But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training from Hallmark cards, T-shirts and stickers, and doesn't understand the pace, pace, or timing ... and the actors. (Crow's note during one of these exchanges is a line for my entry). Scenes with these two pulls and pulls bring the film into a screeching stop and kill any momentum or excitement generated by the sword fight and searching for the heroic trio. 3) Once Ator arrives at the castle (and is captured), things go further down the hill. Zor decided to feed a lot of female victims, along with Ator and Mila, to the Serpent of God, who he holds in the cellar. This scene had some potential for excitement, so the director instantly kills the potential by instilling on the stage all the drama of the people waiting in line at the DMV to pay for the traffic. Ator continues the great battle with the snake, which is hardly more convincing than the battle of Bela Lugosi with a puppet of a rubber octopus in "The Monster Bride". 4) The top scene in which Ator devises a hang glider from twigs and animal skins is so obviously stupid that he completely blows the viewer out of the film and makes you a roll on the floor. he laughs until your sides hurt. 5) Oh, yes, and the filmmakers decided to include the atomic explosion footage at the end, with the moral that Ator decided to destroy the 'atomic core' of McGuffin, which drives the film, because humanity is 'not ready'. ("Zzzzip! MESSAGE COMING IN !!!") Just like "Monster Bride" again, it comes to think. All he needed was observer observation: "manipulated the domain of God." <br /> <br /> 6) For some reason, the movie version I have seen is introducing and closing homo-erotic credit sequences that have nothing to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. I have no idea where this record came from, but in reality it is much bigger than the real movie it has. Watch it only if you are a big fan of Miles or if you like the way MST3K skewers material like this.
