One IMDb reviewer calls Eaten Alive, who is capable of "cannibal expert". Are there people like that? I did not know that. But if you are one of them, hey, you have the ball. The rest of you may find that this impudence is a little hard to swallow (pun), even though, like me, you consider yourself a horror movie expert. I have been a passionate horror fan for about 15 years, even though I never got into a cannibal subgenre a few weeks ago, and I think I owe my short interest in these films that stimulate moans, strangely enough Chinese. completely ignore copyright. You see, I bought a two-component DVD collection of all Wesley Snipe's films for 20 yuan (about $ 2.75), which turned out to be the last cannibal world, the mountain of the cannibal god, eaten alive, cannibal holocaust, another, with Nicholas Cage, and something like Voodoo Lagoon, along with Blade 1-3, in Chinese. Nice. When I was the second sequel, I immediately got into a sinking feeling as the film opened with a cannibal in street clothing, wandering around big American cities, shooting unsuspecting Americans with poison darts, and then full speed up. After running out of ways to keep scary movie cannibals, they seem to have reached the mainland now. Later, you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on "training". Lock your daughters! Before the film settles into an old missing sister, a young blonde woman named Sheila begins her own exploration of the disappearance of a sister who in no way looks like her, but is willing to spend most of the film naked, so I think it does not matter. It seems that after filming one of his victims, the unhappy cannibal we met in the movie and who wasn't used to living in the city, he hit the road and was hit by a moving van. Brilliant police force will find a mysterious piece of film on it that shows Sheila's sister, who was involved in some bizarre ritualistic behavior, but in addition to the film, the man is a complete secret. As an enthusiastic police chief, he laments, "we know nothing about him except that he is dead!" Poor, all of this has to be a headache. I recommend taking a nap. Fortunately, Sheila is the girl who can throw tens of thousands of dollars, as if there was nothing to find her sister. Perfect for hiring a rough backwoods guide cartoon because the police is clearly going to have no help. Obviously, nothing new is added to this miniature sub-genre. On the contrary, cannibalism almost appears to be the backdrop of a completely different kind of bad film, the rescue of a missing person from dangerous elements. Strengthening the plot of the line of clothes is not difficult, all you have to do is add to the cartoon jungle the cult of people who follow a guy called Jonas who believes in using pain as a way to reconcile man with nature, the process of calling "cleansing" ". Personally I prefer to just urinate outdoors. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Sheila is caught by one of the cult members - an obese guy who seems to have married a three-day weekend. from the office appears in this movie. When he pulls out his loyal medical kit to give her an injection, he warns her, "If you don't believe in Jonas and cleanse (through pain), God will help you." Then he gives her a chance, and when she gets out of a tiny pinch, she polite her apologizes. In this boy I feel a true believer! As far as gore is concerned, there are plenty of nasty sound effects over the random shots of animals that are being slaughtered, and more than enough of the disgusting shots of women being cut and eaten. alive, so I think the movie lives up to its name. Acting is incredibly bad as you can expect, and it's interesting that editing is also spectacular, but still strangely effective. Unfortunately, I think you have to be able to relate to people who believe in absolutely crazy cults so that they can all be involved in the film. There is a lot of exotic religious ceremonies that are taking place, making it more and more difficult to understand why Sheila's sister decided to turn her back to normal society. I'm for individualism and doing my own thing, but I'm coming. After a while, the film descends even further into its basic run of the Mill Escape film, just before we see the worst improper rendition of Glory, Glory Hallelujah in film history. WOW. Note: In this movie, a woman is raped by a snake. If you need more reasons not to look for it, seek professional help. Avoid this mess at all costs.
