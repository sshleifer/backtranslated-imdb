I hate a movie that doesn't end. I don't care how good or bad the rest could be, I wouldn't like to be without a conclusion. Such shows should insist on exclusion of liability ... something like: The movie you are about to watch has no end or is so ambiguous that it is not convincing. <br /> <br /> In the film, the last scene we left is with Dee and Dominic, who are a bit behind and he says, almost unfortunately I thought it couldn't be him because his fingers were either girls or baby . NEEDS! Well, a smoke weapon, so to speak, is in Dee's son's hands, but what about Dominic's daughter? Actually, I thought we might find it was her! Anyway, if you don't like unclear movies, then I would avoid this. Otherwise, I thought the movie was generally good.
