Ignore the extreme voices of "House of Wax", it is by no means either "1" or "10". I will try to help anyone who thinks about seeing the "Wax House" or for those who have seen it as a trailer and felt deceived. The trailer makes this movie look very hopeful, which is what they have to do with trailers. There is certainly only one thing with trailers if manufacturers can't put together one minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it's a certain thing that the film is the main shit. But a good trailer just tells you a few things about the movie is good, it doesn't give you much idea of ​​the overall package. Little research can be valuable here. The "Wax House" star Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than her Canadian colleague Sarah Polley or her look-up Rose McGowen) was directed by formerly known artist Jaume, in her feature debut . These are not good grades, but if you are like me, you ignore them and go to see the work of Grace Walken's producer, who was responsible for the "Ghost Ship" look. Again, Walken's work is worth seeing, so much so that it looks like 90% of the movie's $ 30 million budget went into production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuses she has to take away in the entire film (finger cut, lips glued, tied, and plenty of wading in all sorts of screeds). By-the-bye, Cuthbert looks considerably harder than she in "The Girl Next Door", about one big pig-out away with a lot of weight problem. <br /> <br /> What it meant was that they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging from what was on the screen, it could be true. It looks like everyone else has devoted their time to getting their first act or crew. Whether it was inexperience or jealousy about the pay gap, the contributions of all these inexperienced / incompetent volunteers are less than zero. <br /> <br /> Inexperienced work by Steven Steven Windows was about as terrible as you probably see and work in the league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert "Pearl Harbor" here) they manage to take away most of the value added design group . Rather than abstaining and showing off files, the window filmed this thing with poor lighting and jerky-zoom-moving camera work. Negran has linked this problem to a crazy amount of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, camera-like ADD, and veil cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when film power is just its expensive and detailed set. Chan Hayes has made the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as a writer, though there is absolutely no resemblance to the name and use of wax figures. One saving mercy is that the film is not taken seriously as a horror movie and is mostly parody (insert "Van Helsing"). Murders are played for laughter, too extreme to be scary or even scary to anyone over six. Especially the audience crackled when a hotel's high heiress got his home face over a steel bar, though her former half-baked striptease was the only ghostly thing in the movie. Another comic peak was when Cuthbert pushed his finger over the grate and had a bad guy cropped. Good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a wax that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, linked twins and lots of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets into the bath). All this is supposed to happen somewhere in Florida, though many of the hills seem like Paul Hogan's country (Scout Scouts' position - the Gulf Coast is not known for its terrain). The scenario apparently intended to play a connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production, most of the dialogue on that modification was modified. Because what's left of the double connection doesn't make sense and doesn't go anywhere, you wonder why it wasn't reduced to reduce the boredom factor. Especially sad is that manufacturers have no brains to recognize in middle production that they have ingredients for classic horror classics - even with the current cast. What looked at them in the face was the possibility to go wax somewhere with the illusion of the city. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is naturally naturalistic, almost without exception, prone to creating the illusion of reality. Here they had the opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. As well as impressionist painting, the city creates the illusion of reality from a distance, but turns out to be highly stylized wax processing close up. Of course they would have to find a visionary director and DP to do this, but everything else was in place to make it happen.
