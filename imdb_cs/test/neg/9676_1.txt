NBC should be ashamed. I wouldn't let my kids see it. I would definitely tell my church to keep on going. This film proves why NBC has always been the 3rd speed network Producers, actors and writers should get to their knees and ask God forgiveness for doing this fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife did not stand aboard the ark. The Ark did not have decks. When this event took place, Lot was not born. Has anyone tried to read the Bible about this project? More than two animals of each type were collected. Read the story in Genesis. How could anyone bring it to the screen, small or big!
