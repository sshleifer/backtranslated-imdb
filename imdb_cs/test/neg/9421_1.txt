The WEAPON novel, which serves as the basis for this terrible piece of garbage, is one of the best techno-thrillers to go on pike after a long time. The character of SOLO, who is not supposed to look like a man, is an amazing Creation and it was just horrible to see him diminish to another Terminator-clone where Mario Van Peebles is trying to "act" like a robot. Nothing is worth it on this movie. Why Hollywood Insists to Take the Right to Excellent Novels and then Beat Them? With SOLO there are so many bad things that make their list seem unfair because it invites a man without legs to a quick Hopscotch game. Avoid this horrible movie and look for 2 ROBERT MASON novels that have the amazing SOLO character. The books are WEAPON and an excellent sequel to SOLO.
