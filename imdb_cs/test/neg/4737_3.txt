Anyone watching "Alien vs Predator" must have known that the "Alien Quadrilogy" convention was not exactly matched to the film. Among some unusual elements, the rapid growth of aliens seemingly a matter of minutes, extraterrestrials with extremely long tails, and so on. However, the idea of ​​Predator, which encourages the building of a city and temple to create hunting, would be so appealing that I could not resist. I was hoping that the end of the film would not be the impulse of this sequel and I was unfortunately wrong. For those who forgot how the first movie ended, Alien, who carried the features of both species, had a dead Predator in his chest. <br /> <br /> I'm just going to go through a list of "good" and "bad" features for this movie. Good: A lot of wonderful people, especially men. Bad: a lot of beautiful people meet both the Predator / Alien mutant and the Predator. The Good: An Interesting Idea of ​​Predator. Bad: Inconsistent scale of the city. Its a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated (read: big city) sanitation, and homeless. Is it a small town or city? The police are one sheriff and three deputies, or so I counted. Good: Um .... <br /> <br /> Bad: Why do these foreigners / predators grow so fast? They appear to grow at full size in five minutes. I mean ... what are these things ... Chia Pet Aliens ??? And when we're on this subject, why is Alien inside the Predator's body mutated, but Alien in the human body? It makes sense? Good: Still thinking ... <br /> <br /> Bad: Why would only one predator come? And why pour the acid on all the remnants of "aliens" but decide to murder the cute deputies, and then skin it and hang it upside down. So much for being incognito! The Good: Ah ... I'm stuck. I think there's a lot of loud sounds! Bad: How do these mutated foreigners / predators spread? They seem to find a pregnant woman, and in the kiss-type movement, she puts several offspring in the woman's body. Yeah, exactly what you want to see, huh? Pregnant women who have their bodies explode into mutant aliens - as if the previous method wasn't rough enough !!! I don't think there's an Alien Queen either. The Good: Did I say the guys in this movie are beautiful? Bad: When a nuclear facility blows out buildings, how does a helicopter manage to survive an explosion? And how uncomfortable it is for one of the passengers to scoff at the pilot: "I told you not to fall!" Because of the nuclear fallout, when he wakes up in the morning, he won't have any hair! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think you got a message. Mutated Alien / Predator breaks through the dead Predator's body, grows in minutes, kills all predators and can break down on the ground. More mutant Alien / Predators arise while SIMPLE Predator comes to the ground to destroy this new mutant species. Predator kills people. Mutant Alien / Predators kills people. People are killing people. In this movie, is it a person who? First, I suggest you skip this sequel.
