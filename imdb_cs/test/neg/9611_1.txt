What happened to performances with unified parental characters? Parents in this show are almost as irresponsible as children. Instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative, they got away with the murder. When it comes to dealing with children, they can never agree on a procedure and instead do nothing. Yeah, great plan. Ignore their behavior because they are "cute". This show tells the already manipulative preteens who observe that the "division and conquest" technique is the best way to get your parents to the "cave". The oldest children are constantly running around and getting into all sorts of impossible situations, but their actions have no consequences. Yeah, great TV right.
