Okay, the hippies are probably interested in what I have against "education" and "informative" shows like "Barney"? Well, I have a lot of hatred about it: <br /> <br /> 1. She teaches that having a personality and individualism is immoral. Nobody at the show has a personality. Everyone dresses similarly, speaks the same, acts the same and dances similarly. Even in an episode called "Being an Individual", kids try to tell Barney what they like and everyone on the planet should do what I like. Do you want to teach your child that being an individual is bad? 2. "A stranger is a friend, you haven't met" Episode. While seemingly harmless, the show's producers soon discovered that it could also be extremely dangerous to young children. In fact, several young Barney lovers from across the US have fallen victim to pedophiles who have used the friendly message of the show to attract children from their parents. The episode has since been pulled, but the damage was done. So-called "innocent" programming errors like this clearly show why parents need to watch TV with their children. 3. If your still not happy, you're a bad person. No one seems to show any other emotions, but happiness, no matter where they are. If the child's parents go crazy or sad for some reason, the child may think of his mom or dad differently. It's not good news at all. 4. Magic solves everything! Every problem seems to be solved by magic. At least in a show like "Fraggle Rock", he teaches us that the CAN spell is the best thing to do, it's best to solve problems on your own. Does Barney teach it? No, of course not. There must be magic. The problem is that many two-year-olds can't tell fantasy from reality and can think that their parents, siblings, or relatives can use magic to solve everything, yet they're confused when they can't use magic and think they're strange. He pulled another boner again. 5. Barney does not distinguish between theft and sharing. Even explicitly said that "theft is okay if the person you steal doesn't mind". Children can learn that if you really want something, stealing is an absolutely acceptable way to get it. This is not something preschoolers need authority data to tell them. 6. "If I'm right, I can solve all my problems." Whenever children have a problem, Barney gives them everything they need to solve it. The message we send here is "Don't try to solve it! It's too much work and the solution wouldn't work anyway. Just use it." For this reason, children could stop thinking through things (Barney said it was too much work) and became addicted to the "right" object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine ...) That's good news for Barney traders, of course, but it's not good for preschoolers. 7. A report that cheating is fine. In another episode, children are involved in a contest carrying a peanut on a spoon without dropping it. One child lays peanut butter on a spoon and wins easily. The child is then rewarded for his creative thinking when the child actually bent the rules and changed the game to win. This teaches that cheating is good, you win and people think you are creative when you are often disqualified in real life, or worse, and don't really like other competitors who play by the rules. 8. Do the kids in this show eat something other than cakes, candy and candy? This teaches that it's okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy foods, despite Barney's so-called "Healthy Eating". Besides, everyone in the show eats junk food. No wonder there are so many obese children in America and Europe. <br /> <br /> Most of the other kids' TV programs learn to solve creative problems well without having to resort to "magic." Barney could also do it but instead decided to use a method that was A) Best for Traders and B) took the least time and money for scripts. It's a glaring sale that shows how little Lyons Group cares for children. This is all for you.
