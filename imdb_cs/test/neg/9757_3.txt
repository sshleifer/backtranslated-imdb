Teenage Exorcist is one of those divine films that make the viewer all expectations of decent entertainment for sexual antiquity, adolescent humor and blank writing. This film brings exactly what it was trying to bring. It is a girl who moves to a house where Baron de Sade once lived (hmmm) and eventually was pulled by his own inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law, along with an Irish priest, her boyfriend and a pizza boy, are trying to save her and drive her demon out. Well, not much here in the form of horror or tension. In fact, one line of the movie pretty much sums up what to expect. Mike (her brother-in-law) tied her up (by the way her name is Diane and played with Brinke Stevens) after trying her sister's chainsaw. He removes the gag from his mouth and says something like, "This is not the last gag we see tonight." It really wasn't. Special effects are curvy and poorly crafted, and the film uses this by playing on his comedic appeal. Some lines and situations are funny. Robert Quarry, the old earl of Yorga himself, really steals his scenes as an Irish priest. It cries into the lamentations of Bible verses and the singing of Irish songs. You know you're in trouble when Eddie Deezen gets top billing. Deezen does his schtick and has a couple of nice moments too, but the material is just too unreal than being anything more than a teen sophomoric time filler. Michael Berryman of The Hills Have Eyes also has a short but interesting movie portrait. As for the other thespians, well, they're all pretty good at being average enough. Stevens is beautiful in fishnet stockings and French cut panties. Her sister plays Elena Sahagun and shows a little more than Brinke (by the way a very beautiful young lady) and performs miles away from Brinke. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity. Again, it is not a bad movie to waste a little time that involves no thinking on. If you're a Robert Quarry fan, watch his performance at least.
