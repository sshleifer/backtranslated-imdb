I enjoy watching Robert Forster. That was the main reason I rented this movie. I also wanted to see a story that takes place in the middle of nowhere, where the characters could get away from each other without distraction. Unfortunately I found out that the movie is boring. I couldn't care about characters. I wasn't interested in a story that seemed to be moving nowhere. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie for an hour, I turned it off. I will rate the film 4 out of 10. It falls deep under the mandatory 7 ratings that makes the film worth watching.
