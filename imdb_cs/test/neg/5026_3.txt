Let me put it right from the start. I hate this show. Actually, I quite like some aspects. In fact, when I first started watching, I quickly became addicted. I was just starting out from the entire "anime is for children" stereotype and I was interested in the mature elements of the show. Unfortunately, after seeing the whole series and several movies, I can say that my overall layout has changed, and it falls into almost all the pitfalls that plague "bad" anime. Seven or eight friends and I started watching this series on TV. By the end, only one friend and I were still watching and neither of us liked it. <br /> <br /> Let me explain the plot to you. You can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. Kagome is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical well near her family sanctuary. When the kagome comes out of the well again, she was transported back in time to the feudal era of Japan. He meets many other characters and forms a group of five or so companions who embark on a journey of revenge / justice / groping in one sign case =). Overall, he tries to restore pieces of sacred jewelry that increases the power of demons who use it. While there are many, many side stories and arcs of stories, there are not enough. material to occupy 167 episodes. The only arc of the story that is interesting enough to look at is still a little boring (a group of sevens). After half the way in the series or perhaps before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and who made the series decided instead to put in tens and dozens of fill episodes. These episodes have little to no impact on the story and rarely on the characters. In some cases, some characters that had an important role in the story disappear for dozens of episodes at once. Many episodes follow exactly the same cutter patterns as the stories before him. Inuyasha shoots at the enemy's wind-scar. Windscar bounces. Horror signs gasp. The enemy has a barrier. The characters spent three episodes trying to kill the enemy before Kagome finally fires a sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust. <br /> <br /> Also ** MAIN SPOILER: CONCLUSION WILL BE RETURN ** The lack of any conclusion seems to give up 83 hours. <br /> <br /> ** MAIN SPOILER OVER ** <br /> <br /> The animation itself is above average and in some cases excellent. Still, the reused animation cells bother most of the action scenes, and it's very hard to ignore them when it's clear that exactly the same boulder has passed around the character five or six times in a row. Turn on the brighter side however, all the characters are very well developed and the romance between some characters was really captivating. Also, character patterns (appearances) were brilliant and occasionally among the best I saw, especially with the band Seven. There is no lack of Cosplay opportunities. Still, I was hoping that the character would only die by moving on the land. And some of the show's humor is used over and over again. One particular joke (fitting a boy) is found within the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes. Although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to understand why it has a huge following, the series seems to be dominated by the obsessed fans of the girl who drool over Sesshomir and InuYasha. Bottom Line: Definitely worth checking out, but it's not worth watching the whole series. The first 30 episodes are very clever, original and enjoyable for everyone. But after that, it just becomes boring and boring. Watching a TV show should never feel like a chore, but somehow this series is reaching. Don't expect too much from "InuYasha" because you'll just feel left.
