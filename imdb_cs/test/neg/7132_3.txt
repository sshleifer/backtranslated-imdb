I'll start by saying I loved the original Grudge. It wasn't one of the most frightening, furry experiences I've ever had in the cinema. I am not joking. Being a self-declared japanophile also made the film look better in my eyes (if the setting was changed to any American suburb I'd probably end up hating the movie). <br /> <br /> That said. This movie is utter mess! I'm not going to say it's angry because A) the movie has some good points, B) "sucks" is the weakest in the history of lame put-downs. So what does the film do? Well, for starters it has a pretty cool look: through filters and the use of bleak, washed out paint, Takashi Shimizu almost restores the positive, anxious-ridden atmosphere of the original. Several scenes are really shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just bad. Period. The story is everywhere, unnecessarily Tarantino's style, that means scenes are out of chronological order. This technique is unnecessary for this movie and makes things confusing. Frankly, a straightforward plot would work better. The original also lacked fence-wise, but it made sense and the film more than formed for its thin plot with lots of frightening and truly tense atmosphere. Grudge 2 has none of these elements and it's just a waste of time. Let's not forget the acting skills of TV shows that portray Grudge's original look as Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. Simply put, the movie doesn't work. It's too slow, too blunt, and it's just not scary enough to replace the confusing plot (which, by the way, adds nothing to the story, so Grudge fans won't be happy either). And what about an old man playing Japanese peek-a-boo on a bus? Is it supposed to be a comical relief? An artistic statement? Or what?
