I am an Atheist. History and truth mean a lot to me. This film is made after a 1921 novel that is still being updated to this day as if it were a historical book. It's not so. The film is about fifties novels. Some actors were GREAT, but it doesn't cover the plot. In a short person, he inventes a super bomb, so God and his friends hold the tribunal to see if they have to intervene. The analogy of the devil persecutes man and for the defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man? And why was Adam the first defendant? In the end, you will only get American Christian propaganda in the 5th year of the historical book. Although other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is being explored. First we get to the story of a cave man. Women are poor stereotypes of damsels in need. Real cave women were as strong as men and equally resilient. Hard times, hard life, adaptation and survival. All this is weakened by stereotypes in the middle of the century. Furthermore, we get the first pyramid structure of Egypt. Today we see a different story, and we know that there were far fewer deaths and regular citizens at work. The loss of this number of lives in this process would be a national catastrophe and no one would try to beat it. As if there was only one pyramid. The part about Moses and one true God was as if the Spanish Inquisition had asked nicely. The Inquisition itself never mentioned in the film. Helen from the Trojan Evil was so ugly that I couldn't see why she was so interested. In fact, they were just soldiers, following the orders of the commanders who "discussed" the political issue of power. It was just an excuse. Cleopatra's story was when I saw that this film was inaccurate and full of propaganda. This brother was LOT younger. She wasn't obsessed with poison, was educated enough to restore the library's contents, and was politically competitive to get rid of Egypt from dirt. Yes, Rome burned down. Yes, there was persecuted Christianity. But the way they portray it is as if the coliseum were being built and there was no Vespasian to restore Rome. The crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the Crusades to the east of Russia, which ended in an ironic battle. The knights have just returned home and have fun. Many things are postponed as no internal peeling, hygiene and wounds. Then they cover Joan from Ark where she always has a lot of makeup and looks like princes. Territorial policy has been replaced by an unfair court. The seat on the chair itself makes me ask how somebody can go here. On this burning I wanted to shout "Hura! Now I'm dying! Cheap special effects, where is the fire?". By the time they mentioned Leonard, I already had a movie. Columbus, the Spanish defeat of America, roaring Queen Elisabeth "Dig the Spanish Army" and so on and so on. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last movie of all three Marks brothers. And they only got the scene with Manhattan and Indians. Funny, but no more than a smile. Witch hunts are briefly mentioned, as are wounds (after the Renaissance). When they begin to display revolutions, things become powerful and anarchist. The American Revolution was followed by the French Revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just throw an old way out of anger, you have to replace it. They replaced the French monarchy with a new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. However, they replace his motives with unity, and the band only gives him the title "Emperor". Conquest in Europe, defeat in Russia is thrown into Waterloo. American Civil War, English Rich Inventors (Tesla Not Included). "Mr. Watson, come here, I want you," he almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. Technological hard work was weakened until the last discovery and comedic abuse. Finally, after 85 minutes, we come to world wars and organized crime, but none of his horrors. Adolph's words "I invade Russia. That is my last territorial demand" was cheerful. It was his last territorial claim. Building Tension God puts a countdown clock to the doomsday on the "wall" for the last words. Any powerful cant stop for a while in space? There was no need for the persecution, but the defense was done in the last throw. As the last defense, we see the man of tomorrow. It seems to be a paradoxical person because the bomb was supposed to go today. His toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a sword for a pencil. Now is it so wrong? Pens and pencils drew so many weapon plans that her killing rate overcame an atomic bomb. And make music from a gun? Excited egoistic generals make gun music. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster. As I see it, all the defense must have been the fault of the devil as a true conspirator for the extinction of the man and the case closed. And honestly, compared to all the barbaric things, our ancestors were quite humane in the painless backstages these days. To sum up everything I quote, "Firefly Episode" "Jaynestown": "It's my guess that every man ever got a statue of him, he was one kind of son, or another, he wasn't about you, Jayne, it's about what they need.
