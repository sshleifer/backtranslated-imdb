What could have been an excellent hostage film was totally destroyed by what seems like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have ... a vampire slash-fest wasn't one of them !!! Last 45 minutes. or so the result is that the film is a totally absurd waste of time. ... and a sex machine? ... you gotta be kidding! Acting talents like Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are totally useless in this nonsensical film. Director ... Robert Rodriguez, known for his other bloody movements, including el mariachi, desperado, once in Mexico, and the recent city of sin ... really keeps your attention with the well executed first half .. which leads you to believe that you are in a fun time ... but then obviously for no reason and without any provocation, the madness begins ... there are also weak attempts to parody and comedy. .. really irritated !!
