This film treads on the well-known soil - the confusion of art and reality in the life of actors. It has nothing special or interesting to say on this subject and is actually rather boring. Especially the last scene is endlessly boring. When I saw the audience crying on the "moving" gaming they see on the screen, they asked me "who thinks they're kidding?" Yet there are some good performances and interesting scenes, especially from some side characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor who gets a number of policemen pulling his performances when they come to arrest him. Christopher Walken is again playing at the top of the wacko. Don't forget his character "The Continental" on Saturday Night Live; aging eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her to bed? He makes an identical turn in the film, chasing his young (male) prey around an antique table and throwing him with champagne. Overall, this film was charming and irritating, but mostly irritating.
