As for Asian horror, I saw my share of disappointment along with some of the prettiest imaginations ... "Acacia" doesn't really qualify for any of these categories. It had a few moments of tension and it was interesting to watch, but I couldn't think that this story should be a little more. The film deals with a childless couple who decides to adopt a child who seems to be fascinated by trees. He develops a bond with Acacia Tree in his yard and seems to communicate with him. Then, during a fight with their mother concerning their newborn baby, he attacks when he threatens to find his dead mother, who is now a tree. When they don't return, the parents send a message and wait while the neighbor believes he lives in Acacia somehow. Stimulation is somewhat slow and the end is a bit weird, but I have to recommend it as a somewhat pleasant effort, although the story seems a bit flat. Damn, I can't think of it ...
