Yesterday I saw this movie with my friend. I'm 20 years old and this movie was too much for me. I can't imagine a teenager, preteen or (especially) child getting into this movie. It was rude and offensive. I was totally confused by my PG-13 rating and the insights I saw for him. Originally I saw previews on Nickelodeon, and I thought it looked pretty cute (maybe I just don't remember the preview correctly). In addition, Drake Bell (the main character of the film) plays on the television show Nickelodeon, which focuses on preteens and young teenagers. I really didn't think the movie's content would be as risky as it was. I should have done more research about it than I did. However, I hope that parents will read this movie before they take their children to see it just because Drake Bell has it. Seriously, DO NOT use your children or teenagers to see this movie. The evaluation was supposed to be R. There are tons of sexual references, links to medications and disturbing events throughout the movie. Examples: Drake Bell gets attacks of sexually charged animals, several scenes that include men who grab women's breasts, lots of profanities, Drake Bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla icing (or something like that), people stab, hit and hurt the film, and older lady and her dog get crushed. There are tons of offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. It was really humiliating for women. The movie is about the people who made the Scary movie series, so it should say something there. Please note that such films can give children and adolescents all kinds of misconceptions about sex, drugs and violence. Most children and adolescents cannot decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of his genre. But I found that children and youth will see this HORRIFYING movie. <br /> <br /> As for the overall quality of the film, I didn't think it was original or funny. He pulled in part and part of the humor was simply forced and painful. Negotiations were not so bad when he considered how bad the script was. If you are an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie, skip this or rent it.
