If I guessed your "palab", would you let me pass? - Asks William Geld, Tim Robbins, who behaves as if they were telling him a fantastic joke and trying not to laugh. Trying to get into the forbidden area. The woman who stopped him was still fooling: - Your "palabra" is Carrefour. <br /> <br /> - How do you know? - The lady asks, surprised. He answers in the name of Wisdom: - I heard you not speaking. : / <br /> <br /> Yes, it defines the movie. Exactly. It doesn't matter whether Carrefour is a "road link" in French, or whether the future is cold bureaucratic and blending languages. Or if Samantha Morton has nothing, nothing in Spanish (Maria Gonzalez is her name in the movie) with her Irish, Scottish anything. <br /> <br /> It's boring and boring. If you fall into the belief that there are more symbolic symbols, you will buy the most bizarre, worst love relationship that takes place in the future, which can be in seven seconds. I can guess that this film is a palabra: it will be "painful".
