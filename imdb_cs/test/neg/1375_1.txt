Carlos wants to make fun of affirmative actions, racial stereotypes and related topics at his show, which makes him a lot like the Supreme Court Judge Thomas. He is in front of his race and then defamates him. He may say he is making fun of Mexicans to no end because he is himself a Mexican, and I would also argue that he can get away to make fun of mentally challenging because every lay person can say it's not the sharpest tool. although he is certainly an instrument of some sort. He is a hack comedian who, even with the writers' staff, is unable to make 3 minutes of really funny material in 30 minutes. I can't think of a single comedian who's on TV on a regular basis that Carlos can hold a candle, except maybe Larry Cable Guy (not surprisingly, also has a show on Comedy Central not to doubt the same audience). <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen greats, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart etc. talk about comedy, you really feel like it's a lot of work and thoughts that evolve in a fun comedy voice. All these works have been completely omitted Mencia, his comic voice is partly stolen from other better comics and partly hidden by his tendency to shout his unfair rehashed racist tribe. "I don't mind badly crowd", which I firmly believe to look at to feel better out of his praise about stupid society, unfortunately Carlos and his fans are part of the problem, not the solution on the subject.
