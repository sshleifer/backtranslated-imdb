Genre: Cartoon short without dialogue, African girl and lion. Main characters: Inki, lion and minah. What Happens: A lion wants to eat an African girl named Inki. There is also a somewhat confusing bird of Minah. Is it on Inki, or on the lion's side ..? <br /> <br /> Message: Erm ?? My thoughts: I agree with Lee Eisenberg, it is rather on poor African people. !! :-( I like how the main character is, Inki (who is an African girl), pretty nice main character, but still showing it roughly and doing it to a younger audience not just because she is HUNTING !! GRRR CHARLES M JONES! The lion doesn't like it very much and I think the minah bird is ALL RIGHT (I suppose) in the future I personally prefer the Looney Tunes of Charles M. Jones. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch it anyway, then I recommend the YouTube website, just type "Inki" on the main page and you are there. <br /> <br /> I wish Charles M. Jones would be nicer Inki in this short post, so there. Recommended: People who are interested in old cartoons and / or people who just argue about You Tube.
