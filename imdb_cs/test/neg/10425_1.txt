"Wired" would have to rank as one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. Writing and directing show a staggering lack of imagination, and I'm sure most actors are always cringing when someone mentions this film. It does not work as a tribute to Belushi's unique talent, nor as an accurate description of his short life. An unthinkable mess without redemption.
