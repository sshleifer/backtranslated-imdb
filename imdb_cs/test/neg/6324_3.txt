Okay, where to start. I can't believe how many good reviews I've read here. I watched it (2004) and I had to fight not to press the stop button, I decided to continue just for all the good reviews I read. After watching it, I felt it was my duty to know about the world. First, it seems that the movie never starts, the plotline does not actually occur until about 30 minutes before the movie ends, so the viewer thinks "when it starts" So don't ever say "revenge movie" because revenge doesn't even start over half the film is already gone. In addition, the film tries to convince itself that it is a post-apocalyptic Australia. I'm sorry when I saw dusty country roads halfway through the film and the crooked letter sign didn't convince me much about it, even for 1979 it wasn't science fiction. So anyway, add it at the top of a randomly placed homoerotic overtone and you got to one miserable movie (I have nothing against homosexuals, it just wasn't needed). The only good part was the first scene, the good direction given that it was in 1979, and the other good part is how to kill the last guy. So basically I recommend watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes and enjoying a lot more than if you were sitting in all the middle items, which can lead you to make your own eyes. Don't say I warned you.
