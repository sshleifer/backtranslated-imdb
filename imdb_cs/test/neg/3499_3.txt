The crash is overcrowded, thoughtful and burnt. A great example of how to create a glitzy and confident movie with a message. Haggis tries too hard to convince and overcome in almost every category of film. He feels very much in love with his own sense of social significance and has all the softness of a jackhammer to his skull. Sure, racial relationships affect everyone and there is a lot of ambiguity, but the 'Crash' universe works by suggesting that we are all victims of our own perception of race. It's a tedious thread that repeats ad nauseum and wears its welcome within the first 30 minutes. I found out that the characters' results are not surprising and forced, and the film has forever broken and died. The fact that this movie is in the first 50 IMDb movies is a testament to the public's willingness to get suckered by Hollywood malarkey. Indeed, if you want a real "Crash" look at one of David Cronenberg: dark, twisted and original. This film plays as preaching, tiring and masochistic.
