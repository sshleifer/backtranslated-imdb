Zoey 101 is such a stupid show. I don't know if it's because snooty Jamie Lynn Spears is a prissy star or something, but I know the show sucks. It's a girl and her brother, who goes to boarding school. The jokes in this show are extremely boring and rude and I hate every single character except Chase and Lola. Hell, the jokes at this show are so rude that Jack Black looks like Monty Python. This show is undoubtedly one of Nickelodeon's worst shows, it's down there with Avatar and Danny Phantom in the shame pit, and if this show was a person of any honor, it would be a shame on herself. <br /> <br /> 1/10
