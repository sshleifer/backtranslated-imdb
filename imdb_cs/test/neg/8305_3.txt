Low budget, but still scary enough to keep your interest in another takeoff on the familiar Frankenstein story. This film is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The seductive Tania Frankenstein (Sara Bay) fresh from the medical school comes to her father's estate to find he's still on her old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) is murdered by his own creature and now his daughter decides to continue the family tradition by creating a lover herself. It's closer to being a scary melodrama than horror. Supports cast features by Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. Rainy night could intensify the atmosphere. Still a fun watch.
