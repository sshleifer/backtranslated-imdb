It's one of Shakespeare's joys that there can be no definitive performance - no single performance can be right, but some can be bad and this is. There are at least two things about Hamlet that cannot be left out: 1. His indecision and inability to take any action. For God it is what makes the game as long as it does. If you had Othello instead of Hamlet, Claudius would be dead at the end of the One. Every production must try to explain why Hamlet is delaying why it is not capable of action. 2. His sexual disgust. His total resentment at the thought of what his mother and uncle would get up in bed would fill him with utter disgust for all sexual things, and that means any relationship with Ophelia is impossible. At the slightest hint of sex, Hamlet throws. What does Gib Gibson give us? Lusty action man. If you tried, you couldn't get away from the Hamlet character. There are plenty of ways Hamlet can be played, but this is not one of them! What I don't understand is that they managed to get such good actors for the other parts - Claudius, Polonius, and so on, why they couldn't find one to play Hamlet. Mark Rylance would make a great movie in this section. This is Mel Gibson, whoever he is, totally cast the rest of the cast. And let's face it, Hamlet doesn't really work without a prince.
