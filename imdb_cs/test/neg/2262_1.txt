I am insulted and angry at the idea that the "Away with the Wind" should be continued. When I said it, I have no problem with the quality of acting or actors in this film. Performers are talented people whose talent has been wasted on this piece of waste. The noise surrounding this book and the movie is simply a futility exercise. I think it will go down as one of Hollywood's wrong movies. I do not believe that beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell should be polluted by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and the book should be on the list of the worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and filmmaking. The sad thing is that people really made this impudence.
