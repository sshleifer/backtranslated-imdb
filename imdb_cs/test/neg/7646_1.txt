The film seems to have a harsh anti-Bush report ... If yes (I didn't get it), that's all. It's a boring and useless period. Sometimes it's too serious to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not a witty, not an appealing, no exciting, not a movie. It's too much to be the opposite, and vice versa. I was amazed at how bad the film could suck. Don't think about how you look at it. I've been watching literally hundreds of movies and I've never been so compelled to write an IMDb warning. Avoid at any cost. You were warned. Even "Creation ..." is painfully boring. It's just people who talk about babbling with lots of jokes inside the camera, something like a home movie. There is even a part where the guy takes you on a tour of the food consumed by the film crew. Yet the movie is beating, I think ...
