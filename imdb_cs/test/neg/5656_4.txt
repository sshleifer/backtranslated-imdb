First ... I have to say that playing is not very good. The main character is Miranda Cosgrove, but frankly he's not such a good actress. Spencer, her brother is a much better actor. Spencer is easily my favorite character because he is probably the only one who knows how to act. Carly, on the other hand, is trying to act her heart, but ... sorry, it's just not good. Sam doesn't even get credit, I think, come ... ICARLY ... pretty confident? Freddy's not bad, I don't have a comment. I must add that Carly and her puppet Sam are changing her attitude when they go to the web cast movie, they go screaming all their lines. and that's not safe enough. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing is that it has some funny part of the show that is fun. At least this show is not boring, it has nice plots, strong enough. Many children will like it because they are not looking for shortcomings. Overall, it's a bad show, but it's not boring.
