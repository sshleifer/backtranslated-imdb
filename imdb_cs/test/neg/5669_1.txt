If you think Hannah Montana or Suite Life are at the bottom of the sitcom, then of course you never saw iCarly. Undoubtedly, iCarly is the worst show I've ever seen. From idle to low budget, he sets the show cheap, like last week's Chinese take-off boiling in an overheated car. The show revolves around a nice, energetic and "supposed" funny girl called Carly, as she and her friends have a live web show called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother, who really needs some advice or something because it's a few cells that are little brain. Plots are very ridiculous and unbearably unpleasant. But when I look at Carly and her friend Sam, their iCarly show-in-a-show is even worse. Basically, they display strange pictures and hold things in your nose as the laugh-song plays over and over again. I mean seriously, every two seconds the laughing track seems unreasonable. <br /> <br /> What is the reason for this review? you can ask. Just to ridicule iCarly? Well, yeah, but I also warn you to watch this show. Because seriously, if I had to choose between watching iCarly and Barney? No questions I would choose Barney.
