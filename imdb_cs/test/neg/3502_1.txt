What a disappointment. The story is so simple - "good guys sometimes do bad things and bad people sometimes do good things" - dressed in a racial environment to look smart, sophisticated and meaningful. It's not so. He lacks softness. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens is wired and then again if you miss an explanation. <br /> <br /> For such a film, convince and move the audience to represent the character's ambiguity and motivation and action; not simply imagining it as a series of 180 degree changes in every character's actions. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the trip I really wanted to waste more time on it, but I thought I'd stick if it improved; the big mistake I had to stop - it just got worse.
