Four LA Fedoras cops who drive a big black convertible look faintly absurd and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the dumbest looking part of that, is in charge. The writer is never able to create a spirit of camaraderie between team members and the director is unable to rip the articulation of the male mountain of Nolte. Foprget asked someone. Nolte's character lights up a cigarette, gets angry and beats the polled person. His methods do not lead him anywhere until he moves out of his handball residence into an open-mouthed, closed-mouthed residence in one place. He breaks the FBI team and throws two military officers out of the plane in flight, only with indefinite news of anger at headquarters and no punishment at all. At the end of the film, he is as helpless and muscular as he was at the beginning. How he managed to get a beautiful bitch to fall in love with him is a mystery, as is the eternal devotion and tragic feeling of betrayal expressed by his unemployed wife. Two interesting images in the picture: one, an atomic explosion, the other a huge crater, allegedly caused by a bomb. It's almost as broken and bloated as Nolte's face.
