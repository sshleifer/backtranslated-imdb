CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ outta 5 stars) A miserable apology for a movie ... that you can enjoy if you like the boring, senseless jungle movies spiced up with scenes of graphic violence. A couple of drug dealers escape from the crowd traveling to the jungles in Paraguay where they are looking for emeralds and cocaine. They meet another young traveler and his two hot babe sidekicks, one of whom is an anthropologist trying to prove that cannibalism is not and never existed. One of the two dealers turns out to be a little psychopath, and he tortures and kills a few natives to get them to tell him where they hide their jewelry. (And how could they even tell him when he doesn't say their language at first sight?) Well, the natives are not suddenly too excited about the white people in the jungle, and they're all interested in retaliatory torture. Bad behavior, bad graph and wrong direction. It's not a good moment of tension in ninety minutes. Even the special effects are not very convincing (although most of the viewers will still do a few shots). The only good scene in the whole movie is when both women are trapped in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their portrayal of the "Red River Valley". The following is a quote from the movie, but I wouldn't be surprised if many viewers at that point didn't say exactly the same thing: "God, please let her die soon. Oh, let her die soon. And let me die soon, please."
