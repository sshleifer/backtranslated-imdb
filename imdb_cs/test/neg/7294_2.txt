I'm not going to say much about this movie because there is not much to say because there is not much to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" characters are back. A few bad things about this movie is that it has terrible characters, has a terrible comedy, horrible animations and James Arnold Taylor tries to copy the amazing, single and only Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticism are that all characters are turned into something they have never been and should never be, an animation that has been reduced to the smallest extent, and finally, why would someone who did an amazing voice work for Wan Kenobi in " Clone Wars "wants to copy Michael J. Fox? I have an answer for that. Because they are the same person who thought they had to copy Eddie Murphy of Mulana in Mulan II. Yes, unfortunately it is true. <br /> <br />.
