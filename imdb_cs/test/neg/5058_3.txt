It's not a horrible movie, just crazy. The plot is deeply erroneous and unlikely. They are trying to be several genres and fail. It fails as a comedy, as a thrilling thriller and as a horror movie. Almost succeeds as science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, a cute cherub face that is, should be modeling teen clothes, not playing. The only thing that keeps this movie from being 1 of 10 is Helen Mirren. Her performance is wonderfully shameful and is (almost) worth the rest. Her ability to turn from ruthless to faux sympathetic to ruthlessly manipulate and control her prey shows a masterful range. In addition to being a wonderful Exorcist rendition, Marren is the only reason to see this movie. Solid 3.0.
