I was looking at the movie version of MST3K and this review contains small spoilers. When I started watching this movie, it looked like it might be promising, as if it were fun. he watched it become more disappointing. The first reason is quite eccentric - I liked the miserable shy girl with glasses much more than the Wanda model at the end of the movie. More deeply, it was the fact that the loss of glasses and the change of clothing replaced any real growth of the characters. Instead of growing into a character who could take care of herself, Wanda was equally dependent on men to do everything she could at the beginning of the film. Acting could have been better (even though I was tired of cracks on the Irish voice - they were even in the movie itself! And could use more explanation. Joel and the bots have done little to me, and the film could have been better without them at all.
