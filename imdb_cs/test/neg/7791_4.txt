I like Noel Coward, the joke. I like Noel Coward, the game writes. I like Noel Coward, songwriter and singer, but I hate Noel Coward, actor. <br /> <br /> For me, it's a man who was supposed to stay behind the scenes, write his games and compose and do. his deep and cheerful observations. He should never be allowed in front of the camera. Don't be mistaken, it is one of the most outstanding talents of the 20th century, but the man could not act and his voice. With that, it's rolling R and it's too round tonal quality ... well it can quite easily grate the cheese in my opinion. This is one of my favorite offers from Coward because he unconvincingly depicts a psychiatrist embarking on an affair with a much younger woman who was even worse by the fact that a much younger woman is an old school friend of her much younger wife. Celia Johnson is just as happy as ever when Cowards hurt his wife. It is her performance that will save this film from shock. I suppose her own little flirt in Coward's Brief Encounter for four years qualified her for this role because she had to raise a few eyebrows that play a promiscuous woman, and that gave her a chance to win a few fans and get some lost sympathy. She was such a wonderful actress and you can see why Noel Coward used her so much in many of her productions. However, the rest of the film is drab, poorly behaved, predictable, and dull to almost tight. If you want Noel Coward, you'll have to take the time to watch us serve instead, Blythe Spirit or The Happy Breed. Noel Coward's Three Treasures. With beautiful movies like these, I suppose we can forgive him for this turkey. I gave these four stars purely to add Miss Johnson, but on the whole I would avoid this as a plague.
