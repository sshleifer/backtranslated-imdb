I'm sick of the "open mind" argument. I'm generally quite open, but this kind of line is basically made up of people who like things that shouldn't be "used". You know, there is a reason why so many people are disgusted with this. And just because someone out there is not that small. After all, there is a reason for the feeling of disgust and no amount of "open mind" or "pushing the envelope" should remove this feeling. Otherwise we are no better than nonsensical living things. Back to the movie. Another argument is that this film puts women in roles that are normally reserved for men, which may be why they don't like it. But just because it turns out to be rebellious for more men than it would otherwise fail. Perhaps men should not be turned on by what dominates the film industry, but is it the answer for women to do the same? Maybe if you don't like movies, TV and entertainment that have so much sexual objectification of women, do not look at them so much. And if you're a director, don't you? t do them. Otherwise, someone asks for an open mind when something happens in this "movie" in real life. <br /> <br /> Surprise some people seem so much.
