Yes, I wrote it correctly. This film is so predictable that the real word needs more letters to show predictability. From the moment when the main characters and situations are presented, it is by number, where this action takes us. Prejudice was as gentle as a two-tone hammer. You can take many interviews and anticipate the role it will play at the end. It's just that the film has brought absolutely nothing new for the romantic comedy genre. Romance was lukewarm and laughter was weak and little. Sure, it's an OK movie if you have nothing to watch but nothing is missing.
