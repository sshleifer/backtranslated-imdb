As I got stuck in the flu bed and felt too rude to get to the remote control, I watched this abomination from start to finish (how many people can say that? And for anyone who can - what's your excuse?). My God, is there ever, EVER was such a total mess that a big studio had released? There is not even one second of true tension in the supposed "thriller"; the script is awkward and ridiculous; files look like they are left over from a low budget TV movie; and cast ... WHAT'S THINKING? Sally Field gives what is undoubtedly the worst and most embarrassing performance of any Oscar winner in history. Her irritating nasal trembling and silly energetic behavior in what is supposed to be a life-threatening situation are truly asinine. It is a miracle she has not used all her future revenues to buy and destroy every print of this turkey. Michael Caine, who is now endlessly pontifying the art of gaming on the screen - even running championship classes for potential fans - should be removed and shot (preferably by one of Telly Savalas). Angela Cartwright, an actress I usually love (and whose name is not even in the initial credits, poor soul), is ten years old in her role and her horrible graduate yellow prom dress must chase her nightmares to this day. Slumming is Karl Malden and Shirley Knight - hopefully they have gathered a big paycheck to help them get involved. The whole movie is a series of bad scenes, but the one that holds in my mind in particular is an explosion that results in a "ceiling" (if it is possible to mark the deck of the ship upside down) and the collapse of empty cardboard boxes sinking! Ooh, how scary! Really, really, terrible.
