This low-budget film about a writer who goes to work at a London casino has a terrible script, a wooden performance, and not much to recommend. Of course, he will appeal to the highbrows for which the "mainstream" is a curse word, and who automatically add 20 IQ points when they hear a British accent (apologies for Jeff Foxworthy). The script is full of holes (wrote a book or not?), clichés (relationship problems: working days, working nights) and giving so little insight into such bases as character motivation that requires voice narration just to move the story together. In an effort to keep the audience from persisting, this includes a street battle scene that is about as realistic as Julius Caesar's high school production. If your idea of ​​scintillation dialogue is "seeing your ten and raising you twenty" then RUN will see this movie. Otherwise, save your money. <br /> <br />
