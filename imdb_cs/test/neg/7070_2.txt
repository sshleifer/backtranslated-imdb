I was invited to see this film at a small art show. I had no idea what to expect. I was initially optimistic about the opening credits where I saw Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Canne, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flynn-Boyle. However after some very disturbing grossed-out scenes (it did not bring too much to the story's progress), this film quickly became a torture weapon. The folding trick of a growing shoulder is never developed. I waited patiently for this film to be finished. There was little yield in the end, but had to invest and sit in the endless rough, rough, sexually perverted, in-your-face scream, unjust gore cost too much for me (even for free viewing). What did these actors do in this horrible movie? The artistic direction was very convincing and scary. It should be a minimum of 75 minutes. This is a movie Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld would accept.
