Even though I am not a very religious person, I still had quite a lot of hope for this film, as the amazing Steve Carrell has, and his prequel, Bruce Almighty, was actually a creative and clever comedy with a Christian theme. However, Evan Almighty is nowhere near this originality and freshness of the original, and cannot decide whether it is a comedy or a sentimental film about the values ​​of faith and family. If he chose one clear path that these topics should focus on, he could fulfill his potential, but instead, the result of mixing these two films is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, kitschy dialogue, and motives that they try to give the film depth, but instead practically offend the audience's intelligence, as well as the very confused and veiled presentation of the film's opaque news. It was obvious that Evan Almighty was very poorly written, there were numerous holes and elements in the film that made no sense. For example, although a large number of exotic animals from all over the world are spreading to Evan to build the ark for their floods, their inclusion is indeed necessary when the only "flood" that is happening in the film is in downtown Washington DC and suburban neighborhoods, which means they are not at risk? It seems that the filmmakers lacked originality to modernize the biblical story at all, and instead it should happen now, without turning anything into a conspiracy, so many elements that just don't add up, and that is obvious. idiotic motives and writing in film. Overall, this work is tragic in that Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes' acting talent is not exposed to the rude characters they portray and that it was so badly written that skews and introduces many of the movie themes and makes a mockery of the first movie. Finally, Evan Almighty is also an insult to the brilliant actors in him and to any half-intelligent movie viewer in that both of them are unfortunately failing.
