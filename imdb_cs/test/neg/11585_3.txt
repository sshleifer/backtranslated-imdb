Another ridiculous lame and senseless low budget sci-fi TV presentation ??? but actually its kind fun? species?? passively undemanding way. Am I soft? I don't know why they come up with these titles. Yes, there's a commodo. And yes, there's a cobra. But what is it about being "versus"? Sure they will come to blows? only in two sequences (one recap of the incident and the other the apparent climax) and quite boring exchanges I could add. It is all the old routine of a scientific experiment that goes beyond the hands of a remote island (without dinosaurs), and some innocent bystanders (environmentalists who hope to expose animal testing) will be caught in it. This sees a dragon dragon and a massive cobra in a statue with the government soon wanting to destroy any sort of evidence (including witnesses) of its existence by blowing up the island. So it leaves the survivors racing against the time to find a way away. Prominent nuclei existed horrible video games CGI, a hack script, a few dirty files (though tropical island settings were easy on the eyes), throwaway characters (but I found the performances fought up), lifeless cheap excitement (which for some reason held using the same repetitive) a shot of a victim who just stood there in horror, which meant I was waiting, please find me now, I'm nowhere, and finally they would be all buried - the second sip to finish them, or just save the argument with a silly squeeze) and a very hysterical edge with some a kind of miserable message among survival acts. Director Jim Wynorski seems to be in cruise control throughout. Michael Par√© is having fun with his gruff dialogues and Michelle Borth has added a lot of needed sparks. Renee Talbert has a lot of success there.
