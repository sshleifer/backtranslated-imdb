I'm glad I didn't expect too much when I saw this sequel to one of my favorite childhood movies. The story was boring and unconvincing, as were the characters, and I was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. I also didn't think the characters themselves were similar to the previous movie. Charlie has changed and now she has a girlfriend. The first film had good music, but the music in this film was infallible. In short, this movie just didn't do it for me. And if we look at other users' opinions, it looks like they didn't do much for you. It's not worth watching.
