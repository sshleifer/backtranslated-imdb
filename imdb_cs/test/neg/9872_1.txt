It is true that when there was a chance to see this horrible movie legend, my expectations were pretty low. They weren't low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow came into possession of the rights to produce Marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it to Oley Sassone, whose directing work largely was in campy television series such as 'Hercules' and 'Viper'. With a projected total budget of $ 1.5 million, it was made, filmed and briefly released on video and sent to the wasteland of the forgotten film. It was supposed to stay there. However, as a banana peel in the act of vaudeville, this "Fantastic Four" sits in the ether and waits for those precious people who are unhappy and stupid to get to stand up to them. <br /> <br /> If you've ever heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. The people who did this were very true to the source material, and that's the only thing they deserve for any credit in this fiasco. This represents the beginnings of a heroic group that develops superhuman powers when shielded on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic rays. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes "Mr. Fantastic". His girlfriend, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) can become invisible, and her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood), can spontaneously cause fire from his body. Finally, Ben Grimm ('attributed' as Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) accepts superhuman strength when his skin mutates to rock-like hyde and is then referred to as The Thing. There is a prologue who prepares the former classmate Reed, Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp), to become their enemy, Dr. Doom, who organizes the sabotage of Fantastic Four's space flight as an act of revenge for the wound he blames on Reed. . There is a setting, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and ultimately the ultimate fight. There is more detail to the poorly-written script, but they are negligible. This is a movie that was made simply because the creators (I use it in the technical sense of the word t worked many creative imaginations.) had legal rights to it. The story will undoubtedly be reflected in the anticipated release of a large budget that Tim Story will direct in 2005, but solving such a project with no special effects without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of film madness. What special effects exist are mostly hand-painted or simple tricks that have existed since the original "The Great Train Robbery". When half of the climactic fight returns to full animation, it is almost relieved that you are watching the cartoon instead of the poor actors who were in this damnation project. There is also very little style consistency in this mess. Most scenes are either shot in available light or wild primary colors, and the only clothed set is visible sci-fi pieces. There is camera-work, but it is mostly just to keep the characters centered on the screen and minimal information flows to the audience. Editing includes leaving in extra lines and using obvious wipes (there is a transition in one place with the middle of number 4). Rotation editing is even used to complement bad special effects when transforming a Thing object. One scene where morphing technology was used was only shocking because it was such a positive leap in quality. <br /> <br /> The limited camera is not unforgivable. Only the most basic camera movements and almost no style are used in 'Clerks'. It worked for the movie because it was about people whose lives had no style, and that was consistent. Kevin Smith never let his reach exceed his grip. The "Blair Witch Project" caused some viewers to suffer from the disease by moving from the rough hands that made this pseudo-documentary together. When everything was said and done, it was an effective work of horror that we were lost and that a terrible situation was consuming us. There is no story or theme at the spoken or visual level. With this "Fantastic Four" you will never get more than a random laugh at the fact that filmmakers and artists are really trying to compete with other comic films with this poorly budgeted entry. Any movie involves a lot of time and work. It's so sad that so many of them were poured into a similar project. If you are one of the people involved, it was most likely done as a springboard on the way (perhaps better) film career. Everyone knows about work to make the most of what seems to be an opportunity. For those who are curious about watching this movie, my advice is to do just a group of friends (so you can see and say you've also watched it) who have been notified of this experience beforehand (so no one will be injured from the shock ) and maybe you can come with a drink to relieve the pain between random laughs. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
