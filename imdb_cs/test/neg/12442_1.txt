I could kill a better movie. This is a waste of time and money. I feel bad that movies like these are actually made and the people who make them think they are good. I happen to like teen comedy. However, this film will take this genre to a new minimum. With movies like this, people think it's actually okay to get this dirt and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to sit over it. It's sadism.
