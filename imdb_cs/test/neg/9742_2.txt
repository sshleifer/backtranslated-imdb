As this character hired mail, he's far behind me. The test taken by postal workers is so difficult. There's no way this stupid man can work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and that's probably the place of the movie. How could they go their whole life and not see the elevator, it's also mysterious. I didn't take this movie too seriously, but it was so stupid. Then try to start the car without a key? Lots of horrible scenes and terrible gameplay, and this movie isn't funny at all. It's just a sad, stupid mess. I liked Moms dress though. <br /> <br /> Send back to sender as soon as possible.
