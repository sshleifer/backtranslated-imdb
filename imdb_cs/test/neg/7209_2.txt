SPOILERS: The original Road House is one of those movies that I know is clich√© and unoriginal, but it's so good, I'm embarrassed to admit that I like it. It turned out that many of my friends, whose film respect I respect, think the same way. So when trying to make it a sequel, and it's like it was written by some high school kids who got the right to do the sequel, it's just bad; really, really bad. Strangely, Johnathon Schaech is listed as one of the writers and I can only hope that his membership in WGA is canceled. Writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should retire for a complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialogues in this millennium. Schaech already seems to be the king of the direct DVD sequel (8mm 2, Poison Ivy 2) and now that I've seen this and 8mm 2, I think his acting ability doesn't exist. He was terrible, just terrible. And it's not terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible, but take it from me, it's bad. Each battle scene is a slow-blow (it still makes a "wiff" sound in the air), which is then blocked by an opponent who returns a blow that sends the first guy to the ground. This is repeated throughout the film, worse than any bad 70s police show. Or the fact that many people involved in the fighting have a mouth full of cherry cools for some reason. And we have to believe that Will Patton is a combat machine; His fighting scenes look so amazingly fake that I was honestly watching. It's a complete logic failure in this ridiculous movie that makes it horrible. For example: Johnathon Schaech is a city character for one day and will tell a girl that she hardly knows who has no idea on what side she is, "I'm with the Feds, but don't tell anyone." A female villain who fights a good girl in one combat scene with acrobatics that competes with any superhero but is easily held by Will Patton, "old man", in another scene by simply holding both hands while he pronounces some ridiculous line ( "Once you stab me, shame on you, stab me twice, it won't happen to me," it's bad, and then you get stuck. Jake Busey is a villain shooting at the feds while trapped in the middle of a drug deal, but no DEA agent or anyone just go to his place and pick him up after, in fact, he just let them go because it is the sheriff's territory. Busey wants a bar because it's "in a great location" for drug stores, but his own house is probably just as good that it offers all the benefits that a bar has. Johnath Schaech's character is to be the son of Patrick Swayze's character in the original, but Swayze's name is the last name of Dalton and Schaech is not (nor the supposed brother of Swayze's character). And Johnathon Schaech looks in this movie for about 50 years. I watched she was 17 years younger than Swayze, but it looks awful. But my favorite totally stupid scene in this movie was the most expensive scene that ended up in movies. the window on the second floor, and as they move down, I think, "please don't tell me it's stuck on something ..." and certainly, my worst fears have been realized. Actually, I could go for another half hour about what I hated about this movie. Just say, we'll end up with these absurd, straightforward sequels of theater films, at least with Johnathon Schaech.
