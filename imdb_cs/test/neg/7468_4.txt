I saw the Grande Ecole at its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival. I had no idea what I had entered, and if I had any idea, I wouldn't. This is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. He is trying to be provocative, yet profound, with full frontal gay sex scenes - it won't! It's nothing more than another bad excuse to see naked people on the big screen. 4/10
