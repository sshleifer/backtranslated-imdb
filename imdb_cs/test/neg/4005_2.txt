I think this movie had a really bad production value. The lack of action makes me think that they should call it early docudrama. They may not have any money to make it. I feel bad that it was a ruin ride to the Major League for Jackie Robinson. He had to be really great to break the time barrier. Not getting around that it was a really bad movie. Wish there was more information about its creator. They can be limited by the quality of the actors willing to take over the project. Maybe no money for good people.
