I first heard about this movie when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his CD "Werewolves and Lollipops". He said it was a lost classic that was totally ridiculous. Being a lover of horrible cinema, I knew I was good. This movie is, hands down, one of the weirdest I've ever seen. Definitely one of the strangest movies. Basically, the demon took a human form years ago for a woman, a woman died or something, a demon screaming blood, blood fell on a bed, the bed is now obsessed and now she eats. Along with fruits, flowers and chicken it also has a taste for people. People can move between horny teens, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orgy throwers. There is also a sick man who ate the bed, but gave his soul a picture in the room. <br /> <br /> Most movies allow you to figure out the action through exciting action. Death Bed has another way: basically tells you exactly what's going on while slow, boring murders take place. I also have to say that everyone who is at the bed is surprisingly quiet. I would think that if the bed took you on a 5th level science experiment, it would be a little stinging. I think the nerve endings were not invented until 1981 or so. The story is crazy, the direction is slow and pretty awful, the sets are sparse, it is quite painful and brother is one of them. unintentionally the ugliest actors I've ever seen. Probably would make a great party movie if alcohol and smart butts are involved. You shouldn't miss out on it.
