Formula to max. No title reflects serial actual content, "Fighting Nazis in Morocco," (actually, Iverson Ranch). The reason is just to fill the peace between the fistfights. Packaging states that there are more than 40 "fistic meetings" in 15 chapters. That's at least three chapters! Besides seeing Duncan Renald cast as a Spanish accented Frenchman who watches how much furniture is flipped, broken, thrown, burned or thrown away, that's what this show really is all about. When the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be there. So, praise the choreographer who is the real star of this series! Two Positive Notes: Characters sometimes lose their hats during the fighting, and best of all, the girl's party (often a journalist, as here), who actually participates in chaos, mostly by shooting and kills the bad guys. Still to come is Linda Stirling killing the main villain in "Manhunt of Mystery Island" (1945). On the negative side, there is only too much jump from the escape route - before the board falls before the car goes over the cliff, before the boat explodes before the building explodes before the truck hits you, etc. Etc. Etc. . It is alleged that this series has partly "inspired" George Lucas to create the first Indiana Jones movie, but this is an implied concept rather than a true story or development of the series. Rod Cameron 'shines' as a moving rock, a role he has played in all his movies. In addition to watching all the furniture that is broken, nothing really happens here in comparison to other series that have fewer fighting, more stories, better actors and more developed characters. I give it 3 for all the smashing furniture.
