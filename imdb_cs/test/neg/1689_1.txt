I hate, despise and hate the passion movie that makes red hot gates of hell compared to cold. It's nothing but a campground, a frightening and utterly delicate repayment of the memory lane to that oh-so-bad time, 70's, decade I'm glad I wasn't part of, if it's absolutely trite what was on offer! > <br /> Animation is immensely dated, last but not least sticky, missing frames and figures with huge, bulbous heads, this movie is sight. from what he knew, he nodded to his parents with strange homosexual sea horses, and it was the camp's hand movements and kenneth williams-esque voice, the apparently indecent drug of the anthem High Cockalorum. he was forced on me as a child and I never fully recovered from the horror that caused me .... <br /> <br /> This terrible manifestation of utter horror should carry an R-rated certificate, which is worrying that it is it in it content!
