it was bad enough. pedestrian work or worse. I don't think it was homophobic, really bad. if something was really amateur like when you have 14 and first discover the cursed words and skin spells. The main point of this film, romance, is really flat. I can't help but wonder if writers have ever had any serious relationships before this movie. Rendering and stimulation are terrible, they don't go anywhere at all. one minute we watch the guys catch the cheaters, then we're at the gay club, then we're on a date. the girl probably doesn't like comics and then she sleeps together. none of it feels real, like the elementary school of Shakespeare production if Hamlet was written frat by the boy. The end was some fearsome over the top revenge fantasy loser who got dumped prices. girl. Unnecessary and truly disturbing. <br /> <br /> You still have to watch. Why? As others have noted, the director's commentary is actually merry - what kind of professional talks about "banging" or "hooking" with actresses? dialogue sucked out, relations lacked chemistry. you will be on the floor, laughing in this flashy jacket.
