Why can't a movie be rated zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies like "Plan Nine From Outer Space" are so bad they're fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. "The Dungeon of Horror" could be the worst movie I've ever seen (some of it anyway. I had to do it a lot in advance!). Luckily for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advanced age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but fortunately, I can't remember them. The kits seemed to be made of cardboard and finished with paint cans. Special effects looked like the diorama of the fifth sorter in a shoe box. The film contained unforgivable gaffs like the awning and killing of his servant. He then immediately gets into a brawl with his escaping victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it, without the weapon being reloaded! This movie was so bad that my DVD copy had only nominal credits. I don't think any company or studio wanted to be convicted. Although I think when you film in your garage and make cardboard boxes, the studio is not needed. This movie definitely belongs to my cellar of all the worst movies with such terrible sacraments as "Manipulator", the worst movie I've ever seen with a real (one) Hollywood lead man - Mickey Rooney. The only time I would recommend watching "The Dungeon of Harrow" (or "Manipulator" for that matter) would be if someone paid. (I'm cheap) I'd have to have $ 7 or $ 8 dollars for "Dungeon" and at least ten for "Manipulator". phil-never from cameraman cans
