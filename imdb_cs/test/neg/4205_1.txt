Have you ever wanted to see a movie in which Chuck Norris takes the bad guys aside and discusses with them the mistakes of his travels until he sees the light, and with tears in his eyes shake hands, in the true sense of the world. and harmony and forever the end of evil rule in the world? Well, forget it, Jock. "Breaker! Breaker!" instead, it goes straight into the drop when our Chuck wears his big rig into a small town where his little brother is held by a corrupt judge and his even more corrupt lawyers. Chuck karate kicks, chops, slices, juliennes and crinkle-cuts every baddie in sight until evil-really dared to lift his head. Lots of fighting is in slow motion, for excitement purposes, but you just need to empty the movie to fill 86 minutes. And there is a lot of fighting that leaves only about 15 minutes to plot development ... and that's about everything you get. But what did you expect: a quiet discussion? One Star for "Breaker! Breaker!"; and that's a little 10-4, good friend.
