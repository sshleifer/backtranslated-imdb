This movie, which I just found in a video store, seemed to be a few years without a distributor. It's easy to understand why. The story of two friends living in New York looking for a high school friend who now lives homeless under the Coney Island promenade has flashes of being a very good movie, but is ultimately esteemed by the Stan and Daniel story. rather than on their homeless friend Richie. Cryer is, as usual, very good and the film has a pretty sharp look with ghostly images of Coney Island. However, writer Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are too busy dealing with the quite uninteresting life of Stan and Daniel rather than focusing on Richie. One flashback in the music store, where Richie fanned employees, excels and really shows the viewer where this movie might be. But not much in the end. Two of the many scenes of annoyance, such as inside Skeeball. RATING 4 of 10.
