AALCC informs us that 14 years can be quite unpleasant and bad. For those who do not, the film is a public service. Otherwise it is a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason to be. I will let the camera work be sometimes remarkable, but also that it may be insanely confident. Actors take up screen and screen space, but they don't count as convincing human beings. I suppose an e-mail that lights up on a full screen means you have to figure out which character has a nickname, but I just couldn't say enough differences to do so, and actually didn't care.
