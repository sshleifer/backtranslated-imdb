These are some vampires (who can run around in the sun) that cause problems in South America. Casper Van Dien is sent with his squad team to investigate. The film starts with Van Dien & Co. Walk through the jungle, and there it is a huge black man who just absolutely can't act. He speaks all his lines as if he was reading them for the first time. His voice is also so low that it is positively cheerful. A great way to start a movie! Anyway, they plunge on some of our vampires, they shoot (that makes them seem to die for about 20 seconds) and then of course they return to life. Van Dien notices that one of them was strained over a tree limb and screams at his friends to kill them with wood. Stunts must be seen - they believe vampires are on wires that lift them into trees, which should look like they can look really easy, but it just looks like they're bouncing on bungee lines. or something like that. Yeah ... anyway, later, a huge black dude is down in South America with some guys (Van Dien is not part of) and are attacked by more vampires. It's really too bad that these guys never heard of crossbows, because it would seem to be the perfect weapon that kills small bloodbaths, but instead uses big old wooden bets that try to mimic vampires with their hands. The big black dude ends up captive and eventually becomes a great vampire leader. Van Dien ends up with him later. It doesn't help that everyone through the movie, they all forget that if you shoot a vampire, they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so, which would allow the person to hold a bet in them quite easily. He tries to keep them in the middle of a hand-to-hand fight. Yeah, not quite a brilliant tactic. There is a hot babe (remember Veronica from The Lost World TV show? Yes, it's her!), which also happens to be walking in the middle of Vampire County on some kind of research mission, and she also simply becomes Van Dien's ex-wife. Hey, what are the odds? It's a pity he's not much more in the movie than she is. Will she return with Casper in the end? Will Van Dien beat a huge black dude who can't act? Will the circus performers laugh at all the vast action scenes? Do we hear three music when someone does something fun? Did Lynda Carter forget how to act in her little portrait? These questions and other questions will be answered if you do this until the end of the movie. I don't know, it could mean a few points on such a bad scale, but that's about it. Eh, it's a lot of jungle punk, I think it's a little fun.
