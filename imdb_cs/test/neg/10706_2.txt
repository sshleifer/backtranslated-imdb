They used footage of some real protest associated with a woman who talked about a society without men to make them seem to be cheering for the "gendercide" of men. The funny thing is that in the background you can see a man cheering with his own death. OK, conspiracy. A lady says she should be a company without men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) thinks it's a great idea. So all men are killed or something. So they no longer exist. Then this blonde scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so that he can't be violent. The male grows very quickly and soon is an adult. Soon after, a blonde 'Volkswagen' takes a beetle and goes to the city where he is discovered. Now you'd think a lonely man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy he'd never been. The police are chasing him. I wasn't looking at the rest, but it probably would end up having to compete with the clock and some people, or something bad would happen. The man somehow ends up in the stadium with some other men who want to lead him. These brave warriors, who were hiding in the stadium, might have had a plan that explained the details of getting rid of the planet full of women, but I wasn't looking. And you shouldn't. <br /> <br /> If you're late and surf the canals and it happens, don't hesitate. Watch everything, but this. You'll find those Bowflex ads or those with swimsuits with you to pick up your phone to meet women like these in your area, which will be more fun. <br /> <br /> (Oh Yeah, it's a funny thing to pull with cars. I don't know what they did, it looks like they were driving in real slow and careful, but then they tried to speed up the movie to compensate, but it looks really weird.) <br /> <br /> The blonde was a little cute and I feel generous, so ... 2/10.
