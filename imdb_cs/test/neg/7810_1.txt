I was fascinated by the ugly figure of a boss like myself, and the real boss's daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see even younger Ashton Kushner, but this movie is so handy that I had to turn it off. It was a waste of time to watch. When people started peeing around the living room, there was too much to watch. A painful, horrible movie. If it got a little stronger. Are there really people who consider it fun and like it? I was relieved when I knew IMDb readers were so low. The career of the story was interesting, just as a young man was trying to get a promotion and win the favor of the bosses. I liked the part. Also the introductory scene with co-workers on the train was fine as I liked his co-worker characters. If you can stomach non-sense movies or you're pretty young, then it can be one that you can stomach.
