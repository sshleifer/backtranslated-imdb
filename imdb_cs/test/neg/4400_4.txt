The Palestinian situation is fertile and still largely fallow for film production. "Divine Intervention" is trying hard to give us a glimpse into the almost surreal life of those who have been struggled, but the film is a little more than just a few (extremely beautiful) visual jokes that fit the celluloid, while the links between them it becomes increasingly unclear how the film progresses. The missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue.
