I watched this movie because I thought it would be Amy Adams' classic movie. Wow, this film is so bad on so many levels that it stagnates imagination. It's poorly designed for one, the script and acting is just awful. But hey, even Johnny Depp has a lot of bad movies behind him. The highlight of this movie would be Amy singing, and even on this score I believe that better songs could be selected. Amy is, of course, beautiful when you see, and if you're a relentless fan of her, you'll probably watch this title no matter what it is, just don't expect too much. I wish I could find more, but it was just painful to watch. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Doubt.
