I've heard this Japanese movie is nervous, creatively interesting, "cool new thang" on the Asian movie scene ... maybe something as innovative as "Ringu" Hideo Nakata or "Oldboy" Chan-wooka Park. You can imagine my disappointment when, instead, I found out that the film is discontinuous both narratively and filmically (though not as the movie fans appreciate), clich√©, even though it is a sadly silly place of fun --- on the whole, a very bad "Pulp Fiction" knock-off. After 30 minutes I stopped watching when I gave up something more than it was.
