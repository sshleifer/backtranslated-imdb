"Fool for Love" is one of several now forgotten films directed by Robert Altman in the 1980s. This one, Shepard's main character screen adaptation, is simply not very good. In the course of his fascinating career, Altman has made a lot of non-very good films and has been his fault many times. But here I think the mistake lies with Shepard for writing such a weak game. Altman's direction is ensured, performances are o.k. given what the actors are supposed to do, but this inconsistent scenario is nowhere to go and its time will get there. Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a love and hate relationship with Kim (Kim Basinger). They both fight endlessly during an evening spent in a dusty motel in the middle of nothing, while the mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton), who can either be figurative or literal father of Eddie and Maya, watches quietly. Randy Quaid completes a four-member cast as a gentleman's caller. The only dramatic hook of the whole plot is the suggestion that Eddie's relationship with Maya is incestuous. However, this hook feels more like a trick than anything. The scenario does not examine their relationship in any detail and does not use their relationship to explore other universal topics. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric, well-behaved characters who are irritating during the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reactions. The last half-hour of the movie is particularly bad when Eddie and May's footage start playing in memory of a monotonous, somnolent voice. Chalk this to the next of Altman's experiments has been lost. <br /> <br /> Level: C-
