this is a 1990 television show, not a film from 1979.it seems to be three episodes totaling less than 90 minutes. before watching, I thought it was one of the movie versions, and I noticed right away, it had a TV show Feel it it.i didn't care much about it much. i just felt the story wasn't there and there wasn't much in the way of excitement or drama.i watched the time elapsed on my dvd player often as i was really bored.i also thought that some of the dialogue was to make it politely, not good.plus, i thought the acting left much to be desired. but that's just me, that's a good clean, healthy family fun. It's certainly nothing offensive here.kids will probably enjoy it. For me, the black stallion is 4/10
