This is so bad that it will be my contribution to another bad movie night. In the beginning, it is clear that Steve Gutenburg took this role seriously. I think they got a whiff of how soon it had gone down and went through the payout proposals. Sean Bean "acted" as usual, but was spared sharing space on the screen with some of the principles until the final scene where it was like an actor who went to high school stage that is how the contrast was defined. Some actors don't look good. Some actors should not accumulate for a part. These two statements apply to the "Police Academy" Steve. His shabby look translates into stiffness and inactivity, and his commotion makes him look like a potato lump that is not a buff. A couple that has one of the worst dialogues in Hollywood history and you have a BAD movie. I can only guess that all the principles really needed money for rebuilding or something, or their agents signed them before the script wrote the monkeys that they had to list. I'd like to know what a catastrophe is.
