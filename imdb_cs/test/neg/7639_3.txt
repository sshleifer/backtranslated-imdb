The lack of character development is fatal to this film. The figure of Valerie Golino Grazia starts to look like a bipolar personality, but she quickly disintegrates into a cartoon and looks incredible. Other characters are thin, probably a writer's error not actors. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the younger son of Filippo: his energy and bravery are funny and convincing. I suppose the tiny cruelty of children is supposed to contribute to the atmosphere of bleakness and to highlight the ever-present primordial spirits in the city, but for me, gratuitous cruelty is superfluous and contributes to the overall boredom of the film. Some scenes were entertaining, but not necessarily designed in such a way, for example, when maltreated dogs prove fat and healthy and appear to be ready to show. Pretty cast and set to make for an attractive trailer, but can't carry the entire movie.
