Randy Bowers (John Wayne) arrives at Half Way House at the right time to take a break from the trail and finds out that dead bodies, including the man to hand over the message - Ed Rogers, the business owner, have appeared in it. He is observed by the dead man's niece Sally (Albert Vaughn), from behind a hidden room where she remained unnoticed during the massacre. "Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses the shooting technique here as in other of his films, where he cedes action from one place to another, usually involving riders on horseback. It's pretty well done and seems quite innovative in these 1930s Lone Star Westerns. Pre-Gabby George Hayes is on hand, without a beard, and that's the first time I've seen him as a villain. In fact, it took several scenes to realize that it was in a dual role, first as a hunchbacked businessman "Matt the Mute", to communicate through a pencil and paper just to turn into Marvin Black, the leader of a group of criminals. Black's gang was responsible for the murder at Half Way House, trying to force Sally to sell to Matt / Marvin. Yakima Canutt is also a major player, as a black follower named Spike. Interestingly, Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser / Wayne Oater, "Neath the Arizona Skies." There's a horseback riding between Black's gang and the sheriff. posse, as John Wayne's character maneuvers reveal bad guys. Finally, he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers' $ 30,000, at the expense of destroying Half Way House, where he exchanges some dynamite bars for prey in the vault. Greedy Marvin Black is trying to open with his six-shooter, and the blast is a good end for the villain. In his best attitude "Aw shucks" John Wayne falls under the spell of pretty Sally Rogers and unfortunately Randy no longer goes!
