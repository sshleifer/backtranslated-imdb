Ugh. Unfortunately, it's one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic, making it difficult to watch this movie. They are all the unhappy thirty-year-olds who do not take responsibility for their crazy lives. I could only do half an hour of the movie, so there's a chance that it will improve later, but I doubt it. I can't imagine that five people who are absorbed in self-esteem can remain friends for ten years. The three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing because they were meaningless for conspiracy, and was clearly a groundless (unsuccessful) attempt to bring some life to this otherwise boring film. <br /> <br /> Save time and money and skip this movie.
