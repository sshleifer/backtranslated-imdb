Steven Seagal is a thief who specializes in the theft of drug traffickers who give the poor and the unhappy. Harlan, Robin Hood. Harlan wants to go straight for her girl Jada (Mari Morrow), so she takes a job as an armored car driver for Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe, wasted in a subscription role). Max intends to have millions for himself and his reckless collaborators, with the intention of using his loader Bruno (Robert Miano) to bring him money, but Harlan has other plans. Harlan runs away from the police, hides money, and throws away Bruno (who had a loaded gun pointed at Harlan's head that threatens to shoot him if he didn't drive) after avoiding capture by hitting a huge dump truck. Harlan is accused of murdering police, among other things, as a result of high-speed persecution and is imprisoned and many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins forces with prisoner, ice (Treach), the leader of one of the many gangs in jail, with plans to find Max and remove every member of his corrupt escort. Soon DEA agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton) becomes part of this scenario thanks to her boss, Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who claims to be drugs. Coming to the conspiracy is also Harlan's desire to save the children's hospital from closing, and Jada has mysterious dreams about Max. Seagal and Treach and Gangsta split, while Buxton spends time trying to help Harlan, revealing the possibility that her boss is shooting with Max. Mancuso's character is a special duck, allowing Rachel a lot of leeway despite the threat she is to his career. Tighe appears for five minutes so high, which is a shame. Seagal's Harlan escapes the prison and finds every rich Max companion, inevitably discovering his whereabouts after breaking a few skulls, breaking his wrist and breaking some bones. Treach talks in his rapper and Seagal tries to answer him permanently, giving him some unintentional laughter. As you would expect, a lot of people will shoot themselves and Seagal will not be damaged by sweat. It's interesting to see Seagal in jail, among the convicts, to help Treach out when the group "Eses" plan to get him out.
