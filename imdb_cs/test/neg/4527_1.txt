This movie is in the same league as Ishtar. Lots of useless talent. Who let this bomb escape? When Sigfried says an example needs to be done, referring to a nuclear bomb, I said, "Please let it be this theater!" Don't waste your time. Not for free rental! And where did they manage to fill these comments with the IMDb comments section? I can't believe that the one who ever saw the original series enjoyed this smelly film. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the "comedy" and made it a direct action movie, it could pass. What the hell was the purpose of the dance scene? Also bold jokes and links were tasteless. This film never missed the chance to go to the lowest common denominator and the scene just ended, it seemed like no one imagined it. Just awful! Save time, if not money, and give this movie a pass!
