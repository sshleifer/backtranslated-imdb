Think about the fact that the most movie you can afford is 10 times worse. A woman must complete as many puzzles as she can per day. We can't even see questions and think about words alone, we just look at her fight. The woman seems so anxious and rushes to do crosswords, but for some reason she spends time distracting walking around the city when she can focus at home. Acting is terrible, actress huffs and meringues when she tried to think of words, and we're all left in the dark. The scenery of New York is nice, but the film relies too much on it and cares fast. The film plays as a rejected NYU student film. This film has no quality and I do not recommend it to anyone.
