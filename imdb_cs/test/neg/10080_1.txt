You could have had characters on the island for some reason and have the same movie. The first one had an original story, the other one was stolen by King Kong, and at the end (hopefully) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been completely omitted. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about what was there. Special effects were decent, but not worth $ 8. If you have a discount theater in your area, wait and see it. I wouldn't even bother to rent. That would be too much money for this thriller.
