I'm going about the dead, but my mind is still uncertain as the dead go. Sadly, CHILLING didn't help me think. This is really slow, nothing happens for the first 45 minutes, so I pressed the "movie enhancement" button several times. At a time when a well-designed zombie appears, it's too late and the director (two say they shot it) has no idea how to shoot them. Haggerty, Blair and Donahue all look tired / embarrassed / recovering in some way. I'll do the film credit because it precedes the T2 ending with the frozen liquid nitrogen. Shriek Show DVD offers an enhanced promo reel from behind in the day that lasts 8 minutes and I would really recommend it to be over watching the movie in its entirety.
