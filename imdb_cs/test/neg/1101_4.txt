After spending all her money caring for her terminally ill husband, recently widowed by Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring), she moves with her two daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to the home of her late husband in rural areas. Pennsylvania, where local legends talk about zombies roaming the woods at night. Just when they saw the names of the writer and director of this film in the opening credits, it was enough to send a frost on the spine: Boaz Davidson is the 'genius' responsible for writing scripts for such STV titles as Octopus 1 & 2, Spiders and Crocodile, while JS Cardone gave us a pious 'video of ugly' The Slayer and a dull vampire. With such dubious talent, I didn't expect much from Wicked Little's stuff. And I just finished the movie, I'm glad I kept my expectations low. Although the movie sometimes looks good, with a beautiful use of a scary forest environment and cast, it gives reasonable performances, given that the clich√© of the drivel they work with is a conspiracy so difficult, poorly written and derived that it is impossible And, most importantly, maybe the movie killers, the undead children who come out of the mine every night they die, are not as scary, smudges of makeup, black contacts, and some miserable jars of shop scars they do very little. threatened. Scout Taylor-Compton and the company are doing their best to fear the small terror, shouting convincingly with every confrontation, but their admirable attempts to instill a sense of fear in the audience are few: little blisters just don't have what it takes to cool the blood. There are several bland zombie chow scenes in the vain offer to win over gore-chasers, and the last kill that sees the blood victim drench as Compton and Heuring is suitably tasteless, but on the whole, Wicked Little Things (AKA Zombies in the UK) is an instant forgotten waste? just another clunker in Cardone and Davidson filmography.
