I was pleased to find out that TCM is showing it because I like the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright ... This movie had luminous Ann Harding, the amazing performance of Frank Morgan, but playing other movies more beautiful then beautiful developing that later movie. Arbuthnot Reginald Owen is painful to watch and you can't understand why his wife adores him. After watching the movie, I found that it was based on a stage play where a 1992 movie is based on a book. The original film also felt that it was a fragment of a larger piece and felt incomplete. Too bad it was such a pause.
