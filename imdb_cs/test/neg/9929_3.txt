I got into the middle of this movie and I was very disappointed. It was just boring and totally unrealistic. I can get past as unreality in a lot of movies, but not when it's supposed to be a criminal drama. Collecting evidence and interviewing processes was just strange. I began to move quickly to see how it ended. And then he was bored with it and just turned it off and returned. The main character played by Ellen Barkin was simply unbelievable. Peta Wilson was doing very well in this movie, but her character was there and there was no one to play from her.
