* Criticisms mention spoilers * <br /> <br /> Rarely user comments, but that's one movie I have no gossip problem. This film stinks, and its average rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such fiber. The bone collector is not at all the same caliber of the movie as the lamb silence or the seven, despite what his ad claims. This is a perfect example of how to make a thriller. The speed of this movie was extremely slow - I actually stayed about 10 minutes in the middle of the road and returned to the exact scene with exactly the same character without absolute progress (I refer to the section where Angelina Jolie debates on Denzel to cut off the corpse's hands. frightening, but trying to cope with love-subplot, although the sexy character Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington is, of course, what you get is something that is comparable to a mentor-student relationship, as seen in the brilliant epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, also lack all the effectiveness, and I personally aimed to kill the villain Denzel shut down to prevent hackneyed giggling between the two, and with such a lousy film I half-expected to see a conspiracy or some spectacular appearance at the end a situation that would allow the film to get some credits that average films like Arlington Road and Scream have downloaded. Anyone who has a 4th degree education can see the end as it is resolved (a situation that mimics Alfred Hitchcock's back window). The cliché that the killer had explained his motives was steadfast, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that I spewed on my screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think that the killer's intent was completely lost when Denzel happily recovered from his loss over the proverbial "chess game" and got his pet project Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of films with original ideas and truly dynamic concepts (like me), you won't appreciate this movie. If you haven't participated in one movie in your life and would like to catch up with all the clichés of Hollywood you've ever borne (late night knock on a window from someone else, but a killer, a ridiculous serial killer who invented an investigator's relationship), horrible 'woman Trying to get into an all-male dominated workforce aka SOTL), see this movie .... but even then its too slow-paced and you'll get bored.
