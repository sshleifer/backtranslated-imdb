This movie is just stupid. Don't bother watching him; believe me you're better. Long and Short Conspiracy: Advocate represents the man who murdered his son and other children. When she defended him, she hit a wooden doll from Pinnochia. He takes the doll home. Pinnochio is obsessed and begins to kill people. This film is moving very slowly to have such a weak ending. The plot is very bad and Dennis Michael Tenney's musical score is pitiful. The story written by Kevin S. Tenney is meaningless and does not cause any horror or fear. This is far from his work on Demon Night and Witchboard, which are decent trips, but nothing to write home about. Finally: 2 out of 10, perhaps the most beautiful, boring movie I've seen all year.
