This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life (I'm approaching 47)! The description on the back of the cover was equal to the scrolling text right at the beginning of the movie. Another plot was zero and even a bunch of corpses would show more life in their "acting". I saw the whole length and I was really relieved when the death of the last character signaled the end of my suffering! The place was either some arch or dirty beach. I think the home video device served as a camera and the lighting was non-standard. The dialogues were uninitiated and meaningless. Just like the actors face. Which brings me to the theme of "makeup": as it looked, they got him as tricks in teenage magazines "my first make-up" or the like. What made me buy a DVD was the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection with this brilliant work of mind was the use of the name "Necronomicon", which was incorrectly translated as "The Book of Light". The EUR 4.70 I paid for this DVD was a total loss because the DVD went to a recycling box without any further ado.
