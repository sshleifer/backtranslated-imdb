I put down this vehicle from Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy and Murphy especially for the first time, but when I saw it again, I recently see it has some very funny pieces. <br /> <br /> This is by no means to say that this is the greatest comedy of all time, but really what you can do for an already exhausted subgenre? What director, Tom Dey, has been trying to do, is the satire of comedy and media cliché. Soon in the movie the cable network manager asks, "How is it different from Cops?", When Chase Renzi is pitching the idea of ​​a reality show dealing with De Niro's character, Mitch Preston (cheerfully boring name by the way). That's when I saw it in a new light that I hadn't noticed before. The idea is to show all the comedy comedy elements and give them a twist. De Niro is reluctant to play in the series and partner with Murphy directly from every pony you can remember. You can say that De Niro actually plays himself and asks, "Why should I play another cop?" Chase Renzi is portrayed as a Hollywood false, but when you look at her opening scene again, she does it just to save her work. Somehow he sees the ridicule of what he does, but still wants to succeed. One line says everything: "Who doesn't want to be on TV?" Maybe it is reading too much on what is basically a light film, just set it up, but give it a little bit of spin that I haven't noticed before. <br /> <br /> As for Murphy. You have to applaud him for looking ridiculous. Trey wants to be a star so bad that he's willing to sell out everything he comes into contact with. Murphy was a big star and maybe it struck nerves that it was so fleeting. Of course, the gun story is pretty boring. Action sequences are nothing special except the end, which required a lot of effort from both cast and crew. One thing I noticed is that he's dressed like a pop star of the 80's. George Michael comes to mind and it contributes to all media rotation. So I threw it away for the first time, but what the hell; If you do it, why not notice how ridiculous it is and De Niro and Murphy have made a great chance.
