Absolutely confused Western, flashing forward in crazy asylum, south of Hell Mountain was one of the first films to create a schlockmeisters in Cannon Film. Co-directed by William Sachs, who would later give such popular fans as The Incredible Melting Man and Galaxina, the film tells a very boring story of a trio of gold robbers who stumbled across a cabin occupied by two women hiding secrets, not worth exploring. Cast (most of them never made another movie) try the game, but is limited by a scenario that generally doesn't make sense. Asylum scenes are modified to have little effect and are interrupted by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. In the end, it's a lot of talk and little else.
