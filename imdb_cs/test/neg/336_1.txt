I'm proud to be able to sit in everything. I think "if I paid the rent, then I will at least watch". I found an exception to this rule - Planet. I don't know what the course is, but I can only read through other comments that Â£ 8000 must be around $ 150. I'll be dating myself, but this movie reminds me of Steve Reeves's old 50s movies. He was a bodybuilder who became an actor. He was in those really terrible Italians, dubbed films that played Reeves as Hercules or any other muscle bound hero. As the child who watched them, you couldn't accurately formulate why these films had been stuck - you just knew they did. Mike Mitchell is the new Steve Reeves. That's it .. that's what it really was - a new story of an old Italian film "Spaghetti and Sandals". And me, boy, no - where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie isn't so bad that it's kind of fun to watch - it's just bad.
