It was horrible, mild and full of the worst clich√©s and racial stereotypes I saw in looong. When he saw Hayden P, who was trying to act "ghetto", it was painful (hi, one leg on the leg and some braids downs't you "down with the homies"). Solange Knowles largely grimaces through the film. Most of the set sequences seem to be filmed in cardboard boxes ... what was the final? And poor Rihanna was simply exploited to get people to follow her "act" she couldn't. Put simply, this Downs't movie doesn't deserve a single star. Please give this tired franchise to rest. Or at least make another Bring It On IV: Cheerleaders vs. Freddy & Jason.
