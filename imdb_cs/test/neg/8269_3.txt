The television reporter who said this late Saturday night said he should win the Oscars. Quite a statement for a movie I never heard of ... but why should I have some announcements about a television broadcaster, I don't know. In this case, said the announcer spoke impudence. It's a grim, unhappy film that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I couldn't get along with Hoskins' terrible Burr-ming-accent. I don't see any advantage in being in Midland anyway. Unsolved threads are teeming with ... and normally I wouldn't mind, but half of them make no sense. And what if Hoskins says he'll pick Felicia from his guesthouse, even though he never told him exactly where he was staying? Or her purchase for a funeral that apparently never materialized (and where she was in those days) Clumbsy and bad thinking through pieces of business when you ask me. It's a thriller without excitement. It is full of demanding business matters. It's depressing ... <br /> <br /> I didn't like it. I thought it was waste. I wouldn't recommend it. Said Nuff.
