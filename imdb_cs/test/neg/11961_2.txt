I was looking at the first scarecrow movie and I wasn't kicking it, even though I knew it was a b grade that had a really decent gore and the one who played the scarecrow was an amazing acrobat and had some good skills. The effects were better and the costume looked better than this movie. I borrowed this one with an open mind, I'm also a fan of ken shamrock (former superfight champion ufc) and I was hoping it would be a decent movie. The boy was bad, the film sucked in, the monster was pathetic, in fact it was scary, the story was so predictable that it was like watching a movie in preview mode. I already guess what happens, the music was so bad, with a terrible lips sync song that made me punch on the screen. <br /> <br /> Overall, avoid this crappy movie. <br /> <br /> Save some money.
