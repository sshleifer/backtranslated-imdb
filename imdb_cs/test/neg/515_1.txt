This is a really horrible movie by any of the regular scales. Fence, storyline, acting, effects, direction - I could go on. Just say it's bad. However, he has some appeal. Many absolutely out of context sex scenes appear, it's fun looking for links to Batman. Umm - that's it. Poor really, never mind.
