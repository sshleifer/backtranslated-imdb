Director Lo Wei knew she was reading racing papers and receiving on the scene - telling us something about his "approach to the movie, huh? Reviews I read fall into two categories: 1) it's a movie so bad it's funny, or 2 ) it's so bad that it's boring. <br /> <br /> So let's go to the point where we all agree - this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> I'm voting for category 2. ) The story is almost incomprehensibly complex, and it is further torn and twisted by a remarkably poor camera and editing, but Lo Wei was so in love that it slows down the pace so we can all have a long look at whether we want it or not. <br /> < Maybe Lo Wei was upset for the day (or two) when this movie was made - he just wanted everyone to suffer, cast, crew and audience. <br /> <br /> Save suffering.
