My spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie makes me so angry that I packed up. <br /> <br /> Once you've finished, you're staring at the TV in confusion and horror. Then there is a soft tap on his shoulder and a voice hisses: "You will die in seven days." You turn around and one of your best friends stands there with the expression of utter hatred for the one who designed this movie when you were in a sensation. I will not lie: this is the worst film on Earth's surface. I saw it with 5 of my 18-year-old boyfriends, and that was our reaction: - One person actually started crying and punching - one person screaming and fainting - One person got up and staggered out the front door. it reappears more than an hour later - One person just darkened (this one was me) - One person started to babble incoherently as if he had both cerebral palsy and Touretts' syndrome - One person went to some kind of catatonic trance and didn't respond to our voices twenty minutes <br /> <br /> The movie is really so bad. There is one part where the retarded cameraman actually travels (while holding the camera), but the producers decided to leave it. Seriously, you can hear him grunt and swear when he hits the ground. There is only one special effect and it's strange, just as a retarded kid trying to solve the Rubix's cube is special: the camera rotates so that the action on the screen (action, n. Some dumbass lost in the maize field for 80 years) Freaking minutes) makes a barrel roll. Under no circumstances should it be monitored, and the film itself warns you of this fact. Do you know what slogan is on the back? "Some warnings should not be ignored." I honestly think that publishing this film for the public is a bad practical joke on the part of producers. However, this does not mean that you should go through it if you see it in a movie shop - then it would sit on a shelf to be seen by some other poor people. Rather, buy every copy you can get in your hands and send it to people you hate.
