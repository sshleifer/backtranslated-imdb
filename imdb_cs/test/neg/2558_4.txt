This movie was a rather special viewing experience. Of course, the film is based on play. Now I'm sure everything in this movie works fine in the game, but in the movie it just doesn't seem very interesting to watch. The film is too "stagey" and has not bothered to change any of the dialogues to make it more suitable for the film. Instead of being presented now, it is almost literally re-filming stage play, with over-the-top characters and staged dialogue. Because all this is really not working and the movie becomes almost complete bore- and outdated viewing experience. It takes a while to find out that this is a comedy you're watching. At first you think it is the drama you are watching, with unpredictable characters in it, but as the film progresses, you will notice that the film is rather a tragicomedy that rests more on comedy rather than drama. Br /> <br /> Characters and dialogs are really things that make this movie an unpredictable and over-top-top that sometimes really becomes unnoticeable. Sure, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among other things, do not actually offer the movie "enough attentive". The story is completely disoriented. The story is basically nothing and focuses mainly on the characters of the brother / sister playing Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is this story about? The film feels meaningless and outdated, which has very little to offer. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage, but as a movie it's really not suitable and just doesn't work. in some sequences even laugh badly. Director J. Lee Thompson could have expected more than films that seem to have made much better films than they did in case of failure, screen-translated play, project. <br /> <br /> Not really. worth your time. <br/> <br/> 4/10
