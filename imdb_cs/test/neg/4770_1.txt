My review is divided into questions you should ask yourself: <br /> <br /> 1. Plants that eat people have been made several times. It was used by Nintendo in everything from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime. It was used in a lot of low-budget 50 films, on par with the lowest of the Godzilla series. And it brings another level of cheese with plants that TALK. I don't know anyone going out, but I know a lot of people who broke up in some parts of the movie. I was one of them. Does the horror genre deserve a little better than the pile of ridiculous stupidity? <br /> <br /> 2. Characters could easily be copied / pasted from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or any other movie with collage kids with bad luck. But it is called "characterizing" when the film takes hours to tell you that hundreds of characters had before? You never want a movie to have characters that were not just forgotten pieces of meat with your feet? 3. It wasn't bloody. The guy cuts off his skin. Oh, my! (No.) The guy gets his legs broken. Oh my! Gasp! (No.) I showed movies like this to my mother who hates everything she has to do with horror because she makes her sick, and she said, "I saw PG movies worse than that! Why was it rated R?" So why was it rated R? 4. Here's the only movie / book storyline: collage kids drink, have sex, get naked, cruse, bleed, and eventually die. This is perhaps the most typical example of a cheap, thoughtless horror movie, but people call it "mature"? What is it. . .? 5. I don't think I've ever seen anything less original in the way I have watched A Beautiful Mind. You've never sat there and wished something worse genre, the most diverse genre. . . well, diverse? Something really original? I just wish other horror movies to have a real horror, not just cheap collage pages that were filmed with some fake blood splatters that fit around. <br /> <br /> 1/10
