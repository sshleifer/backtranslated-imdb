Talking about how Jan-Michael Vincent is fresh led me to a silly re-visit to this mid-90s DTV entry. The child is traumatized when he sees a fallen ice cream man in the 1950s and he grows up as a psycho ice cream man (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and end up in ice cream. Blah blah blah. Director Norman Apstein (credited as Paul Norman) made a career before giving birth to porn and then returned to him. That's what you get for all the murders taking place off the screen. And for expelling a thin boy like a fat boy and forcing him to wear a suit. Just throw a fat boy! Also there is a scene where Vincent stoically responds to a group of escaped loons that surround him. He was either completely drunk and was terrified for his life, or the filmmakers captured his "I really sank so low?" shame full. Despite being a low budget, it became a few good names, including David Naughton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner, and Doug Llewelyn's own. How can you make a boring slasher with this cast is behind me.
