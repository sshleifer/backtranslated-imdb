On one Thursday evening at 10:00 pm, my local west coast ABC affiliate aired a pilot episode of "Northern Exposure". The ABC network usually broadcasts "Men in Trees" in this time slot, but the program was anticipated for a live sporting event. Despite both shows, they are set in Alaska and filmed on site in the Pacific Northwest (Exposition in Washington State, Trees in Vancouver, BC), re-watching "Northern Exposure" (as well as several episodes of "Sex and The City ") reminds me of how disappointed I am with the poorly conceived hybrid" Men in the Trees ". Anne Heche can be a good actress with the right material. Unfortunately, her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in Alaska grows on my nerves. Perhaps because I think Heche is wrong, I am not convinced that she has the character "fish out of water". Also, I can't help but feel that the support cast is typical of unpredictable stereotypes. Hot-looking local, kind bar owner, Bush pilot, local police officers, matte but well-meaning radio DJ, etc. <br /> <br /> The only stereotype that can be broken was the teddy bear and veteran "ER" actor Abraham Benrubi as a local bartender in love with two different women. Since one of the executive producers is film director James Mangold (his films "Heavy" and "Cop Land" were leading characters who were big men), then I'm not surprised why Benrubi was cast in atypical role. However, I see why there are plenty of dedicated viewers who love "Men in Trees". It fits the unpredictable niche for TV viewers. I wished the show could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows.
