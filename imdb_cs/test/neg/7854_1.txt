I am a fan of good historical fiction and I was thrilled by the idea that someone would take a well-written book series and shoot it. Writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction, but if you have a book that you customize, it would be nice to actually follow the plot line. The depictions of the Vespasians (the real emperor and his two sons Titus and Domitian) were terrible. They acted as cook Caligula and were "bad" in this adaptation. There was a scene with Titus publishing justice, as if he were Caligula (from the eponymous film). The way Vespasianii is displayed in the books is mostly followed by the historians' reports at that time - they were just and reasonable, not tainted by the Imperial Claudian madness. Helena (Marcus Didius Falco's love interest) gives Pertinax as one of the reasons for divorcing (one of the title traitors) was that he was a traitor, but in the books it was because he ignored her and she she felt better to marry someone who would appreciate her as a person. Marcus in the film gets a slave named Justus, yet in a book that he could barely afford his apartment, let alone a slave. There was certainly no romantic fall between the nonexistent Justus and the female Gladiator ... <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a good crystal of Roman stereotypes, you get Caligula if you want a good classic from a perspective, I, Claudius.
