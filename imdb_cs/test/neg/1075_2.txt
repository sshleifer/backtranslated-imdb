The film was well done at the box office, and the producers of this mess thought that the stars had such good chemistry in throwing them into a much darker skirmish skirmish, The Gazebo. Frankly, I am shocked to see all the positive comments on this ridiculously rendered unfair comedy. Both leading characters have a maturity of seven years and are much less interesting to spend time. The veteran of the cast, including Fred Clark, Harry Morgan and Eva Gabor, provides excellent support. And beautiful cinema certainly makes the rich Spanish landscape fresh. And there are four or five really funny scenes to go with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and indecent mess. I can't recommend It Starts with a kiss.
