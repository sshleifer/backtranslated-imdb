This movie starts by showing you a map and then explaining the radar and it's been a long time before you see a deadly mantis. Probably a better film in the fifties is this dated bit a little slow motion and payout at the end is not very good. Although he has his moments, as when the Perry Mason guy argues with an old man, and when he says, "I've narrowed my options to one", excuse me, but when you narrow down, you have a couple or more options, not one. If you can reduce it, but actually find out what it is. The monster is a standard sci-fi fair of the 1950s, better than telling locusts at the beginning of the end. Acting is a subpara, and the heroine is the most attractive ... in fact, in some shots, he looks like a guy in trouble. You see a lot of fighter shooters and other things, but you'll see a lot of all the deadly mantis.
