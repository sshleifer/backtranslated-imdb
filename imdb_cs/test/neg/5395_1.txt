I got it in the Six-Pack Horror by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This one isn't the worst movie ever made, but it's still angry. In fact, this movie sucked so hard, I don't know how I will write this review, especially since 1. I threw it out of the DVD player because I couldn't even watch another second and 2. Hurricane friggin 'Ike comes and God knows how long it will take to do it. The film begins with a scientist and his wife. The scientist receives a valuable artifact and examines him when allegedly Urban Legend known as the Skeleton of Man kills him and later his wife. Then ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but I can't say anything other than bothering about this POS. I currently use the drive as a track, and if you see it, you might want to do the same. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker had to have cash ... BADLY! <br /> <br /> PS. I will largely review the boxing movies and can make a new review of the Ghoulies IV.
