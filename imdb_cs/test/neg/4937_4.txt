"Shuttle" is an independent thriller about four young adults who boarded one night on a shuttle bus from the airport to see that the driver is a sadistic psychopath. Although some of the sequences scare and it's an unusually interesting plot, some aspects just don't. Bad dialogue and improbable characters give a good reason not to worry about them. But often the tension works and asks you the question "What would you do?" and usually what you would do is not what these idiots do on the shuttle. <br /> <br /> If you expect a mindless, bloody horror, you will be wrong. This is a movie that causes you to use your mind, but unfortunately not to the end. Four out of ten.
