Wow, this is anti-Christian bias big-time! It is based on Stephen King's novel and wrote this kind of bias before and then Hollywood exaggerated it even more. In this film, we see a Protestant minister and a Catholic priest BOTH who acts like fools and is also a profane. Of course, the devil took over the city, so perhaps his influence is also on these boys, but they are typical Hollywood paintings. They never show a minister who talks and acts like Billy Graham, or your local minister or priest. And - another "given" - makes the Satanic character the most interesting film. Max Von Sydow plays the devil and makes him a nice guy. Ironically, Von Sydow played a number of these roles after displaying Jesus in the 1964 film, "The Greatest Story Ever Told". He doesn't know if there is God, Satan, or anyone in between. Ed Harris, who has played many unlikely roles until the last few years, is appropriately cast in this story. He and the other crushing characters in this movie don't make it fun to watch. From what I have heard, the King's book is even darker and more sick than this film of hate but better designed. Honestly, who cares. King and Hollywood deserve each other.
