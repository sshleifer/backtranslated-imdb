Dr. Chopper will begin shortly after the teenager Nicholas's mummy (Robert Adamson) has died, is still defeated, but every cloud has a silver lining, and in this case his mom seems to have a log cabin on Lake Tatonka. "A friendly place for happy people" she didn't tell him about. So there together with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) and three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy), they go there for a fun weekend. Unfortunately things don't go according to plan, the cabin turns out to be a little more than running down the shed and their neighbors turn out to be Dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) & his two sisters go around killing someone they meet to use it in horrible experiments ... <br /> <br /> If you are going directly to the video / DVD of Dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schoenburn, and this movie seems to have some nice rough reviews on IMDb, while I think Dr. Chopper as a horror is pretty worthless, I don't think some of the criticisms I've read are quite justified. The script, which is taken very seriously, is attributed to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not ...) who has the role of Detective Crocker on the IMDb list, although I can't remember any character of that name. one of the cops? In any case, the basic story is fine, I assume that although it's tad boring and takes too long, it's a typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running out of our annoying American teen cast, you know the drill now. Except for some short and undeveloped nonsense about Dr. There are not many stories to Chopper, who uses body parts to replenish his own body, and the script seems to exist only to invent the situation for girls to take their peaks, there are inevitable sex scenes, there's a sequence where some The girls have to finish the top of the dressing-up toilet house and there are also a couple of lesbians, one of whom is seen without her full dress compliment. Oh, and when I say topless, I think they're not wearing any tops, but they all hold their bras, so you might want to remember that in Dr. So there is it really, it's an average story that has a slightly surprising twist at the end, which is wasted, is filled with poor clich√© stupid character that exists only to show off some cheap gore scenes and girls in bra. To be honest, I expect a little more of my movies, but then maybe I'll just be picky. Director Schoenburn actually does, it's by no means the worst movie I've ever seen though it still looks cheap. There is no style here, I didn't think it was a scary and no atmosphere. Gore is limited and limited to some dead bodies and separate limbs, there is nothing new, nor any special convincing effects. Dr. Chopper is also one of those movies where character decisions and motivation are ridiculous. Technically, it's a little rough around the edges, but it's pretty well done on what was probably a really low budget, the Forest Places are suitably isolated, even though the police office looks like a front room and two sisters on the beginning look like strippers. Acting is fine, it could be better, but I certainly saw worse. Dr. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Chopper contains a doctor riding a motorcycle with a helicopter, but unfortunately it is not enough to satisfy me, even though it is reasonably competent to produce, without any real gore, nudity or decent plot.
