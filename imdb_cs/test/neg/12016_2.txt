Seriously! You've just seen this movie to understand everything that's wrong with it. It came out at a time when everyone was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (little rascals, nanny, etc.), but they lacked charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the film is driven by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who only shows deterioration and fatigue, perhaps in a tired clich√© this movie likes them. Simply put, the biggest mistake of the movie was not playing, nor filming but mainly writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney's classic, although this film lacks the fullness of IL 'Walt's heart. Junior's Dad, (John Ritter) will upset you without doing anything, just because he allows Junior to run unattended and gives him only a strict warning when he records 200 pounds on the chalk board. Also junior grandfather is especially unbearable. For those of you who saw the first, they found it to be nausea, so he didn't see the other, "Big Ben Healy", as mentioned in this movie, is still a total shower. Basically, it flows into John Ritter's house without inviting him, settling in the Junior Room, even though he says he hates Junior, and basically does nothing to speed up the film, or to support the film in some way. Instead, he tickles the viewer by being a lazy free loader. Finally, we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters, such as Smug, Unpleasant, Trixie, who carries dynamite in her backpack. , which first lights up, then by hand, to Junior, who simply looks at his eyes. Gilbert Gottfried is also returning to this film, this time playing an uncomfortable director at the new junior elementary school. If Gilbert Gottfried is not enough to get a point ahead, I will simply say: This film smells! 2/10 stars because the actor's beliefs shine through the film, even though the script sucks.
