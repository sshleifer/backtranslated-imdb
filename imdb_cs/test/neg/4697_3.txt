I just got back from seeing, "comedian". It was OK. I was looking at the screen. It's just not what I want to go to pay $ 7 to see. <br /> <br /> Now don't get me wrong, it would be a great HBO feature. If it was something I was watching on TV, I'd be addicted to it. It gives an amazing view of what the comic will go through before and after the podium. He will be interested in anyone who likes comics. But when I go to the movies, I'd love to have fun. I'm not there to educate myself. Now I know what it's like for Jerry Seinfeld to go on stage. But truthfully, I'd rather just laugh at his jokes rather than worry about something. One more thing: Onry Adams has a bad attitude; I expect to see him take my order from Burger King before I see his special HBO. He wasn't funny. He's the man you love to hate.
