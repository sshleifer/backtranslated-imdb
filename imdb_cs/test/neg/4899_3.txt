It's a pity Barry Humphries infamous Sir Les Patterson's character had a movie debut in this under-cooked spy / comedy. This film reminded me of Beatty / Hoffman stinker, Ishtar (1987). Humphries should learn from the mistakes the film has made - if you want to change speed to the concept DO NOT USE SPIES! Like Ishtar, the first 20 minutes offer a promise of something else. It would be great to see the anachronistic and Boor Patterson, who is angry in the world of Australian politics. One of the characters even points out that Patterson is dated today - do you think Humphires might have a field day to comment on Hawke's government (I can imagine a scene with Patterson and Hawk in a drink contest). Instead of a movie that could be a clever and even scathing glimpse into this world, Patterson runs around the world when James Bond tries to save the world from biological chemicals weapons that run out of steam by half the mark. Disappointment.
