The only reason I saw this movie was that he had Giovanni Ribisi and was supposed to be "Horror". Don't be fooled, this movie has to be the worst "horror" movie I've seen. It's about these people who go to a secret place that has "Monster" in it. A monster is a man with a deformed face running around in his blue pants that has a brain appetite. Some people are dying, some people are not. Finally, he discards the monster from the plane and then happily leaves. BUT OH NO! MONSTER IS ENJOYING THE PLAN PLAN! Go spend 2 hours in some other way, such as watching the paint dry on the wall, trust me, it's more fun than the bullshit.
