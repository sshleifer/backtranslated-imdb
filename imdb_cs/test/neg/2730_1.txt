On Wednesday afternoon I was exposed to this pile when my mother-in-law was watching her. I can't get through someone who basically makes a remake of a crappy high-budget Hollywood flop ("CORE" with washed actors like Luke Perry). If HIGH unleashed one of them, what do people think that making a SAME movie two years later with no budget would go anywhere? Most of the movie I laughed at, because it was insanely similar. You've seen "Core", you know why you make it worse is funny because CORE was so bad that it was funny. will be up to your aisle. The only thing I can say is that I wish Luke Perry to be able to have a career because he's not a terrible actor. Crappy made for television films, which will run only on television, is a step closer to the end, if it wasn't 90210, it would have a career.
