1988 Post-Disaster Post GJS Amitabha Films Lost Quality They Had Earlier <br /> <br /> Barring MAIN AZAAD HOON, which was released in 1989 and which was a great film break, was all movies mostly ruined except HUM (1991) later in 1991 This is another Amitabh crap that movies people have rejected in the early 1990s. The film he made as a friendship to Shashi Kapoor, who directed the film and does not take a penny The film also had Rishi and Dimple (once again opposed by RANBHOOMI) <br /> <br /> The film came in 1991, when Bachchan had 4 versions and 3 flops among them INDRAJEET, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> <br /> Ajooba came 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR both supernatural movies that were rejected It's another type of stupid Bachchan wears a mask and Krissh clothing and performs a spell that turns 1 person into donkey.etc special effects, but the film is too bad to watch him <br /> <br /> Direction from Shashi Kapoor not good Musi c is bad <br Among the actors Amitabh became too old in 1991 and looked tired, his acting is fine, but not on par with his best Rishi is fine Dimple is fine, the rest are forgotten
