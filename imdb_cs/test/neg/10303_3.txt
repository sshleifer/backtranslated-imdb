On the recommendation of a friend and admiration for Philip Baker Hall, I rented the first season of Disc Loop.It's a typical television comedy with all the clich√©s that the genre employs with "shocking" scheming brother (Sully), "ditzy" blonde (Lizzy), token unrequited interest in love (Piper), a sarcastic Asian helper (Darcy, who reminded me of Arlissa, as if ANYone had to be alerted to the THAT show). The story deals with various misfortunes (usually Sully), which confronts Sam, who puts his work in the plane at risk, just to save him, saying that Wednesday's "hijiji" happens. I didn't have an episode. I have described them all to T. There is a problem, because what seems like it could be a passage of fun initially gets unnecessarily musty as they watch episodes in a row and still get bored of believing in endless repetition. Sully does something 'crazy', Mimi Rogers says something overtly sexual, Russ tells about his gay son, Darcy makes her impersonation of Sandra Oh on Arliss blah blah blah blah. The only positive is the lack of unpleasant laughter. But don't be deceived to think it's good. Go watch a much better comedy. Arrested development, always Sunny in Phillidelphia, two name two from the top of my head. Surprised that this one is still in the air. Oh, that's right, Fox just cancels the good show, I forgot. Needless to say, I no longer want to trust my friend in the shows. <br /> <br /> My class: D +
