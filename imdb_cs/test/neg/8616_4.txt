In-name-just a sequel to John Carpenter Vampire, this film takes place in Thailand and includes sects of bad vampires who like killing people, and a sect of good vampires who don't. While it's an interesting idea to set up a vampire movie in Thailand, writers don't seem to do much with the exotic site. This movie could just as easily be set in Los Angeles. Which brings me to my next point, which is that it seems like it's a lot like Blade Lite. We have a rock soundtrack, martial arts battle scenes, a blood circulation club, and, of course, a lot of sharp objects going through vampires. What we don't have is budget and talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, too bad that his actions weren't so good, and there are plenty of decent wire work and lots of rotated combat sequences, maybe too much. The problem is that they just don't have the same impact as Blade movies. Maybe it's just that the movie has "been there to see that" he feels to him. However, the biggest problem for me was that the filmmakers did not take enough time to establish a relationship between management, buff and bland Colin Egglesfield, and his girlfriend. After the exchange begins with his friend, he catches himself at the very beginning of the film. At this point we have no interest in her welfare and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk her neck to save her. Now it's a major drawback when it's the main plot of land. Finally, you could do worse than 85 minutes of your time with this, but I can think of much better things. with your time, like renting Blade movies.
