Like many comments over me, though it was an average scifi movie, but unfortunately it wasn't. I found out that it was more of a sponsorship and a preaching. But that's not the only note. The scenes are very "artificial" (not like in scifi as I explain in a few moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The film is more or less a discussion between two groups. The physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing side by side, the middle one typically speaking. In the worst case, the other party is represented by one person. Also, interviews with journalists are very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example, it is sometimes a discussion among reporters (I think it is "akward" from the perspective of the interviewee). In addition, interviews always stay calm, they say everything without normal emotions. I.e. You can't tell if they're lying or not, they're crazy or not. They show almost nothing. This is also a very unprofessional, 'Christian' reporters always believe in everything the people they talk to tells them. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: <br /> <br /> All conversations include: <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br /> - arguments for / con <br /> There are no lies. Nobody is lying. (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you plan to see the movie) The only thing that is happening is to show how bad the infidels are. This leads me to the conclusion that the film is a B-film. This is very similar to 'Plan 9 of Outer Space' (from the 1950s), but this film also has an annoying, misconfigured discussion of extraterrestrials and Christian faith. NOTE: I do not intend to insult Christians, people who believe in aliens or anyone else. That's the idea I have about film, not about people. I would also like to note that I do not know whether the actors are bad or that they have just gotten terrible scripts.
