All right, it breaks. Why is it one of the worst movies ever? Because there are so many answers to this question, I have headaches. Come on ... Cracker World? Mr. Honke? That part with an Arab guy? It's just horrible, I really didn't care about the whole white racism, but when they did it with an Arab guy, I wanted to get the names of all the writers. It's really not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. It's not funny at all, which was my first interpretation. I hope the person who drove this movie won't commit suicide, but it seems likely that I don't see any other options.
