"The Love Letter" is one of those movies that could be really smart but unnecessary. The film focuses on a letter that caused confusion in a small town. So Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond have recently played in a super-cheerful "In & Out" (also a little town excitement) where they were both great, but here they look like they're getting drugs everywhere. I can't say what they're trying to do behind the camera (if anything), but they certainly did nothing. How tragic it is that a potential mutiny of rebellion is wasted.
