It's just me, or the fact that a bad racing team is Japanese and that their arrogant star racer is German, seems a bit over the top? Maybe it's on the international racing circuit, but if they all represent America, it's like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who still had to learn how to act), and then I would be rooted in another country. Formula films can be good, but characters must be nice and nobody in this movie meets these criteria. In short - a very bad movie.
