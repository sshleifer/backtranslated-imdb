I don't really know why I'm writing it. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say this: <br /> <br /> When I first saw some movies, I love them. As time goes by, my opinion on the film is changing. it happened with the end of days. I liked it for the first time I saw it. I thought it was fun. But a few weeks later my opinion changed. To solve this, I watched it again in the house of friends. Well, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I'm a logical person. If I see a logical hole in the movie, I try to ignore it. When I see two, then I start bothering. More than two and I'm p *** ed off. The end of days turned me off after the second track. First, the film is a bit depressing. All this is sad. Everything from Arnold to film. But dark looking movies don't bother me, but did something else ... <br /> <br /> If Satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you kill him in his deadly form? If you shoot him, his skin will grow. If you cut his head off, a new one should emerge. So the question: what is the point of trying to kill him? I'll tell you why: because it's a stupid movie that has a recycled villain. This is not my devil. This is a human being reminiscent of Bond's bad guys who give the whole system out to the hero. As I said, it's worth looking, but you don't see it twice because it's crap.
