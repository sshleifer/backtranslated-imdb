I was hoping Pulp would be an interesting movie, but he was deeply disappointed. Fiber has a very small story and what you never care about your interest. It was a real struggle to watch it. When he says to you "huh? That's it?!"? This is where you think after watching - why do they ever bother? It's bad because Michael Caine is a good actor. I also hoped to see a big Lizabeth Scott in it, but it only appears on the screen for a minute. Scott is one of the best films noir femme fatale and that was her latest film. <br /> <br /> Well ...
