It contains the main spoilers, the chance you would actually be interested in story line. OK, we have a storm that destroys a city and a computer hacker who spews power. <br /> <br /> Predictable schlock from scratch, and if it wasn't enough, 5 seconds of action hit between the movie and the ads to kill what little tension could be there. For example: will they arrive at the airport in time? Things look dark when we go on commercial ?? A action shot before the ads shows that they are reflecting around inside the plane! Well, I think they'll do it after all? But then again, they had to, because they're good guys. Acting wasn't very impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid as Tommy Tommy), the effects were a little weak, the mildew got it and the good guys came. The real catastrophe of this film was the script, especially the end. Not only did they happily pack things as fast as the soap opera gave 24 hours of attention to cancellation, but they celebrated the hacker as well-intentioned. So he caused the death of the basilias? And, of course, the uplifting final TV news of how people meet. Barf. It was all I expected from the ads, and I'm glad I was wasting my time watching. Tomorrow it will be a great conversation at the midday table. <br /> <br /> CBS insults us by doing it? Yeah, but we watched it, didn't we? Did you count a lot of ads that were created for home backup generators during this pig? <br /> <br /> Hope in the next plan 9 from space (which is better each time you browse). That's not it. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
