How come so many talented or at least charismatic actors ended up in this balloon? Nothing is very good about this film, but the worst things are probably script and direction. It seems to be the director Damian Niemans's heart-piece as it is written and directed (and also acted on). He is a card magician himself, and he seems to have named the characters in honor of other famous wizards. That was his first feature film, as far as I know, and the chance it's his last. Is it difficult to point out what makes it so poor? but I would say that the story and the characters are not believable (script) and the director does not give any encouragement (director). Plus ?? Poker Scenes Are Bad In The Worst Hollywood Way (Super Hands, Hollywood Rules)! The projected twists in the film are either completely predictable or absolutely incredible. They simply end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as "a few decent scenes"!
