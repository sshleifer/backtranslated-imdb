Travolta and Thurman deserve a better film. It is very secondary in all aspects, not a new idea. But the biggest problem is the ridiculous philosophy of this film. The black rapper's gang of all their criminal activities and even the killing of people are becoming almost positive heroes like Mickey Mouse who perform on stage and award prizes at the ceremony. Maybe it corresponds to real life. But showing it as a fairly normal "happy-end" is beyond my imagination. "What's wrong with filming a few bad Ukrainians if they're not politically correct?" - show must go on! That's why I think Hollywood writers have a big problem with the separation of good and evil, even though the genre is supposed to be a "black comedy".
