I would probably agree with all the bad comments about this movie because I honestly thought it was such a bit of bullshit that the actors did a terrible acting job and the script was terrible. Although special effects were not a bit bad, but I think it should be much harder. I mean, Clara Bryant has gotten into this movie, I think she would have done much better if she looked a little farther and that would be the same with Kristen Honey, I think her character will die and she doesn't bother to try and defend herself that it must be a total joke. She should at least do a lot better than she could become a soldier or more heroine or something like bravery. But the point is that the actors did a complete mindless work, as did the director and writer who made the film. they were supposed to go to film school to come up with some better ideas, and I hope everyone agreed with my methods because they probably think the same thing.
