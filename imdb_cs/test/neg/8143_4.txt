This movie is perfect for the best zombie lovers. his movie can be laughed from acting to horrible zombie action. It was said, I gave it 4 outta 10 for cos horror efforts is a hard genre to make. The bad points of this movie were as follows: <br /> <br /> #Bad #terrible sound and sound effects #really bad continuity #cheesy dialogue #one song played across the movie #stein couldn't act and in my opinion one of the worst saw #terrible ending #racist moment and theft of Simpson's character named <br /> <br /> good points # Good costume #police officers seemed to be the best gaming exp # actors with smaller lines or small roles looked like they were better # good Trying with Gore <br /> <br /> I don't want the bad mouth of the movie, its funny to watch cos of these bad points and I think that's what makes this movie OK. if it was better, I don't think it would make any difference, but it wouldn't be interesting to see a remake with all the same casts because I think they've improved over the past 7 years.
