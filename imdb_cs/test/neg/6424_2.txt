I know a few people who look the same as the main actress in this movie (or at least as a character they portray.) Everyone gives me a mold and I would be the last person to ever lend one of them a gun or even a sharp knife. He has one medium and ugly expression. If you can conjure up a little sympathy for her, let me know. Of course I could have the same expressions of fear and fear if I had an imaginary friend who killed my true friends and acquaintances for the past 15 years. And I'm sad for our European IMDb friends, yes, some colleges and universities in the US are teaching courses on paranormal phenomena relying on pathetic defense represented by "academic freedom" and an open question . This film has no value. You will have no sympathy for any of the characters (with the exception of Aunt Lydia, who gets very soon) and the story doesn't make sense.
