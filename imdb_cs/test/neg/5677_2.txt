This show was an amazing, fresh and innovative idea in the 1970s when it was aired for the first time. The first 7 or 8 years was brilliant, but after that things fell apart. In 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it continues its decline further to a total waste of time it is today. It's really shameful how far this show has fallen. Writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for a slightly entertaining rest of the host, this show would probably not be in the air. It seems so hard to believe that the same creator who chose the original cast also chose a group of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such a brilliance and then recognize it as appropriate to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I had to put 2 stars out of respect for the original cast, which made this show a huge success. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can't believe he's still in the air.
