I hardly know where to start. Huge problems of continuity, bad gameplay, etc. For example, Sam is supposed to be far from all people, but you can see the slopes carved into the mountain beside him But the most basic problem is that the essence of Sam's adventure that paves the way for to improve his whole family, she did not touch. Instead, in the movie, he gets ticked off at his family and leaves his rich parents to be alone and, when he gets tired of it, he goes home. Where is its development? Where is the arc? <br /> <br /> If you've never read a book and can get through hokey 60isms (double / triple / quadruple falcon vision) and terrible production quality (cracking, extinguishing, fire, winter winds stopping their howling for dialogue and then restarting) , etc.) I think it could be fine for 8 years. But it is a terrible disappointment compared to the sophistication of the book. <br /> <br /> Read the book instead.
