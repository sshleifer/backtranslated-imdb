Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and no one can play Woodroe F. Call better than him. Not only was he the first and the best, he was the only person who could portray his grief and confusion. It was wrong to start and I was surprised to see it. I can even start as they woefully created Woodroe. I understand he would be old at the time, but everyone knows he'll never let him down. The first movie was the best and the only one I will watch. I hope in God that no other director plans to continue or rebuild a wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval. Without them, movies are a waste of time and money for everyone, including the director. IF YOU PLAN FOR LONG LONG DOVE ANY KIND OF FILMS, take yours and billions of others, don't waste your time. The continuation of the film is just grinding the first into the ground. Thanks.
