All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorski's movies, really. Chopping Mall is a classic. But what happened to this guy? He made funny horror movies that tried to be good. But it was hardly funny ... I think it was because I was laughing. The villain is incredible. Terrible CGI. Looks ... terrible. And the film has no gore, and no nudity as a redeeming feature. PG-13 is rated. A movie called "Bone Eater", which you know will not be a movie blockbuster, you know it probably won't have a clever script. A movie like this can count on gore ... but no. It doesn't depend on anything else, it's just ... stupid. Look at it if you want to laugh. But don't expect a good movie. I hope Jim Wynorski will return to movies like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV because it and Komodo Vs. Cobra doesn't cut it.
