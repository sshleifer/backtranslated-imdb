A very, very, very slowly moving, aimless film about a desperate young man. Not sure who was more lost - a flat character or an audience, almost half of whom left. An attempt at art with black-and-white and clever camera angles, the film disappointed - became even more ridiculous - because the acting was poor and the storyline and lines almost did not exist. Very little music or what to talk about. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo was trying to find a song that still runs over his head. He goes to the record store to buy it for his lover and has to sing a song for two sales officials before they find the album. Cute scene promised, but from there she went down. The rest of the film lacks art, magic, meaning ... If it's about emptiness, it works I mean because it's empty. He wasted two hours.
