I actually belong to the demographic Zoey 101 specifically trying to focus, so I see that just as trying to be relatable to people of my age, the assumption is just too ridiculous for the average person to apply. The show revolves around the richest boarding school in existence and the beautiful, incredibly tanned, attractive gang of one-sided characters who inhabit it. As is the tradition among children's networks, the cast is a series of skinny white children, with a black token, of course. Stories revolve around Zoey and her gang of friends stumbling on or creating some minor dilemma, such as not wanting to attend gymnastics, ending Zoey inventing a plan to save the day for all her friends. There is generally a B-line spin around a one-sided character of a guest, or placing support characters in completely unrealistic situations, such as having a bee hive in a dorm room and no one noticing. These conspiracies often play against stereotypes, such as any character that draws good grades in mathematics, and must by default completely lack social skills. Most episodes have continuous and overused will - they will not-they Chase-Zoey dynamic. Unfortunately, the characters are all incredibly one-sided; there is Zoey, the perfect girl with the solution of literally everything, Chase, still loving, but still loving Best Friend, Michael, the token black-guy (whereby Christopher Massey to manage some really funny one-liners), Lola, the theatrical chick (which means that she died of hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of fame, despite the fact that she never does anything in real theater), Logan, an effeminate narcissist, Dustin, a spazzy little brother, and Quinn, a scientific geek. A few words I have spent on each of these characters summarize each character completely. Zoey 101 sometimes becomes fun, but serious deficiencies in the value system it promotes are a major offshoot. Zoey, set up as an obvious role model and a quasi-feminist crusader and depicted flawless on the surface, still handles the main character defects. For example, when Lola was first introduced, she was believed to be a goth girl. Zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm room for being "strange". As for acting, it's clear that Jamie Lynn Spears landed this role for her name, not for talent. Although she has definitely improved as time goes by, it is clear that she is not a born actress who greatly influences the quality of the show, while most of the plot lines revolve around her character. Supporting casts are surprisingly good, especially with regard to the material they have to work with. They add quite a few good unicorns for comic relief if the conspiracy has not yet manifested itself. All in all, Zoey 101 is a bad look at life in high school and anyone in the past their limited too long shouldn't expect him too much.
