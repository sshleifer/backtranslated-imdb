The 1977 animated live action hybrid version of Gulliver's Travels (or rather "Traveling" because it only gets to Lilliput) didn't get much of a release and it's not too hard to see why. Michel Legrand comes up with some catchy melodies, but only inspires Don Black's writer to do the same. "The only simple fact is that no one is suffering from growing pain here." Again, Richard Harris is over-indulging in his passion for excessive makeup, this time dimming the eyeliner for too many bases in an attempt to hide the fact that he is at least 25 years old on the role, but at least (perhaps inadequately) reduced his greater than life tendencies to a performance consisting mainly of whispering Belgian animation looks a little better than the French morning children's television, but Peter Hunt's film is not as bad as it sounds? Real model sets for animated characters return to the 1939 version of Max and Dave Fleischers, while a few moments of the Swift Satire remain - though it is certainly aimed at the youngest children.
