1. Watched February 18, 2007 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Leon Leonard): A film about an adventure adventure based on the novel by Moby Dick, Herman Melville. This film is about a ship's captain who stole her eyes (they were extremely rare black pearls) from the statue of God's tribal tribe and hid them somewhere she only knew before he left Tivi Island. He was very ill and was on a secret way to go back to the island to get pearls for himself, while others (like his daughter) thought he was going back to be treated by a local doctor man. Others didn't know the reason for the trip. In fact, Stowway knew it was the real reason for the trip - to return his eyes to God. The stupid part is that the pearls were hidden in close proximity to the statue, and all the time the natives ran their tribe without their God having eyes (causing them all kinds of problems). Along the way we are treated (for some reason) for a short underwater natural show with an electric eel fighting the local octopus (I think only Herman Melville knows what it was about). Once they reach the island, the captain dies, but passes the pearls to his daughter, but also gets a sick curse. One of the villains finds out where God is staying and convinces his daughter to go there and steal her pearls, but at this point good guys follow. I won't tell you the results of a fight or an end, I'll leave it to you to see if you want to. As I said earlier, the film was fine, but some very stupid things I have already mentioned mitigated its impact. I wonder if this new "Pirates of the Caribbean" got some of his plot out of this --- hmm ?? black pearls, curse (I wonder?) Well, it doesn't matter, these elements didn't make any good film in this case. They seem to have learned that they are a lesson, but with the money in the new movie I'm sure they won't. Oh, good.
