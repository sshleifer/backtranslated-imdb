this movie is not that big ... at all, but it's good if you just want to laugh because it's pretty ridiculous :) it has a lot of bugs and it's cheesy. I have this movie for Christmas, like 5 years ago, but for some reason I never gave it away. I think I like that on a rainy day, though I just watch it once a year. It's a 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts. this movie is good for someone young ... even though it made up for me, I didn't have it much when I was 12, but that's just my personal opinion. the movie was really predictable. I wish he had some strange strange twists, but I think he was trying to be a good movie for anyone who enjoys it. I think it was good for the whole family, but Hallie's dress was a bit unfashionable, but certainly suitable for family material.
