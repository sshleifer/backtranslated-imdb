The monster will be very well known to you. So the rest of the movie if you saw half a dozen of those teenagers who were trapped in the woods. Well, they're not teenagers, this time, but they can be. Three couples decide that it would be a good idea to try an almost abandoned ghost town, hoping to find the gold people killed less than a century ago. Do you think that things like "Miner's Massacre" can become interesting. No. In fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. I imagined teams of frightened miners who collapsed in their caves in their cave, praying that Black Lung Disease would get them before the Grim Reaper forced its terrible revenge, but instead I got the Earth's twenty-two whores - and one case, defecating - in a forest, a gang of sages with collective IQ it would have trouble pulling a plastic ring out of a box of Cracker Jacks, a much less buried treasure from an abandoned mine. No tension, fear and a lot of embarrassing performances give this turkey 3 nudity.
