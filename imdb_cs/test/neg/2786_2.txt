I woke up and it was a beautiful day; The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and I was making a movie, something new, maybe a horror movie? Like many other reviewers, I came across what can only be described as a piece of poopy in a gold wrapper. The front cover is great and the commentary on the back is fascinating - "frightens you with crops" ... oh how I laughed at looking at such naivety and ignorance. One of the most terrifying things about this movie is the acting skills of these "actors". I guess not, I was actually cheering on these "scarecrows" who wore some classic costume costumes. I drove quite quickly around the corn fields as I found them to be quite scary at night, but when I saw this movie, I was almost wet alone (through so much laughter) just in sight. I saw a more frightening omelet quite frankly, not mine, even though I was hand-to-hand in cooking an omelet, and if somebody joins this film with my omelet, let's say I would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie three times in a row. <br /> <br /> If anyone has any good corn movies that they could recommend, please let me know. It's a great comedy, if nothing else, OK, it's nothing else. Enjoy but a bit of advice - Throw it out of the window before pressing the play button on the DVD player.
