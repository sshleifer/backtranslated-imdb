Seriously, people ... I was getting ready to write Radu Razzie and recommended this movie as Razzie Champ for 2007 ... until I got on IMDb.com and realized that the date of his copyright was in 2006 And not in 2007. Seriously, although this movie could easily be Razzie Champ. This movie was sucked! As in the world this piece of crap has been overlooked and for Razzie's nomination in 2006 he is behind me because it could easily compete with Basically, it stinks, too for the 2006 Razzie Championship. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie on the recommendation of my neighbor, who told me, "My God, after seeing this movie, it will be a long time before I stop by when I stop ! " I couldn't believe how scary and horrible this movie was! Possible spoilers below, not that you'll miss out on something. OK, above all ... the problem ... the rest will stop itself. Of course, the director of this piece of crap doesn't know the first thing about women. Toilets in this rest area were on a par with Trainspotting. I am not saying that I know all about women, but one thing I know is that women are largely utterly hygienic. Since you pick the crap on one of the toilets and maybe catch something or squat in the woods, the woman chooses to squat in the woods. I know because I used to go camping with them before and they don't have a squatting problem in the woods. So right here ... the main hole and the false. Secondly, it comes from a stop and her friend driving the car is nowhere to be found, not even him or his car. He just left. He starts shouting his name and wondering where he is. Ummm ... hi? You stand on wet mud ... ever happened to you to look at some tire tracks? I mean, his car's gone ... it just didn't rise and fly. And actually, it leads me to think ... Actually, I was looking down at her feet and there were no treads in the mud. How ... exactly ... did it happen? <br /> <br /> Third ... browsing mobile home families with crazy dwarfs in the back with Polaroid pictures ... Wtf!?!?!? ? They made no sense at all and it is as if the director just threw them to be strange to be strange. They had no meaning whatsoever, and they had no place in the film. Fourth ... Oh my God, this ... finally ... near the end of the movie. .. finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling in a halt. I'm glad, "You ... stupid ... bi ** h. You were locked in this rest stop all the time ... and you just ... you know ... escape the hatch in the ceiling?" ..that seemed to throw it just because the killer threw a window window gasoline on the ground and was about to light a match. So they must get to the higher ground to avoid burning, and ... oh, look! The perfect reason to get to the next level! Escape hatch on the ceiling! It's like ... Why didn't she go through it before? Most people in this situation would see that since they were closed in this rest stop, they got f ** k from Dodge. When they showed that the hatch escape at the end of the movie, I was like, "You gotta be kidding." Fifth ... what was the solution with all the people she met still disappearing? Girl in wardrobe in basket at rest? The stupid cop? At the end of the movie, when she ended up in a closet on a broomstick? It has never been explained. Personally, when they did, I thought, "Oh, Christ on the cracker, she's her. She's a murderer. Wonderful. She killed all those people, she doesn't remember, and the writers of this movie just ripped a French horror movie I can't mention IMDb.com, or I'll be blacklisted for giving away the end (the film being sucked, by the way, people) But it wasn't a murderer and the whole deal with the dead people was never explained Oh, for the love of God, people, stay away from this This movie sucked up the balls, and now I have a serious bone to collect with my neighbor, it's for 2 for a $ 1 Family Video stand, not even renting it if someone gives you it for free!
