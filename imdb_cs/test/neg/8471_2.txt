I watched several times as she cooked before I wanted to pull my hair out. Just one question ..... Who can't cook a tasty meal in an ordinary meal in 30 minutes, when all you need is handy, already in the sack, sometimes chopped up and you have very little else than to chop a few greens . Also, almost every TV show is 30 minutes long and most of these cooks do all their preparatory work (except Sandra Lee) during their show. Oh and yeah ... they're also doing full-fledged meals. <br /> <br /> I love this guy's comment that hated the "EVOO" commentary. Add "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid words. Then you have an obvious ... loud, gregarious woman who is truly her own best audience. He laughs at his own lame notes, cups too many times for the camera because he wants to convince us that he is as good as he thinks. NO is not the "cutest thing". She is a 40-year-old woman who is not DE-LISH.
