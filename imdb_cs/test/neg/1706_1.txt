It is a film that revolves around two mysteries (which I have now demystified). First, the filmmakers understood the concept of "parody" before using it for the bomb carpet throughout the movie? Parody is when reproduction tries to mock, comment, or pay homage to one's own work. In other words, there should be reasons to parody such work and should definitely be smart. I didn't see any in the movie. I saw a couple of 10 seconds of jokes that fell within two seconds of delivery. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said, "Hey, I was drunk last night, watching Survivors, and had this brain fart for direct DVD release. I want you on board without reading the script ... because I plan to drive this film without one! "<br /> <br /> Here is the second secret: Eric Robert's career. I think Eric Roberts had a career he had because he was out of luck. Now I realize it's stupid (and therefore deserve the career he had). After watching this movie, it is clear that it would be better to go to regular adult movies that have higher budgets, more intense ... scenes and roles, better acting and directorial behavior, more sophisticated and more convincing conspiracy and a much wider audience than this B -film refuse (C-movie?).
