While most of Wayne B's efforts are fun in a fun way, this movie is so sloppy and written, it's bagpipe. The first ten minutes of the Wayne and Bandits themselves in the night scenes intercut with footage apparently fired on the day. Dwire plays half the white, half Apache bandit with a heavy Mexican accent and can't get rid of any nationality! I give it 3.
