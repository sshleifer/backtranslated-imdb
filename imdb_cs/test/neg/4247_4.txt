Everyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid not. I hated this movie so much that I had to turn it off for a movie. Too much time is dedicated to crying and emotional foolishness, which is why the character of Bullock is devastated by her divorce, excessively collected in the viewer's head. Enough!! And why didn't we hear more about her former husband? He is depicted as nothing but a suit that comes once in a while. Something must force her to marry him, what was it? What is it about being divorced after divorce? More time could be spent on it, rather than one more shot of Bullock lying crumpled on the bedroom floor. The dialogue is stilted, clich√© and terrible, much like one of those corrupt "ABC Afterschool Specials" or something. There is no imagination or creativity in this film, everything is very predictable and therefore boring. This movie also goes to overdrive on the cutsiness factor, very stupid and not funny as it should be! This is just another of those terribly made films, "I'm a woman, I hear me roar", similar to "Waiting for Exhale". If you want to see "I'm a woman, listen to me yelling" movies that are really fun, original and well-done, then see "Gas Food Lodging" or "Ruby in Paradise". Skip this crap! I give "Hope Floats" 3/10.
