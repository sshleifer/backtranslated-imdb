I feel really bad when I watched this movie because I only want to watch it as a concept. The Covenant seemed to be a truly original piece, but unfortunately they lost a great idea of ​​translating to the screen. The story follows four (five) teenagers who are descendants of families that began the city of Ipswitch surviving Salem witch trials. They also happen to be part of a secret sect called a "covenant". Their strength must be used sparingly because it drains their life force in small amounts and is highly addictive. Theoretically, would it be a pretty good science fiction movie? Or at least an interesting film story. But there were too many glaring falls that do not allow this film to reach its full potential plot. That playing was not good, the audio track was average and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues. The biggest problem is definitely a bad editing task. The film has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to maintain a mental timeline or any sense of stimulation. The film has moments, but overall it was a bit disappointing. And the magical 4/10
