People in ABC forgot to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were just wrong! The actor playing JPII was very tough, there was no personality. It is very obvious that this film was at the end of the program totem vote, the move is so low budget. The script is terrible. Conversations like: "You must follow the rules" "No, people are hungry." Lame. Plus, the movie was jumping like crazy out of action at the event to fit within two hours. Grapes! Better use of the time would be to watch a documentary about JPII. Also, CBS has released a miniseries on JPII, which is far better than ABC. JPII was an amazing man, and it bothers me to think that my grandchildren could seize this ABC movie and think it's what he really was!
