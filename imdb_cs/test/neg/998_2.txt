Starting with a poem with tearjerking and images of US missiles, starving children, and crippled Palestinians, I quickly realized that it would not be an objective document. Five juveniles convicted of gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explanation as to why they had to throw out the citycenters and then (oh my gods) actually paid for what they did. I still watched and raised many questions if the process was properly executed and the cops had the right to do what they did? He asked a lot of questions ... and then he fell. No arbitration interviews or browsing process documents .. nothing. In short: Nothing new about what every Swede has seen on TV a hundred times - just bad propaganda.
