The real problem with this story is that the story doesn't have much of a story. It's hard to talk about it. Widower buys an electric grandmother for her children. One child resists an electric grandmother. Then she finally accepts it. Then the children grow up and Grandma leaves. Indeed, very little happens. It's much more presumed than the story. In addition to being a schmaltz, and having a story you've done before, and better: The Lonely. The same basic idea: one cannot accept the love of a robot at first, because it is just a machine, then it finally brings out and comes to love a robot. The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much stronger, because both the protagonist and the audience are suddenly shocked back to reality and forced to realize that at the end the robot is really just a mechanism. I also found a story very flawed in that the electric grandmother is just * perfect. It's not just "human", it's * super-human *. It is wiser than a real person, has no mechanic tracks and makes the balls air. Frankly, he thinks wisely that he is a machine.
