WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE FENCE SPOILERS THAT POSSIBLE !!! Well, if you haven't come to the conspiracy yet, I'll give it to you. Two couples set off to camp, but the clown masked killer appears and causes all kinds of chaos. Now is the time to give these pairs some advice. 1. Never, never went to a camp called Camp Blood. 2. You don't have to have sex or recognize yourself before the killer. 3. Do not be chased after a murderer if he runs away. 4. Do not shout murder at killer. 5. Make sure your mobile phone works before you go camping. 6. Everyone must bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it all the time. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothes and bring a pair of running shoes. No solid and tying clothes and no high heels or sandals. 8. Wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you won't stab a bad person. 9. Always wear car keys on you. 10. Turn off the campfire when you go to bed. 11. Follow your step. If you go on something, you break the bone. 12. Check the rear seat for an uninvited estimate. 13. If the killer cornered you, at least he stood up. And guess what? At least one, but usually all four main characters break all these common sense rules. They are the dumbest characters he has ever loved film. <br /> <br /> Now for some brief comments. This film slasher was on a very tight budget. Low four out of 7 or 8 actors play more than one role. Playing, writing, direction, sound, lighting, working with the camera, rendering, editing, etc. are at the bottom of the line. But just like the classic JACK O movie it works on sooooooooo bad, it's very fun and campy fun level. So rent it and have fun. My rating: 5 of 10.
