Little Quentin seems to have mastered the art of having a cake and eating it. As usual, a pure sadistic display can be explained as a clever way of provoking how to send violence back to the audience. Sure, Mr. Tarantino. Violence is Baaad. Sadism is Baaad. It is well worth wading in to make this point. How brilliant. The juvenile part of the audience may not be smart enough to watch all the clever references to a higher level of consciousness, but I believe one day they will see light. . <br /> <br /> Thank you for improving this little world. You deserve a medal.
