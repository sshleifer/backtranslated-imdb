I rate movies on this site all the time, but I don't normally write comments. However, in this case I felt compelled by WARN OTHERS! This movie is bad! It is probably one of dozens of films I have labeled '1 (terrible).' I know people say it all the time, but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's also on the top ten. <br /> <br /> I have very low standards when it comes to horror movies. I will overlook all kinds of awkward movies for good fear. But this movie is embarrassingly bad. Looks like someone on Sears bought a video camera and decided to make a movie with his friends. (The fact that the name of each crew member is included in the cast list is demonstrated by this theory, I think.) This film has lower production standards than the average high school game. It's actually a little shocking to see a movie that looks so bad on DVD. Special effects are sometimes effective, but at best they are still amateur. The best thing to say about actors is that at least they don't remember watching the camera most of the time. I can't say for sure if he tries to remember his lines or to confront them. All humor attempts are poor. This film is such a colossal waste of time.
