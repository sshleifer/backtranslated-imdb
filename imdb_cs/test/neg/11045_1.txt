Please don't blame yourself for this bad movie. I'm in Korea (please excuse bad English). I'm sad to see these movies that make Korea look like they are obsessed with blood and sex. Even more saddened to see the murders of animals and hear how Americans say it is like Korea. We do not eat live animals !! So please stop apologizing for your crime by saying it's a culture! There are scenes with man eating live animals and not Koreans think it's normal. No, that is disgusting for us too. The director is a misfit, a sick person who has an obsession with killing and sex with family members. I wish America and France would stop celebrating this evil man who was ridiculous in his country. Please watch ANY OTHER film from Korea that will give you an idea of ​​how artistic we are. This film is waste.
