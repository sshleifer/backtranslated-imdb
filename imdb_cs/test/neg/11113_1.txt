It was **** on the UK sci-fi channel on July 5th. Shame on JRD! Maybe the week is bored! There can be no skint after LOTR. I suppose he wasn't to blame. Mr. Sheppird was. I turned off after 50 minutes, I couldn't carry it. The cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a big bat. Who financed this project? I think the whole thing must be worth $ 250. Avoid at any cost, do not think about buying a DVD if it unlocks one, I can't imagine it would spend dollars on making one. Hopefully someone will make a decent movie Chupra and a decent film BIGFOOT. Sasquatch was fine, poor Lance. It's a shame, big studio and direct won't risk, no more movies super hero please!
