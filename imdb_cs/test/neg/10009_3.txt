I literally vomited while watching this movie. Of course, I had the flu, but that doesn't mean that this movie wouldn't contribute to vomiting in the rock. Why can't Nick Cage play something he could really do as a bad actor. Nick Cage, who is brilliant in the role of a bad actor. No one could do it better.
