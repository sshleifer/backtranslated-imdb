When I voted for "1" in this movie, I noticed that 75 people voted for 146 votes. This means that half of the people who voted for this film feel that it is really terrible. I saw it recently at a film festival and I was really untouched by the fact that it was a bad performance. Cinematography is unobservable, the sound is bad, the story is carved and embedded from many other films and acting is terrible. This movie is basically a bad rip-off of three other movies. NO LIFE CLOSES IN THE USA.
