When I went to see it I thought I liked the first two and thought they were very exciting, so this should be good too. POORLY! There was no tension and no explanation about the new dinosaurs! When I watched, I lost all the respect of Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but then it turned out not to be Spielberg director or written by Michael Crichton! This movie went through "moves". I thought this movie had no plot at all, and I thought no one should waste money to see it.
