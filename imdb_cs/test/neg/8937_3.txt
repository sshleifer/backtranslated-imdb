Less than a redeeming unsolicited hunk who is mercifully freed from the devastation of competences. Some northern idiots come south and look for some Confederate rifles on the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are threatened by scary hillbillies, in wide nod to 'Deliverance'; But it turns out that hicks fronting for Northern Marijuana-Trade ID. It is brought to light so early that it does not even qualify as a twist. Women are shut down and raped in catatonia; instead of rescuing them, the boys run to the city to get a sheriff who is lazy and doesn't trust them. I think if my girlfriend were raped, I would have taken the shortest path to hiding anyway. But it's okay, because once it turns out they're going to take the baddies, the girls get jolly and jump around if it were just a trauma in real life. Also featuring a backwoods guy with a beard who pampers much. No ideas burst at the seams.
