I suppose rave reviews on this site were from people who never read the book - Unfortunately for those of us who love the text, Hollywood survived itself in destroying this. I'm not sure where a woman who is interested in love came to Earth except to replace a cat, or why our Rogue Male got a useful family in Blighty - in fact the vast majority of the book was cut out and replaced your standard crispy love story. The ambiguity about which world leader was in his monuments was completely eliminated, and our Rogue got a name (none of them appeared in the second book). I gave it rather 2 than 1 because of the wonderfully bad acne acne. Joan Bennett overcomes Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins for miles, and it's a tiny way to save her. Ah well - the British should avoid it. Believe me :)
