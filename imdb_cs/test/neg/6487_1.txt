The alleged "screaming queen" Debbie Rochon and her group of border prostitutes travel westward to the place where the title is, and face terrible murders that have proven to be the work of a cult of former psychopaths of the Confederacy trying to resurrect the South with a gratuitous massacre. > <br /> Action and thrilling events will return to a lot of boring dialogue and uninteresting character development. Billy Drago is good at the ungrateful (not to mention senseless) role of urban mortal, but everything else about this Western wannabe slasher is very poor, including the city and the fortress, both of which look like modern western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at Party City. Make it Big Instead of Watching Ravenous.
