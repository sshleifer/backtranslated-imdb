I understand this was Llyod Kaufman's attempt to save the movie that was in the pits. The whole movie is expressed because the sound disc was unsolicited. Voice overs were so bad and terrible qualities. Just as I love Tromo, they tend to be a little harder to voice over work. Acting was terrible. One thing I enjoyed from this movie was Trey Parker's fast-paced character who made a joke with aristocrats with wacky wigs. In this film there are a lot of great director dudes like James Gunn and Eli Roth (Lloyd Kaufman's friends). Again, I think it was Llyods' attempt to save a lousy movie and try not to lose 1000s of dollars. I won't go on, but this movie was a mess. Check out the other three titles.
