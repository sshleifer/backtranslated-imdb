That was something I was looking forward to. Ultimate Avengers have exceeded my expectations, and since Iron Man was one of my favorite Marvel characters, I thought the same production team would be able to do really great things with the Iron Man solo title. However, the final film was not satisfied. I didn't expect to spend most of the film paying tribute to Iron Man armor. Red and gold armor can be seen for about ten minutes. It's not a major complaint, but not what I expected from ads and frames. The worst, however, was storyline, acting and CGI animation for Iron Man monsters and armor that was not convincing. It didn't coincide with cellular animation at all. Even on his own, he seems sticky and lifeless. Tony Stark's character arc, as incredibly slow as needed, is so forced and unconvincing. I wanted to see this movie because I love Iron Man, but after I had to make a movie, I was wondering if they could come up with something that was as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies.
