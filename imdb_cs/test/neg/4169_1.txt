Bad dialogue, a slow story, scenes that drag and are totally useless. I can't believe that a lot of money was invested in such a badly written movie. Directing and playing couldn't save this bomb. 50% movie and still waiting for it to begin. He lays the foundation with a demonstration hole and then spends another 40 minutes setting the NIC. Watching 40 minutes of recording that is utterly helpless in trying to do it, I have no idea. Much of this movie is like watching a really bad French movie where nothing happens and characters are just a little boring, lifeless and egocentry living without purpose or care. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone who recommends that you be disappointed and undoubtedly cast doubt on their taste and depth.
