Too many tracks (almost one-third of this 53-minute film) really slows it down. He said that the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshall George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a solid rodeo (they call it "Ro-DAY-oh"), but the development of character and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between Bad Girl (usually Latin - even in the big "Duck Soup" [1933]) and "heroine" Polly Ann Young, Loretta Young look-like (hey! He's her sister!) Could have benefited from multiple screens. The happy ending is too sudden - though this time John Wayne kisses the girl. The most interesting footage was a long show of rodeo real Indians, squaws and papooses. But when the best part of the movie is the stunts of Mighty Yak, Yakim Canutta, who gives us jumping from one horse to another and a few different running jumps to the horse, you know we're in trouble. As others have pointed out, the final fight with the villains is very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> My copy of the 'Platinum Disc Corporation' was an added, sparse, poorly fitting (pseudo-classical) stereo music track. this will destroy the authenticity of the original film (the DVD box had "enhanced 5.1 audio" on it). If you are going to upgrade and color, you should add a "western" sounding score with acoustic guitars, 'clip-clopping' hooves, accordions and harmonica. Finally, we have to say that this is one of Lone Star's weakest efforts.
