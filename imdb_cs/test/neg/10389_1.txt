Even worse is the incredibly boring "Exorcism of Emily Rose". It started well and until my mom told Dad, "I saw her obsessed," in what I told you. It was a horrible line, badly spoken, and it marked the rapid disappearance of this amazingly bad film. Every family member has a past problem with the priest. Dad starts to blame everyone that he likes either his wife, or actually has an affair with her, culminating in killing his friend, and then appearing in obvious clarity after realizing that his friend wasn't sleeping with his wife. People are dying, others are in possession and most viewers don't even care. With the exception of his staff member Miguel, none of the characters in this film were actually likable, so it was hard to take care of them. Acting was terrible and writing worse. I'm glad I saw it for free; Even though I feel that for the movie it bad someone owes money for the time I lost.
