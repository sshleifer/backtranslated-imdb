I guess the movie was based on a hefty book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought that filmmakers, possibly a writer or director, wanted to create an epic film. But in reality there wasn't enough time to pay attention to the evolution of the characters or the story. Attractively, there were many unrelated side stories that could be edited out. In connection with the events that led to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I don't think the film explained the reasons why murder was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge? An interesting part of historical films is personal motivation or emotion. Instead, the Katyn murderers looked like vending machines, controlled solely by Stalin, who sometimes appears to be a sketch of charcoal. The depictions of the Russians and the Germans seemed completely one-dimensional. (Are the Polish people just angry with the Russians?) In addition to being poorly adapted and intrigued, or at least unrealistic, the choices of music and cinema did not coincide and were in themselves. I don't think you could shoot an epic war movie or warfare on a handheld camera. (But if a director would go with a story-driven character, perhaps focusing on one family, maybe the practical approach of cams would be better.) And if you're using really dramatic music, it needs to be better balanced by type of footage.
