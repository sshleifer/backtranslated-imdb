I'm a big fan of The ABC Movies of the Week. I'm just 27, which means I was born after the show, but I'm trying to collect as many of them as I can on DVD. I have about a dozen. I've read such amazing things about this movie, both here and elsewhere that I was really excited to see it. I just got a DVD today and I watched him closely. I admit that the first or two phone calls gave me mold - that man's voice would scare everyone! But it began to spill out quickly and the whole divorce subplot was stupid. I also found out that Michael Douglas was about half an hour before the movie was over. When the story learned about how Elizabeth Ashley closed his mother, I knew something was fish. Moreover, no one thought of him to ask him why he suddenly appeared that night when fire appeared in the barn? I admit I thought he was training a boy at school to make a phone call. I didn't guess the muted boy or prerecorded tapes (have they ever said whose voice was actually? I doubt Douglas could ever get his voice so high?). I'm just giving this movie four out of ten because I actually liked most of the games in it. Especially Ashley is great. It's a shame because this movie has such a great premise, but oh, that's what sometimes happens when you get too much in a movie.
