Wow, Jeez, I don't even know where to start commenting on this thing they called film. I don't really know what the hell David Bradley started smoking after he did Hard Justice, which in my opinion was a pretty good movie after the American Ninja. I didn't see any of those movies after Cyborg Cop. Fortunately, I saw them on Amazon as every Â£ 5 and I can safely say the following: if I threw a 5 pound cannon I spent on Total Reality, the Crisis and the expectation that I would die would end happier than if I had to sit over 90 minutes that each of them insisted. My God, how can HECK call someone "movies" ??? And why do martial artists / actors fall to their knees deep into the finest horse-dung when they want to reach their peak? I think David Bradley is not an Oscar deserver, but his first movies were pretty fun. A tough, great guy with a pretty good fighting experience who has added slanted lines, but at least entertained the actions and fans of martial arts to some extent. But I really want to know what went through that guy's head after I did Hard Justice. His last 3 films must be honest to be the worst I've ever had to sit down. As I mentioned earlier, I'd like to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. The crisis was the epitome of drowsiness, total reality was cruel, but this expectation to die is just utter nonsense. I bet the director was either mega-stoned when he did it, or he just took out a dick from every David Bradley fan who would sit in this pile of stupid. The story of circles around the physician (Bradley), which develops some type of virtual reality game in which he is only killing different people off one by one. Sorry, but I couldn't take this guy seriously playing baddie with this posh hairstyle, glasses and gray pants and doing absolutely no physical fighting at all (frankly, his best asset). The film is worse than any of the Saturday afternoon B-movies, because acting is ridiculous, directing is horrible and a few fighting in the movie, well, what can I say ... Actors look to train with their gym friend. We get a stupid muscular cop who starts to show off with his warfare stuff like an hour to film and fails badly ... a French furry version of Van Damme that just can't fight, act or talk to save his crazy life and Bradley, the supposed protagonist , playing the evil doctor I was really glad to stop making this kind of consumer waste. I even think he's not kicked a kick in this movie, probably because of his heartbeat already playing on him. For the B-actor, I have to admit that this guy, his style, character, and combat skills really loved me ... But I am really glad he stopped stopping this monstrosity because I couldn't sit over for another ninety minutes like this material. Avoid at any cost, even if you are a David Bradley family, you'll be glad you did it, word.
