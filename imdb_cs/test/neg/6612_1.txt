This movie is TRASH by go. First, it gives a description of the season, held 16 YEARS AGO! Who cares? This film had about as much depth as the bottle cap. It makes a complex person like Bob Knight into a cartoon character. The oath does not bother me, but I am still amazed that ESPN has shown a film with more curse than Kevin Smith's film on a basic cable channel. The F-word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break. This film was horrible, and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed. I rate it on the same level as Jaws IV - The Revenge and Everybody Wins ... 2 movies that are in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.
