I can't believe they even released such a movie. The only good feat came from the water in the movie. This must be one of the worst (if not the worst) movie I've ever seen. The only frightening part of the movie is bad play, I give this movie 1 it's loving to me, this movie deserves 0. <br /> <br /> Act, and if you can call it a movie, it seems that a high school boy was written. Of course, you have to ask yourself if it could have been better with better actors in it. Do yourself a favor, wait for it to appear on TV. And they are also when it comes to, it will be BACK TIME.
