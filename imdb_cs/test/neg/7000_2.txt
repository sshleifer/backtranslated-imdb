1st Watched June 21, 2001 - 2 of 10 (Dir-Emmanuel Itier): A pretty worthless supposed thriller who spends more time drawing us into sexual encounters with and without 'Amber Smith'. He is trying to wrap up the story about sex scenes, but as usual with these types of movies, it's not very good. I was so bored with this movie that I actually fast-forward through the end to get it with. The video version I watched was called 'Tell Me No Lies'.
