He has borrowed scenes from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. Humor is so dry, resourceful and frantic that you can't help but laugh at his blessing and watch it. Exactly what you would expect from HK comedy. The average person would enter the IQ 100 and leave less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this film. Humor would work better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this film is not as good as the Cantonese original. The graphics are poor compared to her Hollywood counterparts. There is excessive dependence on low CG quality. My biggest complaint is his end. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in "Journey to the West" (JW) that this alternative explanation does not work well with the story. Despite his many mistakes this film has far more fun values ​​than another movie by Nicholas Tse played in - a promise.
