This movie is so bad that they should burn a master. You can't spoil the plot because this movie doesn't have it. Graphics are less than false, they are terrible. Then you ran across a rural astronomy job - a holistic one that jumps between his own madness and the mad ranting of a crazy preacher. and when he finally gets to DC, they don't have the decency to kill him; the monster (you don't know at the time) is already dying, but how ... who knows and of course has the ultimate clever end ... all the others on the planet are dead or dying, but his family and a handful of rogues survive. Imagine that! It will be a film that C Thomas Howell will go into his serious regret he has ever played.
