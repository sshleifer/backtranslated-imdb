As for quality movies, this is not one of them. It's actually the first Chuck Norris movie I saw and I was pretty impressed. Battle scenes are slow and don't have many varieties. Norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys who follow him, which makes the matches quite boring. The movie is also quite short, but for some reason the film does not seem to end when it ends. It's a pretty anti-climatic end. Still, I've seen a lot of bad movies and this isn't one of the worst I've ever seen. It's worth the watch, I guess mainly for Norris fans. There is also nothing to see a group of helicopters rushing across the desert, which in my opinion was the top of the film.
