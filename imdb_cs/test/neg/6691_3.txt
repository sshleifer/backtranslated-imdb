Stars: Hayden Pantierre. There were so many movies that have this exactly the same plot, and that's just bad rehashing it. Populer white girl moves to an ethnic school, does not fit in, soon accepts. There is no originality in it, and no laughter. It uses so many old badly made jokes that it is unpleasant. I do not know why he thinks it is a good idea to make an average movie for the video, but it is not. It has been said that the positive is that all people in it are quite competent actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> My rating: * outside ****. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
