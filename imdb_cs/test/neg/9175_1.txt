What is Night Vision? Well, according to the star (Williamson) let's see ... one owner of the parcel shop tells him that "she's out in the dark" he answers, it's for better ....... "night vision". What the hell does that mean? In fact, what in hell is this movie trying to say? It has a plot hole that you could drive a killer van over. Not to mention a cop who drinks alcoholic beverages, Robert Forster is going through this bizarre attempt to pay in the serial killer series of murders and murderer who kills the video. That's all I can remember. The film took place in Texas, had several car chases and clich√©s. Maybe when someone watches this movie with their eyes closed - can it be good? After all, without seeing it ... it would be better ..... night vision. Did it make sense? No way. And not even this movie.
