*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Some Afrikkaner-Hillbilly types are in the desert looking for diamonds when they find a hard hill in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoilers: The dumbest starts hitting the hill with a selection and bursts it open. Then he looks into the hole and pushes his head in and SURPRISE! something eats him. The other two dimwites are not seen alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a pizza delivery boy, but he has a medical doctor with a medical title (which means he should be at least 35 years old, at least). Bairstow has to enter Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that picks up Bairstow to take him to Camp C has a handful of species that usually fill movies like "PITCH BLACK" "THING", etc. The truck moves over the first truck and decides to investigate (how the truck hasn't seen another car when they went to pick up Bairstow because they traveled the same road ??). And so they will find some bodies, and there are some decent special effects on bones with small pieces of meat on them. The main lunatic in the group, Karl, decides to find the killer. So the truck runs in the desert after a few feet and eventually has an electric short circuit and the crew is stuck in the desert. The stupidest guy in this group picked up a bundle of bones using a coat to wear them. When you nap (wearing the same jacket), it is created by a creature alive and another man goes over and pushes his hand into the goo and that manikin loses his arm too. It sounds so excited, except that a few minutes later, Dr. Bairstow realizes that the creature is indeed hundreds of thousands of ants who use bones together to join together to travel to the new hive of the old hive. The last time I checked, the ants could move alone without killing people to use the bones for the structure. If all they needed was something hard, they could put together a lot of sticks and use them to create the form. The whole story is really, really stupid, and the explanation of the ant is the only one. The rest of the movie is just about how the group kills until they find a new ant nest, and they kill the ant-brain and hundreds of thousands of ants then go to their own pieces. legs. There is an ant-brain substitute found (off-camera) and sent back to analysis thus creating a reason for the sequel.
