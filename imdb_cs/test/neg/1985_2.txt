This movie I bought on DVD, despite the fact that it's a "musty" rating, and it was stupid ... That rating was absolutely accurate and I never saw a worse "erotic" movie in my long life! Although it was partly nicely filmed and had an interesting environment, plus a nice cover ... But my own Extreme Erotica (c) films are more than 100 times more erotic (only in the soft delicious aspect) with about 100 times bigger. movies budget! The story has no logical connection with the first film or famous book ... Or with some new (exciting) element of slave training, in addition to some strange and sad development ... Then the main male character - Klaus Kinski - did not look a bit like a second master "O "he's trying to play ... And even the beautiful Arielle Dombasle didn't look great in any scene!
