All I expected was that this movie wasn't an intelligent, talking motorcycle. This movie is just terrible. I gave her 1 star, which of course means I enjoyed it. Bad play, bad writing, bad direction, poor combat choreography. The only real actor in this movie is Martin Landau, who of course plays a good job of playing a criminal, although the character is your standard cardboard cutout by a bad CEO / Villain. Even the so-called "fence twist" at the end was no shock. <br /> <br /> There was so much fun in this movie, I enjoyed it a lot. And it had a couple of impressive stunts. Like bad movies? Look at this. Want a good movie? Not here.
