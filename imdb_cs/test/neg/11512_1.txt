For those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this film is totally ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballerina. At that time Viola was with the ballet theater, now an American ballet theater, and a fairly good dancer, but with the exception of Dame Judith Anderson, the acting is amateur and Checkov is upstairs .... embarrassing! I saw this movie at the age of 14 and at that time I never saw ballet, I was impressed. However, later in life, long after I finished my own dancer career - I bought a video tape, curious to see what it was like after so many years. I couldn't believe that naive Hollywood could be about the world of ballet. But it was made in the mid-1940s, before The Red Shoes or The Turnning Point, which gives a real picture of the ballet world. The entire Specter cast has now died ... Ivan Kirov (not his real name) dies at the age of 79. It was his only film, then he was left by a Chicago business man.
