(Some Spoilers) PRC quickie by J. Carrol Naisha Dr. Igor Markoff, who is not really Dr. Karkoff, but a con man who took over his identity in Europe. The Real Dr. Karkoff had an affair with Dr. Markoff's wife, who led him to murder the real Dr. Markoff, and after his wife Lenore was infected with an acromegaly that looked like her "Elephant Man's" sister. This was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could hold Lenore for himself; but the disturbed Lenore later even got along with his mad husband by killing himself. This nut, fake Dr. Markoff, then notices Patricia Lawrence, Wanda McKay, one night at the theater, where her father Tony Lawernce, Ralph Morgan, the world-renowned pianist. Enchanted by charming Patricia, who is dead ring for his dead wife Lenore Dr. Markoff, sits with her and goes to extreme lengths to marry her, though she doesn't want to do anything with him. After getting ridiculed in her efforts to make Patricia fall in love with him by sending her flowers with syrup love notes that joined her five times a day, Tony looks at the crazed dr. This is then that Tony ends up getting knocked out by a good doctor who injected him with a dose of acromegaly that turns him into a somewhat unsightly guy. With his hands and body he swelled and was unable to play his beloved piano. Adams, Sam Flint, that the only one who can cure him of this terrible disease is different from Dr. Markoff! The person who gave it to him. The movie has the usual sub-charts with Dr. Markoff Maxine, Tala Birell, who is also in love with him jealous of a fake doctor playing for Patricia. There is also a huge dr. Markoff Glenn Strange, who, like his home gorilla, is just a clumsy shepherd who can't even manipulate Maxine, which is half his size. Strange ends up as Patricia's friend Bobby Blake, Terry Frost, sets out on his head. As far as Gorilla is concerned, it turns out to be a big hairy werewolf when he also tries to do Maxine and is driven out, and locks himself back in the cage, at Ace's home dog. Dr. Markoff, in her desperation to marry Patricia to marry him, promises her to cure her father just to get her father out of the chains and end up with Markoff dead with his own weapon in the ensuing battle. This whole mess with Maxine has a happy ending that he knew about Markoff's acromegaly cure as much as he did, and gave Tony a secret serum that made him as good as new. The film ends as it started with Tony playing the piano at a packed and cheerful home in the local theater.
