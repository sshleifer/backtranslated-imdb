I had a little high expectations for this movie. I always thought Tom Selleck was a lesser-known movie (eg Runaway and Coma), where he was above those he had more press. Perhaps producers should have had a little more knowledge of former Major League baseball players who have become overseas stars. Most were players too good for triple baseball, but not exactly major league matériel. I admire the idea of ​​putting Selle's character into Japn, as opposed to the cliché that I play in minors. Sadly, this movie, like the title of the post, was stuck in a third movie that appears to be running on autopilot. I wouldn't mind seeing the continuation, and hopefully, manufacturers would learn the mistakes. The assumption is simply too unique to remain alone with this uneven motion
