Two-party boys working in a radio network are going from trying to solve the murders and performing in shifts between shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller have been playing in this village since 1945. Lots of fast-talking, all yelling at everyone and boys on two sides are calling police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It's a real "shortie" for 59 minutes, and it feels like it's adapted from the game because it usually takes place in a radio station soundstage. We're not interested in any of the characters, which is probably why it hardly turned out. No big deal. This was Phil Karlsson's second film as a director. There are no clues as to who can knock people down, so we just followed the police detective and the boy's page as everyone tries to solve the mystery first. I'm not going to say anything more to make no spoilers.
