Since Disney more often than not, ignoring the quality of animation and the need for a good plot in their sequel, it was actually a nice surprise. I don't know why Disney doesn't pay more attention to their continuation. Graphics quality is always worse; No background that deserves the name Disney, unusual charts and worse dialogue, with little or no attention to the real story, and cartoon drawings are almost always worse than Saturday cartoons in details and quality. The quality of the animation is still weak compared to Disney's originals, and the dialogue is quite banal, the story and overall design was really quite enjoyable. Although not so charming, it cannot fully capture the magic and / or the secret from the first. There is some hint of that tucked in here and there. Kids will love it, anyway. <br /> <br /> This evaluates 4.5 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
