I recently borrowed a copy of this movie that brought me three sessions in three days. This is another commentary in the creation. But the first thing I wanted to comment on was the carelessness of the special features of the DVD. This included a memory game that asks the player / viewer to match the pairs of animals so that they can enter the ark. However, each time a selected animal is detected, the screen prompts the player to find (or congratulates the player on finding) "it's a friend." This is a spelling mistake because it should be "his buddy" as a wealthy pronoun, not a contraction for "that is." It's annoying error to keep repeating 16 or more times until the end of the game. Of course, it's really a child's activity, but it teaches kids the wrong spelling. <br /> <br /> And yeah, the game never changes. It's the same game with the same places of the same animals every time. Plus it won't keep the score as well as the number of moves it took to solve the game. Thus, there is no lasting value or challenge. It's just a feature that's listed on the packaging. Simply put, more thoughts and care could be put into this "special" feature, just as it could be more thoughts and care. confused movie.
