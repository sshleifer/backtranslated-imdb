A wildly uneven film where the main problem is the turbulent mix of comedy and thriller. For me, the unusual assumption is clearly comic, and should have gone on a versatile comedy. For example, Rock has some humorous lines but at times he is too unlikable for comedy. The scene Betty's husband gets is too ugly for what was supposed to be a less violent comedy. An even better example is the Hollywood leftist writer who has preached us through a permanent way through Freeman's character, early on, about the situation of the Indians; I mean - yawning! They were supposed to give Freeman something fun to say in this segment, but of course it is much more difficult than simply to write him boring PC speech. There are even more new computers in New York. The End Form: The girl not only gets a boy - she doesn't get a boy at all; In fact, the message is that the girl doesn't need any boy at all! A little feminist statement. The first half hour is weak, but the film gets better - ironically - once Zellweger gets to Kinnear. I say "ironically" because I'm not much of a Kinnear fan, even though he's solid. As usual, Zellweger is very cute; He has a kind of American cute look that should appeal to almost every guy, and I have to wonder why more of these women are currently not "represented" instead of dogs who inexplicably become stars like Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez, or Barrymore. Since the film sometimes tries to be very serious, I have no choice but to criticize Freeman's character, which is the equivalent of a gangster film in the world. -heart of gold. There is nothing at all in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest that he was the father and the son.
