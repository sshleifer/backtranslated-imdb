I was a teenager when it first appeared in theaters and I saw it in Japan. The storyline was not my cup of tea as a high school, but I went to see the 3-D process. In the press it was ballyhooed by overseas service workers, even though it was never screened in Post. The film began a trend of throwing objects at an audience that was taken to absurd levels with later 3-D movies. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this qualifies as a spoiler, but you were warned if that's the case. In many films of that time, actors would often work before the "back projection screen", where the background could be projected to make it seem they were in a different environment, such as the jungle background when the actors were actually on the sound stage. This works well on regular movies, but when you see in 3-D, they look like a gaming scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the movie where back projection was used, and the theaters didn't work well. If seen in 3-D, it will be another disappointment. The only meaning of the film is historical because it was the first of its kind.
