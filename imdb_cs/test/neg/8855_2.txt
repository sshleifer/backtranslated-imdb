Scary drama? Emotionally strong? Blah! The BBC has lost much time to mastering productions such as Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale from HBO. Okay, so the budget can be much smaller, but "The Street" last night was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a great waste of time. Television (British television) is not as good as it used to be, and it continues to fall behind American productions. There was no sense of brutal violence from a "local gangster". There was no indication that this man was crazy enough to defeat a man he had respected for so long. It was no remorse when he did, and it shouldn't be the kind of thing that would come back when Bob Hoskins called his son annoyed, in the portrayal of "bravery." I wish I was more eloquent to express my contempt for this show, but I am not, and although I cannot prove my opinion well, believe me when I say it was a waste, shock TV that does not provide any real look at life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
