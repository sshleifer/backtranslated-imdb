I had to write a review for this movie after I saw it last night and read some comments from people trying to classify the resentment of this movie going down to the wfmitchell post)). None of these classifications fit. Another classification that has to be on the list is 5) people didn't like this movie because it wasn't good. I found a film to be brought up and forced. My wife chose him to find out he's a huge Kidman fan and likes Jude Law. Speaking of law, it took me a long time and it was a great deal of suspension of faith. he believes his southern accent. I can't help but wonder if his character has made less talkative deliberately, so we wouldn't have heard such a tortured accent that much. Long to make interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then fell flat at its end. Interestingly, I didn't know that this film was directed by Minghella. About 40 minutes into the film I asked my wife, "will this not be another English patient?" It was absolutely. <br /> <br /> As for battle scenes. I'm trying to figure out a word that would describe the opening battle scene, but I think the most precious word that accurately describes it is simply "stupid." It was violent, it was incredible, it was stupid and it was stupid. (After the battle I looked at my wife and asked "was it just stupid?" She nodded vigorously). The only clear point of the film was the performance of Zellweger. This role was a bit superior, like any decent comedy role, but it worked. From her speech pattern, her walk, mannerism and esp. her little quips (my favorite: "If you want to get 3 meters on a bull's ass, all you have to do is listen to the pets, talk to each other"), she was able to create an almost caricature character who did her job extremely well. I just didn't like this movie and I have to wonder what kind of people say it (or the English patient will figure it out). I think you could categorize them in one category: 1) soap opera fans
