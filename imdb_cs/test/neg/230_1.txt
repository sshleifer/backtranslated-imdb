Bruce Willis, as usual, does a great job. <br /> <br /> [warning: can be considered a spoiler] While my friend thought it was good, I was still looking at my watch during the whole movie wondering when it will end. After seeing such big fluctuations as "Patriot" and "Chicken Run" I was really disappointed with Disney's "The Kid". Willis plays a middle-aged man with a harsh and realistic attitude to putting a positive spin on people's images (he's an Image Consultant). An unknown child appears. Yes, he is, but younger, and even Lily Tomlin sees him. At this point I recalled a cross between a poor episode of "Quantum Leap" and a bad time to travel. Kid and Willis are trying to find out why she's at that time. They figured it out. They'll meet Willis when he's older. Remember, he never goes into the details of how old Willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to get started as he started with what he started, learned that he needed to do, and so on. Basically, it's a very tired, unoriginal, uninteresting plot that has some great actors in it. The good news is that the actor "Kid" is nowhere near as annoying as he presents himself in TV trailers.
