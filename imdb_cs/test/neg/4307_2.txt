I rented this movie because I'm a big Dudikoff fan. I thought it couldn't be that bad. The boy was wrong! In the fifteen-minute mark, I tried to pull the others out of the DVD and toss it back to the rental shop but refused. They swore they had to be better. They were wrong! This film was all missing. Actors put their lines with so many emotions as comat rock! The story was ridiculous and I was insulted that Hollywood assumed people were stupid enough to enjoy it. None of the characters influenced each other very well. Ice-T gives one of his worst performances here. After watching the shots of the wrong plane, the bad guys who stood up to shoot, and the clips were emptied and everything was missing, I wanted to scream and bang my head on the concrete. The film hit its platform of ignorance when people on the space station used a lift to travel. Space suits are not needed and there is gravity in the universe, no matter what real astronauts say. I didn't finish this movie and I hated it. I don't want to finish this movie. This is a slow suicide. I felt that my cerebral cortex intended to avenge the torture I had gone through.
