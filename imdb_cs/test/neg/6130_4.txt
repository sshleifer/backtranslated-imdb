Before I go on, I must admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had time, maybe I would watch him every week if I saw the season happen. But it was clear from the beginning that Martha Stewart's version of "The Apprentice" couldn't fit. Martha Stewart made the career of being a happy housewife, the home diva of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Julia the baby. Only since her scandalous legal struggle and the subsequent imprisonment, her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character. Sure, she was convincing for a while, and this whole series is an interesting question of what it means to be a business woman. Must he leave so cold and hard? Shouldn't it? The truth was, however, at a time when Stewart was out of jail, her attempts at a public comeback, though certainly justified, would never ensure the audience's interest for too long. A true comeback might work if she returned home calmly and waited a year or so after her often taunted ankle bracelet was removed. Instead, she frantically dove into overkill with a 2 series at once, the other being her syndicated day series Martha, much like her old show, but more mainstream, with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even at its peak, Stewart was never mainstream, so it is too much to ask that the American audience immediately accepts her foray into reality TV. Maybe America wants Stewart to make a comeback on his own, rather than making it a base. The show was essentially tired of the rebirth of Trump's "apprentice" who keeps my interest depending on the tasks, cast, and Trump's firing decision (often controversial - likely for this reason). The letter was certainly not a clich√©, but at least annoying. The fact that Stewart never says, "You got fired!" - mentioned in the bulletin board on this site - is particularly worrying. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for having honestly dealt with Stewart's jail time while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone who watches can basically try to show that it's pretty businesswoman. Again, never mainstream, Stewart lacks the pleasure and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable, charismatic "tenacity" of Donald Trump. Yes, it may be a gender-distorted assessment of her character, but I think it's more about the nature of her business. Isn't there any shock that Stewart was fired, but I wonder if they really always intended to last only one season?
