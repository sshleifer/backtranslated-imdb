I was encouraged to watch this movie because I heard a good word about it: it was supposed to be this exciting crime milestone, disturbing, shocking ... all that jazz. I am concerned because I have spent money on it, and I am shocked that something like that has come to God. That's about it. It is an alleged "new look" for the family of mentally ill Charles Manson and their murder. But if it's a "new look" then it's probably "new" as in "fresh and utterly awkward": just looking at giving me a headache, and having to give up trying to understand or even understand what the Director thought it was. I suppose I should say something about the conspiracy, but the fact is that it was so stupid and incoherent that I hardly remember if there was a conspiracy there. There was something about "Manson's tape" that was delivered to a radio DJ (or TV producer?), Then an hour of senseless random "family" shots in '69, then Polan murders (looking like a bad school game) and finally some idiotic part about a lot of skinheads who get drunk and beat each other in the alley (I'm not me), and then it ends (thank God), I just remember what I saw!) The show was terrible. And how difficult is the convincing "Manson"? Get a short skinny guy, put on him a dirty wig and a hairy beard. Here's your Manson. But this "Manson" doesn't look good either. It looks like, uh, a guy in a cheap wig and sticking to Santa's beard painted in black. And maybe this is the movie: Manson's family made no sense, so even this film makes no sense. It's symbolic! (Yeah, right) I'm still so angry when I spent the money in this place. I stopped lurking at this site and only registered to vote 1 for this film and send this warning, hopefully preventing others from spending money on this waste. Stay away from her, it's not even for rent. <br /> <br /> PS. The recent American television production "Helter Skelter" has bad reviews here, but last month I saw it (I saw the original from 1976) and let me tell you, compared to the "Manson Family", that the new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and FLAWLESS. And I was disappointed in it! That's how bad the "Manson family" is: it makes a faulty and mostly disappointing TV movie look perfect.
