It is unbelievable that in 2005 two films with the same story were published. This movie came out the day before Tom with Cruise. Didn't they do it the same year with Truman Capote and the Zodiac killer last year? Interestingly. Writer / director David Michael Latt did not have Steven Spielberg's budget and C. Thomas Howell was not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of a blockbuster that has earned $ 588 million worldwide. The action was minimal and most of the time we were treated by the whining of Rhett Giles, who played the pastor who gave up his god. Gary Busey was scary as an LT army.
