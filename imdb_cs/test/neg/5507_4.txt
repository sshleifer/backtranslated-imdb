Jesus Franco is hit or missing on his films and I think this was Miss, that is, if you're not in full slime. I will say that a man has an eye on a good shot, although it includes topless women with machine guns silhouettes against the ocean. This is quite ridiculous overall and acting is terrible, but it is what it is about. And what is it about? Well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women gathering and shoveling in the hot sun for no apparent reason, and just as much sleaze as you can and maybe some. Most notable (?) Is the scene involving one young woman who is tied up with a chair and apparently a love German shepherd, and while what's happening is just implied (fortunately) it's probably a scenario that I could do without. I would put it there with Tender Flesh as one of Frank's movies, which I would rather not have in my collection, even though the music is jazz and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.
