That was a waste of $ 9. the movie was terrible. all the "frightening" parts were unnecessary and, unfortunately, repeated. Seemingly all tense parts could have been completely predicted, and they didn't seem to be interested in the audience's attention in any way. There was no plot at all throughout the movie, and it was just a big setup for grudge 3. When the movie seemed to be making a big conspiracy, it was just a pointless scene. these directors must follow Hitchcock's example: every scene has meaning. Porbably 90% of the scenes in this film could be omitted with no plot change. Ultimate opinion: Don't waste your time, energy or money !!!
