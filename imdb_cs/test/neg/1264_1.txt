Czech film viewers liked this film and rated it very well because it was a Czech language, but I found it polite, tedious, moronic, boring and inept. Again, I believe that "ramping" in order to increase sales of this dog movie. Amazon describes this film as a couple of friends who refuse to grow up, but I will go a little further - I think they are two colleagues who have entered dementia and are doing things that make no sense to anyone. I was told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the movie, and I believe it. When he saw his performance, he probably realized what a terrible job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid terminal embarrassment was to make a "big trip" that I was sure was much more dramatic and much more better performance than him. done in "Spring Autumn". Don't waste your time or money on this pathetic performance. It's nothing but a dog in a manger.
