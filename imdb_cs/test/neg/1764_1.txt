*** MILD SPOILERS *** Dear Inman, nice words is hard for me to find to describe the movie I was just exposed to. The problems are far and painful for me to recalculate. . . but I feel I have to prevent others from suffering the same anxiety as I am. This is not a movie for anyone under 50, it is sloooowwwww, soooooo slowwww and when it becomes a great meeting of Ada and Inman. . The biggest and most important scene in the film, NOT SUNDAY, is an epic decline. Just as the director was supposed to do, I will keep my words short and end up with this warning, your movie is disjointed, boring, has no flow, and Jude Law is tragically mis-cast, showing more emotions as a robot in A.I. - to be warned, the film should be retitled. . . Bored Mountain. Love, Ado
