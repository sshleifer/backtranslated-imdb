I urge you to watch this film and deny the above statement. That means you can stop looking at her virtually flawless face. He also does a little fight and a little filming, but not as early as I hoped. The film is extremely slow and low-budget, though at least they have tried to find an apology for such a poorly dug ship; Almost the whole crew is on "paused animation", and the ship moves on the car pilot! And the heroine will not save any of them, nor bring anything useful back to "home"; The only part of her mission, which could not have been more easily accomplished by the missiles that had thrown the ship at its end, seemed to have been to cheat that the evil lady in space travel was the only part of her mission. There are also some long but somewhat tamed soft-core scenes, and a couple of "aliens" -cut-monsters that kill about 2 people. * 1/2 of 4.
