I was impressed by director Antal Kontroll in 2003. His first American project, Vacancy, was a less impressive but decent start. Armored is its second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the B level of the movie. It's a shame because the main room has all the ingredients for twists and turns and a set of casts representing many quality actors should be able to deliver. Antal could make a great movie, but instead it's an action movie. Then he could shoot a great action movie again, but it doesn't really do it in this department either. What you have left is one unlikely situation after another, a group of badly sketched characters bickering and a fight for money. If you look behind sharp cinema, cast and tight music scores, you will have something that could be a below average direct video with Van Damme or Seagal. It was probably a rather unsatisfactory movie for me.
