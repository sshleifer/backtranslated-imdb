Wallflower is thrown into the sea and dreams come into pirate fantasy as a lady in love with a pirate apprentice. An energetic and good-natured, maybe, but smart business; The failure of the musical to broadcast "The Pirates of Penzance" with a cheap, backlot feeling, wan bubblegum songs and constant, leering overacting. Kristy McNichol's film career has become a real hit after the film, while lead man Christopher Atkins is unable to grasp any strange emotions, his voice trembling in search of a suitable tone. You have to wonder if this is the best title they could come up with, what will be the level of the joke in the real scenario? "Grease" - a similar affection for musicals does not create a gel with its fondness for the grotesque game "Airplane!" They are mostly embarrassed. * 1/2 from ****
