I turned it off for about 50 minutes! Whoever was Moron, who decided to steal the idea of ​​Koushun Takami (Battle Royal), and get into a realistic TV show script, deserves to be shot! <br /> <br /> He made the film industry and a good turnaround. Directors like William Malone (Fear Dot Com) can say "well, at least it's better than series 7". This piece of crap and dracula 3000 tie first in the worst 100 movies ever made! Be warned that it's not 'So bad is Good'Flick! This is a shame for filmmakers everywhere! <br /> <br /> You never see this movie!
