Especially when you love horrible movies. When I first started watching him, all I could say was "I hope there's a dance sequence in it." Imagine my delight when they didn't just make the two main characters dance, but the main ghost also began to break the dance. And on top of that, Sherman Hemsley sings a break dance song (not to mention the song theme). It makes me a little sad that he broke because of this movie, but I never liked him as an actor and he really should know better. Even the director would not take credit for this film (and you should look at some of the other films he directed!). One of the warning notes, however, seemed to the writer to really like the jokes about, um, the male lower area. For example, one of the characters will find a book called "Groins of Darker Species." I am not joking. And that's the most disturbing part of the movie for me. In addition, find the best preserved video rentals in your city, get a movie, invite all your friends over, and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
