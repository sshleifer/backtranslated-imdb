1. tracked 1/1/2003 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Henri Verneuil): A sober drama about a well-functioning Doctor who gets into trouble with a younger woman with whom his family comes to live. their marriage to another person in the same household. His search for happiness is not clear, but justifies his misfortune by displaying the predominant feature of women in the line of his wife. A well-played but predictable drama.
