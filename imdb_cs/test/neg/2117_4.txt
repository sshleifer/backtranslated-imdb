Joe was first released in the US in the summer of 1970. Despite his respectable announcements, reasonable box office, and Oscar nomination, Joe disappeared shortly thereafter and remained forgotten during the 1980s before being enthusiastically revised in the US, somewhat unfairly, in the US. in the late 1990s. Thanks to this long unavailability, his reputation continued to see that placed (inexplicably) along the likes of Michael Winner's original Death of Wish. Although vengeance is a theme, it is definitely not a film about vigilantism. <br /> <br /> It's not worth synopsizing. It is a flaccid, ham and bizarre stage about accidental murder and an unlikely relationship that springs from it. This relationship and the predominantly class jokes of his two leaders are exaggerated into ridiculous cartoons; these two, and their situation, bear absolutely no relation to reality. Almost everything about the film is hostile and outdated, which makes the whole thing absolutely fascinating. Hippies are depicted as snide and exclusive misanthropes, hard drugs either sleep you or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face, and most young women are ready to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana in a drop of fly. Rather, it is a film from the 1960s rather than the 1970s, so why it began to incorporate it into retrospective talks about the beginning of the Hollywood New Wave is a complete mystery. Martin Scorcese of all people even joined, though he probably only nodded to the booming lavatorial shades of gloomy cinematography that almost certainly influenced Taxi Driver four years later. But Joe seems like an angry tirade against Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde, rather than continuing the same rebel movie ethos. It is not a film of any artistic significance - despite Joe's incontinent rage in everything in his world, it remains a story of nothing - but its value as a cultural museum work is unprecedented. The film on the streets of New York and the streets during the darkest hours of the Vietnam War and at a time when America (and significantly its cinema) was revolutionized by the horror of the old guard, the film ends with its own utterly forgotten and random way to say more about this period of history than many endlessly excellent movies that have been trying to capture it. But as a movie? Despite a really surprising and effective shock, it's basically a Michael Winner movie, but not so well. How does your fantasy tickle? ** By the way, if you, like me, are a fan of observing random viewfinders in the background, then look at Harold Steptoe at 1:22:11 in the hippie art gallery.
