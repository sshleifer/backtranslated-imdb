When we and my friend saw it in recent editions, we decided to get it despite the fact that none of us had heard of it before. We both love Costas Mandylor and James Coburn, so we thought it couldn't be so bad. We were wrong. It was. It was really so bad. No actor or actress could see this movie for it. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and some movie from a nuclear bomb and trying to put them all together and paste. I must admit that there were a few laughs. I laughed when the boy from the cabin asked Alan (Costas Mandylor) to see if it was a "pussy". The other laughter that this movie had had nothing to do with writing. I'd like to know how the people who thought this movie might have a cruise ship knocked upside down and stay stable. It's not folded or anything. If you're looking for something to watch on Costas Mandylor, James Coburn, or any of these parts, keep going. Find something good they've done.
