(SMALL SPOILERS) I bought a DVD of this movie yesterday. I saw it with my friends and I couldn't believe what happened. In the first three films, the animals at least had a sense of humor (especially the 3rd movie), but not only that. the animals barely appear, they weren't funny! They never gave me a laugh. I have to admit that the story started nicely. After an hour, I remembered that Critters were always very short. So I thought, "Where are the $ ^% # $ critics?!?!" Hardly in this movie! If it didn't make me angry, the boy named Ethan was sitting on the bed when Charlie "murdered the ship" and knew the animals were still on board! In the first film, the Brown family was frightened of their minds. But here Ethan didn't care! It was as if the animals were not a threat! What I'm about to say can ruin the end, but I'll say it anyway. In the first film, in the end, they had to face a giant animal for the final battle. The other was a great ball. In the third movie, a creature with his fave burned did spindash (from Sonic the Hedgehog) and went to attack a small child. But at the end of the fourth (which is what made me the dumbest), the bald creature accused Ethan and Ethan kills him as if it were nothing. Now something I really don't understand what happened to Ug. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then after 50 years he's bad. That was very disappointing. Not only that, but he wasn't an anonymous hunter? Why was he still "Johnny Steele?" Moreover, he seemed to have a different personality. He seemed to be much smarter and not as monotonous as in the first two. Being someone who actually enjoyed the first two animals and loved the third, I give Critters 4 and 2/10
