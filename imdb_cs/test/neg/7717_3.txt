So lame is not even funny. A zombie infection overtakes a small college campus, and a government secret agents unit backs up several scientists who have been sent to find out the origin of the outbreak. Collecting zombie DNA damn sure isn't easy. You once bitten one of them. The entire university was completely infected by running the undead amok. This sequel does not buy the terrible original DEAD HOUSE (2003). But worthless fun is fulfilled. Several views of female nudity added to gore gags and exploding heads should keep all zombie enthusiasts happy. Credited cast members: Emmanuelle Vaugier, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Haig and Nadine Velazquez. The word "F" holds an unimaginable script together.
