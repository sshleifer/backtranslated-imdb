Ugh, bad, bad, bad, but I saw worse, which is why I gave him 2 instead of 1. I just finished watching this movie and I thought it was about as rotten as a body on my face. Chopper. The worst line of the film had to be "I'd like to introduce you to someone ... meet my inner b * tch", which consisted of a lonely survivor of a fantastic group 5 throwing garbage on dr. stage. The second worst line, "I'm a park ranger that's going to be f * ck you" What, this freak isn't even a cop ????? Someone else has noticed how everyone immediately dies of a spell sting (no one dies that fast from the sting gut, I know that's why I see them often in the operating room) in addition to the super park ranger. Dude liked a bucket of blood poor from the wound, squirming around on the floor, and then coming to the final to take a farewell shot to Dr. Chopper while inner b * tch lies crouching on the floor. And if it doesn't, he has no decency to die than everyone else. The inner b * tch helps him limp outside and continues to tell him not to die while running for help because he's like her only friend now living. Since when did these two become friends? I don't think a frantic encounter in the woods tells you to go to town qualifies as a knowledge of time, but anything. Watch this movie only if there is nothing else and nothing to do with it.
