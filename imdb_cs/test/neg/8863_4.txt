It can hardly be called a good movie, or even close. But I have to say I had a few things that didn't ... laugh, not giggle but something like that. The parody of Resovoir Dogs was one of them. The rest is not so important to remember. To be honest, I was a bit disappointed with this movie. The story was like an idea, but it dropped to the ground. The whole thing was just chaotic and the actors who didn't have good characters; most of them just swept. There were also a lot of countless sequences, it was the sheer waste of the film. I realize it would be 20 minutes shorter, but it would only be better. Now, with good and bad things lined up, let's conclude: two out six toilet seats.
