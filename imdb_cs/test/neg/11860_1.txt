There is a difference between "film" and "film". The film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. The movie is what a group of friends meet to make a weekend with a video camera. In my time as a spectator, I saw examples of both. On September 19, I attended a screening of "Donnybrook" by Jon Satejowski. Now that I have read the script and seen two different cuts (rough cut and "finished" product) of this work, I can safely say that it is a film. A student film. That is, for lack of a better word, competent, that is, the director knew how to push the recording on the camera and capture the moving images. The visuals are largely static and unimaginable, and dialog scenes are reduced to predominantly long shots, with little to no close-ups that allow the audience to establish relationships with the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted movie, but a certain visual atmosphere would be appreciated, and that would be a long way to keep the audience interested. It is true that there were independent images that have shown that limited camera work can be over, there is a well written, riveting story and some sharp dialogue. Steven Soderbergh is "sex, lies and videotape" coming to mind immediately. But this film doesn't. The main story is weak and out of focus. If Davie's main conspiracy is trying to fix her relationship with her father, then I feel like this movie is missing. What I got from this is that Davie's main effort is to "change the face of rock'n'roll." However, we see very little activity on his side. While at the beginning there is one dream sequence and at the end its improvised performance, it seems that we will get the scenes of Davie who are listening to music or deceptive rough guitar. We just said that Davie played a lot of shows, but we never see him in full rock mode. Next time, don't listen to the audience. Everyone who took creative writing knows that. Davie also does not look like someone who would be great in the glam rock era of the 1970s; Looks like it would be more comfortable in the early days of rock 'n' roll, featuring less talented brother James Dean. Meanwhile, the remainder of the film events seem to happen randomly, rather clich√©s, and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the lean main story are brought up and abandoned with an alarming frequency (ie Subplot involving Terry's father). If I want to see a movie with such a random design, I will think again about watching "Napolean Dynamite", a film that I could barely go through for the first time. <br /> <br /> As far as the above dialogue is concerned, I think I should mention that there are few of them and they are very distant. Is too much to ask for characters who speak? I don't think he is. When the characters speak, it is in short, torn sentences; collections of oh so bright questions, angry grunt or wildly crowded explosions. These characters just don't behave like normal, rational people. Working with material like this is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the movie, Al Hudson, and that's just because it makes a bad imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen. A good director, or at least one who is prepared for the feature film director's call, would be able to detect these problems and get writers and cameramen to fix them. However, when Satejowski is so close to the material, he simply does not see them, or, if so, is not willing to take the necessary steps to correct them because it will hurt his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive way is a sign of a confident, misleading fool. Ask Rob Schneider. Finally, we have a bad, high-school-set, knock-off of the amazing "Garden State" by Zach Braff combined with equally amazing "Velvet Goldmine", two movies far more worthy of their time. Now, before any of the actors or crews come out of word work to take me on this review, let me offer you. The best thing I can do is to praise Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make his own film and put it there so that viewers can see it. However, the hope that this film will be picked up and distributed is simply deceived by the vision of grandeur. This is a student film, nothing more, nothing less. If a movie has some promise (and let's get it, at this point, it won't come from acting, writing, or directing), it's like this: If, IF, people associated with this movie are willing, then, please learn from of this film, put it aside and take the lessons from another experiment; Do not attack your critics or do a friend or family for it. If you can do it, maybe the next worthy distribution, worthy of being called a "movie." I'm your audience and I'm willing to watch.
