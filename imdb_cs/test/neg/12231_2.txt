I hate spoof movies for the record. Except Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because they are classics and make fun of clich√©s, not the movies themselves. I think the spoof movies are the bottom of the comedy and movie. I particularly hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, "geniuses" for DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE and MEET THE SPARTANS. <br /> <br /> I decided to give THE COMEBACKS a look. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with production, I was as objective as possible. It was like one of their movies. It was basically every sport movie that rolled into one with a lame joke in kindergarten, and disturbing images of bodily injury that made me laugh and fail. These jokes could only be laughed at by someone tall. Toilet bowl? Who wrote that? 11 years? I was surprised to find out that it was the creation of WORLD KRASHERS, which was pretty decent. But the attempt at a fake genre was about as fun as a burning orphanage. The only reason I had these two stars (when it clearly deserved it) was that Friedberg & Seltzer had nothing to do with it.
