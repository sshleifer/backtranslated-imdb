I can't believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had great expectations and I was disappointed. First, they used every cheesy racist clich√© in the book. It was so predictable. For example, from the second, a young Latino guy showed that you just knew he was a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. Matt Dillon's character was played a million times, a cop who was hardened over the years and would see the light to some extent by the end of the film. Predictability has hardly ended with these characters. The casting phenomenon has been wasted on a weak scenario. The morale of the story was PC at its maximum. There were a few smart twists, but not enough. Dialouge was sometimes troubled. It wasn't all bad. It was somewhat amusing, just a little offensive to those intelligence. I admire what this film was trying to achieve, but it fell well.
