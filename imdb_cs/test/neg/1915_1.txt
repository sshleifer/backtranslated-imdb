I'm not sure why I didn't like that movie so much. Maybe I'm too old or too masculine or something. Who was the target group here? If you like it and like it, then I'm happy for you. Personally, I found it a little pill. The characters were uninteresting and unlikely, the script was simply embarrassed and some, though not all, acting were uninspired. Mawkish, lengthy and sometimes nauseous - I'm sure there's something better about it. Related Topic: Why is it that when I see Chris Klein in the movie, I have to make him stupid? Does anyone else get it?
