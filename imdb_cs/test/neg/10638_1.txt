This movie is so bad and Hellraiser parts 1 to 3 are so great. Nothing is good Bloodline ... a lot of gore, but without meaning and most of the time without originality. the film is about the past, present (1996) and the future of the puzzle. The boxing creator and his descendants are fighting against a demon, but there are no three serious stories. Pinhead's in the movie ... but it's not Pinhead, he's just a boring evil man who kidnaps kids and kills a bird, and the worse he ... he talks too much. Things I really didn't understand, why is the dog from hell ????? It cannot be a cenobity because it has nothing human. Why can a dog be killed by pressure if a second creature from hell can receive bullets without problems ????? Bloodline is in many ways inconsistent with the film series. For example, Pinhead and Angelique are an old friend in this movie, but it is impossible for Pinhead to meet Angelique because Pinhead is just a World War I soldier and Angelique is an old demon and lives somewhere in Paris, sometimes 200 years.
