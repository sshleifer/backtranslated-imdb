How on Earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creature? This is one of the most typical pieces of garbage I've seen for a long time. Not only is it poorly written, it is a product of delicate direction and cut. Cinematography is so terribly manipulative and non-original, and assembly has not taken place. The real thoughts behind the plot (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are fine in terms of start, but where the production / directing team is, there is a big dirt pit seen in one episode. And this is the scientific series? I'm a doctor and all I can say is that science in this movie is absolutely stupid, almost awkward to watch. I really felt bad for the actors involved because they were extraordinary.
