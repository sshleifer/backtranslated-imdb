I am a fan of the original fifties and about 20 minutes into this remake I started to think it would be as good as the original but not. The murder theme was incredibly stupid. Two of the lovers in the film show up as brother and sister - sorry when I'm a barf. The main character stops at the center of the movie to have sex that doesn't make sense with regard to the situation in which he finds himself. If the filmmakers wanted a sex scene, they should have given it earlier in the movie before the main character (Dexter played Dennis Quaid found himself dying and being accused of a crime where there is a reason why the sex scene is in place.) Life doesn't live to the full, so she's not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. I still feel it makes more sense to have a sex scene either in the movie or earlier in the movie and two siblings are not lovers. <br /> <br /> One the most stupid parts of the movie include gunfire, a few people who are killed, and one person runs all over 15 yards from the crowded carnival, yet NOBODY ON CARNIVAL NOTICES! Also in the scene is a tar mine at the university where the film takes place. If you fall into the tar, you sink to the bottom and in the matter of f seconds, not only is it hard to believe that it would quickly sink in tar, but more importantly, who puts the university on I'd say more about how stupid the end of the movie is, but I don't want to put a spoiler in my post.
