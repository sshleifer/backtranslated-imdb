I like movies, but I didn't find anything like that on The Box. I was interested in the "hook" of the land, but unfortunately never went anywhere and could not be watched. Anyone who claims to have understood this film is likely to pretend to be part of something, but I have news for them, the Emperor has no clothes. The only undertone of this film is that women are to blame for the original sin and harm humanity. I heard the story earlier and it always does less and less sense. It is true that this film is different from many of the films currently appearing in theaters, but that does not mean that it is worth the price of the ticket.
