I am always interested in seeing neglected films that seem to have good credentials, but in this case, the neglect of the film seems justified. Apparently based on some real incidents during World War II, the film is simply not associated with the viewer for some reason that it is not entirely clear to me. One very likely reason is that - in the press I saw on TCM, anyway - none of the scenes where the Germans talked to each other got titles. This interesting directorial concept - letting a non-German-speaking viewer just guess from the "context" that the Germans say to each other - is a complete flop in my book and helps to lock the viewer out. Also, the way the film begins - just dropping us into a very confused situation without much adjustment - is disorienting. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but "The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17" will not be questioned by this film.
