Have you heard the cloning redundancy theory where the copy is poorer than the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example. He tries to duplicate everything from the first movie. Now, in a few cases, this work. Actually, Robert Stack is a little better than Ted Knight when they play essentially the same character. Actually, I like Randy Quaid, who is more than less offensive than Bill Murray in the original. But Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield, and worse of all, C2 once and for all has shown that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst actors of all time. There is very little that I like, and the C2 nailed coffin closed on his "comic" career when it comes to me. It looks like she feels the same, sticks to stepping on, like Miss Daisy driving and visiting Psi-Factor. Other than that, it's mostly, "there was, done that" for Caddyshack 2. Watch the original twice rather than every version once, and you'll have more for your money from renting.
