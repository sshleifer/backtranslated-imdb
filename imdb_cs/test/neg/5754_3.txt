Hercules fell apart and fell into the same category as many promising TV productions, which could be really great classics just to become a sad joke. I really like Kevin Sorbo and his accompanying cast, but I didn't do it No matter what direction the show took place because their movie equivalents too. I believe the show would have a much more successful run if they had the same format they did for the movies. In the beginning I watched and lost interest. Later I met a strange episode, but my attention came to him to a commercial break.
