I think most people would agree with me if I said that Alien has largely set the atmosphere bar. I saw a couple of movies that match the bar, but none of them has ever crossed the terrifying Alien tunnels and darkened halls. A cave is a movie that tries to very hard to reset a bar. I believe the trailer even mentioned something about being as frightening as Alien, but I never felt even the slightest bit in the whole movie, or I am excited that it matters. I could also explain why the main cave hook (atmosphere if you didn't pay attention) disappeared into my waste of time. I will say now that most of the sets were beautiful and nicely lit, but what we hear and what we know is that they tend to destroy what we see. Music for one is terrible. Either we get coral rock music or exaggerated haunted home music. Maybe it pushes a little, but I couldn't carry it. Many underwater scenes were bad enough (it's a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell) I didn't need the rock music that came in my ears when they were just swimming in a cave. This actually produced a lot of unintentional laughter, which was subsequently amplified by the subsequent vessel crash scene. Anyway, as I mentioned, it wasn't just the music that killed the atmosphere, no hell. The creators who are hiding among the darkness should cause terror. I should be afraid that it would appear and that only of them should my blood cool. The cave wisely takes the page from the alien handbook by not showing the whole creation for a very long time and only revealing it with glances, but it just doesn't work because the animals are so lame. I think it would be rude to spoil the specifics, but they are basically aliens with wings. <br /> <br /> I think you get a point. The atmosphere is destroyed. However, I know a lot of people who will still see the film if it is exciting. I'd like to tell you about the cave, but I'd be lying. This movie is slow to get to the action, and once we get there, we'll be surprised when it finally says day. We saw everything that happened earlier, with the exception of a few neat scenes (a man stabbed on stalactites, eels, and rapids), so you really can't get any excitement about watching people running from uninspired extraterrestrial buttons in endless tunnels <br /> <br Oh, but no pain will end there. We must also take into account characters and actions. Well, I can't remember a single line of dialogue except "run!" and the name of the only character I remember is Jack, but that's just because it's placed on almost all the other lines near the end of the movie. Maybe the actors were able, but the script didn't allow them to do anything but run and argue. They had almost no background and whenever he died, he simply shrugged him. It's pretty sad to think that CGI eel is building on the best performance in the movie. Speaking of CGI; there is a lot, most of them are terrible. I praise them for using suits (at least I think they were suits), but nothing really interferes with the environment and as a result most of the effects end up looking pretty hokey. So I think I'm wrapping up a cave is bad and has very little to do. If the movie was the first SciFi movie or a low budget for the video release, I could have a little more love, but this movie was a theatrical release. With more joke and talent it could have been a scary fun movie, but as it costs this movie it's about as scary as going to the basement, and it's not very good.
