I once thought it couldn't be worse that "The Army of the Dead" but this ballast burden makes the above mentioned movie as "Godfather" !! Special effects are HORRIBLE (Creates original Nintendo graphics as HDTV). When it comes to acting, that's how I did it, I went into play with my six-year-old niece and compared to these D-Letters (and that's kindness) actors and actresses. . So basically, if I had a gun to my head and head to choose between watching this movie again or chopping my own arm with a boring knife, it's a tough choice! Do you know what, who needs two weapons?
