I wish it was "The Last Dumb Thriller". But the thrillers are like that. They are like children: numerous, illogical and often uncomfortable. They want to be taken so desperately seriously, but what is there to take seriously about child behavior or thriller conspiracy? When I saw this particular child - I mean ... a thriller - I understand why the reviewers call it a "Hitchcock thriller"; they may also call it "idiotic" because what "hitchcockian" means in a movie dictionary (look up if you don't believe me). Even the soundtrack is an old Hollywood school, which is a mistake: it doesn't fit in the late 70s and makes it fake. Besides, how dare she steal De Palm's idea of ​​stealing from Hitchcock? The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is killed and her assassins are never a problem. Instead, his former employers follow him and later decide to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? No explanation. Maybe because the FBI is a dark, dark organization ("X-Files") that is very triggering to deter its former employees because of pension funds. Or maybe because it's fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie; it seems to be after him. And while a poor unsuspecting spectator is trying to find out the mystery by logically assuming there is a great conspiracy, he is actually a murderer ... Janet Margolin! Yes, a woman dealing with Scheider dwellings; the one who briefly indicated that he was "corrupt". Why does he come to Scheider just when his wife was murdered and paranoid - and his own former employers - and not a few years earlier or a few years after the woman's murder? Pure hitchcockian (look again in the dictionary if you forgot what it means) coincidence. And what about the great theme of her ...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh 15-year-old virgin in New York, and then she syphilized a bunch of horny Jewish men, one of whom - tah-dah! - He's Scheider's grandfather. As a result, Margolin played a hooker in her spare time (among other things) to kill all the descendants of men who so cruelly syphilized her once virgin grandmother. How's the hitchcockian (check it out)? The final then shamefully jerks from Mount Rushmore scene from "North North North", except that love-interest is a killer and she doesn't get saved. The film also offers some dubious / off-kilter dialogue and some not-so great acting. Look at the stupid and obvious way Napier follows the Scheider in the cemetery. Do not forget that Napier's moral conspirator reached for his jacket and held his hand suspiciously - but it was not a weapon! How great! Napier in the Tower: Now there is another chain of illogical patterns of behavior. Demme was, is, and will always be a non-style director, without taste, and a man who directed "Philadelphia". Give him another Oscar!
