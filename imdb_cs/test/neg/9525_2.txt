The writing and direction of Duncan Roy is really and regularly under par. Actually, it's a little stinking. AKA is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, self-service) remake of Dorian Gray - an absurd, twisted dialogue between "high class" characters, immediately idiotic and arrogant, amateur, driven into the core. Characterization and scenario - and sometimes acting - is creaking like a school game ... but worse is that it is a kind of peacock self-assurance that is only a soul that destroys when a director does not understand clearly. not good. Diana Quick has to cringe. DR, you should get out of the movie ... seriously.
