I am usually the one who criticized twenty-two Neanderthals for not being able to appreciate the film if it doesn't have plastic t-shots, gunfights and car chases. However, in this case, some of these additions could improve the film. At least I wouldn't get bored after class and change channels. It doesn't bother me, and I certainly don't mind having to pay attention to the search for subtlety or hidden meaning, but there should be some mention of the whole thing. I didn't feel that even a writer or director had a really wide vision of everything, but instead he was so confident in his own ideas that they were deliberately dispersed. Or maybe they confused themselves. Either way, I don't care. It bored me for a little over an hour, without saving grace. Although a whole group of other viewers have filled this site with excited ravages of alleged symbolism and masterful cinema, I have to respectfully disagree. Maybe I didn't realize enough film classes to appreciate some of the inspired techniques not only seen by mortals ... <br /> <br /> Or perhaps this movie was just stupid. I give him "1" and the file is next to "Ishtar."
