Terrible, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> I loved the original movie. It was funny, enchanting and had a heart ... this piece of junk doesn't have any of these things. Repeated jokes from the original film, silly plot, bad animation, different voices (except Kronk and Yzma) that don't sound like the ones in the original (especially Pacha ... * shock *). <br /> <br /> The characters are out of model, the animation is flat and boring, it's just bad work all around. And why is Kuzco a jerk again? I thought he was reforming ... but because when these TV rotations turn loyal to the original * roller eyes *. I'm sorry, but there is nothing that could be done about this .... <br /> <br /> Avoid at any cost.
