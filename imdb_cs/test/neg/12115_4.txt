Childish story ripped off by a limp Hollywood movie, horrible acting, kitschy dialogue and not quite "up-to-par" sex scenes. This is another great erotic parody! I enjoyed this movie very much! Sure, acting is terrible, but that part of the fun! The story is ridiculous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around the girl's sex scene. And because it's just eroticism (no intersection), the sex scenes were a bit bland. But it's like a great god of false sadness Russ Meyers said, "Who really cares about what's happening under the waist." I don't know if I would agree with Mr. Meyers in this, but what the hell ... that movie I enjoyed an hour and a half. I gave him C +, it would be a solid B if they could throw more girls to look like actress Russ Meyers. VaVoom! VaVoom! ~
