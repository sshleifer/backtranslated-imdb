Half of the mystical thriller and half of the broken fantasy of the fragile mind, "Guardian of the Frontier" is an engaging trip that will soon derail. Strong imagery and convincing premise are soon overwhelmed by the incoherent rendering, torn dialogue, amateur acting, and the most interesting and interesting recent memory images (here, fish is not just a fish!). Obviously, this is the first Slovenian feature film directed by a woman - Mrs. Weiss had to be determined to prove she could be just as honest and unreasonably explicit as any other man.
