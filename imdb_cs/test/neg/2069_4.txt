For those who are expecting an envelope and a story outline to introduce another amusing Indian production of Bollywood, beware: there are no musical dance numbers or production value songs that would revive the mood in this somewhat tired story of arranged marriages in British Indian culture - with a few little Variation thrown in. As Roopesh Parekh wrote, the script jumps around topics that deserve discussion to cover them with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai drives as a traffic policeman, trying to hold together various subfields to the Keystone Cop tactic point. Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical student who is gay and has a lover, Jack. (Peter Ash) and live with Jack's overweight, alcoholic, aunt of so many free morals Vanessa (Sally Bankes) and Sally's plump daughter Hannah (Katy Clayton). Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family of Delhi, who brings his beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide that Simran is a girl for Jimi to marry and engage and marry according to the Indians' habits - without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers a plot and is too spineless not to go along with that decision that enrages Jack and angry with Vanessa. Hannah tells Simran a "little lie" (he's the daughter of Jimi) and the wedding is gone. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house, they discover drunken Vanessa, are repulsed, but eventually decide that Jimi's happiness goes along with the fact that Vanessa gave them a "granddaughter" and decided to use the wedding as a wedding for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi persuades the very reluctant Vanessa to go along with the idea and long ago Vanessa is dressed in a sarge ready for her wedding, and Jimi, frightened of what she is doing to please her parents, includes Jack as her best man. At the wedding, the truth comes out and Jimi's surprise his family adapts to Jimi's true self, and the day is saved by being just true. Cast with this silly piece of nonsense goes well and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well, though without any hint of loving relationship (the director seems frightened) that it shows the slightest hint of intimacy between the two men); Sally Bankes provides most of the laughs like Vanessa; the rest of the cast repeats the stereotypical roles they have played countless times in Indian films. That's not a bad movie - it has its moments - but it's just too shallow and tired to take care of all the characters.
