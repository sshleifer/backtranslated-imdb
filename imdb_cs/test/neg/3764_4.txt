Wow, this was a real stink. This early science fiction film has nothing but a clean camp to do. There is so much scientific mambo-jumbo in the dialogue that it's ridiculous. Female Character Played by Osa Massen is just a plot device for male characters to serve sexist notes throughout the length of the movie. Watch this with your girlfriend, who I guarantee will brew her blood. The only good thing is the music score that expertly builds the mood of the movie. Special effects are rather coarse but not bad due to the vintage movie. With some good B-stars starring, acting isn't too bad. However, the lines given to them had to give them quite a big challenge. The challenge must not laugh their heads.
