I just finished reading Forsyth's novel "Icon". I thought it was one of the most extensive, detailed and difficult books I've ever read, certainly in my ten. I got a DVD version of Mr. Swayz's book. Well, let me first point out that in order to make a fair adaptation of the novel to 2.5 hour film time impossible, I understand the teams why they get out of the book and differ. However, when I say "different" what I should say is "take the characters out of the book, add a couple, leave the couple out, take the book, add a modern new chart, add Frederick Forsyth's name" "I didn't say it was a bad picture, far from it, some of the effects were top-notch and the act wasn't bad, licking the story and not relying on logic or reality, Forsyth's novel was so good and real and changed the facts of reality instead of exaggerating it if it took time to say 10 sub-series If you didn't read the book then expect a decent TV movie with a good cast if you read the book and then forget it while watching.
