This movie was very boring. I laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed the name of William Shatner on the cover. It's all about the little boy that his classmates constantly pick him up. When she travels through the streets and looks for old ladies to help, she meets a prostitute. He takes him to a club called Playground, where he makes a few pimps. When Mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp shop, Lil 'Pimp must lie for his homies. The animation is not very good at this. Looks like it was with Macromedia, which I was sure. It's not suck, it's just a kind of choppy flash animation that people have got used to in recent years. The humor in this is not very good, I didn't think it was funny.
