This movie is supposed to be good enough to be chatted and talk to a certain fire. "Would you sleep with someone you don't like or know for a million dollars?" While the film had a lot of potential, a poor performance makes it a b-degree soap opera. The film has a tremendous lead and after its design we are really in the film, but then it falls dramatically. The last three quarters of the film spend characters complaining and complaining about what they did! The end was so clich√© that he had me in tears! This has a very similar assumption as "honeymoon in vegas", which are much better. Instead.
