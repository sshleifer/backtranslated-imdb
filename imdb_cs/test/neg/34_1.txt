Jacqueline Hyde begins as every other day for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) throws her out of taking personal calls at work, but it's not all bad news because the call she took She comes from a lawyer informing her that her grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died and that she left her and left her in her estate and wealth (why didn't such things ever happen to me? Sigh). Very excited Jackie heads there and makes herself home while looking for a late night thermostat Jackie hits a secret room where her grandfather hides a bright red formula that he invented, allowing anyone to drink to change their appearance. Being a little on the portions side Jackie finally settles on the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), but Jackie's better looking alter-ego begins to take control ... <br /> <br /> Written, co-produced and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I Thought that Jacqueline Hyde was complete and utterly stupid from start to finish. According to the opening titles, Jacqueline Hyde was "inspired" by Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, "frankly, if Mr. Stevenson saw what was happening to his story in the grave. To begin with, I think that Jacqueline Hyde was / was supposed to be a horror movie, and IMDb is sure to mention it as such, but there is no horror at all except that it's bad. I would say Jacqueline Hyde is more soft-core porn than anything else and extremely tame with why sit down and watch it softer than soft porn crap when you can watch the right hard-core stuff that really delivers goods? That's the question I asked here. It's not even good porn, besides being too soft, it is boring and equally valuable sex scenes are few and far away. The most intelligent aspect of this film is a title that would be pretty clever if not for the fact that another film used the title of Jacqueline Hyde (1998) over the past century and judging by the summary of the IMDb graph it sounds much better than this piece of waste. This is one of those movies you have to watch to see how bad it is, but I just hope you never get the chance. Director Kanefsky apparently worked on a low budget, but this is no excuse these days, shot on a digital video camera movie looks cheap and a few cases of CGI appear to come from Nintendo Gameboy, the last 'shocking' twist probably The worst morphic effect I've ever seen & is pretty good for laughing as well as the scene when Jackie Breasts grow through horrible CGI. This is another thing, the film is taken too seriously. The subject is angry, is too predictable and makes a bad movie, but if the dialogue was deliberately funny with some filthy jury, the movie might be more enjoyable to watch, unfortunately it isn't. Forget any decent horror, violence or gore, because at the end there is no surprisingly bloodless decapitation. Technically Jacqueline Hyde is a home made movie thing, photography is a flat hand held point - and - shooting variety, music, production design and special effects are properly low standard to match the screenplay. Acting was terrible, really bad. Jacqueline Hyde, in my opinion, a lot of bullshit, there is no positive thing about this turgid film I think. Any correct movie lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find some redeeming value in this crap, sure to avoid one.
