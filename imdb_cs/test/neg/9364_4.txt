The movie evening was the movie Legend of Suram Fortress and within 87 minutes of running he managed to jump quickly into my five most difficult movies of all time. This is hard to follow; movies so different from everything you see something totally alien. A brief outline would be: a group of Georgians trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from the invaders, but each time they are about to finish the touch, it collapses for no apparent reason. So they go and see an oracle telling them that if they want to get a fortress to stand, they have to find a young boy, a tall boy who has blue eyes and is buried in one of the walls during construction and his presence. ensure smooth completion of construction work. And certainly in those final moments, he is pleased with the cement and eggs, giggling when he is buried alive, only with the mother who grieves. It's actually a pretty simple story. But director Sergo Paradjanov, working in Soviet Georgia in 1984, not too long after leaving fifteen years in prison, does not follow any of the rules of making a movie we are used to. There are very few close ups. Very often, the action we have to follow is hidden in the lower left corner of the landscaping image, extremely easy to miss. There are very few narrow windows, and sometimes it's hard to tell who does what to whom and why. The film is now taking place on branches that have no meaning for the main storyline and are generally used to confuse the viewer. The music is totally crazy, with sounds found, on screen instruments, and church organs that seem seemingly random. At a time when nothing seems to happen, someone breaks into jigs, which is almost playing time when the next scene comes. But it is clearly a film voice behind him, so you are forced to try to understand what the message is. One of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you can't believe what you see.
