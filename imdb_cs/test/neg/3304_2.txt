I have no idea who these others are, but this movie is just terrible. They must support Joe Pesci when he is a small character. The bait and movie switching as well as the studios with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, etc. The DVD I watched says that "this obscure gem revolves around the character of JOe Pesci's MOB, which is the hothead that starts the war" etc. Joe plays Joe , he doesn't even wear a gun, plays a whimsical character and gets SPOILER - (hit). So much for the film that revolves around Pesci. The only forgotten halfway scene was a bad comedy when they passed the gas while waiting for the score. If you watch this movie after reading it, I warned you. Please stop and don't lose 87 minutes of your life.
