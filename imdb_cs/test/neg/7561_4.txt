A better film could be created to portray Bosnia's tragedy. Some parts are very effective and the film tries to give some idea of ​​the suffering of people especially children, but overall it looks less like a movie and more like a documentary. Woody Harrelson is very good, but the rest of the cast played well without being extraordinary. He should be watched to get a rough idea of ​​what war did to the children of Bosnia. If one is waiting for a great and grasping movie, Welcome ...... will be disappointing.
