Stinger begins with '3 months Ago' on SS Newark submarine where genetic experiments have disappeared and crew member is brutally killed by large scorpion killers ... Jump to 'Camp Pendleton' a few months later, where General Ashford (James Cagnard) Short Lieutenant Williams ( John Miranda) on his mission to board Newark and assist the genetic scientist Dr. Carly Ryan (Michelle Meadows) before anyone knows that a group of corporate scientists and sailors are aboard Newark and are shocked by the discovery besides Dr. Mike Thompson (Casey Clark), who doesn't make much sense, crippled the crew's corpses. It's not long before the scorpion attack, Lieutenant Williams is first to fall, so Sergeant Sam Harmon (Christopher Persson) is promoted and takes responsibility for getting everyone to safety and ending with the threat of huge scorpions forever ... <br /> This co-production of Sweedish America was directed by Martin Munthe & he also mastered cinematography and thought it was a strictly uninteresting creature. It's Early to New Year & Stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster / creature / type of insect movie that I saw in 2007, hopefully things can only be better ... Mat Nastos script is incredibly clich√© and gets it all ideas from other films, especially Aliens (1986), allows to see that in this case the submarine's position is isolated, there is a hastily assembled team of marines, including one who chews a cigar in the whole film, there are scientists, among whom there is a blonde one try and explain it all & evil money grabbed a corporate villain who puts a powerful dollar over human life & the last component is a monster / alien / insect or whatever, in this case a lot of big scorpions are running around but they're not being used in any kind of unique or imaginative way, so they could also be killers. Yeah, it's all here, unfortunately Stinger isn't an alien if you get what I mean. It's a touch of more than 100 minutes long, and it's predictable, even if it moves at a reasonable pace and as a stupid creature you could do worse, despite what many say on IMDb ... <br /> <br / > Director Munthe does not distinguish, it is not scary, there is a lack of atmosphere and action scenes are boring and not threatening. There aren't many scorpion attacks and it's almost an hour before any major action takes place, special effects are at the bottom of the scale, but I've seen it worse. I think that doesn't mean the effects in Stinger are good, but I saw worse. There is not much blood or gore, there are some mutilated bodies, some heads with head and someone is torn in half. The only clever and entertaining moment in the whole movie is when a naked miserly woman scientist asks her lover to turn it on by talking about all the money they will make from scorpions ... But there was a moment when I moaned and tore my hair stupidity like a block tries to fix the submarine's circuits and get the lights to work by hitting a power supply / computer board with a hammer and it works well ... an infinite number of dark corridors that are monotonous. Stinger was shot in Stockholm in Sweeden if you're interested. Behavior was wrong and there is nothing to say. Stinger is not a great movie and it's not a great horror movie either. worse. If you like Stinger (unlikely), you might like thematically 'giant scorpions to free' movies Tail Sting (2001) or Scorpius Gigantus (2006) (as unlikely).
