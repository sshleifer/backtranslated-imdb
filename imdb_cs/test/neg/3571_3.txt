When writing this report, I'm having trouble trying to think about what to write about. Nothing much happens in this movie. The plot is a South Asian woman who falls into an English London club. The problem is that he and his friends had a racist streak. At the same time, her girlfriend unknowingly engages in sexual relations with her brother at work and escapes from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. Once all this has happened, it's all pretty standard. It pulls a little, even if it's only about 90 minutes. That's more than Chick Flick than anything else. So if you're a man, I don't recommend you this movie.
