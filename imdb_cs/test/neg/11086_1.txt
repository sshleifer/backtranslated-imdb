So you have a spoiler warning - but I would argue that you can't spoil what's already rotten. I assume that the name changed to "The Cavern" only if the "WIthIn" reputation preceded it. <br /> <br /> After paying the cable rental for this movie, I'm behind saving my home garbage for the month and sending it to writer / director. He had his waste taken to my home, so I thought it was fair that I returned a favor. The film begins with a suggestion that the scene is in the desert of Kazakhstan. I'm not sure why they chose Kazakhstan; Maybe the writer is a fan of Ali G Show. But they were supposed to start just in the cave because there was probably no Kazakhstan outside. It was the first clue that I would hate the film. <br /> <br /> The film has no redeeming qualities except one: it's consistent. Everything is terrible. Writing, directing, acting, cinematography - every aspect of this film is bad. And I like bad movies, goofy movies, B-horror movies. . . but this was just bad. And stupid. And hackney. And predictable. And boring. <br /> <br /> To get a feel for the movie, go to the laundry with 5 of your friends and turn off the lights. Insert the flashlight into the dryer and turn it on. Now you start screaming and screaming to the top of your lungs. That is all. <br /> <br /> For a complete refurbishment, 5 of 6 people in the laundry will play dead on the floor. Toss Karo syrup on them. Turn on the lights (stop the dryer). Now you have a guy in a gorilla costume to enter the room and rape the last person standing. <br /> <br /> FIN <br /> <br /> ADD: Reading through other comments, many have found that this movie was remarkable. budget. This is not remarkable. Making the crap of a movie in a huge budget is remarkable (Waterworld). Making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable (like Blair Witch, which I enjoyed thoroughly). Creating a crap movie on a low budget is not a bit surprising and you can expect more of the same if these people are still making movies because I can't imagine being handed a pile of money after they noticed it. br /> <br /> Is the low budget an excuse for a horrible movie? No, there's no reason to look at it. Would you like to eat a dog dung sandwich just because it was cheap? <br /> <br /> It will be interesting to watch IMDb for this movie over time. It should go down, but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent viewers could overcome the ability of filmmakers to beg their personal friends to give him 10 stars.
