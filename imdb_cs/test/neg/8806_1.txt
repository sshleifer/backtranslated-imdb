I can't believe Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use this term very freely) focuses around the army of rats that terrorize the city's apartment complex - at least I think it was what it was about. The scenario made no sense at all, I couldn't care less about the characters and working with the camera consisted of repeatedly displaying the shadow images of the rats standing on the hind legs or running. Running is what I was supposed to do. As an African American, I have often read the requests of my brothers and sisters to "support African American films". I'm trying to help, but enough is enough. No one should watch waste like this for any reason. Please, brothers and sisters, don't make any other direct video calls. Please!
