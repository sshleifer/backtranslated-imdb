Someone should teach people who made this film that there is a difference between "presenting more twists" and "shocking the audience over". They even use hypnosis as a tool to cover hole plotting; Whenever they cannot find their way into or out of the scene, they simply say that "now she is returning to her past" or "she is climbing her now" and thinks she explains it all. This film is dishonest and in the last 20 minutes it has become a full fiasco. (* 1/2)
