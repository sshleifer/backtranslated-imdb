This film tries to say something deep; I'm not sure what it was. Too much is unresolved at the end to find out the main point. A few scenes really wondered what was left of the floor. I don't think the wall was very well developed I never got what's going on there. When the mother finally discovered it, I couldn't connect with the boy's silence. What was the meaning of the boy not talking? He was just illusory, or he got some power. What was the scene with a burned-out girl? Another power the boy has or what? I don't understand how it has developed any character or moved the storyline. I got a tyrant, but what happened to a dog? Did the dog come back or did Mommy get rid of Fida in some way? There were several other fence features that were more messy than use. Just like the radio talk show behind the Iraq war. I think it should have made some comparison with the grief and uncertainty that Mother and Addison were experiencing, but for me it was distracting and tense. The link I did not buy much. I also found out that a teacher at Addison about not saying "here" for a call, a little too much. The mother who saw the doctor was useless as the conspiracy served? Was it for me to show how desperate my mother was, or was it something about a medicine I didn't get? Was he the dad who came back in the last scene, or just some guy? So it was written on the wall? What happened to the dog?
