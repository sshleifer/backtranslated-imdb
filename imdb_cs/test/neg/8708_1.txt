This film diverted from the Bible and fell under the 1956 movie bar. I hate replacing the 2006 movie through the traditionally commanded 10 commandments. Moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not as a kind-looking man Charelston Heston in the 1956 film. I'm not wasting my time watching this movie. They tried to modernize this film like this to keep you on the edge of being a soap opera (and not so good). I am sure that the younger ones who have never paid attention to the original 10 commandments disagree with me, but with each of them. The first ten commandments took them 10 years, so it took about two months. Special effects weren't as amazing as the first, and after all these years with so many technologies, you'd think they'd do better.
