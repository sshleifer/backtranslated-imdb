The combination of serious drama with adequate comedy is inviolable at the best of times. SEARCHING COMMENTS In the Muslim world it has been pulled out by the current theme and fantastic scenario; not to mention Albert Brooks' excellent brood character. But MAN YEAR can't come close. It has a messy message composed with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is absolutely incredible. The assumption initially looked very hopeful. Give Jon Stewart a comedy news guy for the United States President and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful TV personality who is under pressure to run his audience. Along with him comes his manager Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK) and his writer Eddie (Lewis Black). Tom Dobbs seems to have very little chance of winning in a successful run. But he? Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, EXORCIST EMILY ROSE) is a computer whiz in a company that has designed new electronic voting software in elections. She finds a glitch in a system that is swiftly swept under the carpet by the company owner and his dark lawyer Alan (Jeff Goldblum, Independence Day). If they want to lose billions of dollars, if they do, the bad men of the company have decided to discredit and / or kill Eleanor to make sure they never tell anyone. But Eleanor is able to get to the president-elected Dobbs and finally spill the beans (that's also where the incredible love story unfolds). Dobbs goes on Saturday Night Live and explains everything to the world, removing him as a newly elected president and ending the career of those who are in the computer society ... oh, and saving Mrs. Green's life. Sounds funny from that? The comedy is violently wedged into the story and is often embarrassing. Robin Williams will explode for a few moments during the debate, but he will quickly get into it as the gravity of how he became president bears on him. The film's message is also interesting and debatable: this special interest is owned by presidential candidates. I'm sure that's the truth, and if you want to make a movie about it, you can. If you wanted to do a comedy about you. But the man of the year is not.
