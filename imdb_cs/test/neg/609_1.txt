A show of incredibly stupid, man and his skillful hot woman. 99% of the charts revolve around Doug, who is doing something incredibly stupid and then comes a variable: a) hiding him from his wife, or b) telling his wife that he will be upset and then it depends on my father-in-law from Seinfeld) to make the situation worse. And writers dare say that it was influenced by "Honeymooners" (absolute classics) and that plots are drawn from real life situations. If you don't live in a cave, you know it's not true. Anyway, let's do it this way. If Kevin James were thin, the show would be canceled by the pilot. If you're 12, or you like fat jokes .. be my guest, watch this show (or any of Kevin James's movies to figure it out). <br /> <br /> I noticed some posters to compare this journey to much better programs like Friends, Seinfeld and everyone love Raymond - I still wonder how anyone could do it
