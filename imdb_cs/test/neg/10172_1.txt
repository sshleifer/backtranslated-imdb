This film was the biggest piece of garbage I had seen for a long time. It is sold as Sci-Fi, but in reality it is nothing but a tool for recruiting Christians. It tells you a little about the status of the Christian Church when they have to resort to fraud to listen to their sales pitch. But then again, what do you expect from an organization that has gone so long to help protect such a huge number of children in their organization. Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and mongers of war. Let's not forget that our former former president actually came out and said that "God told him" to attack Iraq. And no one asked if they heard voices or see things? Anyway go on this topic. No film has anything to do with UFOs, it's nothing but religious production.
