Man, the movie stinks! Obviously, this film has helped disprove Hollywood's need to drive a tired sequel to appeal to the masses. First, it came out too quickly, and secondly, it just didn't have the same hipness that made the original movie so successful. No new plot was broken and turned into a mundane effort.
