Oh Gawde. I want time to travel back to Monogram Studios and strangle someone in their 2 front office room for this sloppy musical. It is one watt above the flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips over an hour) that there is a real life talent to be badly photographed. To see the point go into some trouble to make this movie that could be easily energetic and actually funny and let lethargy be the main thing to look at. The strange story shows Grace Hayes, an annoyed joker, who bulldozes his false way to college, where her son is a rat sack-rich college clown. She will fix her playboy ways no matter what. His real son son (weird look) Peter Hays plays his son on the screen. His real life wife plays her secretary. Talk about nepotism. I think this talent package was almost a raison d'etre for Monogram funding for this back-lot musical made by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire Sam Katzman. As with other Monogram musicals, it looks more like a reason to film recent new purchases of furniture and fixtures to show off to other studies that Monogram images are 'opulent' in their Class B ways. They have a terrible look at the SWING PARADE OF 1946 for the real Proof of this: Just built this huge nightclub set then found an apology for movie actors and musicians running around it. Story? None. Anyway ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where was Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when the Monogram really needed them? Probably standing at the gate gate boom PRC Pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there. Junior jive hepster Roland Dupree goes to life to knock his teenage legs around two fluctuating dance numbers, especially in the 'big show' finale set in a new and expanded malt / club set. The usual crumpled curtains are freely suspended on the back wall, and the stage of the mad tailored skirt even has one dark main rag that is pulled back and forth when each amateur sequence elbowes past the previous one. Choir girls and their very simple looking partners in this finale look like Monogram workers who borrowed (from writing and carpentry) in the morning to filming. They have absolutely no dance talent and are so common on screen ... ALL girls look like they are all called Joyce. There is even a calamity costume where he wears hot-pants panties ... on one leg only. It's all so horrible and miserable ... and actually annoying, if one of the others involved in all of them would cause the KIC to actually be FUN. Particularly interesting is the conversation between Grace and her son / daughter in law: it is so carelessly added that it actually works through script and logic. He has life as a presence that is the only thing that makes the story ridiculous. Dupree boy is a real star. In fact, he can do something ... despite the fact that he looked like a tubing Liberace who dances teens ... You read it right.
