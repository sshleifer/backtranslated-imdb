Ho Hum. Just another movie with Steven Seagal, who pretends to be a spiritual being but attacking heads and killing like nothing. Of course, it justifies donating money to an orphanage. Put the world on waste and ignore it if you take care of a little girl. Jeesh! This time it's Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). I have to have someone to put all those breaking lines, man, and lots of them. Dialogue is pure crap. They go after the bad guys Nick Mancus and Kevin Tigh, two people who were born to play scumbags. It's squeezing Mari Morrow and the impressive soap star Sarah Buxton. How cute. I think if you have to have some excitement in July, it may be enough. If nothing else, it will help you get a degree in Seagalology.
