Not even "minor" Hitch, but just a bad movie. A film equivalent of a dirty man. Ugly in all directions: an unimaginable scenario, static look, rotting clothes, gruesome hair, unlikable actors, and one truly gratuitous scene in rape and strangulation. The director's perverted sense of humor is present, but is not applied consistently; the film comes alive only in its cruelty. Women are particularly ill-behaved; "Frenzy" could be used as evidence that the director was a misogynist, although for me a better explanation is that I may be starting his TV series and "Psycho", which he himself described as a gentle exercise; Whether the TV Crew Could Shoot a Passage Figure - Alfred Hitchcock had nearly abandoned art and settled for business. In 'Frenzy', the Grand Master seems to bow to the conventions, trying to go with the times and give the audience what they think they want - in the form of unpleasant nudity, jerking and shocking. I don't make the old man rest, but I don't want to remember him being tired and lazy and panding- time to watch 'Vertigo' again!
