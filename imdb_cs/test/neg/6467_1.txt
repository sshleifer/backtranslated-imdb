The only fun thing I found about watching this movie was listening to the star wars that went through the cinema wall (yes, I'm going to a really bad movie). This film is so insensitive that I think I'd rather have my eyes scratched by a cat than watching it again. <br /> <br /> Compare it to the original. One is charming, funny, exciting, well behaved, and one of the best movies ever, the other is so far away from the funny that all you can do is hope your eyeballs fall out so you don't follow any more. I'm sorry Christina Ricci is a great actress, but she can't deal with Hailley Mills and she didn't even want to start with Doug E. Doug in the part that is occupied by the amazing and absolutely charming Dean Jones. Dean Jones's tiny part of the new version is the only partially redeemable part of this movie, and that's the only reason I can justify a 1 * rating (also because imdb doesn't go to negatives).
