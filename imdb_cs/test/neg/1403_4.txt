This pathetic psychodrama is used by every shabby instrument in the book to draw attention and sympathy for our characters, who are not worthy of announcement with the sole exception, let alone two precious hours of film viewers. Just like in the "ordinary people" of Robert Redford (a brilliant film that clearly shows the emptiness of "heroes" in comparison), the late teenage boy died and left his family in the horrors of death. In this case, death was a suicide event that almost always poisoned the emotional well of survivors in a particularly aggressive manner. We follow these people in the next 8 or 9 months. The father (Jeff Daniels) becomes a withdrawn, virtually muted, usually drunk stiff, who secretly leaves work for several months instead of sitting on a parking bench all day, and insists on setting a full plate of food on deceased son instead of every meal. She treats all the others in her family with infallible ugliness. He regularly sees his doctor, but the issue of therapeutic intervention in his apparently dysfunctional state never comes. Sigourney Weaver screams at a neighbor, including when she is silly trying. buy "marijuana" (her term) in a head shop (what would an adult ever try such a stupid stunt?), and near the end faint into a pulmonary coma that everyone in the theater assumes is cancer heavy smoker). Mrs. Weaver has several flip lines, but generally behaves too unintelligent to deserve much empathy. It's not that there aren't people who act in these silly journeys when seriously stressful circumstances arise. But why do such a movie? What can anyone learn from the behavior of this couple? The deceased's older sister (Michelle Williams) is away at college and too happy to distance herself from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emile Hirsch) is the only trusted member of the family. His suffering is true, his causes are manifold, and his behavior is coherent in circumstances. However, Hirsch's character is too soft, too annoyed and defeated to carry the film. Other bit players, overtones and cutesy, do not help the unreal dialogue. The theme of suicide is almost nonchalant in the case of two other smaller characters. So what does writer-director Dan Harris try to say about this subject? That this is not a serious matter? Why Jeff Daniels has agreed to play the sap of his father, as written in this scenario, is something that only his therapist might answer. Avoid this dog. Instead, rent Redford's classic. My rating: 4/10 (C-). (See on 2/17/05). To learn more about my reviews, send me a report of the routes to my website.
