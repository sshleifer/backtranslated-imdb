'Take Fame' and 'You Got Got Served' and Collect Them Together and What Do You Have? This god scary custom movie for boring-normal teens. The story very closely follows 'You Got Got Served.' Three ghetto afro-teenagers, this time living in Baltimore John Water, not far from "Peckers", spend their time in high school failures and dance in dilapidated 100-year-old buildings with hoochy-mamas. To finance their expensive baggy hip-hop garments, they taste the cars and deliver them to the local chop store, which is not unlike John (Tony Manaro) Travolta, who worked in a Brooklyn store to buy his polyester disco clothes. Tyler Gage, one of the black three musketeers, gets trashed by the local Fame High School and is forced to do cleaning services. She meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old high school student, and finds herself an Irish American, much to the fact that his black Mac friends and Skinny are annoyed. <br /> <br /> Just as if you got the service 'crime does not pay and Skinny, the youngest member of the trio gets shot Bad Bad Leroy Brown type ?? but it doesn't stop the music ??? and the heart-stopping finale.
