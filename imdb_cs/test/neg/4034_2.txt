No film I have ever seen seemed so boring and stupid as this piece of waste. And I've always been a big fan of B-movie. After reading this total piece of crap, though I can honestly say it didn't even come close to being a B-movie. Nobody in this movie could act if their lives depended on it. The screenplay is so stupid, I don't think I've ever heard someone talk in my life. The writer should spend several years studying people in real life to see how they behave and talk, even if they are unable to watch a traceable movie because it is so obvious that no one is involved in the movie. he has no talent. at all. <br /> <br /> I could make a better film with a digital camera and some monster toys. Also, don't forget any sexy scenes, women in leather dresses are so grotesque that you'd degenerate before you turn on! <br /> <br /> Avoid this pointless drive if you don't get bored of your mind!
