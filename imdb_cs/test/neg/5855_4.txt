This film coincides with the mini-comic book Mike Allred, "Red Rocket Seven" and tells the story of an alien who has escaped on Earth and waited for "Astroesque", which is linked to the book of Revelation and apocylps. This is just part of a bigger story (if you are confused by the movie, also read "RR7"). You can easily say that Allred is used to telling stories with pictures. The direction is very good and the effects are not bad for the $ 500 budget. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play roles and probably didn't have a heart to say they couldn't act. Also, Mike doesn't show his writing skills in this movie. His dialouge spoon-feeds a plot to you and won't let you enjoy the characters. It was actually disappointing due to his enormous writing ability in his comic book. 4 out of 10.
