Yeah, this must be one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It's totally tasteless, has no style, the story is so slim that you can watch TV through it, and the whole movie has so many holes that you could go through an oil tanker. Sure, I appreciate a good B-movie, just like most white homo sapiens men do. But this must be the worst I've seen. In fact, it's so B that lacks everything that makes B-movie interesting. The whole movie is based on such glamorous artifacts as bullshit, various bodily functions and a complete lack of common sense on screen. It's not even funny. In fact, it is the other way around. I found it even boring at times because of its extreme predictability. I found nothing good to say about this movie. It was a waste of time, and I hope others won't make the same mistake. If you also pay for it, you should make a serious brain.
