If you want to see a horror movie that is terrible and in very bad taste, it's definitely a movie you can see. These films begin with two young teenagers who get into a wild idea of ​​going to a chat room and going to blind dates, and quite likely to end up as a little lamb slaughterhouse. Lots of blood, gore, nudity, handcuffs, and all kinds of blood releasing hooks and things you will never dream of a person are able to perform on men and women. If you like piercing, this kind of piercing deals with heavy heavy hooks and lots of tattoos; in addition, plenty of needles and threads seal things on the human body. I really hope that this film does not give a sick person in this world the idea to act on these horrors in real life.
