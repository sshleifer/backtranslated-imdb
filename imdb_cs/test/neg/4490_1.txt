The film begins in the spring of 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with the Savannah Cutis student studio (Amanda Seyfried) while at a break. Within two weeks they fall in love with each other (!). But they have to go to war and have to go to college. They do, but stay in touch in writing. Then it becomes 9/11. He wants again - he wants him to stay home. What will they do? Hysterically bad romantic drama. Leadership is attractive - Tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body (he introduced a walking shirt after surfing) ... but he can't act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she is trying ... but the dialogue here is terrible. When I saw it and my friend fought hard to not laugh at the beginning of a "romantic" dialogue. It was just HORRIBLE. For the first hour or so, I was either bored with a ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the terrible "romance". Then, after the first hour, tragedy starts and I have to admit he was crying. However, filmmakers go out of the way to make sure that you are crying with death, funerals, and meeting people who are falling apart in tears. How can you not cry? That would work if the negotiations were better. Tatum's face never changes expression - not ONE! He always had a blank expression on his face. Seyfried was LITTLE better but not much. To make matters worse, Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry at all! They barely looked like they liked each other. There was some beautiful photo of the Carolinas, but it is a boring and silly romantic "drama". And 1 all the way ... and I like that stupid romantic drama!
