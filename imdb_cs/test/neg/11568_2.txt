Cheap, wonderfully bad 80's cheese, decade of cheese. I was looking at this first uncut and un-MST3K'ed, and it was pretty much laughing out loud even without comments. The storyline (like that) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which AI robots revolted (knowingly?) and destroyed almost everything, leaving the world in ruins with air so bad that no one could breathe. A few people on the left act as slaves to a mysterious creature called Dark One that appears to be part of a computer and is part of an organic being. "Air slaves" work to produce energy for this purpose, for breathable air. Every once in a while, Dark One has the most powerful of the air slaves to fight to death, so no one will rise as a leader in the revolt against the Dark One. Okay, that's so-called serious stuff. For stupid things like ridiculous quasi-futuristic outfits that every sport, including car seats 'furs' garments, loincloths, and spangly stuff and feather boas (worn mostly by Dark One henchwoman, chick with unrecognizable and almost incomprehensible accent). Or the wooden and slanted lines of all so-called "actors" whose dialogue is high on preload and in a small sense. Or a dime store special fx, including pink socks with teeth stuck to them for 'deadly' sewer snakes, a stringed piano wire bomb and a can, and terrible 'mutants' with Halloween rubber masks on. The Band of Air Slaves follows its leader, a mysterious rogue who has adapted to the outside air to go to the power plant to destroy the Dark. The guy's name is Neo, which explains where the Wachowski brothers had an idea for the Matrix. On the way, they meet with a group of amazons, with a compulsory battle scene in which the female is in the best position (of course). Did someone else notice that in every Amazon or t.v movie When the show was made, these so-called amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by men or women? Amazons are just pansies, I think. This group of determined fighters cross Central Park ... errr ... ravaged lands behind the last standing city (a good way to save money on frosted images of destroyed New York, anyway) and the way to Sewer leading to the power plant where Dark One meets his Valeria go-go girl. Here, they defeated such wild beasts as sock puppet worms, a giant spider that no one sees, and a goofy lobster who is one of the Dark Guard's personal guardians. The last showdown is pretty sad. One of the slaves, a girl who was a father, was accepted by the Dark, because she created the way for people to breathe air, seeing that her father was "consumed by the true form of the Dark", which includes his being. they eat a giant avocado until only his head comes out, the three remaining adventurers destroy the Dark by turning off several switches, and the robotic Holocaust dies not with a bang, but with a whining. and this is the end.
