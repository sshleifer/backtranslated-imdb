When Las Vegas came out one review described this show as citing a "harmless piece of fluff". Needless to say, after seeing a dozen episodes, I think this description is right on the money. The range of handsome boys and bucking models chooses a range of paper stories while constantly trying to pretend to be serious businessmen. One-dimensional figures, in one-dimensional settings, following one-dimensional stories. This pretty much represents Vegas. From time to time I still watch whether the show is trying to evolve and take it a little seriously, but unfortunately nothing. Yet.
