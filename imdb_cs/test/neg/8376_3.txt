Let me start by saying I don't remember this comedy. On the opening scene, our protagonist, Solo (Giovanni Ribisi), shows himself to be an absorbed, weak and neurotic loser who is unable to cope with the least responsibilities, such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word, or making a coherent thought. I think we should be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and encourage him in the process of dragging his way out of deep depression. I think we should sympathize when he stumbles through a series of misfortunes that seem to be caused by his dog buying, but in fact caused by his own contemptuous nature. At no time did I get the slightest hint that Solo had ever possessed a redeeming character that became alarmingly apparent when he could not feed his dog for a few days. No spark of humanity or a glimpse of conscience has given me hope to ever realize that his life is so utterly unhappy because he is self-consuming, self-satisfied. I have not developed any connection with this character. He didn't think he cared, and so did I. Actually, I wanted him to have his knees pulled in one place. The dog was not in character in the movie. It was simply a case that was used, neglected, scorned, abused, searched and destroyed on a whim. So be warned. Although the "dog" in the title, this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. The role of Scott Caan is fun and credible as best friend / cadre. Don Cheadle is honest and magnetic - I've always wanted to see him more. Mena Suvari was beautifully repulsive. The role of Lynn Collins 'stripper with heart' was good, but the character was also absurd and clich√©, not to mention that there was zero chemistry between her and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romance? Hardly. Comedy? If you say.
