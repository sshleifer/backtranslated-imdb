When I grew up on westerns and considered the current lack of Westerns on television and theater, I was looking forward to the Commanche moon. he was shot in a tight budget. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones stars are noticeably absent. There's Val Kilmer, but what the hell's going on with him? Four or five buildings on both sides of the street and the Scull housing estate form the entire city of Austin. The capitol is never seen, only the interior of the governor's office. Dialogue is often times hockey, insignificant commotion. The line of land did not connect. Totally forgotten.
