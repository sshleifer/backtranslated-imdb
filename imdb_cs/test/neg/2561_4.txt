I remember when it came out that it was the first kung fu movie he'd ever seen around our journey, and we were all excited to see it for sure. Although the action was at best average, it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing, as well as poor filmmaking or more accurately, as the Chinese filmed movies at that time. They were undoubtedly inferior, but there was an amusing value, and that was sure to attract. Kung Fu craze started and Bruce Lee and '' Chinese Connection '' soon followed either that or '' Chinese Boxer '' with Jimmy Wang Yu. In any case, this film was chosen to lead the way.
