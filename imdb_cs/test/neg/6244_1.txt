After reading many good things I finally watched a "clearing". With the cast of great actors like Redford and Dafoe, one would at least expect a decent movie. the bad and incoherent this film actually was. Should it be an "artistic" movie? I don't think it would be too melodramatic. way too forced and unrealistic. The truth is, the script doesn't make any sense at all. First, it never actually explains what is behind the actions of any character, it just bursts with their so-called "personal affairs". What's so bad about Redford having the character of life that he has to "clean up"? The fact that he sometimes cheats his wife? The guy is a millionaire who has a good life, has a great son and a big daughter, a wife who loves him (and a girlfriend who also seems to be above a woman's general lover) and a newborn grandson. The only problem seems to be that he ... has worked hard for his whole life to be a successful person. So what? His hard work seems to have paid off, and in fact there are no real problems with his life. Then we come to the character Dafoe: here is someone who was the manager of one of Redford's companies and was fired. Why is this guy unemployed ... eight years ??? He seems to have to have some kind of good education to do the job he has in the first place, and he seems to be a man with firm ideas about his job (as can be seen from his memories of the conversation he had with Redford) when he worked for him) Why couldn't you have a decent job and a decent life? Because he was burned once? Totally unrealistic. The film really tries to portray these men as tortured souls "or something, and it comes as really cheese. In fact, I would say that if the creators of this film tried to say something about the American dream of the hen They have failed miserably. As for the real events taking place during the film, they do not make any sense at all: in fact, the last 20 minutes of the film go away as an insult to the viewer's intelligence because there is not one thing that happens that actually makes some sense. Redford seems to have about 1000 chances to escape, but he doesn't have. One moment is ready to escape and yet he lacks his chance to cause him to feel sorry for his kidnapper and doesn't want to hurt him !!! Dafoe picks up the gun from water and mud, which should be useless (if you fire a gun with a gun after the gun has been in the water and the mud might throw it in the face) and the weapon is in perfect condition !!! Ob, as unemployed, useless (as depicted in this film) and mentally unstable character, manages to outwit the entire FBI with such ease, bringing the film's story to the level of "twilight zone." Finish the viewer off. This film pretends to be something, it's not (ie, a high-quality, sophisticated psychological thriller). Unfortunately it fails so hard that it becomes a disaster and that is the word that describes this movie's best: DISASTER.
