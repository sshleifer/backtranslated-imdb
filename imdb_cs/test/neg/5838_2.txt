This SOFT soft-core / sci-fi B-movie is what you should do if you took Fred Olena Ray's movie and took some fun. Or vice versa, it's like the Uwe Boll movie, but without so much numbness. A young nubile chain-gang convict (C.C. Costigan) agrees to represent space marshal to stop mad Kim Dawson's plans ... to have all have sex with others apparently (that nasty devil). Anyone who came to this film is looking for serious science fiction and what you deserved for not making it on the film. First, when Kim Dawson EVER played in something other than Skinamax's soft core. For this reason, look at the CV for Costigan and the director before you take the hissy fit, expect something else. Do not be mistaken because space / action / soft-core / titling film, this film is NOT FOUND, but if you were expecting something in the spirit of "Contact", we DO NOT have to regret you. <br /> <br /> My class: D- <br /> <br /> Where did I see it: Starz-on-demand (available until December 8, 2005)
