It didn't take long before Halloween threw off a sore boom for a category that would be cursed by continuous mediocrity. Already in 1983, the genre tried to release more than three decent offers a year, and in '88 the stem and slash became almost a whipping horror boy. In the meantime, major studios were all aware that repeating a tired equation was no longer a lucrative direction that left it to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that John Carpenter created. Although there were still many remarkable features in 88, most of them were poorly made and as a whole they were extremely attractive. With that, he said there was a few gems among the debris. Scott Spiegel's Alien in its unabridged form was an excellent rough classic, while Evil Dead Trap proved that the cycle has not yet completely exhausted style and panache. William Lustig's Maniac Cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later Dead Girls and Mirage proved to be the last spectacular breaths of life in ailing category. It was a constant release of Schlock as Berserker, Blood Lake and Rush Week, which cursed the film slasher for eight years of darkness. Finally, it took the great budgeted splendor of Wes Craven's scream to ensure the necessary resuscitation. After not expecting anything about Demon Warrior before I met him unexpectedly, I immediately assumed it was part of a low eyebrow that led to the fall of the slasher phase. But he said that the film boasts an interesting premise that sits comfortably next to Scalps and Camping Del Terrore as another welcome addition to the Native-American influenced catalog. <br /> <br /> The truck pulls on the forest road and out step two laughs dramatically overgrown. Lumberjacks are only on the screen for about ten seconds, and then they are murdered by invisible threats. In addition, we have a collection of five young adults heading to the same place where a shotgun is located on some of the local wildlife. The area is owned by Neil Willard and has been passed over three generations of his family. His grandfather had stolen the land from a man of Indian medicine that was said to have left a curse on property. According to legend, every ten years, a demon warrior with extreme hatred of humanity is chasing a forest that has been avenged by those he considers responsible for stealing the tribe's home. It wouldn't be much fun if these myths were a delusion, a manic bloodthirsty killer appeared as regular as a movement. Will children be able to stop this phantom killer ??? Demon Warrior is best described as the larger budgeted (but still pitifully cheap) re-imaging of Fred Olen Ray's scalp. Bogeymen of both films is virtually identical and the director even throws himself into a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicion. Things start promisingly with some sharp Friday the 13th first personality camera and a few shocks that director Frank Patterson composed with subtlety. Thomas Callaway did a good job with the photos and the tribal-drum score is a refreshing change from traditional 80's synthetic waste. The thriving tensions are built alongside several credible overhead decorations, and there are several humor attempts. The killer seemed to be horrific in demon clothes, and the inclusion of bows and arrows as the main murder weapon was a stupid touch of the director. Fred Olen Ray's notorious slasher was remarkable for his sharp and trusted concern. atmosphere. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the Warrior demon was made twice the budget, it never comes close to a movie that it so desperately mimics. It is said that most actors were designed from Texas Baylor University and were not paid for their inclusion, so of course it goes without saying that the playwright is reasonably deep. Especially I enjoyed the merry John Langione ??? An "Italian" Native American (don't ask) who captures as much emotion as the trees in the forest that surrounded him. Warrior began some credible flashes of panic from the director, who led me to believe that it could be a welcome inclusion in the slasher index. Unfortunately, the poisonous cocktail of abominable acting and ending torn straight from stupidsville has seriously changed the initial plan I had in mind for evaluation. It's a shame that the playwright was so scraped off the bottom of the thespian barrel because Demon Warrior occasionally showed flashes of potential. Patterson's film is a mixed bag of ideas? some of them were good, but mostly they were extremely average. Because it was released when the slasher genre was watered to prevent the happy censors scissors, there really is no gore worth mentioning. Even the scalping sequence is relatively tame compared to that of Olena Ray. Demon Warrior has an odd moment of credibility, but not often enough to justify the purchase. It's not as bad as the above-mentioned Berserker, Blood Lake et al, but isn't it really that good?
