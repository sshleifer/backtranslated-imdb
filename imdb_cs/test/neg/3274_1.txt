My brother plays "Moose" in this movie. Although most of his scenes remained on the floor of the room. The funniest line is the movie "nothing wong to stat." Anyway, it's filmed in Portland, OR, where we grew up. The Dance Club is / was called "Up the Front FX". I loved this movie is that the main character (who is not named on the box because it will bring more influence) is supposed to be a police detective ... a great opportunity to ride a red Porsche. I have to get a copy of this, best director, so I see all the scenes my brother is in. The only scene he's in is the beginning of being in a dance club. He got a job because he was dating this cheerleader from a semi-professional football team called The Oregon Thunderbolts. It's interesting because his name comes as the first record in IMDb. Glory to him, happiness, not so much.
