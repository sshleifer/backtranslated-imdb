The beginning was decent; The end was all right. Unfortunately, this film suffers from total and total shallowness of the characters, unrealistic confrontations / scenes, lack of someone intelligent off the shuttle. This is for a scary mid-story. Things you need to look for: too obvious foreboding, fast healing cuts, too smoke fires, fun seat belts, delayed reactions. because the beginning of the movie had some nice elements of happiness and basic character development. The relationship between the main, dark-haired girl and her fianc√©e is briefly touched, and the placement of a blonde friend's influence on this relationship is present, even if it is unpleasant. The business discovered at the end is becoming increasingly common and well done, but unexpected as another commentator pointed out. <br /> <br /> viper ~
