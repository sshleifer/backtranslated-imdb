OK, I read the director's commentary on this movie (referred to as "the foremost commentary") and I must admit that I can identify with his position. Micheal, I hope your career has returned to a particular failure and you have gone to other, better things. I saw this movie in the form of MST3K. Even when all the robots hacked to endless continuity and stupid notes, I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of thoughts trying to fight under a limited budget and limited actors available. And this is one of those films ("Mitchell" is different), where the MST3K crew has taken a lot of cheap shots on the lead character, even though it deserves better. You know they had some unfair fun at the expense of the actress because it was for a more vivid episode. The IMO, the fact that the film actually tried something, and had a few decent, effective moments here and there, should keep it from 'Bottom 100' ('Tangents / Time Chasers' is another movie with a chart and a heart that doesn't deserve to be there too). But it's not a very good movie yet. I don't blame a writer / leader for being who she is. It's just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull a vanity like this or carry a feature film. Writing and characterizing is amateurish and slapdash, and dialogue is often barely up to ABC Afterschool's special standards. The cast honestly gives him the best effort, and acting in general is definitely head-and-shoulders over abortions like "Future War" or "Space Mutiny", but there are no really professional performances here, except for 'Big Joe' Estevez, who is Hammy, but appropriately intense. I've never seen a full original cut, but the MST sampling "Soultaker" was representative enough to keep these facts simple. Oh, and Robert Z'Dar has a movie in it. That is, IMO, the real 'Kiss Of Death' for every movie that hopes to be taken seriously. Yes, it's a big and scary look in your role, but I just hate him as an actor. (In real life I wish him well and I hope he is financially comfortable). <br /> <br /> I liked little things on the film. For example, camaraderie between a man's lead and his dead mate added some warmth and humor to the film and made it much more observable. The idea of ​​an elevator in the hospital, which opened the door to the Afterlife, was an inspired way to evoke some spooky vibrations without the emergence of special effects, and I respected who was working on the script to keep the budget manageable. That really didn't work, but it could only have a little more improvement. So anyway, Mr. Riss, more luck with other projects - your involvement in this failure wouldn't keep me from watching something else you did if it was good. And Mrs. Miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious and the film wasn't that bad.
