I captured this movie on late night television. I honestly saw most of it and all the time I sat in total and utter mistrust. Is there any genre that is more meaningless than soft-core porn? If I don't want to know about it. Erotic porn combines all the horrors of porn (miserable production values, nasty acting, crappy scenarios) with shame sex-scenes in regular movies. The end result is exciting and fun. This movie also has a somewhat strange approach to setting science fiction and it works awfully. All sex takes place in a virtual reality environment, where the crew will learn about physical love in the future. And yes, it's about as confused and stupid as it sounds. But there must be some positive points, right? Well, there's ... Kristen Allen is amazingly hot. That's probably the only thing that was less than terrible in this movie. I don't know what it is about her, but she has amazing sex appeal. The rest of the cast looks like a standard porn-cast. Rather unattractive women with poorly executed false breasts, and men who spent too much time in the gym, tasted themselves grotesque. Probably a gym in Germany, as well as judging by hairstyles and clothing. <br /> <br /> Summary of things. If you like the presence of Christ Allens on the screen, you can see it in brief moments when some of its seductive potential turns out to be (most of the time, it tries to articulate miserable lines of dialogue). If you do not enjoy Christ Allen, you can also completely avoid it. I rate this 10/10 for the sexual appeal of Christ Allens, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for fun. because it is a unique lousy porn / science fiction hybrid that isn't really like anything I've ever seen.
