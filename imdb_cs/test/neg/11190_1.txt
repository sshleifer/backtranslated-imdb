Man kicks dog 2 'in the air. Woman kicking a cow out of bed. The man on the sidewalk kicks the violin. Woman sucks for 15 seconds at the tip of the statue. A man kicks a blind man in the stomach. Jesus rapes a young girl. > <br /> There you go. I saved your hour of life. Certainly there are those to whom this "shocking vanguard of cinematographic expression" would appeal. But I found that it was no different from the disgusting, disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in grade 9. Except we never had a real cow. We heard the endless preaching of the beard who pampered the art, as it was such an important film, I thought it would be worth it. Don't be wrong, this is stupid. If I hear one more person, I'll call Buñuel "father of film surrealism", I think I'll hit someone. If he did this, he took a step back from the Surrealist beginnings promoted by his seniors, Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F.W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari) 10 years earlier. This made it all a joke, as if Buuel had no confidence that he would really accept the sans sarcasm, sans l'absurdité. Buñuel would take another 40 years to refine his style to something admirable. Skip past things and skip straight into 1970 if you want to be more impressed with your work. I'm sure he would agree with that. In 1977, Buñuel himself said he would contently fire all the prints of his old films. In this case, I'd like to pour a lighter fluid.
