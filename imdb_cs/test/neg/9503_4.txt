I thought it was an incredible boring movie! I heard the director can't speak French, so he left his actors what they want ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is great, as usual, but I can't say the same to other actors. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. Everyone seems to be very tired, it's one of the film stories: tired of being together, living abroad, living in general; so he spends half of the movie sleeping in a hotel room. After a while I felt sleepy myself ... <br /> <br /> I gave 4 because of some very beautiful scenes, including the last one.
