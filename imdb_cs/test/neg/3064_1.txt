As Michigander, I have Michigan jokes. Very Funny - Making fun of Pontiac, Ann Arbor, all those lame suburbs of Detroit. Yes, yes, I heard these jokes a million times. I'll give them credit for accurately describing Grosse Pointe's limp. Couldn't get more White. Did you hear those beautiful Michigan nasal accents? Where do girls speak so fast that you can't understand one word coming out of their mouth (nose) ...? Like I love Michigan, I hated this movie. I've never met a person from Grosse Pointe who I liked. Listen to the horrible live band and the annoying background music! What is it? One of your bands Gross Pointe? Probably. Wow, this is a great "Detroit scene" you had there. Funny how the people of Grosse Pointe always say they are from Detroit. They are so white and rich that they want to complain. Anyway, this film is blowing. All the time from lame jokes about girls in thongs to horrible character development. Wait a minute, you mean the whole character base is saying a lot of words? How deep a personality. Great work, Grosse Pointers! And I love all sexist jargon like the narrator calls the first girl who is killed, who I never even hear talking "naive b * tch". This is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Manson contact lens masks are really great. And I love how it was perfectly meaningful why cyclists came and killed people. And how did their filmmaking master see such a role ... ?? The main friend was so boring that I fell asleep looking at him. Three idiotic boys (or they were two or four? How can I say they all look and act the same!) They were so desperate to make me laugh, but Beavis and Butthead have already got my butt of laughter in 1994. And what is with gay jokes? No wonder this film sucked in - everybody must have some minor problems with their masculinity, boys? The only saving of this movie's grace was the main girl. Despite what other people said, she was actually a good actress. Teenage girls talking in the way she spoke. They really act the way they did. Her actions were very natural and believable. I really thought he was an employee of Grosse Pointe. maybe it is! And she had big boobs, most women here. Michigan is the most fat union state, you know. In all aspects. So those of you who think it's a Detroit representation isn't. They are Detroit suburbs. They are very white and full of aimless teenage anxiety. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP is from one of our suburbs) and $ 75 baggy khaki pants all the way! Lame rich children who are crazy because they have a lot of money and nothing to complain about. And they also make bad movies. <br /> <br />
