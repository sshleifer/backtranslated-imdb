Normally I like Jackie Chan movies, but this was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 combat scenes, all of which are more or less up to the normal standard. The bad thing about this movie is that it focuses a lot on car chasing / racing. Chase from the car is not so bad (though not as exciting as fighting), but the race car at the end is extremely boring. Basically, it takes all the things that make Jackie Chan the movie Jackie Chan and skip everything except Jackie Chan. Even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humor. I suppose to some extent it was even worse by seeing one of those horrible dubbed versions. I usually try to see the headline version ... I wish I could understand Chinese. I saw only one Jackie movie worse that this one and it was one of his early forays into Hollywood movies. It didn't look so good. <br /> <br /> Avoid if he's not really curious or a motor sport lover.
