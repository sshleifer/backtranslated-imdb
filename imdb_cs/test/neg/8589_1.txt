I've never seen a more unrealistic film than this nasty manure. Playing was at the top. The direction was cheap and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story looked written by a person who has never been around a high school football game, a much less professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to be an actor in this movie? He was terrible and played on an unrealistic announcer. He couldn't even hire himself to do professional games. Then you have Jamie Foxx who's throwing like a girl. But he's a little more athletic than older Dennis Quaid. Seriously, Stone wanted to drive this film to 16 year old men with ADD. That is why we hear loud music, quick cuts and numerous adjustments. It just happened with a bad MTV video. Shame on Al Pacino for doing this crap. Cameron Diaz? Damn, no talent has any role to go to pike. When Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor" you went, well, your movie sucks! And he does this.
