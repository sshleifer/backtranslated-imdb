This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. What weak waste is the obvious talent of Michael Imperioli. Disgusting film from start to finish. All I can say is that this director is not an "author". You'll never get inside the game, the character's head, the amazing talent with the numbers the real Stuey had. The coke scene is bad enough to throw shoes on the set, maybe it was a great scene that was filmed for movies and not a stage where a camera in the middle of the house hovered over the drug mirror on it. The drama is going far in the background. The scene where the big championship wins is just laughing loudly ridiculous. This should be reflected in Film-making 101 - What not to do when creating pictures.
