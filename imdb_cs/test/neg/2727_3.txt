It's a time like this I really wish I was more a passionate reader of the literary repertoire of Clive Barker, because very few things feel worse than failing to fully understand the film of this amazingly "visual" caliber. The story "Nightbreed" is based on the novel "Cabal" and includes the dark amount of wonderful and bizarre creatures and environments in the underground society of demonic ghouls. A normal man joins a strange world called Midian through his dreams and his psychiatrist makes him believe that he is responsible for a series of horrible family murders in recent months ... Thinking about it being true, retreating to Midian - located under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. Death, however, is right on healing Homeboy with a devilish plan to whip the Nightbreeds community ... <br /> <br /> He wanted so much to love this movie, I was very left in the long run. Unfortunately I did not read the story, so Barker's fantasy world and its purpose and all these monsters were terribly confusing and the assumption was painfully uneven. I understand how the final cut was cut into hell and even the Barker show is slightly displeased for the overall product, but I just didn't get it. While it is important to read a story, I feel that it should at least be translated into a film in a way that is still understandable to those who are not familiar with literature. If the "Cabal" is as convoluted as this movie before Barker really finished the dead concept. I couldn't help but after a while I was a little bored, especially when things started to get mixed up (somewhere around the prison scene I realized how bored I was) - as a police department fearlessly going to war with Midian, as everybody does Week! No one seems to think the idea of ​​immortal monsters is ... strange. I liked the visual effects and all the crazy sh * t that continued in Midian, especially the porcupine mistress and that big head of the SOB ... Certainly an epic film when you consider a huge amount of effects and a convincingly morbid decor. David Cronenberg fills his position well when loony shrinks with his cool velcro mask on his head, but we all want him to do some work behind the camera to help him save this pile ... <br /> <br /> So if you have Clive Barker boner and fully understand exactly what Midian is, why show creatures during the opening titles (horrible idea!), and why these beings live there and how some punk guys share a telekinetic reference to it, you should probably look at "Nightbreed". I'll be looking for one of these days and hopefully get some perspective ... Or maybe I'll just forget about this travesty altogether ... Until then, it's a badly constructed and pretty boring movie mess. Watch "Hellraiser" instead.
