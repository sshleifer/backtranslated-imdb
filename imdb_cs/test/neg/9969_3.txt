Last night, on August 18, 2004, I was very dissatisfied with Mr. Van Bebble at the Manson Family movie at Three Penny in Chicago at the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here's what I have to say about it. First, the film is an obvious tear of every Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie I've ever seen. Secondly, in the short Q&A session after the show, Mr. Van Bebble immediately declared that he had never met real Manson family members or Charlie himself, told them liars and said he didn't want to do anything about them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) Take on trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I suppose from Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which was directly imitated through narration). So I had a second question, asked if I was trying to present an outsider, Mtv, sexual drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily a true story. This question obviously upset by the fact that now a sloshed director who started screaming "f *** you, close f *** up, that's right! All these other movies are bullsh **!" Anyway, I didn't even think about how ridiculous it was until the next day when I read the movie's slogan: "You heard the story of the story ... now hear the story, as Manson says family. "Excuse me if this guy never talked to his family and considered them a liar, he doesn't want to have anything to do with telling a story in God's name!? This is the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard! The film was of course taken care of by sexual drugs and rock 'n roll audiences that it had no difficulty in attracting to the small, weakly lit theater, and was even more overtly spawned by sexual drugs and rock' n mind the mind that owning a movie without getting up every ten minutes to get more beer, or shouting some Rocky Horroresque line on the screen. This film does little more than distort the public image of the real events (which helped shape America's state and most of today's world) into some sort of Slasher / Comic Book / Porno / Rape fantasy, about which an apparently shallow individual dreamed. Br /> <br /> The movie was definitely very impressive to look at. The soundtrack was refreshing because it contained real samples of Charlie's work with his family from his Lie album. The cut was nice and choppy to simulate the unspoken uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all, this film would make a much better addition to Mtv's catalogs than the Underground Film Festival or the minds of all intellectual observers. I felt like I was Rocky Horror at midnight watching the audience dress and behave (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good, with the exception of Charlie, who resembled an enthusiastic dungeon and dragon than the actual role he displayed. The descriptions the film gave him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physically about it all the time didn't match all the slow, lethargic and chubby representations that were actually presented. Overall, the film basically explains how Sadie (or maybe Linda) at the end declares: "You can write a lot of bullsh ** books or make a lot of bullsh ** movies ... etc." Example. Even the disclaimer "Based on a True Story" is a dead giveaway, signaling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic junkyard lies the basis of a true content story that will make and make a difference in the world. All you have to do is sort of alchemy to separate the truth from the bullshit, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it together and read the book instead. <br /> <br /> All I can say is when the movie ended I got a free beer so I'm glad I went but not so glad I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to tell me closed f *** up to ask the director for a question. Peace.
