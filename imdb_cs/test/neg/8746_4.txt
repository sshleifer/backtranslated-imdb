As a child, this film scared me green. As an adult, I couldn't stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I had no honor to watch this movie through MST3K. Instead, I caught him on late Saturday afternoon when there was nothing at all in the theaters and there was nothing out there to do outside but some autumn leaves. I thought this was better. I was wrong. The film has some very good elements; water mystic, knight painter, a few idiotic ranch hands, an older history enthusiast and "bad wind". Um ... I mean ... bad head. An evil head that will, once the systematic hypnotism of each present is complete, seek out his evil body. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place on the evil "ranch", which probably does not grow crops, nor does it increase evil animals. Because everything that their resident mystic declares to be "evil," you either look crazy or laugh until your parties are divided, depending on your mood. Me? I laughed until I had tears running down my face. I remembered this movie kindly as one of those who really made me a kid. But some children are also afraid of Santa Claus. Anyway ... if you're in camp for 50 years, then it's definitely a movie you shouldn't miss. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good story, this movie has it. It is the best playwright and absolutely innocent time that makes him so horrible. The deal was just BAD, but it still had some good elements. Maybe it's a remake ...? <br /> <br /> Price for 4.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
