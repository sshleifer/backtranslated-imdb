A good example of a reversed, politically correct racism, where white men are presented as nonsensical brothers who are just massacred, and their indigenous adversaries as noble heroes, superior to both appearance and ability. In addition to being too boring, it also prevents a neutral viewer from identifying with one or the other - it's just too simplistic. The recurring score is incredibly annoying (as well as voice-over), the characters lack any depth, and the viewer soon gets lost between questions like "who is this character" and "what the hell is that". However, photography is amazing, and there is a lot of atmosphere on it, but the landscapes themselves do not save the film. The DVD box uses Kiefer Sutherland as a banner. In fact, anybody else could play his character because it is basically just an empty shell (like most other than Maori characters) and it will also disappear around half the movie. But if you want to see Jack Bauer in a kilt, it's your kind of movie ...
