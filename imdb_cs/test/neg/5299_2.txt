"Get Shorty", "Out of Sight", "Jackie Brown" (and even "52 Pick-Up") - People finally got Elmore Leonard right, so they made good movies from his work. So, despite my students' warnings about how bad this movie would be, I couldn't resist renting. I thought how it could be? Oy, what's wrong, especially right on the heels of reading a book that was lame (and too circularly confident) also in relation to other Elmore Leonard books. But the book was better than the film. Again, Leonard tops weak and unskilled screenwriters trying to take over his book. The dialogue written for Steven Tyler was painful. And the lyrics of Linda Moon's first character? My high school students write with greater depth. Sad, sad, sad. Why give her a star? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are still fun to see on the screen, and Andre 3000 hasn't made himself.
