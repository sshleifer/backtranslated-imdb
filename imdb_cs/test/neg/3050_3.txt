Before Stan Laurel became a minor half of all time-time greatest comedy team, he worked under a treaty to Broncho Billy Anderson in the Lac series, many of which were a parody of major Hollywood features. Most of Laurel's "parody" films are only slightly witty and even less entertaining for modern audiences who have not seen the original film that Laurel parodies. Fortunately, "mud and sand" blinds the film, which is still known: "Blood and Sand", where Rudolph Valentino plays. 'Blood and Sand' was released only nine weeks before this parody, giving you an idea of ​​how quickly Broncho Billy's films have been anchored, modified and distributed. Various sources (including IMDb) report that Stan Laurel's character in this film is named Rhubarb Vaselino, with the finale of 'o'. I screened "Mud and Sand" with the original titles (in Hobo), so I announce that Laurel's role is actually cried by Rhubarb Vaseline with "e". But I agree that 'Vaselino' is more fun. Laurel copies sophisticated sideburns worn by Valentino in 'Blood and Sand', and there is a parody of Valentin's bandage scene from the movie that made movie viewers throw in. Carmen in the original film is parodied here like Caramel (a girl I would like to sink into my teeth). This film (as well as the original) seems to take place in Spain, but there is a contract. Here Laurel uses a distinctive gesture that could become a trademark for him (like Hardy's strong tie), but I've never noticed it in any other movie. There is some fun dialogue: Rhubarb Vaseline tells the other matadors to 'Save the Bull for Me.' When Vaseline becomes a successful bullfighter, he tells him he's a bull without, sir, which is funny, but I was disappointed that Laurel didn't answer "Without WHAT?" There's one funny moment that almost certainly wasn't planned when Vaseline appeared for the bullfighter's competitors. Laurel plunges into the arena and - before you say 'corrida querida' - throws a bull over the fence, where he lands with the hump of other competitors. Of course, the bull is fake, but the gag is just as fun ... and, yes, there is a cover card with a joke about "throwing a bull." The expected moment comes when Laurel repeats the gag, and Vaseline hangs the other fence over the fence. This one lands on his ass and straightens up straight ahead. Very funny! If anyone planned this gag in this comedy, I greet an unknown gagsmith ... and a man who manipulated a bull to land in that position. Probably happier, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep him. During the silent era, when Hollywood produced a large budget that was set up wherever people speak English, it was an ordinary movie device to show a piece of text or an inscription in the local jargon, then dissolve it into the same text in English. I was surprised that this low-budget comedy spent money on copying this device here: we see a bulletin board outside the Spanish message corridor, then dissolving it in the same English text. Unfortunately, the photo in this cheap movie is so dark that the effect is wasted. The actresses in this film are attractive ... including the wife of Broncho Billy Leon Anderson and wife Stan Laurel Mae Dahlberg; He briefly makes a nice dance. (Mae danced in Stan's act.) I was surprised to find Charlie Chaplin Wheeler Dryden's semi-short role because Chaplin had nothing to do with this movie. In 'Mud and Sand', Laurel gives a funny performance that is unlike his later known character Stanley ... but this movie is much less fun than his great work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: only 3 out of 10. TRIVIA NOTE: Twenty-three years later, in the latest American movie Stan Laurel - 'The Bullfighters' (1945) - again played a Spanish bullfighter (with his Spanish post-dubbed voice). Coincidentally, this film used footage from "Blood and Sand": not Valentino's film, but a remake of Tyrone Power. "Mud and Sand" is more fun than "The Bullfighters" but not much.
