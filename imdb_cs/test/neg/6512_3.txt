It is not such a good action thriller, because it is unsuccessfully trending the same water as Steven Seagal's earlier films because there is not a very good set. Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character he has played since the Fa. In my opinion, the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs to a much better film. Bob Gunton is fine as the main heavy. Best Actor throughout the film is Brian Cox, who is very scary in the role of a killer. My favorite scenes are fighting scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the film's reasons to see Glimmer Man (1996) is for the brief appearance of the beautiful and voluptupus of Nikki Cox. It's too bad that there were no more scenes in it.
