This movie is based on the Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero) series! It is located in a setting other than Streetfighter animated movie! This film is about Ryu, who is accompanied by Ken and Chun Li. I met Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! No other characters (which I could discover) were used from the video game! The battle scenes were fine, but nothing really spectacular! And there were not many! For me it's strange! There's no Streetfighter to fight! Streetfighter Animated Film (1994) is much better than this movie. He is trying to be more than he is! Using "Snake Power" and other supernatural elemnents has nothing to do with skills that have characters in the video game! And in this case, it's a bad thing! The story is so boring that you really don't mind what's going on! The event is greatly reduced! Why? And what happened to the other characters in the video game! Certainly they are more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the video game are characters with their own special skills! It's all about Ryu in this movie! That's why this anime fails!
