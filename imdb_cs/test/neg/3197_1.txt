I watch this horrible movie as we speak. it may be one of the worst films ever made in my house. I'm sitting here with 3 friends and agree. it's not scary. its not funny. it's not dramatic. it doesn't contain anything appealing. we are 49 minutes in the movie. we only saw 2 animals. only one person died. This movie is one big drop. Nothing about this horrible, horrible movie I thought of looking at the rest. I'll bring the movie. I hope everyone who has something to do with this movie will die. I don't mean just actors. I mean the director, the producers, the presidents of the studio that funded the film. It is in full, worst movie ever. It should make IMDb the worst 100 movies of all time. at 1.
