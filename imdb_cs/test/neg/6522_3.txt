This script was slightly original when it was written in 1935, but poor performance and inconsistent levels of quality do not recommend. Some vignettes are absolutely terrible and dialogue is never natural. Several twists were creative, but I was very surprised to see that it was so highly rated on the IMDB. Several scenes are worth it, it's like a movie that, if you don't fully enjoy it. If you like this kind of montage, run does not go and get "Manhattan Stories" (1942) a wonderful movie that follows the life and topcoat times.
