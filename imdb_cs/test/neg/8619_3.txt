Although this was set to be a showcase for some kickboxing and swordplay, "Vampires: Turning" (VTT) could have aspired for it. Since he doesn't even strive to be a good vampire movie, VTT can't deliver any punch that he could try. The use of the idea of ​​a 800-year-old Thai vampire was interesting, but the story of the offspring that she misled (and now has to wipe out) actually reminds me of Gizmo and his situation in Gremlin It's not a good thing to get to a vampire. Stephanie Chao is attractive and serves as a "good" vampire very well, but her lack of any grate accents when you realize she is an 800 year old vampire. When she told Connor that she was a "young soul" she did not bring a line of great weight that you would expect from an "old" soul. Attractive but incredible. Meredith Monroe was more believable in his role, but for alum "Dawson's Creek" you'd think he'd have more time on the screen. The question of whether Amanda succumbs to "turning around" is the most compelling reason to watch this movie and you'll never get it. You get a joke, but you never really get any type of development from the characters for this device. It's an inexpensive way to play your audience, people. <br /> <br /> If you want something that is a good vampire movie, go find Lugosi "Dracula" and if you want a sexy vampire movie, you have dozens of swings from Hammer with much more power than this. Finally, if you want good or sexy, this is not the place. This is simply forgotten.
