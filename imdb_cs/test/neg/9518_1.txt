I was looking forward to this at the Sydney Film Festival. I left the theater, as did many others, before the credits ended because I couldn't sit back. It was badly shot, the sound sucks, and playing was worse than the episode of the Boat Love. Now I know why this movie couldn't find an American distribution company that would release it in the United States. This scream of low budget high school production.
