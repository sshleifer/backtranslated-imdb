This is the most scary movie ever made in Hollywood. It's a warning story about how to take a European masterpiece and suck the life out of it as long as it's dry husks like the carcass insects on the windowsill. Scary because it reveals how the world of Hollywood really works: the ignorant money that spawned the wreckage. I wonder how many great movies could fill my memory corridors if the Hollywood process didn't match them with unforgettable. Cry for murdered children! See Spoorloos or read the Golden Egg if you dare, because it will always come back to you in calm moments of your life: when you walk down the street and see a "missing" poster; in common car parks; when you hear Tour De France on the radio; and especially when you think "what a shame?" wearing a sock with a hole in it on an ordinary day. <br /> <br /> If I could just give it zero.
