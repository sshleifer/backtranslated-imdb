What a waste of great acting talent. That's a shame, because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention the other, less known in America), this is a lot of talent for wasting. This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After I enjoyed "Kings and Queens" and this movie left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where I actually left before the movie ended. The film wandered its central story (including Catherine Deneuve's Disease) to get sidetracked by every peripheral story and supporting character that appeared on the screen. The film also gave us too little character development to understand why different characters don't like each other so much (that was the story of family dysfunction), so the lack of a coherent story became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (which moved from hip hop to Bach to Mendelhson's Night of Midsummer Night) was at odds with the emotional temperature of the film and further obscured some emotion the viewer should feel at the time. Photographs (the director often started with scenes with a mostly dark screen where our only spectacle is just a small opening, so the feeling as if we were looking through the peephole then widening) was also arrogant and erratic.
