Several friends and I have a weird hobby to look for a really horrible and totally obscure (for good reason) horror flicks and then follow them under the influence of expanding consumer goods like alcohol and / or soft drugs. A lot of people do it, but they watch movies like "Godzilla" remake, while we torment our eyes and brains things like "The Loch Ness Horror". And eureka, this is a bad film prototype! We will open traditionally, with music in bags during the opening credits. This is, of course, to emphasize for us stupid viewers that the story should take place in Scottish highlights and not in Larry Buchanan's native house in Texas. For exactly the same reason, cast members are also seemingly instructed to overwhelm and talk with an appalling accent. American Marine Biologist George Sanderson arrives at Loch Ness with some brand new and highly sophisticated sonar devices to track down the legendary monster in the lake. Meanwhile, many other parties hang around the lake, like a group of kids at a scientific camp (a boring way to spend their holidays), retired generals looking for a Luftwaffe that crashed into a lake during World War II, and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists who they appreciate the monster's egg. Do you think that these numerous parcels bring some diversity and excitement to the land, but unfortunately it is not. "Loch Ness Horror" is a generally boring film with only a few remarkable elements. The monster itself is a beautifully kitschy creature with cute eyes and smoky breath. His teeth also glowed in the dark, which is quite useful when you're stupid enough to go on a boat trip in the middle of the night. At the end of the movie, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost Luftwaffe plane than in the monster, so it was about time to wrap it up. "Loch Ness Horror" is carefully recommended if you are a fan of bad B-movies from the 1980s, but it should be pointed out that it contains an overload of meaningless dialogues and a bizarre rushing end that makes the movie look suddenly budget.
