I'd have to agree with the previous reviewer: This movie has amazing animation, but it has problems for the rest of the movie. The hole pattern is huge, the dialogue barely explains the conspiracy concepts-- MAIN FLOOR POINTS are not even fully explained up to the last five minutes of the movie. The characters say obvious while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film. There are characters that appear and have meaning in a story that is never explained - most of them have names that are only mentioned once *, and this is extremely confusing for the viewer. Don 'Don't waste your time with this movie. If you are in it for a good laugh and how it is DUMB.
