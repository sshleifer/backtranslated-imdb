When I first watched this show on Cartoon Network, I found it uninteresting. Then I read a lot of good news about this show and decided to watch it. The show was so boring. Each episode was predictable. This show has no logic. Hypersmart girls who go to school and sometimes do such stupid things, 99% of the episodes begin with Monster attacking Townswille, then mayor (he is a real fool, he's not funny, he's so stupid that I can't imagine how he became mayor) . Professor, yes, he should be the smartest person on this show, but actually ... He didn't even find any difference between the monster and his brother. Narrative comments also make this show boring. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning of each episode and at the end. Also animation is very special. Everything but the main characters is shown ugly. Also in every epsode, this show gives you several life lessons, and that means it's aimed at young children, but if you look closer, you'll see there's a lot of violence and even blood (!!!) during their battles.
