Far from the combination of the best pieces of Pontypool and 28 days, they had ignored it. While brazenly copying them. (If that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and gradually tensed, it just stinks. Radio DJ, "we have to stay in the air", spend effectively no time in the air. Sitting at the bottom watching TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there the only person in the US who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or has he ever heard the word "zombie"? Well, in the 50th minute this bunch of misfits still calls zombies, "those infected" or those with "rabies". The word "Zombie" might appear a guest later, I could care less. where do you have to pay for using certain words? As with Bluetooth headphones, it is called "ear-thing", I am not you! Finish, no plot + no gaming = no one cares. rip-off.
