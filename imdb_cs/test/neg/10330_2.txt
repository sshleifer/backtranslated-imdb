Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so terrible, I couldn't help but laugh all over the movie in disbelief that I was actually watching something so miserable. Ha ha. Sound editing is terrible, trying to come up with creative camera angles. Because they're just strange and stupid. The script sucked. Acting was terrible, the storyline is not very good. Very unrealistic, even for film. But it's a 20-year-old movie ..... so I'll give him a bonus point. And yeah, the music was terrible. But we all have to start somewhere. And presenting these things is such a problem ..... 10 lines minimum ... bother. Well now I know why I couldn't find this movie in the movie store .... I had to buy it offline to see it ... a good thing it was just $ 58 cents .... though the traffic was $ 2.59. Well well .... I do not recommend anyone to waste time and money to see this movie ...
