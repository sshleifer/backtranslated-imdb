The director of this film is the famous French television presenter Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for rednecks and his incredible film is absolutely in his image. It is the story of a young retarded person called "Zep" (sic). At night she sees her sister's sexual relationship and decides to do the same: she rapes the girl she loves! Zep is placed in the asylum and his unhappy girlfriend at the clinic. One person will find them. One person will unite them. This man is a psychologist. This man looks like an infernal angel. This man is ... Patrick Sebastien! With excessive use of clich√©s we will see how Absolute Love can break all misunderstandings and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with violence. We will also learn how to use sandwiches to seduce a girl. Not only Patrick Sebastien thinks he can do psychiatry better than a century, but he also gives us a stupid leftist ideology; with the character of his father's girlfriend, the boss who wants to take away the girl's weakness. Desperate. It's very nice to laugh at Zep (mentally retarded people aren't funny except for this movie).
