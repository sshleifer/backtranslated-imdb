I confess - I was attracted to this humbula - and I stopped thinking about resources. "one of the best indie exploitation of the year (1999)", "shocking" and "must have" movies. Well - I wasted my money, but not all were bad in this movie. as well as some of the simplest ways of murder that have been seen in a long time, and even a story (something) and that is about him. <br /> <br /> Exploiting film is a surprising amount of content - but not exploitation, we get gay sex - sorta, we have 3 inter-racial girls - maybe we have a psychotic Vietnamese hooker - nice back, oral sex (ok that made me) and some female version of Gene Simmons (I don't get that part.) in this movie - it's not a compliment and finally we have a government conspiracy thrown in it - I don't know - try to join revenge / random / thematic killing of Jimmy's boy to make Vietnamese psycho seem reasonable ???? If nothing else, this film proves that the Americans do not have a lock on this type of film. Latinos can do bullshit as well as others. Kudos goes to anyone who has contributed to this success that has outperformed her and made a career for herself.
