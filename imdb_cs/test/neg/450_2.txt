Every time I watch Larry King Live, she throws out most of the softball questions for her guests. He rarely gets any useful information because he doesn't ask questions about hard questions. This is based on his radio launch. The King has settled on the radio and basically, not a single bit of the TV format has changed, except that his visible head is visible. He becomes a puppy for his guests, and the only time he actually gets useful information from them is when he volunteers, or the caller for the show really asks a difficult question. Larry is a kind, paternal type interviewer. This means that it should not be premiered on the main news network if you are considering CNN. I don't have CNN history. <br /> <br /> Copy (ie Cable) The new network was launched by Ted Turner as an alternative to networking messages in that it could broadcast 24/7 messages. When it first began, the only television competition was from NBC, ABC, and CBS. Because of this, CNN copied the format of their competition and achieved decent ratings. <br /> <br /> This worked well for CNN until they got competitive networks that were innovative and provided better / fresher news reporting. In response to the warmth of the competition, CNN went into denial & panned its competitors who ate their lunch and ratings because CNN wanted to resist the changes. This did not work very long and their ratings began to decline. Now the Copying News Network is trying to be re-formed by copying it to its own reporting format. Unfortunately, this show is a big problem. It is 21 years old and shows that his age is very bad. Sorry, the King must be moved from Prime Time or completely eliminated.
