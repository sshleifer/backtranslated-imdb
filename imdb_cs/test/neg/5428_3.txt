Oh my God. Why is it that Nickelodeon has such hard times to produce a half decent movie? This movie could be good, but it was: <br /> <br /> A. Too short B. Rather superficial, stereotyped and offensive to some C. Finally unnecessary <br /> <br /> First, "dress up nerd to look cool "the thing was very consumer, very shallow, very pointless, and very offensive. She has stereotyped nerds, silly faces, glasses, never kissed, holidays with his mom, etc. Maybe the man never kissed a girl because he's gay! Does this mean that all homosexuals are fools? And what's wrong with being friends with my mother? The worst part, by far, is over. The whole movie drama was about Zoey when she found out that Chase loved her, and blah blah blah, and then when Chase finally decided to tell her, A. he didn't tell her personally, because just like that as he approached the typical distraction, he came along with B., trying to send her a text message, but her PDA fell into the fountain and died before she got the message. /> End. <br /> <br /> HOW ARE THE NAME THAT ????? Why is it that cartoonists in the series just can't change anything? Many of us would like to see these two meet. Why don't we see it? I mean, are manufacturers really so non-creative that they can't figure out new problems that could go with the changes in the show? So they must stick to the same plot and outlines, and do as many episodes as they can use? After a while it's boring and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see some real novels, HERE! <br /> <br /> Good. I'm done with my bragging.
