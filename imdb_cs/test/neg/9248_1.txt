Or should I say unintentionally cheerfully? Either way, it's one of the best comedies I've ever seen. I laughed at some of the stupidest fictional characters on this side of Homer Simpson. It's just one forehead-banging, painfully stupid scene after another, like a clown, muffled cardboard cutouts that replace real humanoid characters, push, pull, and drag a "plot" to its inevitable and obvious conclusion. If I had to describe this film to someone else, I would call it a mutated hybrid Fatal Attraction, Dumb and Dumber and Three Stooges, with a "peak" that is unusually similar to the Family Guy episode in which the whole family gets into a fistfight in the living room. Benson Family Advice: next time you get a new pet, do a poor animal a favor and don't call it Fred!
