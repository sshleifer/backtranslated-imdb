This must be one of the weakest graphs in the movie I've ever seen. However, this is not all that this movie lacks. This movie has the worst acting, writing, directing, special effects, naming it - it's the worst ever. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that you spend time on valuable movies and not waste your time on this movie. garbage. I agree with an earlier post that "women" were certainly men dressed in a move, and that gave me a laugh, still trying to figure out if they were about them. Do it or if you are actually trying to be sexy women. <br /> <br /> There's nothing else in this movie that's worth watching! Summary: A terrible act, a horrible script, a horrible movie idea. An hour and a half I want back right RIGHT NOW !!
