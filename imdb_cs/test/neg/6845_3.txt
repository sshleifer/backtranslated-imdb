This movie was so stupid and slow it was slow. The only good part of the movie was a girl in tight climbing gold pants. There was no hole in it and what the horror movie is 80 years without a little thing. And the murderer was neither scary nor murderous. But if you want to watch the worst horror in the world, then it's for you. Don't waste your time as I watched.
