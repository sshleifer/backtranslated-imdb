Although I think that the reviewers who hated this movie have encapsulated exactly what they do wrong (everything!), I had to add my two cents. If you would like a long version of how awful this movie is, please read the coinlightning review. Here's a short version: the shameless use of NAMES actors to drive a plot against using their talent (no one brought their "game"), blatant commercialization (I think Pepsi can afford to stick an ad - or 40 - into the film now) and a plot (???) that was so intricate with the clich√© of "rock star" that it was absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Let me give you this way. . . All the while I was watching this movie, I was thinking about 'Wayne's World', but I wasn't allowed! Whenever you try to throw Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to help your film story around the world, you have serious problems. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, warn your friends and family - this movie will piss.
