It would be pretty easy to make this movie sound entertainment: calling a girl gets shot headed by a North Korean spy but survives. The bullet, which is stored in her brain, makes it a long time for knowledge, as well as for sex. Unknown to her, she leaves filming with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her purse, a key that can unlock the power of using nuclear weapons. Just say scarlet, and at least a few people show up in the theater. I'm not sure how many of them saw this four-year film when it opened in New York in April, but I sincerely hope not much. It sounds like a light and playful flick of a pin, but it has artistic preconditions and is really incredibly boring. Many pink movies in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but the ambitions of this film are making time that will be unbearable between sexual scenes. And then the sex scenes are not even good! I've seen some nasty things in dirty Japanese movies. I've never seen this country produce something with sex this boring. Spice Channel is more imaginative. The only interesting thing in this movie is the main actress's body, Emi Kuroda. Otherwise, it is pure torture.
