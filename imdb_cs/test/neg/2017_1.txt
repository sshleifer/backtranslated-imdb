This may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I knew it was a B-movie before I watched it (that was the reason to watch it), but I never thought it might be so bad. The title promises Dracula in space and brings, however, the story does not make any real use of the fact that the character of Casper van Dien is a descendant of Van Helsing. And watch out for the end of the movie, it will come to you quickly. I've never seen the final scream "And now we're over the budget!" clearer way. Their distinction of the film was somewhat comical, but the story was obviously painted in the corner. If you feel you have to see it, watch it with a friend who shares your love for B-movies. If I hadn't done it, I wouldn't have finished it.
