Yeah, this is definitely a strong rival to win the controversial "worst 80-year-old slasher ever" award. "The Prey" has everything you usually want to avoid in a horror movie: a routine, derived plot you've seen thousands of times before (and better), unbearable characters and terrible performances, total lack of gore and tension, fuzzy photos, and unoriginal sites and? ? most irritating of all? The greatest amount of senseless padding shots you've ever encountered in your life (and it's not an exaggeration, but a guarantee!). In addition to the seemingly endless number of National Geographic footage that I will continue to expand, this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) And two occasions when characters tell dillydally jokes that aren't even remotely funny! The setup is as basic as possible, with the intro showing the images of a devastating forest fire with OTT voice calls. Fast forward almost forty years later when an older couple from camping in the same area with an ax whipped up something that breathes hard off the screen. It should be enough information to deduce that someone has survived the fire all these years, and has been roaming ever since. Enter three unbearable twenty something couples are heading to a dangerous zone with exclusively sex on their mind, unaware of course, that they are sitting ducks for stalking and gasping for the killer. "The Prey" is an irreplaceable boring movie. Apparently it was filmed back in 1978, but nobody wanted to distribute it until 1984 and it's not too hard to see why. If you filter out all the content that is really relevant, it would only be a short 30-minute movie; maybe even less. There is an incredibly wide range of nature and wildlife, sometimes animals that I think they do not live in this type of area, and seem to continue forever. The only thing missing is the typical National Geographic narrative that provides educational information on animal habits. Animals in their own natural habitat are undoubtedly pleasing to look at, but not in the supposedly ugly and cheese-like film of the 1980s, for loud calls. Last fifteen minutes is finally somewhat useful, with some powerful killing sequences and fine makeup effects on the monster (who turns out to be Lurch from "The Addams Family" movies), but still silliness overrules? the scene with vultures is too stupid? And the last shot is just laugh-out-loud retarded. As mentioned above, "The Prey" easily forms my personal list of the worst 80 slashers, next to "Appointment with Fear", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Don't Go in Woods", "Hollow Gate", "Stay up "and" Curfew ".
