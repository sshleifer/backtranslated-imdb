An unpleasant genre of "home invasion" can be traced to Wes Craven's early sleazefest "The Last House on the Left", with such ugly off-shoots as "I Spit On Your Grave", "Wrong Way" and "The Visitors". in the footsteps of that movie. Here, in this early '80s Italian offering the same plot is regurgitated one more time, with a twist being that is set on a continental train. "La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto"? known in English speaking countries as "Terror Express"? it starts surprisingly well, but it takes about twenty minutes to get worse in it because the sex scenes are starting to take priority over more serious action and tension. David, Phil and Ernie, three wealthy young men who crumble into terrorizing and humiliating others, embark on transcontinental express in Italy. The train is full of other passengers, including the Juliette prostitute (Silvia Dionisio), who travels frequently and made a deal with one of the porters to act as a pimp who convinced the traveling men to participate in their money. sleeping night. Three Crete quickly set off to distract the passengers with their aggressive, drunken behavior, but things become more serious when they take control of the entire car for express and barricade themselves from the rest of the train. She is looking forward to her temporary check. a young woman (Zora Kerova) is raped by two young men in a cramped space; Juliette herself is exposed to long-term sexual assault; and later the tormenting trio forces men to play dice to decide which of them will rape a 16-year-old virgin traveling with her parents (a concept that was twice as tasteless as her father is one of the men forced to play the game). The only passenger who seems to be ready to fight is a condemned escort to Germany, but what hope does one man have against three armed criminals? La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto perform a decent start. Various interesting characters are presented and three hoodlums have a really unpleasant impact on passengers. Although the story is unequivocally exploitative, the opening scenes open up carefully and the film seems to rise above the usual level of the genre. Things fall apart during a terrible scene in which Ker's sex sandwich in the toilet is two thieves. The scene is somewhat filmed and the effect does not seem to create sympathy for the victim or hatred of the perpetrators? instead, we are asked to feel switched on. This is a sensation in his worst case. Followed by other humiliating rape, but rapeseed sequences include too much persistent camera work over oral sex acts and female genitalia. One sequence represents a 16-year-old girl who meets on the verge of a hard core and feels particularly "bad". By the end of La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thriller because the last hour of the film is devoted to pornography rather than tension. Sleaze lovers will enjoy it; others may want to look elsewhere.
