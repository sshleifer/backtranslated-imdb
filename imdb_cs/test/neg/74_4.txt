Unfortunately, the talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent cannot get any interesting cooking ideas in this artificial little thing about a confusing mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite her mother's behavior. Apart from a few good sequences, I didn't buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (she's too internally smart and focused on being passed on as this evil lady) and her naturally anchored personality is bad for that role. irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman is much better than her child, yet her work is fearsome (and some of her scenes, such as where she asks the boy to undress, are misleading and uncomfortable to watch). It is certainly not an incompetent work, "Anywhere But Here", it has moments that work, but it is not a movie that can be picked up or proved to be important. ** of ****
