Plot: <br /> <br /> - EBay Chairs <br /> <br /> - Random People <br /> - Random People Talk ("Dude, it's true." "Let's get married now! ") <br /> <br /> - If you are a" hippie "then you will love this movie. (You must be tall or drunk, otherwise you will question your life by watching this junk.) <br /> <br /> This movie wasn't clearly from start to finish thoughtful, and other comments are probably crew upholstery ratings. If it wasn't aimed at my demographic, I don't know what it's meant for. I found a conspiracy of everyday boring. It's something I would do, and believe me it's not worth filming. Going on a roadtrip and shooting half of silence won't make a movie!
