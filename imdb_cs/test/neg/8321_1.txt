We Are Seriously ??? I mean wow ... just, wow. I think I saw this movie in the old War Journal. This is pathetic, the originality is totally dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea that we are getting, it is insignificant to re-care for the old line of plot and to "switch it", we will only change the sex or race of the original character, tired of seeing it ... but I think it's just a boast and will most likely fall on deaf ears to be immersed in the sound of another turda that hits the toilet water as the best western from 3:10 Yum. .. (wait for it) ... 3:10 on Yuma! I thank Hollywood for killing the film as an art form and transforming it into a commercial neo-pop bar and junk.
