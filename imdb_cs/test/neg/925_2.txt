This film is an undisguised attempt to appeal to younger demographic fourteen to twenty years old and to insult all of them. I refuse to believe that this age group is the vapid that should be entertained by this useless remake. soon in the movie one of the characters claims, "I'm surrounded by idiots". this is a crucial moment in the film, which is constantly decreasing from here. The film is full of clichés, red herring, and inexplicable events. The film is also full of characters that are not exactly brains, a formula that is too familiar in silly horror movies. and the miserable "it's so dark that I don't see" scenes stolen from chain saw massacre, but only unpleasant, don't create any tension or horror. it is hard to film in the dark, and sometimes it is the darkness of a great vehicle in a film that assumes tension. But my own feeling was that the less you see in this case, the better. maybe he didn't want to wait until morning because he didn't care, otherwise it could cost more money to make the night scenes well or not. who knows? If you've never seen a horror movie in your life, or you're two or three years old, every aspect of this movie is predictable and made earlier. Warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough. all this in the film blasé slasher, which wonders where is w * ll wax? If you are bored as much as possible, and all the other rentals are out or you're just in the mood for a bad horror movie that isn't really scary or you want to see Paris break its head, go ahead and take the chance. it is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but if the producers of this movie think the younger audience wants it, I pray that they will be deceived. a profit-driven film without trying to achieve any kind of art or respect for the genre. clever characters do for a scarier movie. I believe this is Collet Serra's debut as a director, in addition to commercials and music videos. He has another one coming out in 2006 titled Goal 2. Hopefully his goal is to make a better film.
