I looked at the first episode and found it to be a very wooden performance. I've watched the original of his early days on Big Girls Blouse for the last Channel 7 series. Kath and Kim were great Mocumentary and it's the humor most people get. However in this American version I found it boring, Molly Shannon's fashion to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80's with her curly perm. While Selma Blair's figure embracing clothing is not as good as the original Kimmy. I also found that Selma seemed to beat a lot on her stomach, of course she is (Australian) size 12 where Kim (Australian) should be 16/18. The Molly and Selma exchanges are obviously written and there are pauses where there should be no pauses or pauses are a bit long as someone suggested there to be a laughing track during those pauses. It's like Molly and Shannon aren't used to themselves, there's no mother / daughter chemistry. Phil was okay he had eccentric air around him like Kel. However, Craig was a nice and not sweet simple humble Brett from the Aussie version. <br /> <br /> I found that this was like watching a very bad theater play. Acting was largely wooden, and the tenacity of Selmin's expressions was fun after ten minutes. Especially her annoying scenes. To sum up, I find that this show is a waste of time, the screenplay was apparently dumbed for the Americans who most say on the album that they prefer the original. If NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim, why not pay the producers money to project the original. <br /> <br /> All I can add is Magda, which is one smart cookie for not wanting manufacturers to use your Sharon character.
