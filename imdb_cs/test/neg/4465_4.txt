Title: Dracula AD 1972 <br /> <br /> Director: Alan Gibson <br /> <br /> Cast: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beacham <br /> <br /> Reviews: Sometimes movies can be time capsules that will take you back to that time. In this case ... our time capsule is Hammers Dracula AD 1972, which transports us back to a time when Austin Powers would feel at home. The story is about these groups of kids (they were not a gang! was a group!) who liked to hang up in a cafe called "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm strange surname ... wait ... that reports Dracula back!) A new group member will offer the group a new way to get their kicks. They offer them night of black matter and black magic. What they also say "sure why the hell not, it could be fun!". So in no time flat, find yourself resurrecting Count Dracula from ashes. This movie opens with swinging aside for some rich doofuses home. He knows there is no one at his party, but everyone is a party at night. Doing drugs, doing and dancing on the table. The creators made sure that this sequence was completely flooded with any young people who were cold at the time. They all say words like "way out" and "groovy" and complete many of their sentences that say "all those jazz". So yeah, it's pretty obvious it's a 70's. To top it all off, there's a band that sounds like "Jefferson Airplane" ... I think you'll be drowned in all the 70s. And as I watched, I asked myself, "How the hell is Dracula with a black cloak and get up to fit in all this?" And that's exactly what happens. Old Dracula feels in the midst of all the party and rock and roll and drugs. Many scenes in the movie are great .... but unfortunately the music they decided to add to the proceedings is not suitable at all and will take you completely out of the mood of things. Something terrifying or frightening will take place on the screen, and suddenly a loud trumpet and congos start to beat and your totally out of horror. What sucked in the atmosphere right from this movie is for me. All in all, all the disturbing music of the 1970s is set aside (the illness that also suffered from the Satanic rituals of Dracula), the film was pretty good. But I'll mention it. The story was just a re-hash of what we had previously seen in Taste the Blood of Dracula. In fact, the story is pretty damn close. Let's see ... a young boy who inherits Draculas's ring and ashes ... a check. Then he decides to return Dracula to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what goes into ... control. The black mass brought Dracula back to the desecrated church ... a check. The list of similarities goes on and on. So this movie is not very original if you ask me. <br /> <br /> There are several things that make this movie worth it. For example, the fact that the film is a time capsule to London in the early 1970s makes the film fun. Every time someone spoke in 70 jargon, I giggled and laughed. I couldn't believe that some of the clothes that these people wore and the cars they were driving! It made movie entertainment for me, but we're here to be scared, we were here to see Drac kill a couple of dolls and avenge himself at Van Helsing's house. Did we get anything out of it? Oh yeah. There are a few good sequences that are compressed there to satisfy an old school hammer. First, it is a sequence of Black matter, which was primarily Satanic! They mentioned the name of many demons and lots of blood. This succession was amazing, but the music was destroyed at the most critical moment. Then Draculas was the real resurrection I admit was great from a visual point of view. Some fog comes from Draculas's grave and slowly, but surely, the silhouette and face of Christopher Lees will emerge from the mist. Good shot! I loved it! At the end, we have a Cushing and Lee headdress. And I couldn't help laughing in one place when Dracula casts a piece of furniture through the air. I laughed because he did it in every Horror of Dracula movie. It is a hammer tradition where figures start throwing candles and chairs on top of each other. And I don't think it's about their exciting things that show that the bad guy is throwing a candle on our hero. Well, anycomws, Draculas demis in this is very similar to all the other Hammer Draculas before that, the vampire gets a wrench and then we cut to a series of shots until just ashes remain. All in all, the unintentionally funny Hammer Dracula movie. It's imprisoned in the 1970s and although it's a fun watch (and it's not as bad as Dracula's satanic rituals), it still doesn't look good with the Dracula universe we expected from Hammer. <br /> <br /> Rating 3 1/2 of 5
