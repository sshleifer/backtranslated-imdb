This must be the worst movie I've ever seen Nielson. This movie just doesn't have what it needs to be funny. I think the reasons why Naked Gun and similar movies are that they didn't require Nielson to be funny. He only played roles as straight as he could, while all the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But if you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he is not. The film had only one good part, and this can be considered a spoiler by some, and that the initial credits were revived. If the whole movie was animated, it could have been good. I had no intention of seeing this movie when I saw the ads for it, and the only reason I saw it was that the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. This is the first and probably the only movie I've ever gone to. On the 1-10 scale I give this movie a score of -100.
