I've seen three more films that are worse than this, "Plan 9 of Outerspace," "Side Hackers," and the Dreaded "Blair Witch Project." <br /> <br /> Let's start with an AMTRAK train without a skirt or railing between cars. The killer gets up for his victim as he moves from car to car and just pushes it from the train. In one scene, a killer sneaks into a woman's apartment. He wants to sneak up on a woman to kill her, so what does she do? Turns her stereo! If I heard my stereo suddenly louder, I would be concerned. She kills women by throwing an electric curling iron in the tub. I was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five-speed cord could be dropped ten feet and stayed inside. In addition, the apartment looked modern enough to have grounding outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electric. Boeing 747 is one of the most famous commercial airliners on the planet, so this part really impressed me. First, the cockpit was not even close to the actual 747 and the other was not on the top deck of the aircraft. I watched in utter astonishment as the pilot and passenger (where was the aircraft engineer?) He walked right past the spiral staircase and headed for the plane nose. I was also surprised that the bullets would not have penetrated an aluminum serving trolley (a good thing for our hero) or a bathroom door, but would have penetrated the ceiling, causing fuel to leak out of a small hole in hull. Huh? Watching three guys lengthening the track by 100 yards in less than a week was also amazing. <br /> <br /> I didn't check, was it a movie of the week or something? It was terrible.
