I won't really waste my time with in-depth analysis, I just say I'm very disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones made a mistake in being in the lead in this absurd, pointless thing, in this full cliché boring to death mindless pathetic to try filming ! There is no point in trying to find the positive side of this film, because as a whole it is poor in every single case and the saddest is that Zeta-Jones is so uncompromisingly dragged into a cliché that he has absolutely no chance to show even 1% of her talent! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie on the occasion of spending the night at home playing on the wall !!!
