Like the previous commentator of this film, I found myself in tears during this film. Sometimes one wonders how a film of such horror-inspiring horror is created. From the first moment our protagonist wakes up in his flat in New York from a dream of subway trains throwing on galloping horses (what the Irish emigrant did not have), it is clear that we have problems. And that's not much better. He plunged back into the 1950s in Ireland, entering a world where everyone speaks without intonation and solely on the theme of the Irish Civil War. Schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war. Drinkers in the pub share their civil war. Memories are made for those who died in the Civil War. The city is divided among those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget ... the civil war. Every view and conversation drips with meaning that returns to civil war. The difficulty of the Broken Harvest video recorder suggests that the film is a parable about the problems in modern Ireland. The only parallel that interferes with me is that at the moment the Dublin talk is really dominated by one theme: home prices. If its intention is to offer a glimpse of Ireland's obsession with its past, it will fail miserably. It is striking that few Irish films have dealt with the Irish Civil War and its heritage. However, it will take a film of much greater subtlety and intelligence than this one that tells us something about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation's psyche. <br /> <br /> For those American viewers who designed the film, it evokes the atmosphere of the 1950s in Ireland: no. The 1950s Ireland was a terrible, poverty-stricken field of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in hippos. However, there is more than one conversation topic.
