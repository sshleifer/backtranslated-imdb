I never wanted to see Venom, but I caught it on the cable. It has good elements. Louisiana swamp atmosphere for one, something unfortunately we don't see so much in movies because of Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, a regular man filled with the spirit of evil. His confrontation with his son could be interesting as well as a lot of film. But as in Hollywood, an interesting idea goes down in a familiar direction: <br /> <br /> Kill all the characters saving a good girl, starting with Black Boys. I'm a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but more interesting are other characters, the evil villain, CeCe, who must become a priestess of voodoo. And for the love of God, just once I would like to see a virgin kill. We all like a girl, why can't she live? In this case, it was Bijou Phillips, and we love her. The end did not make sense to think about what was found out about the invincibility of the villain. All the massacres and the atmosphere, and it leads to nothing.
