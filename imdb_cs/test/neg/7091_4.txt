In an effort to keep up with the hipness youthful audience as the 70s approached, OaCD, YCSF was the product of odor and odor material selected for musicalization. Here's the history of life regression, ESP and hypno-therapy ... quite a loop! The real problem with the term (music or not) is extremely low dramatic bets; where can a movie go and what can happen when a man falls in love with a previous girl incarnation she can't build? There can be no new place, but strangely, it cannot be an old place! If so, viewers would still not be interested in joining Yves Montand (playing much older, arrogant, French ass) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We never invest in them, their situations or results. Montand's miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible. It's all given a shallow sixties veneer that makes it clearly disposable; Despite the efforts here and there from Minelli, which are decent. It's not even adapted from a non-musical story that has met any previous success ... that's just too much! Streisand occasionally has some entertaining business he offers, like trying not to fall asleep and improvise energetic dance. But yet she relies on her grumpy (translation: irritating), cocoon, Jewish shtick girl. She, however, can sing very well both on the "fine" and "powerhouse" end of the range. In the middle of a musical score, 3 or 4 amazing songs * of a much higher caliber than Fanny or Dolly offered. "He's not you" is a sweet little thing as noble as "My funny valentine Valentine" Lorenz Hart, but the film can't make any impact; because the lyrics don't seem to refer to anything in the movie, and nothing remotely indicates that great love flourished between Chabot and Melinda. <br /> <br /> The only cut we can see is the poor work of the ax a much larger film. Strong research shows a longer, better explained and more decorative, but not necessarily better film at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there are more Babes in this version, but more importantly, it would be more attentive to work with Minelli. Finally, Montand sends Babs to sing the title song after finding out he's a total dick who feeds her a confident homily to break out of the hook. And he takes the bait. So, uh ... shout for that. <br /> <br /> (* Hurry Up Here, Love With All Ornaments, He's Not, And Title Song)
