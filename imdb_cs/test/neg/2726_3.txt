"The Vindicator" is a weird little Canadian B-movie. At first glance it seems that it's just another cheap (extremely cheap!) "Terminator" knockoff, but oddly enough it also shares some of the features with the original "RoboCop" which hasn't yet been released yet when "Vindicator" appeared (1986) . Chance? Who knows? The story is thus: scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a pretty handsome man who works for a super duper secret government high-tech research lab, reporting a slimy boss named Whyte, whom he bumps his head on financing projects early in the film. Carl has a loving wife and child on the way home, which is all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "laboratory accident". But wait! Carl's not dead at all! Whyte pulled Carl's brain and put it in his home project, some experimental bio-mechanical suit. Of course, when Carl wakes up inside his new body, he is a bit of a mess, lab confusion and escape. This is a problem, because Whyte (for reasons known to himself) programmed a mechanical suit with "Rage Reaction", which causes Carl to kill anyone who touches him for some reason. In retrospect, the little addition to Carl's psyche was probably not the best idea. So Robo-Carl wanders aimlessly at the film, killing several random muggers and other assorted characters in the background. He returns to his home and contacts his wife (this scene is supposed to be heartbreaking, I think, but it turns out to be comical, because Carl's robot voice is so strongly synthesized that he hardly can understand the word he says). Of course, he tells her to leave the city and never return because he is in danger but wants to stay with him and help him, yadda yadda yadda. Eventually Whyte hires a group of commando gangs led by "Hunter", an overt ninja killer played by Pam Grier (!) Chasing and destroying his match creation, using Carl's wife as bait, and a predictable (but ridiculously inexpensive look) mayhem follows. I'm a B-Movie kind of guy, but "The Vindicator" was so half-assed that it turned into a high comedy pretty fast. I suppose a good piece of budget went to Robo-Carl's Stan Winston suit because it actually looks pretty cool, but the rest of the film suffers from a cheap, made-for-TV kind of look. The script could use more work, but then maybe the filmmakers got the wind "RoboCop" going into production and hurried to get the "Vindicator" out so they couldn't be accused of ripping them off. Either way, judging from the other comments here on IMDb, I'm not the only one who noticed the parallels between "Vindicator" and "RoboCop", and of course "Robo" is an excellent movie, so you don't have to waste your time sitting over this piece of nonsense if you don't see a movie that can best be described, at best, as a rough "RoboCop" design if it was created by a 8th grader.
