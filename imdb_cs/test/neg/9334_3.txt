Unfortunately, this film and several other films from the 1950s with a religious context, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis and Samson and Delilah, regret all pagans or someone who is not a Jew or a Christian as morally corrupt and decadent. We focus only on biblical stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As for them, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome. Any film that preaches about "the only true God" gives a short shift to the freedom of religion. The films ignore the fact that the lack of religious freedom of ancient Judea made it a breeding ground for religious extremism. Most of the 1950s religious films also overlook the loss of freedom that occurred in the 4th century.
