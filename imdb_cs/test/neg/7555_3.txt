I've never seen a movie that disappoints me more than Lord Of The Dance. Frustrated because it could be fantastic. Frustrated because dance could be overwhelming. Frustrated because women could be wonderful. But how would I know?! At a time when your eyes moved into the area of ​​interest on the screen and focused appropriately on the spot to be admired, the mad editor shifted the shot! I totally agree with other remarks about lousy lighting and terrible work with the camera / editor. This makes me sick only watching ten minutes of this would be a spectacular movie. Give me the opportunity to take the front seat to a live concert and I'd be there! Nicholas T
