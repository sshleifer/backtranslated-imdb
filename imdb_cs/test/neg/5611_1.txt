This film had so many possibilities to be cheerful, but moving, but not one. She had a great story, it just wasn't done as well as she could be. The strange "hallucinations" during his sleep scenes had no meaning whatsoever, and were certainly not needed, did not influence or improve or provide any understanding of what was to happen. Jon Heder's character was fine, but it could be extended to more. He played the miserable part they gave him in the best possible case. The character was funny, but again it wasn't enough for what could have been. Milain's character was perfect and her performance was in place. At the end, writing was horrible and more often than not, making no sense, and his hallucinations with the film didn't fit. This movie, with better scripts and directing, could be a contender for National Lampoon Vacation when it comes to funny, bad things happening to a person on their way through America. Instead, it was just a worthy second flush. If I saw it in the theater, I'd ask for a refund and boycott the movie. The only thing this film did was waste a hour and a half of life. It also managed to make all those involved in the film look bad, simply because the movie was smelly. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to anyone! At all!
