This show is not good in my opinion, then I enjoyed no cartoon from Disney Channel again. With the exception of "The Proud Family" because it is probably a normal female teen This show is very similar to the way I feel about Lilo and Stich Series. It was a mistake when the film was turned into a cartoon because the film was excellent, the caricature is terrible. Disney Channel did fine before adding all these silly cartoons like Dave Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Lilo and Stich Series, American Dragon Jake long, and where it all started: Kim Possible. The shows would be better if they came to Disney's PlayHouse! As for this particular show, Kuzko never gets out of school, just as Dave The Barbarian's Parents never returns home, and like Brandy and Mr. Whiskers never get out of the jungle.
