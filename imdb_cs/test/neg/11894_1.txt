That must be the most boring movie I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that, fortunately, I didn't pay to see it. We got a free gig at school and everyone in the audience was sitting there embarrassed when it came to fun, when it was fun. This piece of waste is a badly filmed, too long film. The real idea of ​​why the film should last about 10 seconds. The only ones interested in this movie are those who have lost their jobs and want to know why. Some talks might be interesting. The various adjustments could make this an interesting document, but I doubt that these talks are in any way concerned. As it is, it's just a tragedy, both to look and be part. AVOID THIS FILM IN EVERY COST!
