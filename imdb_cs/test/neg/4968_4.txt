How could it get a rating of 6.0? We are like horror fans who are so accustomed to horror movies that they are so bad these days that when someone comes to have some, and repeat "just some", redemption of quality, we get too excited and give a rating that is just too little? The director has a certain visual atmosphere. There is no doubt about it. But between some decent shots he forgot about a good story, mood, or fear. It had a very slow first act, lazy killing scenes, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very incredible twist. And what about the picture of American teenagers in so many movies? They must always be so stupid, irritating and so divine. I don't remember it when I grew up here in Holland. All things in mind, in can not give this movie any more that 4 out of 10 ratings.
