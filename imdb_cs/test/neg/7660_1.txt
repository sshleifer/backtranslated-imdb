Concorde: Airport'79, is so far, the last of the high dramatic series, camp airport rows, at first glance in a TV guide or DVD cover you would just think that the movie you're about to display is as exciting as the previous airport think again!

The film has an impressive cast list, it is certainly observable at least,
