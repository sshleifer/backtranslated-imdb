Another film from a Swedish country that is always northern. If blacks showed up like that, they would be screams of racism and good reasons. This is a farce and you have to laugh at the "clever" clich√© of color. But it's usually tiring. Gangster comedy, with evil Russians (as always) and bad (and stupid) Finns. And of course, the stupidest thing is Norwegian, according to Stockholm's prejudice. Andreas Wilson is the only one trying to make a performance that reminds us of reality. It's not funny. It's not even exciting. Burlesque too raw to interest you in some way.
