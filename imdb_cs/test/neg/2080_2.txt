Tempest is based on classical Shakespeare's work of the same name, but bears little resemblance to its source material. It camouflages itself as being like a cerebral like its namesake, but instead is a messy, intricate, and hackneyed exercise right now. The original probed the assumption that people had an evil side that would be destructive if not controlled. Here you will just get an uninteresting middle life crisis (yawning) goof ball that has everything go wrong in his personal and professional life. It becomes the supernatural power it uses to try to control its environment; In other words, get on your own path. Every few minutes, after something in his poor life goes wrong, he finds himself in a secluded place and starts babbling "Show me the spell!" while waving his arms around and making the expression "serious concentration". From the way these scenes are shot, it looks like they're trying to turn bugs into other kinds of bugs. Maybe the spider turns into a cockroach, but you don't really care about it by this time. The story takes him away from life with his daughter on a Greek island and then has an unpleasant relationship with some girl he meets, one of the most horrible novels ever made. The story just sets and moves at a slower and slower pace. You have never received any reason to like or dislike you. I'll give it 2 because of the beautiful Greek shots and the semi-optimistic conclusion (although it's not clear whether the storm is bringing this end or not). The spirit of Shakespeare's work has been captured much better in other films; one notable example is the "Forbidden Planet," which gave confidence to how much gets out of control. As far as "Tempest" is concerned, his only magic is to treat insomnia.
