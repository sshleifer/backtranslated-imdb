Sadness was the feeling I felt when the screen went out. Another was confused. Why would two seasoned veterans like Matthau and Lemmon come to this rotten project? I'm under the impression that they didn't read the script before the cameras started to roll. All cast is useless, in this unreal, uninteresting and extraordinary film. It's sad that it was one of Edward Mulhare's last projects, here as heavy. Dyan Cannon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'connor lectures several lines loaded with profanity. (????). I'm not with "Legion of Decency." My point is that they were interpreted purely for the strangeness of listening to him using the color language. This is a desperate attempt to "humor" the image. In fact, he managed to bring only one bite of fun when he was groping on the dance floor. I'm saving my toughest criticism for leaders. Walter Matthau should know better. She still performs great solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character, though favorable, is rather boring and one-dimensional. He saw him once and saw him all. Jack Lemmon gives another of his trademarks, crying, "too damn sensitive" male portraits. When the mode starts, I want to tell him a box of tissue. OUT TO SEA is painfully indecent, and the one who made this mess should go through the board.
