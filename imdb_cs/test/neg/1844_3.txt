I'm usually a very generous IMDb voter and I don't bother to comment on movies that I didn't like, but that was just lame. Actually, I turned it off 15 minutes before I finished it to watch "This Is It" (because my gf wanted ... I chose the smaller of the two evils). If you want to watch this movie: Imagine this movie as a collection of horror stories that are worse than average, like "scary stories" found in the "Reading Digest" in the dentist's waiting room. > <br /> I didn't expect anything specific scary or funny, I'm not "I want to see blood!" - the type of person, but this "movie" is neither "horror" nor "comedy" or funny in any way. Otherwise: It's probably more scary / fun and fun to watch a movie poster "You Got Got Mail ‚Äùfor 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea. Conclusion: "Horror Comedy" for 4 to 7 year olds.
