Irwin Allen, the last film lock master, pulled out all the stops in VOYAGE TO BOTTOM OF SEA. The bad old Walter Pidgeon, who may actually be dead when he played this role, is the commander of an atomic submarine that must be in the size of the Empire State Building. Every room is huge and some even have no ceilings. In some of these rooms you can simultaneously mix and hold a formal ball. The sub, called Seaview, is on its first run when all hell is released: Van Allen's radiation belt catches fire, and Seaview has to launch the rocket into the belt for some time, or the world will sink in the flames of global warming! Together for the ride they are a bunch of really horrible actors, many borrowed from television. This makes them television hackers. The worst is probably Stella Stevens of a poor man, Barbara Eden, as a marine secretary, squeezed into too tight a dress, high high heels, and seemed to appear on the beach. Maybe it's because Frankie Avalon is on his way. Injured Joan Fontaine, almost unknowable, plays a visiting doctor with a great bad secret, but in fact who cares? VOYAGE is a really bad movie, apparently made for small children, but what a baby will sit on endless shots of a miniature Seaview model moving again and again from right to left across the screen in what is probably a studio tank? There is no scene in which we believe these people are actually aboard the sub. When Seaview shakes, the actors turn to themselves, sometimes in opposite directions. Just like the good old STAR TREK TV series when the bridge shakes. As I recall, neither a fish nor a sea creature can be seen - except for an octopus that snaps to a sub for a moment, a nod at 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. The octopus, if it was real, had about one foot and shows. Worse, when people stand at Seaview's glass nose, the ocean they're supposed to watch is obviously a close-up of the invisible air hoses that spout bubbles, probably shot in a fish tank. You've never seen larger bubbles in your life. Do you think these bubbles would break the damned pieces into pieces. Unfortunately, poorly aging Peter Lorre is also on the way. Near the end, when the rocket enters the flaming belt, Lorre is enthusiastically congratulating Pidgeon, while everyone else is waiting for their instruction to start shaking hands and embracing each other in victory. The only scene when I ever saw her. What a smelly. It's not even good for laughter. Stick to SILENT RUNNING.
