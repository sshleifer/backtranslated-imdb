Enter the Ninja (1981) was the first of several "Ninja" films produced by Cannon, who played the Japanese sense of Sho Kosugi. The star of the first film, "Ninja", was the legendary tough guy, Franco Nero. Unfortunately, neither Mr. Nero nor Sho Kosugi could watch this movie. When you have two bad dudes in an action movie and it's neither observable nor fun, it's something wrong. But I turn. Skip this chapter and watch other movies in the series. They are more interesting and have a lot of fun. Next is the Ninja Revenge. Instead of playing "evil oriental" (I use this term language in the face of the mind). It's a star! Special for Western film. Watch it instead. Not recommended for Die Hard Sho Kosugi fans or Cannon movie enthusiasts.
