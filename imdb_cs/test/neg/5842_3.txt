The mind is boring boring, completely predictable, and finally just ridiculous. This largely summarizes the catastrophe, which is a hateful suggestion. Beginning with a decent premise, the whole thing falls apart and becomes a complete mess. The story is basically reduced to the question, "Would you let your wife sleep with another man for a million dollars?" Of course, the answer is yes, because otherwise we wouldn't have a film. Frankly, we'd be better off not having a movie. Our couple (and financially concerned) couple play Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yeah, it'll work. Anyway, the billionaire played by Robert Redford wishes his wife and offers a million dollar. He gives them a financial security for one night with his wife. As a result, one night is what the movie really is about. Unfortunately, nothing in the sequel is a little fun. The script is so predictable that you can say lines of characters before doing so. The performances leave much to wish for. Harrelson would rather stick to the comedy because this attempt at serious action lacks a brand. Anguish is not something that seems to be able to portray. And it is quite safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to clear the space in her home for any Academy prize. Why is it a movie star again? There is nothing in the part that should be full of emotions. Only Redford mostly escapes unscathed. He is slimy but at the same time great and clearly the best bunch actor. But the movie can't save. Terrible scenario, lousy acting, moving pace, zero fun ... Indecent The proposal is terrible.
