I was a big fan of the original Enterprise crew from the age of eight. I watched all the movies and I appreciated each of what they kept from the old series and for the further development of the characters (and generally the Star Trek universe). Even in the "undiscovered land" I thought that the aging of the characters was well managed and a story worthy of a theatrical release. However, with the fact that "Star Trek V: Final Frontier" is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew. I agree with many that Kirk, Spock and McCoy's camaraderie is well done, but the overall screenplay, direction - William Shatner - and special effects aren't worth anything other than television episodes. This is a "buddy movie" and, at times, almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. Action sequences are not maintained and therefore generate little or no voltage. The dialogue is weak, though it provides some laughter, both intended and unplanned. Klingon seems like an idea. The whole concept of "Sha-Ka-Ree" is just stupid and Laurence Luckinbill, a great actor in everything else I've ever seen him, boarders on an absurd movie in this movie. The scene in which Sybok raises a picture of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain breaks the picture of the characters as we know them. Spock would never be a party to such stupidity, and McCoy, trying to save his father, is full of crazy, superfluous dialogue, and wastes DeForest Kelley's gaming skills. The whole scene is useless and really doesn't tell us anything and we don't want to see any of it. I understand that Shatner didn't have the luxury of working with ILM for special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight, but that doesn't allow such a bad story. In some ways, I think this story fits into the old series, but movies, including "Star Trek: The Picture", are much better than this. It's a pity that most other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. Focusing on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice, but the way it is used. The old crew seems to be of a nature. I liked the old General Klingon and Sultry Romulan at the bar. I liked some humor and the idea that Spock had a half-brother, but that's about it. If it was a TV episode, I would be able to accept a lot of mistakes. It's just a bad, uninspired film as a movie. It's also a shame because I want this movie to be good. Even if it were "Star Trek III", I'd like to, but this movie does all the other movies in this series as Shakespeare's works.
