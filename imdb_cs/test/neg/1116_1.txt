Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, I found this movie out of horror. It was a huge disappointment because it was cited as one of the eight Horrorfest films. I can only hope that the other seven were better. I was actually embarrassed by the friends I could convince to see, and they were the same friends I watched in the remake of The Wicker Man. He has every cliche in the book. In fact, it was out of the way to include them. Let's start with the characters. Instead of one young girl in distress, we get three: the only, hot mom with two daughters? A blooming but helpless teenager and a cute but scary little girl you just know will have "special" skills, including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The little girl is the same who was in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She was a little uncomfortable but not so uncomfortable with Dakota Fanning. Overall, these characters seemed like refugees from LifeTime. I thought that mountain scenes, where female characters go to bed in full makeup and run around in the dark, announce that horror movies are moving in the dark and announcing their presence to anyone with ears, but not this. I also consider it unthinkable that none of them could bother to open day and night the previous day. To give you an idea of ​​how I couldn't handle these characters, I spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must have been on the scene because they were all in the coat and in their homes and how white their teeth were. Despite all the formal conspiracy machinations, the film does not create any tension at all except that it will be over. There is more atmosphere at the local giant in the midst of the holiest everyday afternoon. As for the dialogue, I could choose samples from ten other films and put together a better, more believable discourse. Gore, the candy for horror fans, was at best minimal. Without their tiny weapons, 'zombies' weren't terrifying at all. You could probably kick a couple of them across the room. Horror movies, more than any other genre, cannot survive uninspired mediocrity. Give me a horror that is comically awkward or outrageous over the top with gore. I can even take the new ones with their irritation-inducing torture. Once in a while I would appreciate really scary, nothing but this.
