Why aren't there good reviews? Because this movie is hysterically bad. We are based in a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we have Jim Brown's hero, who is building a hysterically unbelievable racist officer as well as a hysterical way. Japanese officers brown nose Jim Brown's character. This is probably the worst movie of any of these actors. Stereotypes are not only abundant but dominate this film. The music of the sixties and seventies may be the best thing about film, maybe because it has nothing to do with film. <br /> <br /> It's even more difficult to sit back and enjoy mindless fun. This film is even more racist than the message of racism it seeks to achieve. And believe me, I was alive in the seventies and we thought crap like this was just as stupid. It was never popular.
