I mean really, really, really high and this movie has a chance to have fun. I don't mean regular high, I mean high where reading a phone book would put you in stitches. otherwise save time from your life and go with it something more constructive, like hitting your head on a brick wall and offending your own intelligence. A complete waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny, and Hamat Ham Master) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve (countless rappers who insist on movies). Not without being allowed to do so (chemical aid is decisive) and certainly not insulting politically overly sensitive (which I am always in favor of), but ultimately not worth the time of your life.
