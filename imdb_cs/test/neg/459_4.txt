Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote his name in blood and fire through the pages of maritime history. This is the story of the captain's captain, whose name for a short year hit horror in the hearts of sailors and merchants from the Caribbean ports to the London department stores ..... in one heck, imitation, pillage, movie ripper? It's not so. It's not completely worthless as a curiosity. Out of 20th Century Fox, Anne Of The Indies is edited by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Directed by Jacques Tourneur, the score is Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson provides a photo of Technicolor. Jean Peters is in the title title role of Anna (AKA Captain Providence) and support comes from Louise Jourdan, Debry Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez & James Robertson Justice. Originally supposed to be based on the real life of pirate Anne Bonny, the film ultimately turns out to be the story of a woman seeking identity and found in the predominantly male world of piracy and marine Shenanigan. The film is full of clich√©s and over known sets, the film also suffers from a casting that is largely omitted. Peters gives it good and Paget lights up the sparkling beauty screen. While Robertson Justice, although underused, actually looks like a part and does not go as much as the rest of the male cast. Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, purely because it's Tourneur in an overhead chair. But there is no depth, it is just a job for Tourneur, a professional who has been awarded, but his thin chart and actually lacking swash to go with a bucket in action bets. <br /> <br /> Available at best. 4/10
