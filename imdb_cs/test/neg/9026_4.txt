What a stupid movie. Although it looks nice, it doesn't make sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juan's "madness" was that she was just a woman before her time. On the other hand, he has an obsession that is right from the worst Victorian novel of a poor woman, and it looks like a mental problem like Miss Havesham at the castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would be if Elizabeth couldn't go through Essex's sexual appeal.
