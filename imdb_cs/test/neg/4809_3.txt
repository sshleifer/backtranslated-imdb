Adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude of being right and everyone else is wrong. He must be the center of attention and be foolish to do so. With her attitude she is sent to the school of magic. There he meets typical characters in today's cinema; nerd, clumsy, stepford housewife and sexual minority. Things happen and at the end, Adela "learns her lesson". The plot is trying to bear the deeper meaning of the state in which Adela is, but he cannot deliver (at least I didn't buy it). So what you have left is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you saw in a million movies. And the director seems to have a breast fixation, Adela flashes her goats several times, at least I don't see them relevant to the story. So the movie is fine, but if you're like me and you don't want to watch a teenager get angry people and do a U-turn the moment I thought was incredible, think twice before watching.
