This is easily the worst, most offensive piece of crap on TV. I'd like to ignore it altogether, but Fox stuck it in her Sunday lineup, which made me find something else that could be watched between American Dad and Family Guy. Dink-head male star guy is just about the least developed, pathetic apology for the guy I've ever seen on television. Nothing on the show is remotely funny and almost everything that has been done on it and much better by other shows. Obviously, their strategy is that it is in depth and hard on Sunday's schedule and hope. Someone likes it ... but I have to break it, Fox, that's a bad hole. The scam didn't work on me - I just look somewhere else - but come on, you freaks, this show scary SUCKS, and that's even worse compared to the rest of the Fox Sunday lineup. THEY CANCELED DEPENDED DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH BAND?
