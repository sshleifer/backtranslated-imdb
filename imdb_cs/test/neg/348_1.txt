Well, before you read it, CAN stop crying. This movie was so terrible that it was quite unpleasant. Creatures are a little cute, but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing link between the prisoners and their guards after they got to this daffy island. Even when she saw Barbara Bach with the hair that had spilled over her, there was no reward for buying this joker. She goes with a whisper that I never used - my voice - before she breathes, they just don't wash when someone shouts a bloody murder. (Hi, the leading man was cute too, but I'm still not angry.) This is a gaudy cocktail of Dr. Oole's good ole. Moreaua. Poor Richard Johnson, who was definitely born for better things, is just bad bad as a bad guy. I mean, how bad can a BAD guy? (Ask Richard Johnson). Joseph Cotten tries not to look embarrassed when he falls for his portrait. Do not rent this persecuted bomb in the name of all that is holy.
