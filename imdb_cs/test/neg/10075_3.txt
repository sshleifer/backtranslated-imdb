I was looking forward to this movie since Lost World. It didn't bother me that the Lost World was not as intellectual as the original, and here I was hoping only for a good monster. It was all about "dinosaurs eating people." However, it was also disappointing at this level. For starters, there weren't enough people to eat, and if I kept that secret, how many people ate it wasn't enough. Also, while there was no lack of diversity in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly "enough" dinosaurs. And many dinosaurs, such as spikey-back-and-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, just made portraits and didn't do much considering how cool they are. <br /> <br /> (START SPOILERS) Then there were Pterodactyls. The numbers I read give their body weight about 15 pounds, while the film made them look closer to 300. Worse, they didn't get to eat anyone, or even sprayed them on the rocks by dropping them from the height. Even the movie wasn't over, it was just a sudden credit. (END SPOILERS) I was wondering if the release I saw was missing 40 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion is that they taught Pterodactyls to steal their long beaks into their pockets and get your $ 7. Go rent a Carnosaur series; at least you won't be disappointed.
