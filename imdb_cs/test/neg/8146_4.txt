Froggie is upset she never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang try to fix it by offering him a surprise party. I didn't realize that all the decorations and preparations were all Froggy for him, just to find it too late for him. Bits work, but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where it is going, and because most of the humor needs to have some form of surprise to do the whole thing. I think in a strange way the film is just a little missing. Her type of thing they actually thought might mean more than failure. It's worth trying if you lower your expectations
