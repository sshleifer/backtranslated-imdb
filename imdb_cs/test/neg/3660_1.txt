I know that if I were a low budget filmmaker, I'd probably check this page to see what people are saying about it. So I really hope the filmmakers really read it! I think you should find a way to pay me for an hour and a half of the life I just watched. Please stop making movies about something you dream about. Stop making movies together ... you're one of the reasons it's so hard for Indian filmmakers. Do the world a favor and get a McDonalds job or something to do something productive with your life! I feel like a challenge to complain that they actually carried this film in their shop.
