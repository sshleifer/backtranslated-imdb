Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, I mentioned horrible, you can only say that the DVD cover doesn't take this movie, but unfortunately it wasn't the case for me. And when I looked at it, I just wanted to strangle a person because they used my money. I'm sure I'll take it back soon, but I can tell you when I have it in mind because I definitely want to forget it. This film doesn't deserve to be called horrible. It's beyond the horrible. Acting was so, so terribly disgusting, just as death is so extraordinarily lame and predictable. I didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was, what kind of scares me a bit. looking at this movie page, and i have EXTREME pity for you if you are looking at this movie page because you think it will be DECENT.Final word: YUCK !!!!!!!!!!
