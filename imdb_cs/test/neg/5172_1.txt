Oh, dear, just what we need another Essex-Cockney garbage effort recording the rise of the British footy hooligan / rave gangster, which of course followed West 'am (East Londan / Essex style). Didn't anyone tell you they won the world cap? And then, of course, the inevitable decline in the underworld of British rave culture. Blah blah blah. Why, how and who would like to fund a movie like this, I don't know, but let's pray that it was from private financiers (allowing to see former drug dealers, business bankers - we all know what to tell them, and the rest of the dummies) than funds publicly funded. Hopefully, we do not perceive the recession again. If we do, we'll call death knell for British movies and of course we'll all be able to blame the British Mockney Country gent wannabee gangster Guy Ritchie.
