Go get your camcorder, your little brother, and the disturbing neighbor next door, who throws boiling water at the raccoons; and you got a movie! Well, that's what these boys thought anyway. It was so bad I can't even remember most of them except for flashbacks comparable to someone who traveled in 'Nam. Despite being a truly demanding title, terrible quality, terrible actors and clich√©s, I think this movie is not the worst I've ever seen. I save the slot for everything with Steven Seagal, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Ladies. As well, if you are out of options when it comes to finding new "horror" movies that you haven't seen 1000 times already, (as I was) and you're discussing this, continue to skip this. she had absolutely no redemption qualities. This fake serial killer thriller was a weak, appalling attempt to even B movie. If they are really lucky they would be wal-mart $ 4.50 bin. but I doubt it very much.
