Did doodoo earn awards? They had to be desperate to award something. This film melts from a tiny bopper and that made me sick. Fortunately, I watched him next to Mike MST3K and the boots, so it was bearable. Terrible gameplay, disturbing mother / daughter moment, stupid assumption if you want a bad movie here it is. Be warned when you watch with Mike and shoes or you will suffer. 1 out of 10. I still can't believe he won the prize, and the director defends this * && ^ $$ # $ ^ && piece ^% ^% $ ^ $ #% @ $ # @ movie!
