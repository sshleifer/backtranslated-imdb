This film as the first KSA movie should be active for their people and show them a good thing. Otherwise, we see that Rotan's cast wants to show people in Saudi Arabia as a Terrorist and stupid, in fact they are not very calm and smart. He is no less good about the director. The grandfather in the film is much younger than the father. And the girls who, by the way, do not make the Saudi Republic, show our girls a playground that seeks people to meet their needs. Hasham was just another piece of furniture when he didn't do anything he could imagine only when he told his lover that I love you and yell at my friend that he doesn't talk to strange girls >>>>>>> really funny or so stupid /> <br /> The father did not just move to watch this movie and did not feel like one of the actors and the only word he said "A5zo Al Shai6an". Weird Thing in this movie is when girls were placed in a family restaurant, there was a voice behind a young man talking to his friends "kiss me" many times >>>>> It's so in Saudi Arabia when girls and boys grow up good and muslem not bitches and adulterer. Any Saudi my patriot does not allow her heart to see this stupid movie
