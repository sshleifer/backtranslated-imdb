Not bad enough to make it pleasant. In fact, it's just boring. It's pretty well done, even if the scenario is bad, the effects are fine and the acting average. (Except James Mason, who is always great, but in this underrated) I suppose it's hard to write something about this movie because it didn't cause me any reaction. br /> <br /> Dull, boring, boring, boring, boring.
