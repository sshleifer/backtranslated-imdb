Do I need to say more? The reason why the good Australian version of Kath and Kim was, as mentioned, good, was because it was a funny humorous originality. The reason this new American version is so terrible is that much of it is taken directly from the original. Not to mention the infidelity of the characters. Kath is supposed to be dag. Kim's supposed to be fat. Kel (or Phil as they dubbed him) is meant to be pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is to be defeated, not a man who acts like him on heroin and finishes every sentence with 'dude'. Thank God Szubanski didn't sell her rights to Sharon, she probably ends up being a tall, slim blonde who likes Kim. Kath and Kim are mother and daughter. They are not meant to look after two years. And they're not meant to giggle like school girls. This show is a shame even to share the same title as the Australian version. America: get your own TV shows.
