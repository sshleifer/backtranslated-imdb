I can't understand why anyone would allow the director to put the drone on the celluloid. This movie has already been made by at least two others that were better than this ("Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - 1941, and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). The only cost-saving factor for figure skating fans might be some nice skating done by professional casting skaters, but that just won't happen. The closest thing that viewers see is that Tara Lipinski turns on ice for a moment. Others like Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stojko are hidden in the background and do not do any figure skating at all. There is not much real emotion and there is really no reason to tune in to this apparently made film. My advice: rent an original.
