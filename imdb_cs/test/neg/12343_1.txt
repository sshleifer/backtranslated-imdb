11 years after this film was released only 5 people reviewed here on IMDb. There is a reason for this utter disinterest in the Moon. It is coherent but lacks all the film's virtue. Check out this movie for examples of terrible production in all respects. Opening credits are for example white letters growing mechanically from a red background. The final features Michael McKean stared out of the prison window and said, "There's a lot of secrets." followed by a clip of montage / music video of all uplifting moments in a tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything in between is terrible. I tried to find some value in this movie and I came empty. Even though it's hard to believe, the portrait role from Burgess Meridith (always a crowd of pleasure) has made me even more disappointed. This film is a derision of what is special about movies. On paper, the film is below average. Women living together in a trailer. But what was actually made was almost unnoticeable. The film attempts to turn in many ways, but never goes through any. An unpleasant conflict when their friends are in jail is never resolved. No conflict is ever resolved. There is no conflict. Women are trying to be hookers, but that never happens. Instead, they get a job as a bartender and a warehouse worker. Sound exciting? It was not. It was stupid. And the biggest part of the film are two women who talk and create a fictional conflict. Women are capable actresses, but the scenario was wrong. Unnecessary. This was a horrible movie, but it is even worst that it bored Burgess Meridith from his retirement home to do it. Bad from start to finish. Like a lion-free lion, this film has no bite.
