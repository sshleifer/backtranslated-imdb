First of all, I mean, I'm liberal at political level and I've found a film offensive. I managed to watch the whole stupid movie. This film brings low to original ideas. Yes, it was original, so my 2 stars instead of 1. Are our film writers that creative that they can just come up with it? The acting was terrible and the characters were largely unlikely. The leading lady in the story had no good features at all. They made her a bad guy and I didn't even see it. Maybe I missed something, I don't know. It was the most on the ground, the relevant character in the film. I didn't make any money on this waste. I almost want PETA to rescue this terrible, offensive film and make a protest. ANSWER this is all I have to say!
