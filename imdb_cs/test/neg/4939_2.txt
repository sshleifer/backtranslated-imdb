Hi, today I watched this movie because of the middle (5.6) IMDb rating. I thought it would be worth it. Also comments here were quiet, but after starting to watch this movie, I quickly realized that this movie is not so close to 5.6! It's just boring. You can describe a movie with some words as well as its standard horror story with all the standard horror scenes. I don't know why people still like the movies or why they choose such movies better than 1-3 in IMDb. Just a few examples <br /> <br /> A bunch of people coming from somewhere or going anywhere. Somehow, strange people meet on their way, but hey maybe they are just nice, so they roam with them. Then there is a very important scene for every horror movie "Oh my cell phone doesn't work oh oh my too .. it's weird but we don't need them so get our ride ..." uhhhhhh our weird person is weird psychopath better we all sit and scream for a while before she starts cutting parts from us or killing some of us. After a while, a game of victims takes a weapon or a chance to escape from never thinking about escaping or even killing a psychopath if they get a chance to talk about what to do until the psychopath gets his handful. The standard tricks they got in those movies and all ran back as usual ... Screaming ... Killing Even More ... Oh and finally it really pours out Sometimes a bad guy sometimes wins some victims can escape wow great movies. ... OK, if I've never seen a movie of this kind I'd say it's a movie that can be watched, but if someone has ever seen a movie of its kind, it should be just a boring waste of time, because almost everything in the movie, than you even watched it because it always runs as a standard horror movie thematically. ... mmm maybe is there any Windows program? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? You can just pull some settings buttons and get a new Shuttle, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers kind of movie.
