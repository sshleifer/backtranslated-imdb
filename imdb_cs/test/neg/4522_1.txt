Get Smart should be called Get Stupid. There is no funny line or gag in the whole movie. This movie is so bad that making Austin Powers movies look like Shakespearean. Several such movies and Steve Carell can kiss their farewells. As for Anne Hathaway, what is she doing in this movie? She's a good actress, but she's just awful. Writing is pathetically lame. There's no funny, clever or funny line. There's no good gag look. The director is terrible. Comedy relies on timing. Someone should tell the director. Every line to be humorous (and not) comes with the very worst sense of comic timing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 0 stars
