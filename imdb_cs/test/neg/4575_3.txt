Before I speak my piece, I would like to make a few things clear: 1) I am a cat who is not on the cub ("Kate & Leopold" and "Someone Like You" are EXTREME exceptions - Hugh Jackman's ass). 2) I just chose it because I'm a fichtner fangirl who was looking forward to seeing him in the bathtub. 3) I'm not a Demi fan, although I think her performances in "Immortal" and "A Few Good Men" were noble and deserved places in my vid library - I also think he's a little crazy (in no way will be sleeping) w / Brucie). When it comes to studying the nature of unfulfilled women living double lives of independence and happiness, then I would say we have one narcoleptic melodrama. Marty: Literary agent. Gives a six-digit salary. He lives in a luxury penthouse in Manhattan. Easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for some highly recommended night leaks. Or maybe go through an interdisciplinary portal? Has a career, appearance, cool car, great pad, now where are the men and children? In the steps of our boy Aaron - some real escape. What are architects? They are artists who can do math, sprigs who make real money. Aaron gives Marty a dream of safety and fills the void where, apparently, he has no confidence. On the other side of the coin is Mary, who still lives out of her imagination when she speaks out of motherhood. . Her children are her career and life. But what about Mary, exists only through her children? In waltzes William, a Parisian alien who helps her focus on one thing she has lost contact with: herself. The supposed way of self-discovery and the late advent of age thrown in some with anxiety and Some hatred towards Marty's own mother / Mary. It gets 3/10. All I could say is thank God for the BPL multimedia division, I wouldn't want to waste $ 2.99 on the sensation in this case, give it to Harlequin Blaze.
