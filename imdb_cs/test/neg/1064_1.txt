There is nothing original, humane or bright in this film. Acting is average, the images are amateur, the font lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic ... something close to soap. At 2: 37 suicide is used to turn the film into a thrilling drama. We're watching, partly because we want to know who's dying. Individual characters have every problem and the film shows how bad each problem is for them, but only as a way to get everyone to where you think they could kill. Despite the different views the camera offers on key events, NEVER another way to see events alone. So at 2:37 there are arseholes arseholes, angels are angels. This is a simple matter. Without this complexity, the film will appear as a voyeuristic story of youth and violence. You can hardly get to know the children as well as the breasts, bodies and limbs that the filmmaker floats as a characteristic. Finally, if you know anything about the film in the last 5 years, 2: 37 is just an immature stroke of the Elephant - not meditation, not progress. While the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend in every chance to get the film legitimate, he never talks about Gus Van Santa or Elephant. Positive contributions to IMDb are curiously avoiding any mention of this fact or simply not evaluating originality. If you want something with heart and voice - avoid this youth exploitation. I was surprised by film ages when I found out I saw this movie - I assumed it was 13 years old. Twenty Somethings I have always known is too busy trying to express something real about them to give up the old man's work.
