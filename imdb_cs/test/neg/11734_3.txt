The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely regarded as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and is certainly, in my opinion, one of the best films of all time. So the decision to shoot a draw is a bit mysterious. The cast in the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live on. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not the best choice for leadership. He's a very handsome boy and he's not very convincing as Bates. I can imagine actors like Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro doing a much better job in this role. Anne Heche as Marion Crane deserves a good job, but she still mentally compares her to Janet Leigh. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than she shows here, and Viggio Mortenson is just going through her role. The best of this new cast is William H. Macy as a private detective. Although director Gus Van Sant does an acceptable job, he can't build the tension as Hitchcock did. And why did he change the scene in the basement? In the original, the atmosphere is dark and damp and closed, while in this version it runs in a brightly lit lab environment. And I think the black and white photo of the original has a clear advantage over the color version. Maybe another mistake could be the fact that most viewers saw the original and knows what happens and when. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that it's not broken, don't fix it. <br /> <br />
