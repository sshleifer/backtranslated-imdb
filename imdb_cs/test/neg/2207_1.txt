I'd rather cut someone's eyeballs with a razor blade than look at this movie again. I watched it from start to finish and I thought it couldn't get any worse. Writers and producers should be crazy about bringing this kind of crap on TV. The actors are all terrible. Get out of Hollywood, you're crazy, and go to work at McDonalds sweeping floors and emptying garbage. Anyone who thinks this movie is even remotely decent should be suspended. They are human embarrassment. Thinking we have soldiers who give their lives on the line for anyone who produces this kind of human waste. She makes me feel embarrassed to say I'm American.
