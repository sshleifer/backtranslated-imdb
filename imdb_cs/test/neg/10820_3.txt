The mission to see the movie "Cave" was my friend's dream after witnessing a very dramatic trailer, full of glimpses of creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and nothing else. It's too bad that the movie hasn't changed much before the trailer did it. The instant glamor of a movie like this is a creature. What will it look like? Why does he live in a cave? How is this different from the other creatures we've shown in movies like Alien and Predator and Relic? The "demons" cave does not look far from the skeletal creature in the Alien: Resurrection and even look at the Predator. Too bad it is a complete excuse ... Well, let's look at the conspiracy: very confusing and jumps on more and more unlikely twists, because a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its inhabitants in the Carpathian mountains. Casting was very clear that we wanted young, hips, hard chickens, carved boys and girls who have brains must also be hot. If viewers believe that filmmakers are interested in a certain perspective, we must also have one of each racial background. It was all done, and I'm tired of it. Another major problem was the end, as if to say it could be a sequel. Piss me off if there's one. Tagged at the end frightened me. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points he received were more or less points for recognition by the creators for their high-quality costumes and design work for the monsters dwelling inside, even though they seemed totally ripped off. There is also an interesting (still working) document on the underwater cave diving DVD. Look at this only if you like new creatures of monsters and creatures, but be warned that you probably saw this movie before and it was the first time.
