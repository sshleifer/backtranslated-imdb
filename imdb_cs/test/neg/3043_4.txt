This film had the potential to be a good little middle thriller. Instead, we had a good holiday on a stupid, spoiled guard. The problem was that there were too many unnecessary things. Fight with a friend, random friends come to kill. It was obvious that it was just killing time. The main character was bland and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no emotions during this movie. There she was. Another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat. The children will survive, so Jill will survive. The only reason it was four was that the last ten minutes (when the FINALLY killer comes out) is really exciting. <br/> <br/> 4/10
