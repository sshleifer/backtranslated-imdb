This movie comes from the same name that took place in the Long Running ITV sitcom. Sitcom took about half a decade and brought Rigsby, Phillip, Alan, Mrs. Jones and Vienna to our screens. The film version hit Cinemas.Now, when she did, unfortunately Richard Beckinsale died and was replaced by Jen when I laughed at actor Chris Strauli. I myself felt it gave the film a different feeling. They preferred it if it wasn't shot like Richard was a key character. It's like having a mushy movie without Godber or Mackay! The movie had some classics moments for sure, but it felt a little De-Ja-Vu! Many parts have been seen in the TV series. Now that you've seen the movie first rather than the series you'd get a different feeling about then the fan series! Say Leonard is definitely on top of the form and makes the movie just like on TV The film has recently had a new life on DVD and is usually on Terrestrial over a quiet weekend.It is a cracked good movie but for Rigsby fans, you may feel like you've seen it before. He says that even if it's worth buying <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
