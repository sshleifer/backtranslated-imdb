There is somewhere here that is decent if the routine SF story. This is thwarted by several factors. First, the actor is just terrible. Even competent actors are terrible. The dialogue is wooden and embroidered. The story can be predicted. It seems less than a finished film than a walker. Extremely disappointing.
