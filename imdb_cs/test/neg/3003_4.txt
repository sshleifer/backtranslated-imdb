"What symbolism!" the woman cried as we stepped out of the theater after seeing Polish brother Ingmar Bergman. Some symbols are fine. But not much. "Northfork" adds to some subtle acting attenuated by harsh cinematography that makes no coherent statement and confused story that rather teases rather than miracles. Northfork is a city that faces the extinction of a new hydroelectric dam. It is a beginning to the mid-1950s and a team of identically dressed state agents, all looking as if they have just responded to the call for casting "Untouchables" to relocate defiant residents who have not appreciated both their immediate dangers and the remuneration for moving. . An exciting anti-development film is always an option, but let's realize: rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in providing decent living and a strengthened economy in American history. Can dams be built without forced relocation? Not in this country. But this film is less about homeowners than about the fantastic creation of a dying boy's escapist fantasy. Nick Nolte is a priest who tends to the boy and much of what he says might be interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear it. Changing between the black suits of evacuation agents (working for the "Lakefront") "The land where the dam creates this valuable area" and a fantastic collection of weirds, the film does not develop either a motive, nor a coherent or interesting one. <br /> <br /> The camera is bad. The washed, muted and depressed color penetrates the whole film into a small dramatic sense. There's no reason for this huge terrain to be so bleak. Indeed, the contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and gloomy strength of the developing dam and power stations would be very effective. <br/> <br/> 4/10.
