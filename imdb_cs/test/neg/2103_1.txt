There are spoilers, but believe me, I'm doing you a favor. <br /> <br /> My friends and I like to watch bad movies so often. Inspired by Mystery Science Theater and our ability to make jokes on the spot; We set out to look for films that are worth watching and which are really ... not worth watching. However, problems come to paradise when these films can only be found when you buy them. And I am firmly convinced that I will not give a single cent to such a group of talented junkies. So, as another reviewer said, movies like this are the reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized. I prefer the idea; Instead of direct on VIDEO you have the INTERNET directly. In this way, the buttocks who made this trouble never show a profit. What unfortunately you know. They hire a lot of actors who can't act, special effects from the high school classroom, the rubber snakes you can get in a dollar store, the constant vomiting of green jokes, and the two main characters that seem to cross the border. Jumping Mexicans who speak only Spanish to make Arabs stand 100% fluent in English, random nudity, the guy is shot as 10 times, including one on the head side and the lively and busiest end in film history, books, cave drawings and the hustler magazine. The fact that I actually predicted that a joking snake girl would actually be a TRANSFORM into a snake in the middle of a terrifying storyline ... <br /> <br /> By the way, the movie is great to make fun of it, but You have to make sure that you have at least 4 of you and you all spit on fast fire jokes, because if you are even 1 second watching this movie where you don't laugh in the ass, you'll feel physically ill. No no. My friends and I ate chicken wings and now I can't even look at this thing without reminding this piece of Sh! T. <br /> <br /> This movie is above us Alien Vs. Hunter, who is by far the second worst movie ever made. I've seen a lot of bad movies. By the way, it's the same manufacturing company as this movie and the bald guy is in both. He just thought you'd like to know that it's a little fun. -100 out 0f 10.
