I rarely get motivated to write a review unless it's inspired by the quality of the film. In the case of Comanche Moon, I was so uninspired that I felt the need to warn others how bad this television mini series was. Here are some thoughts. Indians: They heard as if they were on Saturday's live skate, so they're kidding about how the Indians are talking. It is so interesting when McMurtry writes a dialogue in his novels; I'm not sure how they ended up with what they got. Gus McCrae: Looks like Festus from the old Gunsmoke series. Acting is fine and the McCrae Robert Duvalla manners are fine, but the look is purely a comedy cowboy. Clara: Maybe you could use a little dirt or sweat next time. Have you ever been to Austin in summer before air conditioning? I promise women didn't look like that. Do you think they have never seen any Dearwood episodes? Gov. Elisha Pease: Once again, when they're in the governor's office, they feel like a live scene on Saturday night, and the parody is bombing. Woodrow Call: Calling is the most adequate character, of course He speaks as little as you can spoil? But hey, what about the hat? Blue Duck: See above and include the fact that he's not even scary. They should have Javier Bardem to play this role. Rangers: Straight from "About Brother, Where is Thou Art" I expected George Cloony to come on horseback and they break into a song. br /> <br /> Maybe I'm premature because the miniseries isn't finished, but I doubt I'll look at it differently. I wouldn't expect anyone to duplicate Lonesome Dove's fascinating feeling, but I watch it, and they don't seem to feel like it was an old West at all.
