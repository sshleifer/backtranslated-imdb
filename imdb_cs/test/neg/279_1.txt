I have read the newspaper reviews of this movie and I must say that my expectations were very low before I watched the 12th Oceanic Show. I rated it a lot as the 5 best films I've ever seen. Why do I say that? Above all, it's a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like a perfect action thriller. Fragments that could be assigned the term "story" is loosely held together at a time, but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive. The whole story seems to be forced, and the story-telling scenario is forced to become a farce sometimes. The most embarrassing are the top ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) who either play or are extremely simple. Neither Damon, Clooney nor Pitt are great. To be honest, I don't understand how they want to be associated with something as bad as this movie. <br /> <br /> === Can contain spoilers ==== Camera and editing, sigh where I should start. There are many unnecessary camera movements that only make the experience painful. Combine it with incredible finishes and start looking for a wooden spoon to cut your heart. Especially the scene where the whole gang is moved from prison to drive him by car. Camera zoom on every person just bored and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message: wow you are cool and can make simple zoom effects - no. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny, but it's very embarrassing and you turn away to avoid mess. Bruce Willis. Why? Explain it to me please! Why ??? <br /> <br /> To summarize ... if you have a choice between root channel work and Ocean 12 observation I recommend the former. Make sure they do all their teeth when you're on it ...
