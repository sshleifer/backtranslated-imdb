This movie contains 2 well-known actors I enjoyed watching before. The events are great and every action feels like a heart. But it occurred to me that these two were first thrown into the classroom / drama class at the university and said that one would act to dominate and confine itself to the other side of the room without leaving it and the woman should be really innocent and heal Her enough mind-jumping to drive viewers into tears for her release. The only good part is the acting ability, the plot has the same ruse as Hitler's influence and I started hating the protagonist for that. But all this, in my opinion, could have been done within 15 minutes, so that it was over an hour, it was just pure punishment for all who watched it. <br /> <br />
