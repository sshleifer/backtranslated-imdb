"Thunderbolt" is probably Jackie Chan's worst movie by "The Protector" in 1985. Yes, I know his movies are not being observed for his stories, but the rendering of this movie is unusually lame, even by his standards, and while his standards, the battle scenes (all two of them) are destroyed, as other frenetic, disturbing cameramen have already mentioned. Even the most serious Jackie Chan fans shouldn't really bother with this offensive, unfortunate, stunt waste. Anita Yuen's cute and energetic performance is one of the few advantages. For a good "serious Jackie" movie I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
