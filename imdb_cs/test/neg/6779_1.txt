The problem with this - and all the movies in the Vietnam War - is that they are too biased. Antiwar movies overlook the fact that the vast majority of US soldiers were heroes, while Prowar films ignore the fact that many soldiers actually committed atrocities, as in this film. This movie is upset. It is time for a film that is neither prowar nor antiwar, neither liberal nor conservative, but COMPLETE DANGEROUS.
