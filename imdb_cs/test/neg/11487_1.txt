It will be hard to make it fill 10 lines .... But try it wrong (just to prevent others from making the same mistake as I - watch this (horrible and boring) movie. <br /> <br /> I like Patrick Swayze - he has done excellent performance in movies like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South, but in this movie ..... ARGH .... This movie is so booooooring, playing is awful - the scenario sucks - well .. i can't even find ONE good thing, nothing, absolutely nothing, i watched it with two other friends and we all agreed that it was one of the boring movies we ever had. The fact that it takes more than 3 hours (which we didn't know) - when Part 1 was over and it was said to "continue", we almost cried "nooooooooooooo, we need to watch 90 minutes more of this movie !!!!". His painful look at this movie: You are not getting d at any time the feeling that the actors are Russians, the action scenes are very bad when the trolley explodes at the beginning of the movie! The rest is CRAP! Clean your toilet instead of watching this movie (and don't run, cry if you see this movie - you were warned beforehand!) Personally, I would recommend Patrick Swayze to call his agent and have this film reminded of him - so bad.
