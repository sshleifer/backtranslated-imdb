This movie is special, even for a silent movie. Basically, there is an adventure about the engineer in revolutionary Russia who dreams of going to Mars. In this film, the producers seem to know that the Communists actually dug the earth, but it also seems to want it to look like they've done something good. Then we get to "The Martian Scene, where everyone on Mars wears goofy hats." They have revolutionized after being inspired by Earth Men, but are quickly betrayed by the queen who party with them. Except it's just a dream or it is. (And since the Russian Revolution will eventually lead to Stalin's dictatorship, you're wondering if it was all allegory.) <br /> <br /> I saw GOOD Russian Cinema now. For example, Eisenstein's battleship Potemkin is a good movie. It's just, stupid.
