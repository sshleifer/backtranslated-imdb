My gosh, this film was nothing but filming by numbers. A struggling salesman can't do it in New York, a mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing, a fighting salesman moves to California and makes it big, then loses it, then comes back with a simple life, then hits the rock bottom and tries to get back to the top. I don't think I remember any part of the land that took more than five seconds. A Case at the Point (Spoiler?): When John Kapelos's character calls him and his girlfriends to come to Santa Cruz to visit, and James Woods says there is virtually no chance of coming, did you know with 100% confidence that another scene is coming or two. On the other hand, Sean Young certainly looked good.
