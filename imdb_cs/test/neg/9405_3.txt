I just watched 2FTM. The trailers caught my attention so much that I looked at the opening weekend, something I would never do. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it is frustrating to see how it breaks. I feel the movie problem was directed and Matthew McConaughey. I'm not MM hate at first, I thought it was amazing in both the Reign of Fire and the Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in these movies without having to see him with his shirt 3-4 times. Yes, we all thought it was a good-looking guy with a nice body, but I think most people knew it ten years ago when it came to the scene in A Time to Kill. Showing him with a shirt of pumping iron as a sweaty lunatic 3-4 times in the movie is absolutely unnecessary. I think it would be enough once. I wouldn't be surprised if they threw useless scenes, so girlfriends and wives would be willing to mark with their prominent others, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling unless ... let's go into his role. I feel that his acting performance has been very forced and it doesn't seem to be very comfortable. I know his character was supposed to be this charming Southern, but his lines were sloping and curvy. It was almost as if he were referring to days and confused lines several times! In short, I didn't like his character even though I did. Accent, his shirts, oblique lifting lines, weak sales pitches. His character was just too big a tool like Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but it's no surprise. Piven is fun to watch like Arie .... oooops I mean Jerry. I feel that this film was very commercial and poorly assembled. It's offensive that they might have a great story, and plunge into crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. 1. A cool story that appeals to a male man 2. Hunky Hollywood actor for women women (make sure he has many scenes with his shirt off lifting weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 big speech scenes, and 25 great one inserts 3. Each Character must be dressed in thousands of dollars and have extremely dark tan. 4. Jeremy Piven plays the same character as he did in Entourage and Old School. 4. Throw Armand Assante to make a deal 5. Fence, good writing, character development, and smart casting is unnecessary <br /> <br /> That will be good enough for most people, but not me! Anyone who disagrees with me will ask you about this. It will be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM <br /> <br /> I will probably be part of a minority in the thought of this film. I realized this when the woman beside me began to cry during the absurd ending Pacina scene, which shed a false tear and hugged Russo. The financial success of this film will do one thing. The film goes public gets what the film goes public wants, a great budget crapola.
