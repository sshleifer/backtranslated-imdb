Legend of pornography Gregory Dark controls this cheesy horror that Glen Jacobs (Kane of WWF / WWE / whatever he calls today) in his film debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a blind serial killer who is responsible for human eyes. The storyline, whatever it may be, has a group of troubled young people cleaning up a historic hotel that houses GoodKnight and then offending it. It's not Hemmingway. It starts as a fun dopey B-movie, but soon it becomes too boring to be enjoyable. I'm glad I went with quite low expectations, but they weren't even fulfilled. How can you have king porn directing and still suffer from lack of nudity ??? for shame. <br /> <br /> My class: D- <br /> <br /> Candy's eyes: Samantha Noble briefly holds back
