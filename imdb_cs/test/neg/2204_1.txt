This movie is such a piece of incredible crap. First let me talk about professionals: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit. The rest of the story, which is pretty bad. We said computer programmer Angela Bennett (who's online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY! I bet the directors are excited about that in one hour) who basically checks the software of another company for errors / glitches etc. So let's start with Her ordering pizza on the internet and then putting on the fireplace on the monitor (EXTREME computer skills showed so far). This is after finding some virus in the macintosh program that crashes the entire system after pressing a key to escape. This is probably a huge problem, but the virus created to it could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file. Every event, we go on. She gets this call from some other bloke (it works with the same company) and this fool says to go click on this symbol, which apparently opens some secret internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected 'top secret' woohoo data! Angela puts the crap on the disc and now the people who created this gap are ready to get it. This is, of course, only after he joins one of the bad guys before he tries to kill her before he jumps into the ocean from a boat before returning to a random hospital. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: You cannot create a niche on the Internet to gain access to a lot of secret FBI data. Where the hell did it come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic Internet flow (even in 95)? Problem 2: Angela would need proper identification before the hospital or clinic release her. You couldn't just pack things and go. Then these "hackers" or anything will change Angel's ID so she can't get help from anyone and good enough that her ID is gone. So he returns home and chases cats and mice on and on and on and on. Apparently all the police and FBI people are stupid and don't trust her. So he has to use a lot of tactics to enter the building where he works (where he is the person who fills it now) and return to his old computer. He starts talking to some other random block and finds out who is behind all the BS IP address that the director knows that the audience is stupid enough to believe. this information will be provided by the FBI. She probably has to use the mainframe to email the FBI case. But then the same fool who tried to kill her before he threw her into the water caught her and easily stuck into the FBI (wtf?). But remember the cool virus? Fortunately, she gets it, and even though the virus only worked on software, it now works on the whole system. This will knock the whole mainframe, which has all the fake information, because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of a convention ... WHAT'S SO COVERING! Currently, uber virus is working and Angela (right now) is running away and later killing the bad guy with the fire extinguisher. Of course he has a gun, he runs to her, so he is two meters away and then decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is full of BS and stupid. Anyone who doesn't know much about computers will be wildly confused when they think this is possible, but one thing is not accurate when it comes to computers or networking. And frankly I doubt that I would see a cross-platform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (* LMAO * cough).
