This movie is really bad. Hero cannot play. You see too much to learn how his movement moves around the heart. And believe me, they go a lot. Nothing happens for 45 minutes. It goes to places and gets out ..... As if the story was so short that it had to be expanded by adding useless and boring scenes "looking like and overhead". <br /> <br /> Dialogs are very bad. I counted a lot of "hi" and a few "hang" on the first part. Blood is orange as Merkurochrom, who put on baby blisters. And scenes are not tracked by themselves. Bloody neck on the scene, clean neck in the following place. <br /> <br /> The story could be improved. Yeah, I mean, what the hell is that story? <br /> <br /> Martial Arts? Where? Is it martial arts? Watch how hesitant and slow the moves are !!!!! If you put a kick and you receive a punch called martial arts, then I'm Bruce Lee !!!! The only good point I found is on the battlefields. fast switching of scenes that gives you headaches in most action movies. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of low budget movies that are great. This one was just making money. Nothing else.
