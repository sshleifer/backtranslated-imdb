I was a huge "SNL" fan back in Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner and many other unforgettable stars. But every time I tried to follow it in the last ten years or so, I was very disappointed and sometimes disgusted. Ten years ago, I believed that the show could not survive because it was so totally free of humor that I could understand and still connected, which I always appalled and wondered about how the world could find his lame humor funny . Whenever I tuned in the last decade, I was never glad I did it. I've always been angry with myself for staying and losing time. For me the absolute low point came a few years ago when a popular young male actor I liked a lot of guest guest. At one point that night he played a big star, maybe himself, and in a parody, the character "Mongo", I think Chris Kattan played, again, I think he ended up in the back seat of the car with him. What followed was Mongo forced up and down and up and down on the actor's lap. Viewers laughed at heads and I shook my head, overwhelmed that they could find that remotely funny, amazed that NBC would even have such things. In the years since then, I have repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind, hoping it could regain the sense of humor that I have loved for so many years. But only a week ago it didn't do it for me. Not close. One exception: During the 2008 presidential campaign, I thought Tina Fey was fantastic, and she was the only performer to keep me tuned. and I would always regret not turning it off as soon as I heard the friend "It's Saturday night !!!"
