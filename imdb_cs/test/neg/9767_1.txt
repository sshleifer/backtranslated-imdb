This movie wasn't good at all. I was able to capture it at the film festival and I didn't appreciate the content I had to watch. It is a well-made film about a family that wants to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (Gabrielle Union). the film plays Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle's brother. Actually, Gabrielle Union portrayed a woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was older sister Billy Dee Williams. It had to be Billy Dee William's worst performance in his career, ever. He looked like he didn't remember his lines in several scenes. It was a relentless, barely ever empathetic character that had begotten a daughter while he married a white woman with whom he had a daughter. Two daughters are now older, and while the daughter he had with the white woman (Lucy) tried to contact him, his other daughter didn't want anything to do with him. Billy Dee's character was so pathetic that the only way to get him to fly from Paris to his sister's funeral was to tell him that the funeral had passed and his late sister left him responsible for paperwork. Why did they have to deceive him? Because he didn't like to attend funerals. I know. You ask, "but he also didn't want to attend his own sister's funeral?" Yes! He claims he does not like being around forced feelings of emotion that are shared among people who pay their respect. He had nothing to do with it. Now is it supposed to get into it? The rest of the movie was flat with equally flat characters. The director and editor did not care to make the film move. Watching memories was painful. It was a bad movie. But it seems to be the most popular at black film festivals; a film that celebrates the dependence of Africans and Americans on whites to find love they can cope with, even if it is a healthy relationship. When lame love stories like this win the best festivals at black film festivals, I am challenged by the blacks' judgment on the film. At the same festivals, the only award-winning films are educational films about African-American culture and black films by Caucasus directors. I'm not saying there's something wrong with the white person who drives stories written for people of color. The problems with these films are that they never mentioned both aspects, which are usually films that actually talk to the masses. These films are often unilateral forms of didactics. These films fail to exercise the powers of both sides of the argument that the film revolves around. Writers and directors never compose scenes and sequences that contradict your ultimate claim with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. These films always argue obliquely. I say that people who run these black film festivals are judging the film from pure content, which means directing, playing, writing cinematography, editing, etc., or judging movies from a strictly delivered message. about African American culture? We assume that a movie like Constellation will have a chance for a film against films like "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sideways". What happened to the movie fun? When I mean fun, I mean ritual sitting in the dark, looking at the screen, investing tremendous concentration and energy in what I hope will be a satisfying, meaningful emotional experience. Why can't these festivals appreciate the films that get their message without preaching? Why don't these black film festivals recognize movies that are well-told, work that is brutally honest tells the truth? "I believe we have no responsibility for curing social ailments or for restoring faith in humanity, for raising the spirits of society, or even for expressing our inner being. We have only one responsibility: to tell the truth. ‚Äù- Robert McKee. Now it's something I totally agree with. The same black movie festivals have postponed "Hustle and Flo" as if they were the horrible black film stereotypes. But it is a sincere film about a pimp with a dream. Pimp can't dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp who was human. And aren't they, pimps and prostitution a tough reality in our society at all, not just in the black community, but everywhere? The power that is in "black Hollywood" believes that movies like this make Afro-Americans in the eyes of others, as if others did not know that there were pimps in the hood. The truth is, as long as African-American people in the film are unable to accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, then our movies in the world will never have a chance. This movie was terrible. The best was cinematography and Zoe.
