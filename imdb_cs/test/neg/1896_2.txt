I was looking at a version with a pathetic American over-dubs, maybe it made it much worse, but from what I could tell, the movie was just as bad. It was a low budget. The visuals reminded me of a second-frequency television film, a random white dog replaced by Dogmatix, the BBC's shameful costumes in the 1960s, and so on. I never felt willing to even try to forgive the bad film. It is always difficult to capture the feeling of comic in a movie without the use of animation, and I didn't think that it was worth it.
