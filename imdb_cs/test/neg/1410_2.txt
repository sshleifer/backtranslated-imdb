I was a little looking forward to the Man of the Year, a couple of girls in my job said it was a pretty good movie, and my mom said she liked it, so I waited for the rent, and watched it last night. I must honestly say that this film was a huge disappointment. I hardly did it because being a honest start was pretty good and very good, but then it was too dark and not seen in the movie from the trailer. It looked like a good comedy, then turned into a very dark drama that wasn't so interesting, considering how many of these types of stories we had about a government conspiracy. Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a number of top performances and has an act where many people want to be involved in politics just because they seem to have good control over what would be should be improved. So he does, he runs the presidency, but many people doubt he can win because he is a comedian but wins! But Elenore Green, who makes sure that all the votes are counted, tries to fix the computer problem, but when the government tells her not to fix it, she tries to get rid of it and Tom soon realizes that it doesn't have to be a job he wanted. Acting was fine, the direction was fine, it was just a story that I think didn't work. As I said, it turned into a dramatic change in genres, because if you see a trailer, you would think it was a comedy, and when you start watching it, that's what you get, but then it turns into a very dark and somewhat scary one drama. I wouldn't really recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> 2/10
