I was disappointed with this document. I thought it would be a second chess match between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to defeat any human chess player. Kasparov was and still is considered the biggest chess player ever film takes us back to 1997, where Kasporov agreed to after a defeat of 1 year earlier have a remake of "deep blue", but instead of focusing on the game, it focuses more on what is happening before and after. the game, but not many many film centers around Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the struggle was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly. The film also includes interviews with people who are by no means in any way, even in conversation with the manager of the building where the match took place. I also found it very dry and slow. Even this film was dissatisfied. That's just my opinion, of course. racy theories, this movie might interest you.for people not in check or conspiracy theory, this movie would probably have no value.i am a chess fan, and i just stuck it because that.i put "Game Over: Kasparov and equipment "4/10
