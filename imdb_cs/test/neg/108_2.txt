Every movie I have PPV because Leonard Maltin praised that the sky has blown pieces! Everyone! When will I ever learn? Evie is a crazy old bag that doesn't think she was dying of breast cancer to get on the road! Laura is the unbearable Medusa full of the Holy Spirit (and her husband's snoring)! Caught among these harps, Medusa is a stupid-like-and-rock boy who has been pressed into weeds-pulling slavery by an Old Bag! <br /> <br /> As I said, when will I ever learn? I was temporarily out of my malaise when an old bag put her head in her sink, but unfortunately she didn't die. I was temporarily pulled out of my malaise again when Medusa mowed, but unfortunately she didn't die. It should be the main crime of torturing viewers like this! Without Harry Potter to kick him around, Rupert Grint is just a few big blue eyes that virtually bulge out of his drawers. The scenery of Julie Walters' scenery (especially when she "plays" God) is even more shameful than her character. At least Harold hits it instead of Maude. I'm really grateful for that. And if you read Mr. Maltin, you owe me $ 3.99!
