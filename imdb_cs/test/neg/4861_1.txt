I'd like to give 0.5, but unfortunately I can't. Who can write bad scripts (I saw the movie for five seconds and knew that "bad boy" would be Sutherland - he needed to pay his taxes when you see how good he was in Redford's "Ordinary People" and others!). Although I don't like it, but I had no choice, I saw a movie in French, but I know that hearing the real votes Sheen, Sutherland and Hamilton wouldn't change anything, besides doing more pathetic. What makes me sick is that people make a living and do bad things (I forgot to talk about Mr. Waterson, far away from Woody Allen's films he used to play). We had another movie on another French channel: stupid James Bond with Brosnan (I'm not talking about real bonds with Connery (please, it's the end of the holidays, wake up!).
