In the European television industry, such films are called "stickers". Television stations buy and broadcast them because when they wanted to buy broadcasting rights, say, Titanic, some non-really-blockbusters were part of the deal. 14 hours is a story about hospitals, its staff and patients who have to face the worst flood storm ever. Unfortunately, almost every scene or shot can be said to be a low-budget movie. The newborns are probably not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor. Actors are not believable in their roles: their lines, when spoken, are too memorized as if it were a camera test.
