Savage Guns (video title) is a cheap dirt, the tip of western spaghetti in which the surviving massacre hunts bandits who killed his brother and left him dead, catching them up in a city controlled by their crooked boss. Despite the vast amount of violence, it can be so boring and colorless with poor characteristics and almost no imagination or humor. The leading actor Robert Woods lives up to his name a wooden and non-charismatic performance that does not create any heat or compassion. In other words, the viewer never corrects him despite the fact that he is the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is the unpleasant scene of a ballroom where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly German accent. It was the worst scene in Blazing Saddles and the worst here!
