Rourke makes his usual bit part, like a sinister, crazy, Neanderthal, wild, evil jerk, in the same form as in "Picture Claire", "Out in Fifty", "Get Carter", "Double Team" and the rest of the garbage in which is located. <br /> <br /> It has very few lines. Of course, it's all just waste, underestimation of Rourke, his abuse, and it doesn't matter for his character as an actor.Still, after seeing "prayer ...", "Johnny handsome", " barfly "," 9 1/2 weeks "," dragon year ", etc., etc. For many years I have considered Rourke an excellent, intelligent, intelligent person. I think he has changed since then. <br /> <br /> Looks heartless, calcined. <br /> <br /> "He went grimly; / Despair inhabited his breasts / And made man a perfect pest. "(Belloc," Example "). I had no other reason to watch this dull movie, except that Rourke was in.
