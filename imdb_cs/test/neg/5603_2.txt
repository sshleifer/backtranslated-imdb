Pretty. <br /> <br /> Nice actresses and actors. Pretty bad script. Pretty common "let's go to our underwear" scene. Pretty f / X. Pretty uncomfortable decision about location (dorm room looks like a top hotel room - probably because it was shot in a hotel). Nice bland story. Quite a terrible dialogue. Nice places. Quite annoying editing if you don't like the flash-cut style video. This is not a guilty pleasure - it's rather embarrassing. If you have to look at it, choose a good dance / techno album and turn off the movie - you'll see nice people in their pretty black underwear, and probably watch the story cool. The cast may be able to act - I doubt anyone could look qualified with respect to the lines they had to deal with.
