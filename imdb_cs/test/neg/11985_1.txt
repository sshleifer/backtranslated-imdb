It would be clear that it would have the potential in more capable hands, but given the Uwe Boll record, it would be surprising if it were a credit for this farce. The First 5 Minutes Are Classic Monster Movie Frenzy - Even the horrible mono layers supplied by GI Joe soldiers feel as if they have been taken from another business to the same genre. <br /> <br /> If you leave the movie at this point, you will do a favor. . You've already gone through all the peaks and saved yourself by going through some of the worst games in recent history. <br /> <br /> Then enter absolute talent. The leading man has the same amount of charisms that you find in the garden slug. There is an embarrassing bit of an inventive romance thrown in - it is so bad that you can only speculate why this scene has been cast in the first place. Normally, the genre uses the intertwining of romance and nudity to bring some humanity and compassion into otherwise cardboard cutouts - this is reflected on all the reels. The effects are bad and the action is incredibly boring. Where other classics show originality and imagination in the face of budget constraints - here it just seems that everything was spent on eating. In fact, there are no redemptive features - even "it's so bad" is almost good ". It's just bad, in the wrong way. Our hero asks the star star for the night they've spent together and how they rate him. He gives him 2 out of 10. I give the whole thing 1 (I would go for 0 if possible). Don't waste your time on this dribble, there's plenty of crap out there that go beyond this ridiculous rumble in the jungle. Finally, the film has little to do with the popular game Far Cry (at best it is extremely loosely based on it). Awful, move!
