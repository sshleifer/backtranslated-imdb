Leni Riefenstahl would be disgusted with the disgusting propaganda that Moore was trying to call "humor." That this movie, and Moore's other boiling, actually attract admirers, proves that, unfortunately, one can fool some people all the time. See if we can set a stranger. See if we can denounce outdated factories. See if we can add a hate sum to the world. See if we can pretend to be funny. We'll see if we can break out of isolationist Charles Lindbergh. The only thing Moore lacks compared to Lindbergh is the GÃ¶ring medal. It is true that in this film Moore had a little self-denial to his schtick. In this film, Moore ridicules Roger Smith, General Motors' CEO, as a reserved, unsealed elitist. Moore did this in 1989, but now that Moore has given up his defiant, unwavering elitism, this characteristic of Roger Smith has an ironic fit. Who wouldn't rather be Roger's friend than Michael Moore?
