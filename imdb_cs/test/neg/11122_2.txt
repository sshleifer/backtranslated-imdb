Well, the Sci-Fi channel is gutting these turks ... and they always seem to get worse. When normally good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto come out as rank amateurs, you can imagine how enormously REST is cast in this quest for waste of time. The only one-and-a-half good thing is the creature's rubber expedition (which is so fast in flashes that you don't have time to see how fake it is). Dialogue ... conspiracy ... if this "movie" (and I use the term freely) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to this. Watch the re-run of "The Munsters" for the 372nd viewing-your time would be better spent (and much more frightening as well)!
