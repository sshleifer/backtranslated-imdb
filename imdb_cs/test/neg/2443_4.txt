Poor film. Not in one breath compare to "To Kill Mockingbird," or "In the Heat of the Night." Yes, there is racial prejudice, but the film is most ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Come on. Do you really want Elizabeth Patterson, of all people, to be in jail to avoid lynching? Patterson played her mother in her day and was the owner of "I Love Lucy" before Fred and Ethel Mertz bought the house. Imagine the body's exhumation so that it doesn't seem that the black man's weapon killed a white man? Claude Jarman Jr., who was so fabulous in 1946 "The Yearling" appears in this mess. He still had those sad eyes. My eyes would also be sad if I appeared in this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It was nothing more than a Faulkner flop for me.
