Well, first of all I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I missed the credits and stuff. When I finally got to it, I was like "Who the hell is the dude?" I found that it was Flex as well as after watching the movie. Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson. Not one bit. He couldn't dance like him, or move like him, the only thing he almost had was a voice. People commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I can't really comment on it because I don't know much about her. The whole movie was like an ordinary lunatic. Dialog sucked. Cinematography - if it can be called such. The soundtrack burned. Tanning sucks. Yes, Flex ... I'm so upset about it. I didn't want to suck it. I'm so sad that Flex was told he could get rid of it. But the whole thing looked like a dress. You know? It's like, no one seemed to come out with Joseph Jackson. Concert sequences just sucked. I'm sorry, but Flex just can't dance like Michael. I mean, what the hell was VH1 thinking about? Make-up didn't match the time Michael went through. For example, in the movie he was still dark when Neverland got attacked for the first time. In real life, MJ was white as hell. There was a stupid delay in his skin. The film wasn't boring, it wasn't for me. It was nothing. I was so upset about everything that was wrong with him. I wanted to see how it turned out and if Flex could redeem himself. Not really. The only part I found a little interesting was Lisa Marie's whole thing. When they fell in love. That was nice. When I kissed, I had to turn away. Heh. And only two parts melted away with laughter. The first time they cut off short hair with Michael, you know the Thriller era, Michael with the long hair of the Dangerous Era and he was still black! That was funny. The second time I laughed when they showed Michael's posters and memorabilia, but instead had Flex's face! It was so fun. Overall, this movie was cheap. It was just two hours of dressing and could have been much better. But no, VH1 is cheap. Watch if you want. But this film is not funny, given the absurdity. I came out of the fact that I was angry. And when I found out it was Flex, I started to feel so bad. So ... watch if you want.
