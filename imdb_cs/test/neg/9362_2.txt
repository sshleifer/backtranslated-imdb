This is a movie from WC Pictures. If the name of the production company is any indication of how stinking it is, then it would be it. I think I'm not really a fan of horror movies, not that I'm a chick, but this year I wasn't really scared of what's on offer, either from the West or from Asia. 9:56 there is no other, great assumption, but poor execution, relying on clich√© techniques (I think these are the only tools of trade that are available?), To try to trigger some heart moments. -jin (Ko So-young) is a solitary career woman who one day notices that some apartments in a block of flats opposite her, undergo blackouts simultaneously at exactly 9:56 pm every day. No, she's not a voyeur, but a series of inexplicable deaths in the neighborhood, including one which she encounters her on the subway, begin to attract her deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding these deaths. With horror movies, there is always a pseudo-logical explanation in the movie about how ghosts come. This is just the most interesting thing in the movie, the revelation of "The Truth", even if it doesn't take lovers of seasoned movies to estimate a halfway plot. Which of course makes it very unsatisfactory to watch this movie. There are a myriad of characters, such as a wheelchair girl, and neighbors who take turns taking care of her, as well as a schoolgirl, detective, a mentally handicapped boy and a haunted commuter train. But after the genre formula, these people are usually fed for death, or in this case unnecessary red figures of herring whose only goal is to introduce the audience to the filmmakers, never to notice if they mistake or add little to the conspiracy. And don't let me start with the techniques used here. Quick cuts, sudden performances, long hair ghouls (ahhhhhhhh, so passe!), Who can't move properly, abundant blood as it flows down the mountain for free, and the list goes on. But credit to sound engineers for making some ear piercing bones crispy sounds used every time spooks move, even if it looks like one pony trick. Re horror fan. It is a complete waste of promising assumption, and in the end you feel that you are on the way. Very long and painful. It is high time for some innovations in this genre, otherwise one movie will easily look like another, with ugly long monster hair moving funny, but with the ability to perform a sudden performance accompanied by loud sounds. Oh, and someone can lubricate these oils when they're at it too.
