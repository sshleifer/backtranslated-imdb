the worst sequel I've ever seen. really horrible songs that are upset because of how fantastic the first movies and story are! Also, which will destroy the film for me is the fact that there is no John Cleese, so jean bob would be as good in it and new villains are terrible. It's really annoying as the old woman type thing can't convert a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over and over. But to be fair Ubert's closing is a little funny. but the fact that it was her 50th birthday: why are they pulling her like 80? I wanted to give it 1 but now I think ... I could give it 2. but still the story line is not where near as good as the first movie. it is similar without humor from some characters. Overall, I didn't really like this movie because of unsatisfactory music, a serious lack of voice talent: a change in Prince Derek's voice and jean bob, new villains, a disappointed story of some annoying annoying habits and very simple animation.
