I give "Flashdance" the lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it is nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short of music videos in order to make hours as a feature film. When does it count as a movie? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer who has incomprehensibly worked as a welder at a Pittsburgh steel mill. It is not the line of work most older women have found, much less than 18-year-old high school children. Meanwhile, at night, she works as an exotic dancer who never takes her clothes into a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. Looking at the well choreographic and well polished dance routines that girls do every night at Mawby, you think they work at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip. with his boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who has about twice his age. After resisting Nick's advancement because going out with a boss is not a good idea, he doesn't waste time with him after his first date. Alex and Nick are not trying to hide their relationship at work, which makes no sense given the likelihood of looking at Alex's associates. When Beals is not doubled for many dancing sequences in the movie, her character spends most of her time throwing anger in excitement. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only to audition at the prestigious conservatory in Pittsburgh. Inexplicably, when her boss / boyfriend helps her get the audition she dreams about, it's one of them. He angrily tells Nick that he is not auditioning for his intervention, and then gets out of the car in the middle of a busy tunnel. That's just one scene that lets you think what the hell the creators thought when they did it. Of course, Alex will eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. At the conservatory, which is so ridiculous that you think he's in a movie sold to MTV, he's doing a dance routine. Yeah, it's a dance routine in the movie marketed by MTV. I don't think I can judge whether Beals can actually act on what I saw. Flashdance ‚Äù. It's because the character that is forced to play is so badly written that I don't think it's a fair litmus test of her acting skills. <br /> <br /> You must pass it on to the creators. Flashdance. This film proves that the poorest filmmaking can be covered by a neat marketing campaign. In this case, the best-selling and award-winning soundtrack and music videos for the mentioned soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they put more of their energy into writing the script, then they could come up with a story and a story with the characters I cared about. Instead of what we get, the stock figures are embedded in ridiculous scenes that no viewer with a working brain can take seriously. Really forgotten "movie".
