OK, this is one weird movie! Ed Wood Jr. Fans appreciate the inventive techniques director George Barry uses such as stock footage and cheese voice overs. He can make cracks in the wall to plot the device! There's more humor than horror, but I found it to be an uneven blend. You'll laugh and cry, and you're probably wondering why you had your hands on it. Barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this film in 1972, and was completed in 1977, at a cost of $ 10,000. That's 59 months and $ 9,900 too much! If you like your cheese on the campsite side, with a vintage "70" "gore", you can find this irresistible and strange snack.
