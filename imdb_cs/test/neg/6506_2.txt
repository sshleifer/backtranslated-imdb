Though well made made for a television movie, dying to love you dies with a low degree of melodramatic splendor. The film opens to Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, looking much older than I remember it to be), who is a struggling businessman who runs an empty, lonely life after his wife Ruthie (who looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold) keeps him with speed. Now Roger has his cats ... and his newspaper newspaper. Once his ad is answered, Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa-oh calls, no matter who you want me to be-Lawrence. Then ... they have phone sex. I'm not sure where you came from or when you were born, but I remember that a phone was played in the late 1980s. I'm sorry, but that was embarrassing. Soon, Roger and the wide hook will join and have a romantic atmosphere. They fall in love, visit the zoo and see gorillas. He attaches it to the bed and seduces him. Roger is so stupid he doesn't realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a bimbo who likes to sleep. God forbade women to sleep with only one man. Soon, strange phone calls will start appearing, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute speed, and she keeps bragging and waving about her former husband who beat her. It's funny to see that Roger believes her through all these things. This is until the impolite co-worker tells him to go with her things as if she were a housewife. He takes his miserable counsel and, behold, he finds a suitcase crawling with false cards and wigs and weapons and a crossbow. He immediately takes the suitcase to the police and arrests her. Although all these jazz, he still loves stupid wide. She says so many lies, her tongue seems to ignite once she tells the truth. Roger continues his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela who looks like something from Gremlins 2. She also has a baby and Roger likes her. But something inside Roger's subconscious keeps him connected with Lisa Rohn (if it's her real name) and still returns to her. Now Lisa is "ex that won't leave" she earns herself getting out of jail free cards and shows up at Roger's threshold and his son Matt is so busy trying to check her, pours juice all over the floor . IL 'Rog is so stupid that he fires Lisa and doesn't change the locks either. Boy, if all the people were so stupid, I wouldn't even write it. The end of this movie is so scaly that you won't believe it. Tim Matheson is King of King Made-for-TV-Movie. in this movie she looks like such a dawm mom. It's a little wooden and stiff. Dazzling Tracy Pollan works well with her role and her trampiness rings true. She is extremely beautiful and I see what Michael J. Fox sees in it. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to watch when you are on that late night tip, but then again, you can fall asleep, considering how boring and bland it is.
