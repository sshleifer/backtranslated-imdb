There are some great Canadian movies. There are some miserable ones. Last night I watched one of the miserable ones. It was not a typical Canadian film where he was trying to be so different by being art. This film tried to be some kind of Hollywood gangster movie. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I thought it was going to be a bad movie. It had some of the cheesiest dialouge movie can have. There was that voice on one scene, and then he never came back. It always beats me when filmmakers simply use a voice when they can't imagine another creative way to tell a story. but this movie is unsolicited. The assumption is something like Soprano's episode is not realistic. Some banker's mafia boss is on his deathbed and directs his son to make business legitimate. Not so original. And the workers complain about it, but they simply acknowledge that they will soon be out of work. To be legitimate, they use extortion. Irony. But not a good kind. Then some girl girl who had a terrible Elvis wig and a mole that covered half her face robs the main character and rapes him a little. Anyway, this guy likes to dress like girls for some reason. Then the banker joins the hooker when he has a beautiful future wife at home. But he falls on a hooker because the hooker dresses like a man and gives him makeup. He wins it with photos wearing a bra and panties. Yet he still loves her. He has no reason to leave his fiancé, but he does it to be with a hooker. There was no action or sex for an organized crime and sexual fetish movie. It was like the late night movie Cinemax without good things. Possible sex scenes were neither hot nor sexy. It was too amateur. The film had nothing for it, just a lame fence. I don't think it was an actor's fault. I think they had a terrible scenario. Most of them were ridiculous characters. The name of the evil is Uncle Bunny or something. But the name wasn't important. They were all clichés. Dialouge was laughing throughout the film, and movie-fellow visitors laughed out loud for some "serious" moments. Then it's the worst. It had to be the cheapest end. If you ever remember, you play as a kid with imaginary weapons or toys. That was essentially the end of the film. But I was more than happy that it was over, and I had to warn my fellow Canadians not to waste any time or money watching this movie.
