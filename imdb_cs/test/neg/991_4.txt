As their entire career was a pale impersonation of The Beatles, it's no surprise that shortly after the great Beatles fiasco "Magical Mystery Tour", Monkees will follow on from their own insipid and creative morass movie called "Head." Both films are not so true a story with a storyline (though MMT attempted to define a plot) as they are hodge-podge skits and snippets, scattered with music and songs and out-takes. "Head" has no conspiracy, other than pre-fab-four, which tries to break free from the "box" in which it is located (ie Casting of being "Monkees" and surrounding commercialization) and yet is always back in the box. Most parodies include breaks in the "fourth wall" and move into other, seemingly unrelated scenes. A film full of anti-Vietnam war reports and group attempts to show their next talent, the film will be blatantly blamed on multiple directors. The movie, such as the Magic Mystery Tour, is now apologizing to some fans as "wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements". Phooey. Like MMT, there are too many guys with access to too many drugs that try to do something artificial and bullshit. <br /> <br /> Like MMT, "Head" has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are pretty decent. It develops a little more magic than MMT and is a little easier to sit, but it is not ironic that just like anything else Monkees did, it was just the mimicry of what the Beatles did first ... though it comes to laying eggs .
