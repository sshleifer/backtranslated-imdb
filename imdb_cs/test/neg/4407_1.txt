It's not a plot, OK; it's not a character study, fine; there is no action, all right; Maybe it's supposed to be the boredom and absurdity of life in Palistina and parts of Israel these days in a state of violence, minor disagreements, deep-seated hostility, etc. But mostly it's long, long the scenes don't happen - or things that look like they're dripping with meaning (the control tower hit the ground, the Arafat balloon floating into Jerusalem, crouching tiger women discouraging bullets into the halo), but when you're trying to derive some meaning, it's not there push. <br /> <br /> Bonus: You can watch this movie fast forward and be a little less boring without distinction.
