I think I can see why critics give this movie two five stars, it's not fantastic, but I think it's worth a look at by director Shawn Levy (Cheaper at Dozen, Night at the Museum). Basically 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm in Middle Frankie Muniz) is often lying to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he doesn't do his creative writing, he will fail the whole semester and must repeat the grade during the summer. So finishing his job, but getting a lift from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who hit him on his way to school, manages to leave his "Big Fat Liar" in the car. From the movie trailer he finds out that Marty stole his paper and turns it into a main movie, so he and his best friend Kaylee (She's Amanda Bynes) are on a mission to prove that Jason is one thing that tells the truth. Of course, Marty is too ugly and smug to give Jason's father Harry (Michael Bryan French) a phone call, and he'll burn out "Big Fat Liar". So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as hellish as possible, until he can call Jason's dad. They put blue dye in their pool and orange hair dye in their shampoo and much more naughty jokes creating chaos for Marty's career. There's an obvious point where Jason seems to want to give up, but don't worry, all the characters who despise Marty help in the final surgery, and with Jason's parents coming, he wants to finally prove his truthfulness and the boy makes additions, great style. They also play with Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson, Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and John Cho John American as Dustin 'Dusty' Wong . Muniz is sympathetic, Byrnes proves very surprisingly talented support, and while losing time and talent a little, Giamatti is great at being ugly. It's a children's movie, so if it appears to be scaly, cheesy or predictable, just remember and try to enjoy the show and the slapstick. Good!
