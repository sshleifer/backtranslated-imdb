It's not a balanced view. The director should not express his opinion as the truth. The film has some criticism of Fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words. So few Fujimori critics were assuming that the only reason they were included was to be able to say that the film provided both views. But that's not the case. The film barely shows one of the massacres Fujimori is accused of. And that gives him credit for managing the murder of MRTA insurgents who took the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA was planning. On pages published by Caretas and other newspapers, there are even pictures of the famous CIA strategist. The fact that the director did not use such well-known information gives us several possible conclusions: the director is pro-Fujimori and has deliberately and falsely decided to give him credit; the director does not want viewers to notice that the CIA and Fujimori have cooperated; Or it was just out of ignorance because the director was not Peruvian and was not present in Peru at the time of the events. The explanation provided by other commentators that Fujimori is still quite popular in Peru does not excuse the lack of precision and balanced explanation. Also, the statistics presented in the film for the true Fujimori support were the highest I have ever heard of. Most statistics by major exploration agencies are much lower. Another point to mention is that the intelligence that was crucial to the capture of the Sender leader and the discovery of the secret network was carried out by a police unit led by Ketin Vidal and he had complete autonomy from Fujimori and Montesinos. Fujimori's first government experienced an improvement in overall economic trends (GDP), but this improvement was funded by the privatization of several national industries with contracts. which have not benefited the country for a long time. Also, the gap between the rich and the poor continued to increase during Fujimori's regime. In its second period, the economy suffered and nothing else was privatized, and by the end of Fujimori's second term, it was about to collapse. <br /> <br /> As far as Fujimori's infrastructure investment is concerned, the paternalistic pattern decay. They were created to support Fujimori, but they shouldn't last long. These structures required continued maintenance, but Fujimori did not provide political power to civilians to demand further investment. In fact, Fujimori's regime was able to destroy most forms of political organization, such as trade unions and core groups, and the increase in informal unorganized work was enormous. Finally, the director decided to spend most of them. the film spoke to Fujimori instead of citing massive corruption in favor of Fujimori (Media, Entrepreneurs, Army, etc.) that were so wide that Fujimori didn't know about it.
