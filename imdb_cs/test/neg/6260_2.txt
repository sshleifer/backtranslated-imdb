It is hard to get in depth with this kind of thing because there is absolutely no existing fragment or partial reason for its observation, let alone an opinion on it. I don't know anything about it - I watched him laugh and stay on the fake breasts. It seems to be the unofficial sequel to "Slumber Party Massacre" from 1982, which I enjoyed as a fun slasher. "Cheerleader Massacre" looks like a late thread soft-core Cinemax porn! And it's no wonder that cubs like Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (fertile T&A actresses) are in this. Lots of nekkid hooters and nothing else ... A group of 20-something high school cheerleaders, two random guys, and a fat, dumb comic-relief pet are stuck in the ground and find a house where they plan to stay at night. The "Slumber Party" has recently escaped and the killer is killing them. There is no gore or originality and I would not say that nudity is a real "selling point" because it is probably so boring film slasher can be. Absolutely awful ...
