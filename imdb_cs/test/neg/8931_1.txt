Now it's on my TV ... but long enough to finish this commentary. The previous comment let me know that this film will not be better, I hope and pray. I will agree that this film is a colossal waste of my time, and it would be your time ... it won't be better! I can't believe this scriptwriter does Atlas shrugged! I hope it has improved a million times! I see some more credits on his resume that had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you are familiar with his work, please send something here because I really want to see the Atlas shrugging and hating him if the guy turned it into garbage that turned out to be this movie.
