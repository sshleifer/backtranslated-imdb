One of the worst shows of all time. The show would begin with an intelligent input of comments to themselves that would be completely out of the wall and junk. The bold computer geek was incredible, bible thumper, the bad girl who are these actors ??? I've never heard of any of them except Cole, who was absolutely incredible in this part. Every time you open your mouth, you expect to hear, "you see kids ..." The pulling of the plug was a deadly killing for this terrible show. The stories were as incredible as the actors. Lame would be the best way to describe it. This show somehow makes the slug like Ice-T more believable than a cop, and wrote the worst song about the cops he ever recorded.
