A young woman, Jodie Foster, witnesses a mafia murder, reports the killing of the local police and becomes the target of mob operators. Dennis Hopper, a professional killer hired by a mafia, chases her to get ready for a hit, but falls down on her. Then, as a Stockholm Syndrome parody that defines the case of a kidnapped hostage starting to love and cooperate with a kidnapper, Jodie Foster also falls for his kidnapper, loves and both are preparing to escape. Denis Hopper, an actor, strives to cope with Dennis Hopper's creative ambitions. The result is disappointing and fails to keep up with the artistic level of a great performer like Dennis Hopper. There is no real excitement and the scenario is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is to some extent rescued by the performance of Jodie Foster, who is not her best, but still shines with her talent, beauty and gift. Historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Award, and, in a small act, Charlie Sawn known from his large part in "Wall Street". <br /> <br /> If you decide to spend 116 minutes to see the movie, it's not a complete loss; This movie offers easy entertainment, but we would expect much more from director "Easy Rider" and the actress who gave us the character Sarah Tobias in "The Accused".
