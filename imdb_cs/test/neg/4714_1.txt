Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so immensely filmed, it's not even on this alleged "real half of the caste," it's more of a Hollywood crew to film. No cinematic meaning, and if I could take back almost 1/1/2 of the hours I spent watching this movie, I'd feel a lot better. Initially, it begins to give the impression that they will be filmed somewhat generically, like real Hollywood production. However, they then go into telling the story, and it is filmed so f *** ing terribly. It has to be a "Blair Witch Project" really, because to a large extent they use what you think is a 'real camera record', it's not, don't be fooled. The worst movie I saw. . . What is positive is that it has one semi-haunted scene in it, and the visuals of the half caste were not bad at all. DO NOT PLEASE
