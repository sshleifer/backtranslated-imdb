How many disaster movies can be before they get tired. Come on, we see them on Discovery Channel all day. I agree with the comment that the first part of this film is just a soap opera. The Grand Predictor's grandson predicts and everyone starts moaning about how he destroys the name. An evil mother-in-law convinces a woman to throw him into the arms of her mistress he wants to meet. Can you believe it? Woman wants to approve new wife! At the same time, the lover has someone who does not have a wife, but sends him a cover. Now that the soap opera is over, an earthquake appears. Special effects are really good, but dubbing is bad. That's why I like movies with subtitles. All actors are very experienced and have won many awards, so you can see some of the best Japanese movies in a repetitive story. But the story of soap opera returns with an ending expression.
