You get a good part of Steven Seagal's environment, and some breathtaking mountain views along with cow scenes (or alternatively use parts of all HORSE WHISPERER remains). Then add a big piece of OUTBREAK or similar (attention must be more deadly and at least Biohazard Level 4) wrapped around the Militia leader. Add one teaspoon of martial arts and a zipper to blast and shoot for taste. Add classic red Indian herbs for extra taste. Serve immediately. <br /> <br /> What is the title of the movie you will get ?: Patriot. Perhaps the worst movie of Steven Seagal. I'm sure Seagal tried to say something in this movie, except the usual cook, but his recipe was confusing and the taste was terrible.
