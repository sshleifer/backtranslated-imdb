This film promotes self-justice! This grants freedom to a black man who killed men who raped his daughter and eventually got rid of scales! In this movie, it's as despicable as it can be. The character of Connaughey has immense features for Bullock's character, and the film has some of the stereotypes of test films (like important news brought to trial in zero time) that make every aesthetically demanding film visitor such as I sick! I really can't believe anyone likes this waste. It is a film so bad and holds false ideals that I cannot give my criticism eloquently pleasing. When Americans Wake Up and Find That 24/7 Movies Are Handled, Like These, That Transforms Reality in BS, Where Justice is for All If They Take It. This cowboy attitude only makes me sick, and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with America!
