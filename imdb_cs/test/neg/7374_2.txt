This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Historical accuracy is completely non-existent. For example, James Wolfe, who depicted him as an anti-French Canadian, is shown in London during the summer of 1759. Natives are like the Indians of a bad Hollywood 1960s movie: They wear deerskin clothes and ride horses . The film takes place in Quebec City, but the footage takes place in Louisbourg, which shows the Atlantic Ocean. The original scenario was to include the battle for the Abraham Plains, but the producers dropped the idea. says the cost of uniforms and participants would be more than $ 4 million! I think they never heard of re-enactment. The whole film is planned as a new Titanic: impossible love during a historic tragedy (the fall of New France). There is even a Celine Dion song at the end of the movie (Yes, I stayed until the end of the movie, but I deeply regret it). But the worst of all is that this film costs $ 30 million. I just don't know how to spend all this money. Sorry for my anger, but I'm just too irritated.
