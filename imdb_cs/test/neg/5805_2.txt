Positively ridiculous film. If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight persist in these types of films, they can retire and collect full-time social security. While the idea that a 35-year-old swinger who works on video games loses his apartment and is forced to move in with Grandma Roberts and Jones and Knight's borders, it's foolish. Imagine that the 3 bags get to the things Alex's grandson left in his house and Jones goes to bed with someone who can qualify as her grandson! The video games are just as stupid as any other movie. The assortment of characters Alex works with is out of faith because he enjoys his weed habit with others. Terrible best describes this pathetic movie.
