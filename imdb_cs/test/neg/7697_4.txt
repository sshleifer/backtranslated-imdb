I saw this short DVD movie for Ridley Scott's The Duellists. Scott hadn't seen any shows before the film, it just started right away. The boy and the bike are hardly an example of another work by Ridley Scott. The film shows a boy, played by Tony Scott, riding a bicycle. Guess what? That is all. The boy rides around, goes on and on with a nonsensical, confusing dialogue. The film was shot in black and white, and since it was directed by Ridley Scott, I was expecting great cinema or visually striking sets. Instead, I treated nothing. This film is not good at first. However, I recommend that every Ridley Scott fan check it at least once.
