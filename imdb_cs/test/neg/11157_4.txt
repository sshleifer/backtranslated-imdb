While watching "End of Days", I felt that filmmakers might be trying to make it unique for an average Hollywood action movie. They failed, of course, but you must give them credit for the attempt. This time, Peter Hyams attempted to direct, rather than set off another flat action movie. He tried to push the atmosphere into the film by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if it is used correctly (see "Se7en"), but here it just looks like a cheap trick that is trying to scare us. Hyams is a decent action director and does not offer anything more than basic filming and combat scenes, with the exception of the subpar f / x end "battle". As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates real capabilities, displaying some good frame work and movement, but it's nothing beyond the hard work. Andrew Marlowe's screenplay is the greatest enemy of the film. The scenario actually shows how good a religious thriller is good, and sometimes it even shows some quasi-intellectual thinking (the Temptation scene between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these little pluses are choked by the river of negatives. Generic dialogue / characters, conspiracy gaps, and a comfortable plot that point to all characters in the right direction are just some of Marlowe's standard black holes in the scenario. The shadow of a good film could be faded very quickly. The movie is surprisingly good. Arnold, who is still bigger than life attitude, is trying to play depression, on the edge of a cop with more than average results. Stick to the invincible hero Arnie, that's what's good for you. Gabriel Byrne is a powerful element of the ensemble that brings Satan a nice air of cynicism. In a criminal role mature for overclocking, Byrne limits herself and adds a slightly greater threat to character. Kevin Pollak, as usual, is able to bring at least a few laughs to the movie, but it's better. Also look at the stellar little role of Rode Steiger. Hyam looked as if he was trying to separate himself from the anonymous mass of Hollywood action movies. He was heading in the right direction, but he had neither the script nor the originality to get him there. <br/> <br/> 4/10
