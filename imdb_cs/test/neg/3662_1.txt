This movie seemed to be filmed with a video phone, had a very small plot and unnecessary nudity. In fact, the film never came or made much sense, and for that movie, of course, there were some useless shots. Apparently the director was trying to make the film subjective and different, but he never gave enough information about what was actually happening, even in the end, in a mixture of anger and confusion. Confusion from lack of conspiracy, and anger because I wanted my two dollars back from blockbuster and 1.5 hours of my life back. They should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie.
