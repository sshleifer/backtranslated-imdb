There's something amazing about revenge film. Everyone wakes up in the morning and believes that he is the star of the film, and that anyone who interferes with his own personal agenda is somehow an enemy. Slander Films Films Work Especially if You Have Low Self Assessment. Instead of returning at this point, the hero draws on the built-in inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an effort to restore balance. Quite naturally, in the "real world" this type of revenge rarely releases tension because life is not a film; after taking revenge, the measures taken have their own consequences. Good revenge revenge helps people ignore this bitter pill. Final credits end in films and all responsibilities are resolved. "Swimming with Sharks" is advertised as a comedy, undoubtedly an act by the producers to find out how to sell this strangeness. It's dark, but it's not a dark comedy ("Men's Society" and Todd Solondz's works are much closer). Parts of the film are so brutal that they precede the current genre of "torture-porn", everyone is so obsessed ("Saw", "Hostel"). There are some laughs. There are laughter in "Saving Private Ryan" too, but it's not marked by comedy. The actual problem with this movie is that it did not get its case of revenge. It is seemingly about a young man who is being abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to "pay" him for all the ill-treatment. The hero (aptly named "Guy") is "mundane" so vague that we literally know nothing about him ... what is he doing with his free time? Does he / she have friends / family? How did he get where he was? What are his interests (this becomes a running theme in the course of the film, undoubtedly inspired by the film's own struggle ... "What do you want?" It is very difficult to care for such a character, even though he has behaved well (even Tom Hanks becomes a mold in the wrong round, for example "Punchline"). Kevin Spacey as boss, "Buddy," is supposed to be a monster, but he's too charismatic as an actor. The best laugh came when he abused his assistant - he seemed almost so surprised that the audience would probably last. When Kevin's character is tortured, the sight of him suddenly becomes empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a funny monster without rationality. At this point, any message the author had had was lost; in this film there is no "hero", ergo, no reason to care at all. It is not a section that would assume that this story is based on the author's own problematic career in the film industry. I worked for a similar boss and can guarantee that it is not so attractive. At that time, I had similar fantasies of wish and thought I was justified. I thought you could win the most beautiful woman in the story (actually just a woman - all four people seem to be in the universe of this movie) just because she is your eager, naive self, that eagerness has won awards and boss has abused you because he was an average person. Time and tide have revealed the truth that most "monsters" are really just a demon of the individual's personal psyche, and resentment is usually based on itself. As the film shows, if Guy was so unhappy, he had to leave. The film does not offer any denouement at all, regardless of "surprise". We still know nothing about the protagonists, nor can we be sure that everything they said was actually founded and everyone has the magic to have their cake and eat it too. In short, this story had no meaning at all but to point out that (shock!) Film business can be quite brutal. There are plenty of good movies that say solid and satisfying revenge - fantasy fantasy, both good-sensitivity variety ("9-k5," "working girl," "devil wears Prada") and not so much ( "War of the Roses", remake of "Hills Have Eyes")). This is not one of them - despite the fun turn of Benicio Del Toro in the role of Emily Blunt of "Prada" and some interesting work of Spacey and Michelle Forbes, it is a frustrating, average, confused and slightly boring self-creation - the leniency of the director she has, hopes ,, that "it all managed" ...
