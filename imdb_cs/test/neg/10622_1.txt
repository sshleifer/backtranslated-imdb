This film made me slap my head on the wall. It is hard to compare such badness with what is happening, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under the nails. And that commentary comes from a cousin's writer. This film was so miserable that "Hulk" (the second worst movie ever) looked like "The Departed" (one of the biggest films in film history). If you like boring family movies with predictable charts, then you will love this movie. If you have a brain, certainly not. When I rented this movie, I fell asleep watching. The next day I finished it from where I left off, and it was the worst decision of my life.
