Swoon Focuses on Leopold and Loeb's Gay Relationship - A case aspect that was mostly (and unjustly) ignored from their trial, even Leopold himself in his autobiography. But even when it is done, Swoon is far from being done. The worse is that it spins, combines and changes the details of the case, which will irritate anyone who knows a lot about it, and at the same time can confuse those who are unfamiliar with it. While this is an interesting film, Swoon stinks. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 - terrible.
