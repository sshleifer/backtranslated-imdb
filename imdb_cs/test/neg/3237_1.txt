It's hard to believe that anyone could have such a great book and make such a horrible movie. Imagine King Kong being reworked as a monkey organ and part of Fay Wraye playing a young boy. How about Elton John as Rambo !!!! This movie is even worse than the TV remake of The Night of the Hunter. <br /> <br /> Using the name Watchers and Dean Koontz is the name of this movie. To be sued for scam readers of the book who expected reasonably accurate customization of the book. <br /> <br /> Read the book, I've never spoken to anyone who didn't like it. Another good book is Winner David Baldachi.
