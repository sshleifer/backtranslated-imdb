Why, why is this waste considered classic? I saw a higher number of bodies on The Simpsons episodes. There is hardly anything going on in this film, and much of its run is filled with an almost unbearable melodrama from the low-rent opera. The Trenton family is going through tough times and when Dad is away from Mom and Little Boy to get in the car. But when they get to the ranch, they find that the guard dog is crazy. The rest of the movie is just sitting in the car while Saint Bernard is circling them again and again. As for the boy, I've never seen a more annoying child in my life movie. And of course he's completely Aryan because blond hair and blue-eyed kids like the one that is prominent on Kinder chocolate packs are probably more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair like me. All he does is cry and whine. The same goes for Mom. He gets out of the car, gets in the car, gets out of the car, gets in the car. I know it was made in 1983, but I'm sick of horror movie deaths, where characters make stupid, illogical decisions. If my mother used some common sense, she could get away from icky dog. <br /> <br /> It's very badly written and there's zero tension. If you want to see a good "bad dog" movie, check out the best friend of John Lafiu. It's funny, inventive, has a better dog, a higher number of bodies and a more engaging story. Let this waste be.
