Dr. Markoff is a mad scientist who experiments and tries to find a cure for the viral cause of acromegaly. When she attends a piano concert, she is hit by a beautiful daughter of a pianist and embarks on her. But when he doesn't want to do anything, he infects his father with an acromegaly virus in an effort to blackmail money and his daughter in exchange for treatment. This is the basic premise for this B-class low budget thriller. I must say that I was impressed by this film. Not that it was awful - it wasn't, but there was nothing special about it. It was fun enough for viewing, but it's not the one that stays in my memory. The dialogue is sometimes a little spoiled and the acting is just average. The story is quite predictable and in fact it doesn't give us anything new. Of course, I can't complain too much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla suit that has almost no real purpose, and a doctor looking at Svengali who can't grab his victims. Maybe it's worth watching if you like this kind of movie, but don't go into it with too much expectation.
