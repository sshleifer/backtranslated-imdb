Extremely boring .. I don't care how many avant-garde bones you have in your body, this baby sucks ... and doesn't go and see it because I mentioned it, saved it for Warhol's "Empire", it's much more fun !! I've seen other Duras movies that were much better, so I'm amazed why this is considered a "masterpiece". As an art historian, I had to think of the radical works of Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Damien Hurst, and in these artists I still see the artistic intent, even the quality, and the entertaining aspect of rendering their art. As for "India Song" - it is not even soft-porn- Anias Nin was almost here - G-rated slide show sex- and voice-over that does not cover the slide show / film ...... crap and not camping ... unfortunately only boring and waste 2 hours. To add insult to injury, the press I saw was faded and scratched to hell! (Harvard Film Archive), If I Want To See "Fun Dull" Watching Bunuel !! Yes "India Song" - keep your head high on late modernism and be really bored! Check out the 70s porn movie with all the good parts cut out and turn the sound down, you get "India Song" but with better cinematography and none of the annoying music or shouts of Vice Consul !!!.
