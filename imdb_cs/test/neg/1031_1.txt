Here is the rundown of the typical Rachael Ray Show: <br /> <br /> 1. The horrific thematic song begins to play and Rachael descends wearing Snapcrotch clothes in this bizarre freight elevator. 2. Starting to run around screaming and / or offending the audience, then screaming at them and sitting down. 3. Inept monologue. <br /> <br /> (Next in any order) 4. Segment stretching Rachael's own horn (ie "I Lost 500 Pound with Rach's Recipes," Rachael Ray saved my life, "" Rachael's Fashion Tips. ") 5 . Totally useless tip on DIY (ie How to engrave words into casseroles, how to use the washing machine as a salad cone, how to build a lipstick tube with light on it). Releasing a Terrible Recipe to an Unsuspecting Audience (Reaction to First Bite Will Never See) Yes to all women, I don't own anything, but a lady with overalls, and I can't find the time to put on a housewife. What would Rachael do without you. The reasons why this show should be avoided, such as the plague: 1. Fakeness: Rachael Ray says the whole show is decrypted. Those who participated in the show show that the whole show was written. Many of these same people have also mentioned that dressing is very strict for the show. 2. Her show jumps around too much: Where as Oprah, who is the highest rated talk show host of all time has a certain theme for her show, Rachael is jumping around like ADHD soda baby on crack. Her show averages about 10, short, worthless segments of the show. On the other you get the fashion tips from Kojo, and the other Rachael will do the rough stuffed "Spanish" peppers with the manchego cheese, and the next one will be a giant anakondu on stage, and more, you'll get the picture. 3. Rachael is a poor guest with bad ideas: In addition to his congratulations, Rachael's hosting capability is terrible at best. Her questions to celebrity guests are bad and often not even relevant to the interview, and her segments are uncoated and offer little educational or humorous value. Finally, you don't have to waste time with this schlock. Will be canceled soon.
