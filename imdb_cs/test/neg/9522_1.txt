I am a little frightened by some of these reviews praising A.K.A. Not only does it sound like they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of insider information that you could only find by reading the print book from the cover into the cover. Please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews because it would be too sad to change his mind. I'm afraid I'm another of those who hated the film and was surprised by his infallible amateurism. Great idea, shame of execution. And it was most worrying to watch so many good actors (as well as some very bad ones, including lead lead), apparently thinking they appeared in a series of very different movies. <br /> <br /> I wish AKA to be bold, innovative or simply interesting. Unfortunately, it was like watching an unintentionally hysterical home video with artistic aspirations. Missed opportunity.
