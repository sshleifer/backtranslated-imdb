That was a decent movie for the first half. Too many cheap BOOs! moments, but tension builds up, bad guys are scary and everything seems to be nicely set. Children are not particularly deep, but hey, it works for teens. Then it's just ridiculous and trying too hard - "why would he do it in the world?" the moments overwhelm anyone's ability to suspend distrust, the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences, and the name comes from a late attempt to philosophy some sense into a film that is nowhere to be dropped. He laughed at the theater in moments that shouldn't have been funny. <br /> <br /> A great premise, but only poorly written and does not hold together. Some very nice shots, but it's hard to enjoy when they roll their eyes.
