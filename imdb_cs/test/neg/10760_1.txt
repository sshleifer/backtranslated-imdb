Film director Bryan Forbes, who once exhibited a light, sardonic touch with glamorous material, such as "Whistle Down the Wind" and the original "Stepford Women", down here. Not only is his direction awkward, but he also carelessly adapted Sidney Sheldon's earlier novel; the results are cruel. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, a chewing scenery, is a hot-under-collar cop (this is easily his most embarrassing performance). The only actor to show off some life here is Elliott Gould, who knows a bit about reviving the script. Bland, choppy, and produced on cheap. NO STARS of ****
