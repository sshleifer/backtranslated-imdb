I thought this movie would be good. It certainly wasn't, despite the Oscar winning actors. Maybe I laughed once and I never heard laughter in the theater. Renee Zellweger's makeup was very unpleasant. It seems that everyone in this film has tried so hard that they move in the imitation of the grotesque run but do not pull out. I think maybe the movie sounded good in the development, but something was lost in the translation. Was it roaring like that? I think not. Everything seems artificial. Randy Newman's score was unpleasant. The film is in sepia tones, just like any other film that takes place in the 1920s or 1930s. There's not just so much originality.
