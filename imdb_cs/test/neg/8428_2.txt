Historically terrible. Hardly the exact moment in 4 hours of ridiculousness. Tracking cannot track irregularities. As with all songs and movies, no one is bothering to ask for a counselor. Events and techniques that were not created until the next century are shown. From the footage of runners running at 400 meters on a high overweight who wins the jump and jump winner, you wouldn't have to know anything about the track that it should be even fun. Probably thrown in 1984 as a tribute to the games just before the LA Olympics.
