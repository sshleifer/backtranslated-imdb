What a terrible movie. The effects were bad, especially by today's standards, but it was forgiven. What was unforgivable was the terrible rehashing of each flood / dam breaks the film disaster ever made into this piece of trash. Behavior was terrible and I mean AWFUL. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops rescuing the dog from the upcoming torrent was cheerful. They see water coming and running for their lives. (By the way, they had to find a very old fat dog not to make Mrs. Green look bad). For some time they manage to overcome the water in front of the refuge. What speed! Later, the speed car is not fast enough to escape the torrent. God, she and the dog ran fast! If you want to watch a good movie about breaking a dam - that's not it. Porchlight Entertainment is hit by some good family movies, but this time they are missing.
