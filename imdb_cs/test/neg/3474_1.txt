Maybe we're too attached to the big glasses when we hear about the antiquity brought to the screen. Maybe we will expect too many of these films. But if we are offered too little as a viewer, then what happens? This is what I thought when I saw IMPERIUM - NERONE by Paul Marcus, part of a production series about the Roman Empire. Roger Young's AUGUSTUS, the first IMPERIUM movie, included at least Peter O'Toole, but what does the movie contain? Hardly anything accurate. The historical mistakes are so serious that the film changes facts and represents rather a distorted picture of the Roman Empire than real history. Throughout the film we see a young Nero: a young man during the supposedly long reign of Caligul, a young man under Claudius, and ultimately during his own (historically 14-year-old) government. And ... he will die anyway. According to the film, Nero, born under the reign of Tiberius, has lived for over 40 years, but seems to be in his late twenties when he dies ... Continuity combined with formed history is the biggest problem of film that makes barely logical, not to mention reliable . Nero loses his father, is brought up by slaves. At the time, his mother, Agrippina, is driven out of Caligula. Later, however, she suddenly marries Emperor Claudia, who already has large children with a fresh marriage to him, Messalina. In these moments of the movie, we see Acte (Rike Schmid), Nero's mistress. Well, it's historically "accurate"; but no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of Christianity in Rome. He is not only a devoted Christian in the film, but also a witness to the miracle of st. Pavla (brings the young girl Marzia to life). In addition, historically, there was nothing like Nero seen on the Caligula course because Nero was born in Caligula's 4 year long reign (A. 37-41). I understand that movies can change something, but that makes the script completely unreliable! And many other shortcomings about content that is difficult to name, but after 30 minutes of watching this movie, I doubted whether I was watching a historical movie or a complete fantasy. <br /> <br /> As for his artistic features, which give us fun, they are just as lame as history here. Performances are artificial, casts simply have beautiful faces, but weak acting skills. Maybe I'm too connected to Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton at the head, but Hans Matheson doesn't fit like Nero at all. He could have some good moments as an actor, but never as an infamous Roman emperor. Is it an artist who burns Rome to a song? Is it a cynic who disguises love for his relatives? Is it a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for "alleged justice"? None of these. He is just a young man who does not know how to rule, and in the long run begins to release fire in himself ... John Simm is in this film as Caligula and absolutely worse than the other character character. Elisa Tovati is just sexy as Poppaea; but it could have been much better. The costumes are inaccurate and the sets are not surprising. Low budgets lead to low effects and hence low entertainment. What made me most annoyed in this film and I give it 1/10 as a result are some moments that are totally unacceptable: the death of Poppa and St Paul speaks with Nero in her dead body, Claudius' mention of the simultaneous conquest of Britannia on the feast and early of his death (he conquered Britannia, while Messalina was his wife much before his death), <br /> <br Tigellinus killing Agrippina (Laura Morante), Nero's mother, <br /> <br /> - Nero arguments in the speech to senators, <br /> <br /> - finally, Nero's death - a calm day by the lake and indifferent suicide that leads to morality said Acte "Forgive Him" ​​<br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is a waste of time and is totally unnecessary as another production of the Roman Empire. It is better to make one good movie in 30 years than ten smaller children in 5 years. 1/10 - should not be done at all.
