I have to agree with the other two comments. I waited over a month to see this new great A&E show that was hyping. What a disappointment !!! The show is almost all about Ryan Buell. His voice calls are erratic. It sounds like he's talking to a can. Since the second episode, which is about 30 minutes or so (if you take out the ads), is being persecuted or followed by something that knows it is demonic. He can't say a name whenever someone needs to tell this name, write it on a piece of paper and pass it on to someone else. Not particularly informative or fun or believable to the rest of us. Why can't he say a name? ... supposedly would give the demon more power. Funny, I always thought demons wanted to hide their true identity. If you know the exact name of the daemon, it's not easier to throw them out. Now the next episode, which airs in just a little while is titled "Exorcism". So Ryan already needs exorcism? Not to say that it couldn't happen, but the show hasn't given any evidence or proof yet. I can tell Ryan that if I were a little child, hell, if I were an adult, and someone gave me a small bottle of holy water to drive out something that frightened me, I would seek help elsewhere! Besides, if you're not using holy water and blessings, etc. The right way, you don't just risk another angry, what's upset with you? I will probably watch tonight, but if these episodes are just as ridiculous as the first one, it will probably be the last time I watch it!
