Watching this movie brings a few words to mind: "sophomoric", "ridiculous", "improbable", "self-indulgent" and finally (and mortally), "boring". Poorly directed, poorly photographed and misbehaved, the film is a confusing mess with conspiratorial lines (if they can be called such) that rotate in all directions. Someone can use a five-year finger print as a template. As a punishment for this childish crime movie, this cast of "stars" should be sounded and sent to the appropriate beds without dinner. . All in all, George seems to have needed an apology to pay with his little friends for the paid summer vacation, and we pay for it. Bad George! Bad!
