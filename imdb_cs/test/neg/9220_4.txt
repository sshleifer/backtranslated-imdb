POSSIBLE BEST SPOILER <br /> <br /> It's not a very objective review, but I just found that this film is terribly depressing. Like much of Russell T. Davies' work <br /> <br /> he asks more questions than he can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) looks forward to hope and perseverance even after seeming defeat. It seems that these uplifting motives were strangely absent. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it is a few days after the show to testify to the quality of the program, but the decision was too bleak for my tastes. But I would not agree with the reviews I read that I complain that the end feels "pinned". I think every conclusion logically comes from his premise and the end was a healthy personal belief that neatly solved the primary theme of the show. Although I have never questioned the progress of the events, I felt that there could be a lot of expansion. I also read that it was originally conceived as a four-part series instead of two, and it is possible that the shortening of the finished piece has damaged. However, these errors appear throughout, in sequences and topics that sometimes feel rough or outlined in. <br /> <br /> To his credit Davies is utterly fearless to write great, and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project. The assumption that he is dealing here is a matter of movies or novels? It's a brave and ambitious thing to deal with on TV. Strong points include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively fascinating in leadership. For me he was and remains the best reason to watch. The depiction of the humanity of the Messiah was a brilliant, provocative and engaging and real recognition of both Davies' writing and Eccleston's acting. I also thought that showing the reaction of the modern world to the second coming was true. So two stars just because I personally want my fun to be fun. I'd rather be uplifted or at least distracted by my fiction. Do I have a whole real world around me? filtered through CNN or newspapers - if I choose to be terribly depressed. There are certainly less subjective reasons to judge this piece, but I'm afraid my judgment in this matter is shrouded in my emotional response.
