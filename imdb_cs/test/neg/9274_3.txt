The film has a good story, the action is good in some parts, but not all of them. Some parts, I just felt as if the evil evil had not yet gotten out of my martial arts experience. Some are actions that are long, as always mostly for the boss, but for the least important, they were killed or postponed with a few hits, but some where it was quite unrealistic or could do a better job on. The least important actors or sensational people were the right choice for the movie, my girlfriend started having a crush on them that she started watching the movie more than she spends her time with me. The film is good, that's all I can say.
