Killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. Bad play, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, you name it. Frankly, I'm not so surprised that more people have seen this movie. The only reason I watched Killjoy 2 is that I wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. No. This movie is just as bad, if not worse, than the first one. The clown ... the damn clown ... I hate him! So I hate him! And I hate him because he's a good villain ... I hate him because he's uncomfortable! I hope the filmmakers once again after the attempt and failure have convinced them that this film is irreparable. The last thing we need is Killjoy 3.
