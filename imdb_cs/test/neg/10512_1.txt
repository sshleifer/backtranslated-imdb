I rented this movie and expected it to suck, and it didn't let me go. I rented it with friends as a joke. But what we got was worse than anyone could imagine. <br /> <br /> Before you take it out of the box, it starts to suck. Looks like Blade rip-off and the guy on the cover is nowhere in the movie. His name is Vampire Assassin, but isn't he a murderer who kills for rent? Well, this guy kills his own will, so it doesn't make him a killer. Then, when you actually insert a disc, it gets the worst. First, the menu animation is lame. But when you actually start a movie, every thing from design to lighting (or lack thereof) is terrible. You know the movie is bad when you even suck credits. The effect is ridiculous. The event is childish. Writing is basic. And directing is the worst
