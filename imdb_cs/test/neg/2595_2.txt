Have you ever seen one of those shows that have become so popular that they could eventually get away with any nonsense nonsense and repetitive half-tricks that the creators can get rid of? If you don't, then you've never seen Family Guy. The fans of the show seem to consider it funny, irritable and engaging. It's none of this, but it's boring, repetitive, offensive and uninspired. "Humor" comes from two sources. <br /> <br /> 1) Irrelevant idiots. The show often has flashbacks on things that have nothing to do with the storyline and are usually just absurd and meaningless. And then there are random links to movies in which the characters from the show re-enact the scene from the popular movie without parodying it effectively. . . or parody it at all (which is not FUNNY !!!!!). <br /> <br /> 2) The same crap that is in every episode of the show. This guy is a sexual deviant with STD, AHA HA! Isn't it funny?! Hey, you know what's even more fun? Making the same joke about him anywhere between one and fifteen times in one episode. And don't just say it many times in one episode, make sure you drag it so that the whole scene is dedicated to just telling the joke. Now also imagine that this same routine is used over and over again for virtually every character in the series. The unusual humor of "un-PC" is not like "un-PC", as they usually believe, what ants think about the latest headlines, politicians, and random celebrities. The series was a while, but now I think it's time to go into the air and do it. <br /> <br /> Do you know what's funny? I like more than Nausicaa from the wind valley.
