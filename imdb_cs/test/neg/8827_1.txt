I've never seen any real action or drama or comedy in all the episodes. The story is so repetitive. **** Someone gets something old and then tells someone else about it and how much it costs and who did it and where it came from and how much it was sold and if it was any work. Sowhile, I was looking at 30 of them, I realized ... not a drama ... no one will ever lose a limb or a life, or divorce or hit a car or a plane. There are no chases or explosions - not even horse racing with old buggies. All those weapons and swords, and no one is guilty of a deadly spree ... what is he giving? No pshycos, no ax-murders, no-gun-totting English in bad suits ... yap yap yap yap ... you have an old tea set and it came from Germany back in 1602 - blah blah blah. .. <br /> <br /> I'm still waiting for someone who has a time machine to go to the screen and ask about it, but no ... it never happens and the only thing that happens is that some stuffy stuff An Englishman or a woman during the Ming dynasty serves some bullshit about something that has been sold in Boston or China - the great EFFIN store. Can't one kidnap one of the leaders and hold them ransom? Is there no foreign spacecraft that would destroy the entire floor? Who the hell is he writing as a show and expecting to be awake? It's as fun as observing a dry color - with just a comment. There is no sex, no comedy or romance, no action, no tension, no action, no drama, no secret or martial arts. <br /> <br /> This show is upset! What happened to supermodels wearing thong and spewing lasers from a futuristic weapon? Antiques Roadshow - more like grab a blanket and pillow and go to sleep show ...
