This 3-hour miniseries made for television came back from Blockbuster this weekend. The production company has spent a lot of money on sets, costumes (especially Bridget Fonda) and special effects (including a great talking polar bear & reindeer). They were supposed to spend a little more money to get a coherent scenario. The story was so free that it never really happened. One can overlook the Irish-stressed German, but not the actor-jerking narrative. With nonsensical loose ends that included a strange guest appearance of the devil, this is certainly not meant to be a Christmas classic. Too bad they lost unnecessarily the good performance of both female leaders.
