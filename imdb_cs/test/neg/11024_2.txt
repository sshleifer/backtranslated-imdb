Inefficient, molly-coddled, self-regretful, miserable provider Jimmy Stewart has a bad marriage to Carole Lombard. After falling for hard times, he endures humiliating work, detecting defects, a passive aggressive mother who survives in life and is in dire need of an epic smackdown and an infinitely crying baby. The film blurs in failure and breaks into no recognizable end. Do you want to see a couple of bicker with his mom ninety minutes? Many scenes have a baby screaming. The film can't explain why we want to endure a mother from hell, or why Jimmy Stewart can't grow up a couple. Who wanted to see it? Who wanted to see Stewart and Lombard without laughter or magic? It's completely depressing and unbearable.
