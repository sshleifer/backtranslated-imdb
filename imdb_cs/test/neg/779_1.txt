Perhaps if you were smoking enough weeds, it would seem funny, or would nostalgically consider you to be completely relaxed in the early 1970s. It's a strange innocence for this movie, and sex is much more embarrassing and playful than steel professionals who do it for cameras now. film - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. It was a Ford model and it shows. Has a classic, WASP-ish good look - like a really cute little girl Ivy League. So what the hell is he doing in this cheap, cheesy skin? From my point of view, she doesn't seem to be at all on drugs in this movie (which might explain it), and she seems to be doing this part incredibly. When he sings his first song, he really does, as if she thinks it's Julie Andrews, or something like that. I just feel that the girl really believed it would be her big break, or something, instead of being a close career killer. By the way, she's pretty damn cute and you can't believe she would even get naked on the screen, much less doing a masturbation scene, a couple of oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then make a real deal as a peak to the movie (snark). This is also not a double body at all. This is our little Kristina, who will marry one for the team, or for the showbiz fame or something. It's amazing to watch and it certainly stimulates (ahem), but in a way I wish it didn't. It was a very pretty, talented young girl who got really bad advice. Anyway, I think Kristine Debell, wherever she is, has long, wished long for this movie to disappear. She was very cute and attractive in "Meatballs". Almost impossible to believe it is the same girl - but it is.
