I love how everyone treats this show as if it were another big American sitcom. I watched five episodes of this abomination and the only person who approached the real teacher was the old person he loved and hated his work. The rest were just handsome people trying to read lines written by people who never went to the real class. I loved how each episode consisted of two idiots (the one who stood up and the other who did not) who got into some form of zone problems that indirectly influenced their students. A British girl who thought she had found a nice quality in the main idiot, but was somewhat shocked in some way that it was hell. The hot chick that was there for a particular purpose to be hot, and the chief and her listener, which served to shift almost non-existent plot ahead. I loved how almost all the teachers at this show were very young, but I ask you to return to your high school days and remember the teachers you had. . . did they look like this? Or did you go to high school that taught her middle age? This is a high school that everyone else went to. The show lacked some form of research on what's going on in schools. In public schools, headmasters do not have the power to senior and fire teachers, the school board does, but in every episode I watched, the main teachers threatened her teacher. Remember your class history. . . . . Or are you thinking about a class of history, have you ever seen an incredibly hot British cat teaching American History? No. Have you ever seen a teacher's room that is so huge that you could actually play basketball? No. Teachers could have been a great show if they actually stood up in some form of reality. What makes learning fun is the stories you get from interacting with students, and teachers consider it fun because they deal with students day after day. Excessive emphasis on their lives outside of school made him four more camera situation comedies that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment and called themselves unrealistic lines, and I'm sorry I just didn't buy it. The show could model itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single-camera format, and it should have more focused more relates to teachers with their students and not with each other. It gets a star for a try and a star for a hot chick (it was really hot). Finally, it was a failed sitcom that goes into history when hacks try to understand the profession. I just hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes, monsters like this never touch the TV screen.
