I don't understand what the big hype was about this movie. All the horror sites said this film has all the essentials of an "old American slasher" that will satisfy your needs. - Although it was similar to an old American flick, my needs were not yet satisfied. My big problem with this movie is that we are now in 2000, not in the 1980s. The horror of the 1980s is a thing of the past and should be in the past. Horror movies have changed so much that older movies now look cheesy and unrealistic. While they are fun to watch, they don't offer the same realistic blood thirst gore that recent movies offer. Hatchet is cheesy, unrealistic, and down-right horrible. If we wanted to watch an old American slasher swing, I can only go back to the fifth 13th series, a nightmare on the Elm Street series, or a Halloween series. I have to admit that the film is better than some of the horror movies that are being released, but one of the worst. Jokes are not funny and the actors are terrible. <br /> <br /> I would personally stay away from this movie and never look back.
