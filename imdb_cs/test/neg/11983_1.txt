It's not a very good movie. Sure, it includes action, but the effects aren't as good for the '08 movie. Firing effects are downright horrible. Acting is "meh" <br /> <br /> It's nothing but Far Cry, except the names and foundations of the story (genetically enhanced super soldiers amok). Super soldiers are very different, mercenaries are different, the environment is completely different (a tropical island in the Pacific, an island in North-ish America in the movie). <br /> <br /> I loved playing Far Cry. I loved the story and the environment. I hated the movie.
