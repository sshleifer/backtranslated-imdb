After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I couldn't quite figure out why so many people liked it. It wasn't "pleasing" or "smart"; it was just the amalgam of all the other "mismatched people who had gathered during the holiday season and despite their ideological differences that had learned something about themselves", the movie he had ever done. Characters are the stereotype of bouillabaisse - we have Blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians and homosexuals - and never do anything except what everyone expects to be characters in a movie like this. The Black Mother claims it's "okay," when it is mentioned that another black character is in the church instead of helping to prepare dinner (because all blacks love the church), Hispanics seem to be able to speak Spanish only when they greet each other or they make screams, lesbians do nothing but cuddle and kiss (and one of them wears a scarf. Because all lesbians dress like Ani DiFranco) and a Vietnamese family owns a video shop. Imagine it. Oh, and the movie is called "What is Cooking" because every ethnic family cooks a different version of what they think Thanksgiving dinner should be! Black mother wants corn bread and macaroni and cheese, Hispanics are depicted by rolling tortillas, Vietnamese family is fried spring roll; I was surprised that there was no bottle of Manischewitz on the Jewish table. All this is shown in the time-honored tradition of "musical-montage", where they play "Surf" with "Wipeout" and quickly switch the instruments used in melody to reflect the respective cultures. Isn't it cute? When the director completes and discovers everyone else, he tries to show the inner humanity that we, as all people of every race, religion, and culture, share inventing unlikely and too dramatic conflicts for each of the families we deal with. . It would be a killer plot to mention what each of these conflicts are, but calm that they are actually a surprise, that is, if you were sleeping for the first half of the movie. The theme of "dishonoring the family" is very strong. All in all, if you are the kind of person who enjoys new films that blend into stories of improbable characters that blend together, Well, you won't like this movie. If you like the widespread assembly of foods that are passed around the table, then you have to put them in the Netflix queue. However, if you are admired by stereotypes and clich√©s, make sure you ask for it at Christmas. Or Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa.
