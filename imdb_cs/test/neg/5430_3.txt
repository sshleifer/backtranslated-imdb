I was just watching Congo on DVD. In most cases I love these movies, but this is different. It made me write my first IMDb movie commentary. I was amazed at how such a team of experienced filmmakers could come up with this film. You can see that there was a lot of money for this production, but you can't make a good movie unless you have a good script. And as a producer, Frank Marshall gave us a lot of great movies we could watch; he should never have tried to become another Spielberg. This one shows how hard it is to make a good movie, maybe you have all the ingredients, but if you can't cook, stay out of the kitchen. If you can make a proposal do not spend your money on this one. If you want to see that you're watching it first on TV and think of your own mind.
