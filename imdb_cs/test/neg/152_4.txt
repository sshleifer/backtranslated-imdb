Frankie Muniz plays Jason, a high school student. His biggest problem is that his life is built on small or large lies that get him into trouble most of the time. But he cannot escape from his teacher and finish his homework just before the deadline. While he is cycling to quickly submit his tasks to the teacher, he crushes it into the car. As he explains the situation to a grumpy man (Giamatti) in his car, he gives him a lift to his school. But the problem is that Jason leaves homework in the car, another way to say it's Marty Wolf (Giamatti) steals. it snaps. Because the story of the film is based on his homework. He tells his parents, but of course he doesn't trust him. Especially his father uses the words that offend him. Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses, Jason takes steps and destroys his life. This is the short story of Big Fat. As a movie for kids, it could be a light heart, but there are also mistakes that might ask if it's possible. For example, having such a small amount of money and going to LA with a friend to solve the problem, have access to a highly protected house and the office of this cinema producer, set up a telecommunications system overnight. It is not. Well this is a movie for kids, but kids aren't so trusting. Big Fat Liar offers a little pleasure to its target groups. Unfortunately I'm not a big fat liar to say it's a good movie. ** outside *****
