Yet another recent comedy that shows that Hollywood can't even make the basics when it comes to filmmaking that it has made in its sleep for decades. If a writer / director had a brain, they would create a film around Stamp's character, boss Jack Taylor. When she's early in the movie, it's nothing special, but it's slightly hopeful and sometimes fun. After leaving for most of the movie and Kutcher having his "merry" adventure house-sitting down with a guest after a boring guest, the film falls apart. As a result, what should be a clear timer will turn into an inept stinker.
