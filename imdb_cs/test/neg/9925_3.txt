Like I love Ellen Barkin (who is really underestimated), I have to make this movie. If you can't tell who did it And why in the first half hour you've obviously never seen a psycho-sex thriller or you've never seen 20/20. It's like filmmakers and the actors didn't care that the way they were shooting and the way they played the characters would be a dead gift. Overall, this film serves to turn dirty perverts, who like to mix violence and sex. It's not a fun movie to go through, even if you like Ellen Barkin, it's nice to see her place as a tough lady.
