If I were a Brit, I'd be embarrassed by this depiction of incompetence. Special Branch Protective Agent who can't defend himself against a sick, unarmed and untrained attacker? The Home Office will send a single "science advisor" to investigate a possible biological threat at level four, and that "advisor" doesn't make sense to wear a mask or gloves? Totally unprotected police officers from London working side by side with technicians in a full biological suit? "Counselor" and his bodyguards, who carry the sociopathic lair, experiment on human subjects without any backup? Puh-leeze! One wonders whether manufacturers could afford to hire any technical advisors, or if for some mysterious reason they deliberately decided to display the principles as hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who has no experience in medicine or law enforcement, turned her eyes in disbelief. I was discouraged after the first episode; now that I've seen two episodes, I'm giving up.
