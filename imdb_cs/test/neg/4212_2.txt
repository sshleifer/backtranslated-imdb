Breaker! Breaker! Chuck Norris is a truck driver and karate champion, talking about juggling two disparate careers. He puts a burden he can't deliver to his younger brother Michael Augenstein and then, when the young man doesn't appear, Chuck is looking for him. What the young Augenstein got is the speed-trap run by Judge George Murdock who comes from Roy Bean School of Jurisprudence. Of course, Norris is dealing with Chuck Norris's usual ways and when he gets in trouble, the call goes through CB for all truckers to come and help their good friend. This speed trap, known as Texas City, has a bad reputation and drivers are too happy to help a friend. Of course Chuck is, of course, a little younger without a beard. He has a narrow X-ray view of a man who realizes that the academy won't look at this gobler. George Murdock overcomes disgustingly as the likes of Roy Bean. <br /> <br /> This one is strictly for Chuck Norris fans.
