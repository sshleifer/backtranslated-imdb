Oh, dear! What did they think? Terrible scenario, horrible action. Even the actors don't like it very much ... they took the checks into the bank and smiled happily. <br /> <br /> Since then at Bank? Why are vehicles crossing the Tower Bridge towards the city when they hit a surge? Why isn't Tower Bridge crowded when the city is evacuated? How does Carlyle dive into a furious torrent and survive? I could go on ... and on. There is no real sense of urgency in the command room. They could also wait for England to return to the court after the masters' tea interval. He says something when I'm waiting for adsbreaks to learn more about treating diarrhea with eager expectations. <br /> <br /> Totally repulsive waste!
