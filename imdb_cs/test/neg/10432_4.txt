I saw it on a DVD screener a few months before it was released. <br /> <br /> I liked the main characters and the overall story, but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. The sets fit, but a few of them looked like left overs from Freaks & Geeks, or reminded me of a commercial cell phone that was shot in the middle class. Definitely not what the DVD envelope claims, "Designed to be the next stoner classic", barely. The wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene featured the guitar it was on. The sound design was a bit bad. Less would be best.
