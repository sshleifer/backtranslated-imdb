Invoiced as a romantic comedy against the early years of World War II. The problem is that, while beautifully photographed, he has no consistent story or story. It starts out as a mysterious murder, offering no chance to its actors as it is drawn through recent history. Depardieu is wasted in a trivial role that he apparently is not happy with playing. Adjani cannot carry the image. Hero is not; apparently the imitation of Hitchcock's "wrongly accused" role lacks balance. Neither heroic, comic nor thrilling. It could have been a good movie. I remind me of "The Lady Vanishes", which has combined tension, romance and comedy in a serious fascist film.
