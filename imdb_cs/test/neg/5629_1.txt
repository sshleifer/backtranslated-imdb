SPOILERS FOLLOW - And I didn't even see it. Let me guess ... murder is associated with a bad property developer who wants to develop a waterfront and Dickens was murdered because he was trying to uncover a similar plot. If somebody who saw me could let me know if I'm half right, you saved me the time it could take to look at something worthwhile and the rest of us would know how to get rid of this one filmmakers and his enthusiastic reviewers. On the other hand, it sounds * interesting; but if it was good, would it really be * gone with a Sunday rag? And what kind of record does Foley have anyway? So, as a public service, I managed to sit. It's worse than 'Swept away'. Really. I've read eight-year stories with more drama than this. Really terrible. And I was right.
