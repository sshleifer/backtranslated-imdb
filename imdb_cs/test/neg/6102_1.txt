Obviously, the director, writers, and everyone else knows nothing about their religion or the people who practice it. This film is endlessly defective and totally perfect overall. For example, there is a scene where a rabbi enters a female ritual bath while a naked woman bathes, puts her hand on the woman's head and blesses her. This is a complete mockery of laws, in this scene some of the broken laws themselves include: Modesty, a rabbi would never enter a ritual bath house while there is a woman in it. Wrong contact, the rabbi would never put a hand on a woman's head, not to mention the fact that the blessing is given. A woman from a ritual bath dips a naked woman by shoving her head under the laws of ritual bathing, requiring the whole body to be in direct contact with the water in the bath; that is, no one should be in contact with the person who is bathing, certainly not pushing them under! to mention the rest of the film was a complete delusion. It is scary what ignorance can invent!
