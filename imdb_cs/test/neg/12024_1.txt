What to say about "Dead End Road" ... <br /> <br /> Let's say Edgar Allen Poe is ashamed. Acting, writing, effects and everything in this movie was just terrible. Not even justice! This movie was the biggest piece of waste I ever had to sit. That's why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the end because I didn't personally care what happened to the characters. I saw bad, but it was definitely the worst. I was excited about this because I am a Poe fan and that was bad. Just wrong. <br /> <br /> What makes me more upset is that you can't rate negative numbers.
