This is a movie that largely sounded mortal to the author in Hollywood. For over $ 40 million, the Gate of Heaven is so poorly conceived and executed that it would take a lifetime to break every area of ​​failure. What really attracts me the most is that it is technically a very bad, unforgivable sin for the money that got into it. John Hurt's opening speech at Harvard is inaudible, as is Kris Kristofferson's and Richard Masur's interview at the station. Some people think that Cimino meant it as a "style". No. It's just a bad soundtrack. Characters are not particularly well drawn except for four or five lines; in a scenic battle scene it's hard to tell who's bad and who's a good boy. Even at this level it is impossible to enjoy a movie. Casting Isabelle Huppert as a madam city is a joke, her French accent makes the whole character fraud. The action is generally stiff, without any extent or depth of feeling; even Christopher Walken is bad. John Hurt's character is the only one with any fluctuation or vitality (although Hurt, at the age of 40, playing a freshly met Harvard grad with bags under his eyes is obviously ridiculous). I think I'm saying it's too long. Roller skating could be easily cut out, the cockfight scene quickly becomes a movie cliché, and the last scene aboard the ocean liner is just off the Twilight Zone. If Rod Serling had appeared in front of the camera at the end to explain what we were watching, it would be a perfect final. In fact, these scenes are not bad in themselves, but Cimino did not deserve the right to include them, because what he gave us as the "meat" of the picture is so badly bad. The cut is bad, especially in the great climax of the battle. At one point, the same explosion with the same vehicle that flies from the explosion is used three times. I wish I said something - something nice about this movie: great scene, great performance, even one unforgettable line of dialogue, but I can't. It's just one big mess. The only thing I did was cinematography and places in Montana that are stunning. Even Cimino couldn't be confused. This is a long, boring, bad movie of all standards. And people who say it gets bashed just because the cost of overruns are just kidding themselves. 1/2 * of 4
