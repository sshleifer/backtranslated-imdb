I saw it at the start when I was nine. Everything I remember is a few scenes (those where the main character Elle is being chased by the guy in the mask) and is scared. When I saw it, my opinions changed. It's a pathetic "horror" movie about ophanage run by Gloria Grahame (sad), dealing with a young, talented girl Elle who is sent there after her mother, a city hiker, was beaten to death by a hammer (graphically shown). The film is defeated, tortured, killed, starved, attacked by meat cleavers, raped, etc. Apod. The murder of a brutal hammer is the opening scene and then deteriorates and worsens. There is nothing to recommend this crap. The story is stupid, all dialogue is bad and actingâ€¦ the less they say, the better. How does it get sick with GP (now PG) ranking? It gets R. Valuable. One last thing ... a really nasty twist that suggests incest!
