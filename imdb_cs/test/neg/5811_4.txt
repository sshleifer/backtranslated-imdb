I fully agree with the previous reviewer. There is no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr, and the film focuses on their relationship. Hedy Lamarr is not her best and Spencer Tracy seems naive, simple and too hopeful - in love and life; the idealistic role that played the best in 'Boys Town'. If you can do it through the ridiculous crowd scene at the train station ... whoa ... it's a grotesque and not worthy of any cast in cast. It's not the best for someone. Incorrect and inadequate. The story is empty and there is a distinct and non-free entry. Hedy Lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself, which is really the best part of the movie. Spencer Tracy doesn't match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the film doesn't look believable for that reason.
