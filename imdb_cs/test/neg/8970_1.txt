I will never forget to watch this show around the age of 13. Even at a young age, I remembered that: "This is a Baywatch rip off show without one thing that makes Baywatch tolerant. Girls in swimsuits." Yet in those days I was too small to hold a remote control in my house. The highlight of Pacific Blue was an episode in which a couple of fired gangsters are approaching somebody to kill somebody submachine guns ... on bikes !!! As a thirteen-year-old, I had never been so strong about something to be taken seriously. I also knew that the task of going out and getting Uzis (for murder) is a task that should never come before you borrow some car for the day. That was the decisive moment of the show. Simple crimes and situations tailored to hack writing so that they can be taken care of by the unrestrained hero of the world to fight the crime, Bike Cop. He won't get the power of the Dumber.
