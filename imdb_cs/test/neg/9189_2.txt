At first I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in a parachuting unit (guys who call when earthquakes and real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I had some training and simulation but I have no real life experience. However, there are still some points that you will notice as absolutely incredible. I understand they have removed their mouths / masks and there is not enough smoke because the public would not see anything else. But some things go against the logic: <br /> <br /> - No second mask is attached to oxygen. How the hell do you want to save people through smoke without it? <br /> <br /> - Abseiling people. No, it's not like that. I would also shout if someone hung me with a rope like this and hung me off the building. If I could scream, it is, and not pass from lack of air, because the rope squeezes my lungs. The second time when they're aligning Jack is better but still weird. <br /> <br /> - "Head high". No, you damn no. You always fight with fire as low as possible. You do not want to fight, if you want to sprinkle flames, you will want to extinguish the fire and it is under the flames. <br /> <br /> - No discipline. They run around like chicken. And they still shout instead of using the radio and keeping the discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactics. Why don't they work in teams of at least two? You can still separate, but it will take a lot more than if everyone was just looking for victims to find victims. <br /> <br /> - Do they really enter buildings without bringing water? Even Europe, firefighters would never enter a burning building without. <br /> <br /> - Firefighters on the roof. WTF thinks they do it without safety lines or water? - Exploding rooms. Wood and brick do not explode unexpectedly. Better points are actually camaraderie and other unfortunate parts of the movie. It's a lot of kitsch, but that's okay. I'll give it for it.
