I had this movie, I saw it at the back of my head. I wanted to tell people about it again and again, but I never remembered it. I found it now. I can finally tell people exactly what is absolutely the worst, most miserable movie I've ever seen in my whole life, there is no bar. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete waste and is not suitable for the garbage dump. All copies and other copies of this film should be rounded into a large rocket and released to the sun. only the cleansing heat and the pressure of the sun could be able to purify the materials on which this film is stored so that they can be useful again for the universe. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies. and yes, this is an opinion. but this film was a clean waste, dirt and excrement of a beast that should never be seen, let alone named by man. I'd rather watch the Uwe Boll Movie marathon than watch this movie. and I hate Uwe Boll movies.
