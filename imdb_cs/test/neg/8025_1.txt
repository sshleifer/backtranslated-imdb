Having learned that some of the people behind the low-budget fluctuations "Terror in Rock'n'Roll Önsjön" and "That came from space ... and things" have taken part in the creation of this film, I decided to buy an invisible DVD. I wish I didn't. Other movies were funny, on the tongue and a little silly. While Kraftverk 3714 has no humor at all. And it's so divine that I'm just annoyed by thinking about it. The worst possible actors, the worst possible scenario, the worst available special effects. And most sex scenes. Uhhh. And the whole thing lasts 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please never do another movie.
