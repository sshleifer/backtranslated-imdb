From what I remember seeing this movie, it wasn't good. I always say that if the film is good and it can keep you in the most difficult moments (such as the Tylenol Cold & Sinus War) than the film that did its job. The fact that most of this film has fallen asleep proves that it could not keep my attention and ergo did not finish my job. Why did I become a victim of Tylenol Cold & Sinus when I had a movie in my arsenal? <br /> <br /> Committed didn't make any sense to get started. The behavior was bad and the overall story left more open doors that simply could not be closed. I mean the moment I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this movie) kissing. That made no sense. Then a scene with Affleck and his roommate appeared, suggesting that he was sleeping with one of them, almost breaking the perfect lesbian couple. I suppose it was supposed to show that most of them were not as devoted to the relationship as Graham was, but to me it was nothing more than a fill. I have this suspicious feeling that the director of this movie was sleeping with Affleck. His work in this film was cruel. I've never seen him do "good" negotiations, but that was by far the worst. Oh, I just had another moment during the battle, what I thought, and I confirmed it with IMDb.com ... what did John Stewart do in this movie? That was another moment when my eyes only opened for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever. And honestly, it's Heather Graham - after a while, we could take care of her less. It's just uninteresting - it's just unreal, boring and basically stops acting after a while. While they are desperate to throw crazy characters into the mix to revive the movie, it just doesn't work and instead of just saying it, they start throwing more characters into the mix, so it's just weird, boring, boring and really, really long. Luke Wilson's slow acting style slows down the creepy film to a dead stop - why did these two get married? Determined is a really horrible movie - a kind of "hip comedy" that will leave you overwhelmed with depression and bored. <br /> <br /> Level: * outside *****
