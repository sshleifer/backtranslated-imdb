I must say that I found this film very disappointing. Yes, I know that Maltin gave him 3 1/2 and others think it very well. But, the operatic sequence was divine. I take this Jeanne MacDonald's taste gained. Yes, in the short sequences I saw with Nelson Eddy, he is extremely favored. But on her own ... God, she does not like opera and despise operetta, and she is basically unbearable. At one point I had to cover my ears. Gable is fine and Tracy is fired. The storyline is annoying in JM never tells Gable that he loves him and opera and why can't he do both? Instead, it suffers quietly (or not) with the compromises it makes. The support cast is clearly unchangeable. In addition to the star three and Jack Holt (and I assume his mother), they are all just backgrounds and forgotten. The EQ sequence is the only thing that saves the film. And simply. Yes, it's quite spectacular and moving. However, it seems that "oh god is great". I really prefer "Old Chicago" when it comes to old times of disaster. Save yourself on this.
