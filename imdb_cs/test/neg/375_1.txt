This time, Beastmaster (Marc Singer) returns only to oppose the new enemy Arklon (Wings Hauser), but due to the annoying teenager (Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future, where they will be taken away. Lots of (lame) fish from water jokes follow. You honestly don't understand the continuation of this rotten core. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie. Links and "hipness" date movie wrong (This was done in 1991) and really who wants to see Beastmaster at the moment? Also remarkable is Wings Hauser, who is embarrassed, it's the best movie. The singer looks awkward, Wuher is irritating and the whole slang of 1991 makes the movie unpredictable. This is easily one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 (horrible)
