Part II of the Toxic Avenger begins with a surprising revelation that after Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura, who was apparently fired during production and replaced by Ron Fazio), got rid of his hometown of Tromaville Evil, in fact, has become a pleasant place to live. This meant that Toxie no longer had any use as a superhero and now suffers from depression and a sense of utter uselessness (just as directors Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz should feel like they did), Toxie is now working as a concierge in the Tromaville Blind Center . It's not long before the problems back is an ugly head though, a bad chemical company called Apocalypse Inc. He plans to take over Tromaville for some stupid insignificant reason or other, but to do so, the need to get rid of Toxie. After Rick Collins' first plan, he fails to bribe Toxie (Erika Schickel), a psychiatrist, to tell him to go to Japan to see his Father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), his mother (Jessica Dublin) and his home to Toxie heading to Tokyo, Japan. Once, Toxie sets out to seek her Father, and a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps him in his quest. Meanwhile, in Tromaville, Apocalypse Inc. moved to kill and without Toxie citizens are helplessly defending. Toxie finally finds Big Mac Bunka (Rikiya Yasuoka), whom he believes to be his father, but Big Mac is part of Apocalypse Inc. plans to destroy Toxie once and for all ... Produced and directed by Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz following the successful The Toxic Avenger (1985) basically proves that the first film was a complete mood, a happy accident to combine the right mix bad taste comedy, outrageous violence and so bad - It's a good movie creation, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is compared to the load. Kaufman, Phil Rivi and Gay Partington Terry with a number of "additional materials" credits do not contain one single funny moment throughout the 102 (Unmanaged Director). Visual gags are horrible, Toxie goes through Tokyo with a wig and glasses to mix for example, or a scene where she warms up in a bath with a bad guy in it & how to cook Toxie plunges on vegetables and spaghetti, a scene where electric wires stick up a woman's nose, holding in the antenna head and microphone in her mouth, spoken by a Japanese radio announcer, a little where a Japanese evil guy has a nose burned into a fish shape A little where Toxie catches the sword's head and uses it as a weapon or embarrassing Bad, silly and silly idiotic facial expressions, a guy who has fish on his head and gets literature into sushi, terrible comic music and sound effects and the whole movie in general is a pale imitation of what made the original slightly fun and memorable. The bad tastes of gags aren't there this time round and the silly childish youthful humor first is also missing, it just feels like a real step back from the original & won't forget it's Troma here, so it's definitely a bad thing. There are several harsh fights and some serious gore and violence, at least in the allegedly uncontrolled 102-minute version I saw, crushed heads with bodies pouring out of blood, broken faces, guts, roses stuck in one's eyes, and thorns wrapped around the throat tore apart arm and very graphical scene as you cut into pieces. Unfortunately, the Pericles Lewnes special effects are not very convincing and come mostly within the first twenty minutes. As I mentioned, these are embarrassing proportions. Action wise is a very cheap looking car chase at the end & a few intrepid, bland fighting using cardboard ninja throwing stars in one place. Horror wise is nothing that separates a few small pieces from each other. Wise comedy is very rude. In fact, The Toxic Avenger, Part II, really sucks at all levels and everything that is going on is also cruel, most of them appear to be taken out of the nearest corner of the street, continuity does not exist, cinematography is a fundamental point to shoot and special effects are different. One or two bloody scenes apart, that is total stupid plain and simple, do yourself a favor and watch the original again.
