You know how you age, somehow you think the movies you didn't like when you were younger could be because of your youth and inexperience. When I saw the Godfather at the age of 14, I thought it was boring. Twenty years later, it's an incredible movie. In other words, I grew up and started to appreciate great movies. So I rented Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend at her request the night she loved him at the age of 14 and I hated him the same way. age. But I was hoping that I was young and stupid at age 14, maybe it would be a new experience for me. So I sat down with her to watch and hope to be enlightened. Well, after watching Dirty Dancing, I feel a breach. I feel that someone has reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of life to watch this cheese festival. First, Patrick Swayze plays for 20 years, but he looks 35 years old. The prerequisite for the film is that it seduces some teenage teenagers, bothering them with their dance moves. Truly scary. Anyway, the film is a clich√© where the "bad side of the tracks" and "rich smart girl" fall in love with each other. Of course, their romance is driven by the fact that a "rich girl" can't dance to lick, so a "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become a professional dancer for a big holiday show, or something like that. But you argued: A disapproving father will soon enter and forbid both to see each other, and the film advances to secret meetings of dance lessons and lovemaking. All this will culminate in the final scene when the entire resort is gathered around two young lovers, while once a hostile father receives a 35-year-old dancer as a new man to his teenage daughter. Even my girlfriend in the end whimpered at the movie when she admitted it was nothing she could remember. I didn't push it, but I grinned a bit and put Part II on the DVD player.
