I can only think of one reason why this movie was released. Earning Upcoming Fame by Guy Pearce. This film has no merit, and Errol Flynn's memory is no longer needed. The homosexual encounter was purely speculation. The contempt shown on Flynn in this film is palpable. An easy way to defame an actor who died years ago. Awful and awkward. Great disappointment. Don't waste your time on this sheer waste. Follow my evil ways to learn about this gentle actor or read his autobiography. This film is not the way.
