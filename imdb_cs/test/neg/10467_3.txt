Now, before I tell you synopsis, it's a review without spoilers. The Bone Eater hits its mark for the worst movie of the year. I don't know how these movies get on DVD. If I saw it in theaters, I would be very upset. Battery Eater is about these people who dig an ancient burial ground and find some bones. It's a 'Bone eater' and the more her bones are, the stronger she gets. First of all, I thought he was fine. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label, it looked scary. But then, when I played it, I could agree on one thing - the name "Bone Eater" is better than the film itself. Tell me what's stupid? The bone eater, who just attacks the throwing bone, ate you and you disappear? Don't worry it's not the spoiler you see in the first 5 minutes. Or is it stupid that 'Bone Eater' has horses? You know what I think is the dumbest? The whole film. <br /> <br /> CGI is terrible. Yeah, I thought the idea of ​​'Bone eater' was scary, but once you see it as an action movie or just a cruel, average joke. The film felt longer than the Titanic and it was half an hour. Once the film has tension moments, it stops. I admit that acting wasn't the best, but really decent, and that violence wasn't exaggerated, but everything else was stinking. Overall, a bone eater is a movie you can skip. If you like interesting movies with big creatures, great CGI and 'Bone Eater' is a movie you can skip. If you like bad movies no matter how cheese they are, then they will satisfy the Bone Eater.
