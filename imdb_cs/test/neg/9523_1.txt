Unlike one of the reviewers listed below, I don't think a huge and glittering career should be ahead of the director of this impolite and tiring piece. While it is good to see a British director trying to break out of the convention's limitation, AKA's only claim to innovation fame is the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think it might prove to be an interesting device, but the only real benefit of the film is to test your eyesight and patience. A vision of the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional film does not mean that it is more revealing or complex. If you can forget about the triple display (which is very difficult if possible), then you will have to deal with an unintentionally successful scenario. The audience is defeated by chiche on chiche about the British class system. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of the episode Upstairs and Downstairs. To sum up: Emperor's new clothes. And bad clothes too.
