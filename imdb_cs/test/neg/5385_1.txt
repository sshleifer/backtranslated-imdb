I recently went for a free screening of a soap girl where they were creators. they looked around, laughed, photographed in front of the film. I was thrilled to see how they dressed in real life and couldn't wait to see the movie on the big screen. During the movie, the audience smiled with laughter. it was clear to me that they were not allowed to see the picture, but in the picture. This is a purely Class B movie without the logic behind it. throw in some nudity, some blood and whaly! you have a movie! After the movie, I approached a group of filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this movie. they were all as serious as serious filmmakers. everyone told me something else: to make a controversial film, a witty movie, an uplifting film, a socially responsible film. everyone mentioned something else. it was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of film they were doing, and now they were trying to get their money back by posting this film so people could see it. Allow me to warn you: don't buy into hype! if you have nothing else to do, it is worth it for the student to study how the film should not be done. otherwise you will save two hours of your life better.
