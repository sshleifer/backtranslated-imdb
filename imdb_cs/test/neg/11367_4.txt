In fact, I liked some things in this game. I loved looking at the first person and I wish we had this choice in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing monsters up close, in the face. Graphics really wasn't bad, but I want to have more things to interact with, even if it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: Movement type sucked and focused on total pain. The story was too lame for words and too much old stuff without originality. Inability to save was terrible !!! Some of us have a life and would like to save up to the end of the game. I thought the guns were also soaked. This game is fun for a while, but it's not like the first three and just good if you just want to shoot. I would recommend this for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it. Play at your own risk.
