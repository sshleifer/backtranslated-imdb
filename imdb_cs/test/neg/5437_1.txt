Let's look at this: there is a civil war, a lost city, a talking gorilla, several regular gorillas, a previously unknown species of albino killer gorilla, the most powerful laser ever recognized. sand, hippos attack, active volcano and hot air balloon packed in a boot in a downed plane. That's not much, is it? I had more coherent dreams ("... and then a Romanian guy picked up a lot of diamonds because it was a lost city he was looking for or something, but then the average gorillas we'd seen before Now a talking gorilla came back from a visit to regular gorillas, and as the type of earthquake or volcano began, a female industrialist / doctor built a weapon using a laser and this big diamond she had just found in the hand of a dead fianc√© ... "). It's an explosion if you're looking for more ammunition against Michael Crichton's pernicious influence in American entertainment (and hence the world of entertainment), and if you keep in mind the extent to which this cynical and half-hearted attempt fell on his face at the box office. But, unfortunately, responsible men - Crichton, sceenwriter John Patrick Shanley, director Frank Marshall - probably never lost a dime. Shame on them and I think so. 1/10
