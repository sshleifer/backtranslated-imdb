I admit that I did not pay full attention to what was going on in this movie, but to be honest, I don't think it mattered. Basically, local councilor Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) convinces the incompetent mayor of Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) of Firecombe to organize a beauty contest to improve the city's image. Faced with the resistance of female liberator Augusta Prodworthy (June Whitfield) trying to sabotage the competition, they have advertising agent Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and owner of Palace Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Young, beautiful models will soon appear, including Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Margaret Nolan's Goldfinger), Debra (Sally Geeson) and Ida Downs (EastEnders' Wendy Richard). When girls have cat fights, they take regular residents, but after a while, which is not funny humorous cues, and William (Jack Douglas), who have too active twitches, they finally get into the competition, and that's only then I couldn't bother. Also starring Patsy Rowlands as Mildred Bumble, Peter Butterworth as Admiral, Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dukes, David Lodge as Police Inspector, Angela Grant as Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as Pratt Board Member, Robin Askwith as Larry, Patricia Franklin as Rosemary, Jimmy Logan Like Cecil Gaybody and Bill Pertwee Dad's Army as Chief of Fire Department, Charles Hawtrey seems to have stopped Carry Ons, but where's Kenneth Williams? I suppose I see Baby and a young, beautiful-looking Pauline Fowler in a bikini, but for a comic value, it fails unhappily, and overuse of a swan whistle just gets nervous. Pretty poor!
