I saw the movie when it first came out and hated it. I saw it again 27 years later. I really liked some of this ... though Robin Williams was totally bad for the role ... I remember most of all that I hate the movie, it was almost the opposite of what I understood when I read the book. Since I have not read it, I can only give you impressions of the past - but I'm sure one thing - the film is a paean to family life, while in the book almost all traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially, marriage - are showing that they are leaks we would get rid of. The only positive in the book is the amazing nature of the kids ... something that only the very beginning and end of the film actually captures (with the incredibly beautiful child sailing in the air. Too bad Williams doesn't have a tenth of his life) He has magic! that the film distorts the book. As a film itself is better - but only a few key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think somebody falls in love with her. And John Lithgow, as a former football player who has a sex change operation, is fantastic ... he never dismissed him, nor did he make a character anything but praiseworthy - and his performance was incredibly integrity. During all his scenes, I watched him closely and never was anything but a woman. Nothing in his performance came close to the queen's performance ... and that made the difference. In fact, of all the people in the movie, his is the only one that is irreversible. It's worth seeing this movie just for its performance.
