If you are a demanding person, it will sound like a good idea to show off your intelligence that says you really like this movie. Otherwise, don't bother and look at something good. This is a stereotype movie for snobs. The plot line would be very stupid if you could see it from start to finish. It is only presented in chaos as an attempt to make it difficult to understand and make the film look intellectual. <br /> <br /> Mullholland Drive is not nice to watch. When you see it for the first time, you rarely understand. And if so, you'll most likely be disappointed because it's not a big deal.
