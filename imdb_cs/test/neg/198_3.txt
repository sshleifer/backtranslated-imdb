When I was once friends on my first movie (pretty bad videotape), I said I could grow; Orson Welles' first movie was even worse. He called me that it couldn't be, so I pulled Criterion laserdisc (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEATTS of AGE. My friend only lasted a few minutes before this point was decided. There's a bit of humor in this short movie, but it's basically like pretentious as (and maybe a collegiate answer to) SKIN POET and another avant. films of that time. This is what it is: a sequence of images with an indefinite theme, and if you really like any shots of Welles (in heavy makeup, boot), it is not really worth watching.
