Frankly, the people who gave this film ten would give 100 for fiction. This is the level we are dealing with here. The movie isn't bad, but it's not like "OMG, the best Pulp Fiction movie!". Some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those indie varieties. Personally, I found interest in a film that disappeared after a half-hour mark. The story surrenders to logic and faith. You have to hear a part about why the woman did what she did to "save her husband". Yeah, right. I guarantee you would leave theatrical thinking, "hmm, now it doesn't make any sense at all." This is one movie in which you really have to suspend all the logic and beliefs. Those who said the music score was good probably listened to their MP3 players. It absolutely killed the movie in some parts. Finally, watch the movie only if you have nothing to do. I give it three because there is one long sexual sequence at the motel that is decent.
