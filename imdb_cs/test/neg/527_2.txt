This movie moved too slowly for my taste. The concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it examines the dynamics of a family living with a mentally retarded family member in a way I have not seen on screen before. the implementation of this concept was flawed. Each character was developed entirely inside the scene of her first appearance, then had to endure the feeling that each character treads water for the rest of the trip. Relationships with others in a film that I thought was a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose it has artistic merit, given the irony that the story focuses on an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by a way of above-average news friends and family. However, the negotiations were, without exception, well done. I agree with other reviewers that cinematography was beautiful. and cinematography, but fails at the emotional level due to the shortcomings described.
