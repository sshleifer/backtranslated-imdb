Perhaps the weakest movie in the "Kharis" series, despite John Carradin's presence (miscast as Egyptian priest) and George Zucco (as his predecessor, cheerfully affected by the bad case of Parkinson's disease) supporting Lon Chaney Jr. titular creature - if it is really under the bandage because its contribution is at best negligible! It's traceable for 60 minutes in myself, I think, but the standards have dropped considerably compared to the two previous records, and the end result is strictly unforgettable. The only interesting feature is the fact that female leadership becomes a reincarnation of Princess Ananka, who has been mentioned in earlier films, but has never actually seen her.
