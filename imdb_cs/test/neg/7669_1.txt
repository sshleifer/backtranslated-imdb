WARNING ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The Lord knows I've seen some bad movies in my time and this is annoying me anyway. This is an insult to people looking at a bad movie. "The Story" includes a flight attendant who discovers that her boyfriend (poorly bred by otherwise great Robert Wagner) is a murder, a thief, and just an overall face. After the Concorde takes off, he sends missiles to destroy the Concorde. So while Concorde travels at light speed, our "hero" (played with utter stupidity, George Kennedy) then opens the cockpit window, then holds OUT WINDOW's hand to fire on the rocket! I am no rocket scientist, but his hand seems to have at least burned the wind. Then, to the ultimate "climax" when Concorde heads to a disaster and everyone dies, the passenger turns to his fianc√© and suggests a marriage. The priest just happens to be sitting in the next row and continuing to take them when the planes crash! Wow, the one who wrote the script had to sniff the glue for a week.
