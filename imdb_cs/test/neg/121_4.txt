Isaac Florentine has done some of the best Western martial arts action movies ever produced. Especially US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can say that Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always busy, creative and sharp, with some of the best fighting sequences a fan of action might hope for. Especially he found a muse with Scott Adkins, as a talented actor and action artist as you could have hoped. This is confirmed with special forces and undisputed 2, but unfortunately Shepherd simply does not fulfill his skills. There is no doubt that the JCVD ​​looks better here than he fought in the years, especially in the fight he has (for almost no reason) in the prison cell, and in the final show with Scott, but look at his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There's nothing in his eyes. It's as if he didn't care about anything in the whole movie. And that's the main man. There are other dubious aspects of the film, wisely and visually, but the main problem is that you are completely unable to empathize with the film's hero. A real shame because I know we all wanted this film to be as special as it could really be. There are some good pieces, mostly action scenes themselves. This film had a great director and action choreographer and an amazing rival for JCVD. That could be the one who brought the veteran action star back to zero in action movie bets. <br /> <br /> Honestly a pity that didn't happen.
