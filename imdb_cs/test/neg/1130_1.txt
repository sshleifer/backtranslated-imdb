I watched this movie last night and let me say it's the worst thing I've ever seen. The whole movie is a train wreck and not an actor. It's a terrible scenario. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** Okay, Eddie's losing his monkey job. His fool is disappointed. The bathroom went crazy. <br /> <br /> Get a free vacation. He goes with Uncle Nick and the original Audry. Their ships are crashing. They stay on the island. They are stupid and don't bother to look at a nearby hotel. OK, so that's all. What makes this film pathetic is humor. It's so horrible, hillybillyish and stupid, you can't even laugh. It's not even stupid funny humor. I couldn't laugh at the whole thing.
