When you watch Seagal, you expect good action. You expect a fight, not just a lot of shooting like in this movie. And: you expect a rather simple story. OK, I can live with a more complex story, though it's Seagal. But this, it is, I don't know what to say. It's very, very confusing. At the end of the movie, I was in big trouble when I found out what had happened. And I know I'm not the only one. The story lacks so much information and is so full of conspiracies that it is almost impossible to watch what's happening in the movie. There are many people in the movie, people are constantly changing pages and changing locations too often. Grapes. I just don't understand why Seagal seems to do something like that.
