An unpleasant British movie from a Japanese novel about a very troubled young man who is under the influence of classmate Hitler and a conspiracy to harm a widowed mother lover. A Few Good Scenes (Sarah Miles, finding her son looking at her and confronting him in anger, a pasty guy trying to save Kris Kristofferson from his extinction by being more friendly), but what results in a provocative shock ? It's ugly and uncomfortable, not showing anyone to take advantage (especially Kristofferson, whose hollow looks and usual gravel speech are in psychological mishmash like this). Director Lewis John Carlino feels coldly without any sense for his absurdity that such a situation could actually happen. If he's right, it's much more shocking than anything in Sailor. * of ****
