This movie was in a box with 20 others, with different quality, & I can safely say that this title was right on the bottom of the heap. It is pointless to go through a conspiracy of what it was, pick what was wrong, because I didn't have a full day and life is short, which reminds me, I just lost about 85 minutes of my observation of this tripe. Acting was devilishly wrong in a way that made fun of it, though only, while comedy elements like two idiotic cops had to create all Laurel & Hardy fans. One of the few funny moments was when the front lady joked about her former T * ts plastic friends, which would be okay if I didn't have to watch them while they were browsing on the screen. The smallest I can give is one, and it deserves to think he's got Heather Thomas in her because she was definitely sexy and pretty, though her acting was as bad as everyone else.
