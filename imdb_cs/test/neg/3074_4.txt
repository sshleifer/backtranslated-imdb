It seems that this TVM has polarized views among commentators on this site, so perhaps I can solve everything so that it is a very stupid, not very well made TV movie. How bad is it? It's a teleplay that can't even decide what its name is, because while everyone in America calls it LINDA, it's known in Britain as LUST FOR MURDER and it's usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name. And I can also point out that this is not the tongue in the cheek spoof as someone else claimed to be honest and I say that the plot is more of a sound. Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple named Jeffries, who they behave well with. They get so good that they go on holiday together (invent your own mind if a wife exchanges) and Paul sees his wife killed Jeffrys. After the plot takes a shock twist <br /> <br /> Writing the above paragraph I suddenly realized a great deal of potential story had and I won't say anything to keep you from assuming. It's just that when the story continues after the events I have described, things become more and more unlikely and bizarre. Not only that, but the production values ​​are quite bland with the actor playing Paul Cowley, who makes a very wooden voice that irritates, while most of the scenes - Exterior and Interior - look as if they were filmed on a hazy day
