This is a flic that you can safely avoid. Childish Conspiracy and Bad Appearances From Cameron (Shouldn't Really Take on These Serious Roles - Doesn't Fit It) Besides being the most apologetic, let's do it, she's great at Charlies Angels and she's been excellent at There's Something About Mary. .. The Pope would not be a good president of the US and vice versa, my opinion is that there are some actors / actresses that are suitable for a certain type of character and Cameron is best suited for this serious type of household - there are a dozen other actresses would do a much better job . The film itself is somewhat unbelievable and preteen in its plot (I wrote the truth of Juvinile?) I noticed a comment from another reviewer who gave The Box 10 ratings that were sinister in his comments to other film reviewers. 1 or 2 ratings and could not be a spell. I mean, what is the spelling of the movie? Does this mean that people who spell perfectly could appreciate this film more than those who couldn't? Professor.
