Bad script? Control. Terrible effects? Control. Terrible actors? Control. Lame direction? Control. After I saw a DVD box on the blockbuster and was a fan of the horror genre, I placed $ 4.28 on the line and rented this "movie". My girlfriend was out of town and I was bored so late on Tuesday night I decided it would be the perfect time to watch what seemed (based on boxed) horror. What I got was the worst movie ever made. Until then, I've always said "party party massacre 3" was the worst movie he ever made. <br /> <br /> If you're the type who wants to see a movie because you heard it bad, it's for you. If you don't want to lose $ 4.00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life, avoid this rubbish. <br /> <br /> Added note: I noticed a few "actors" who came here and added comments on the bulletin board. How can you brag about being in this movie? You were all terrible. I mean really wrong. If American Idol existed for the actors, everyone would laugh at you in the first episodes. Peace. Sutter Cain
