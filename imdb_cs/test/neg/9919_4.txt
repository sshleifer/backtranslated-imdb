The story of a story about a rebellious teenager against a church and her father in a small Norwegian village. The rural environment is picturesque, but the story is somewhat resourceful and proud, with much of the film dedicated to typing. It's like watching a movie of religious propaganda. Theisen, who made just one other film, is quite good as a sensitive young protagonist, just like Sundquist as her stern father and Riise as a woman whom Theisen fascinates. The aim of the film is to be fresh and charming, but it feels rather musty and tired. The director and co-founder of Nesheim, who mostly worked on television, is not up to the task.
