I wasted enough time actually WATCHING this movie from the movie, I don't want to waste more writing a great review. I didn't do so many smiles once. All the jokes were boring, forced and lacking any kind of joke. I kept saying, "Where's the punchline?" Almost every character was an unpleasant stereotype and all the situations were clich√© and there was no solution in the middle of the time. Things happened to happen to the next scene. I can't understand how life has so many good reviews as he did. If you like clunky acting and poorly composed movie making Fat Girls is a movie for you.
