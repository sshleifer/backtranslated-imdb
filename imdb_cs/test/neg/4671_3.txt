spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is not packed with action; it's slow and boring. It is neither funny nor exciting, it is predictable and plays on cheap sentiment and vague patriotism. Special effects are not imaginative or impressive. They are noisy and uninspired. Acting talent is useless to hopelessly stupid one-track and cliché. These are brought out by characters who should only be called "gentle giant black man", an eccentric genius who is about to burst, "angular proud hero comes to age", "by-the-book coward", "carefree player" lives Code of Honor, "Impulsive Princess" and so on. <br /> <br /> And writing! How much do you think they could get into this? Does it have a scene where people have to destroy a bomb by counting one or another wire as fiction? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the film depends on the audience caring if some jerks can delay his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say bye bye to Liv Tyler in time to save the ground. All work is done; We have to wait a few more seconds until Harry Stamper, a jerk, throws a few lines out of cotton. I know Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his character, Harry Stamper, is uncomfortable. I thought he was awarded the Golden Razza, which was awarded to him for this role. <br /> <br /> Since the film is so long, the plot is so obvious, and the dialogue is available so that we cannot notice the Lamek's inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and holes. 800 feet to something is TX size smaller than pinprick. Try to go 800 meters to TX and see how close to the center you are. Throughout the discussion of artificial gravity at the Russian station, she seems to be inside. In fact, gravity comes and goes through the film. Does it make any sense that anyone except Michael Bay would give these morons a few shuttles and send them to blow up an asteroid threatening the country? The sentimental phone / insurance / commercial style of the commercial style revolted. <br /> <br /> I like action movies. Really. This one is boring, stupid and really stuck to himself. He deserves hatred and contempt, because it is all that has become Hollywood's most expensive effort - a lot of cheap clichés from one expensive explosion to another. Oh yes, the whole thing is penetrated by the Neanderthal conservative view of sex, politics and so on.
