this is an example of a movie that can have a lot of potential and is done very badly .. I am a fan of kids and drumsticks and many other so-called teenage movies, but this occurred to me. Why is every white child divided into a thief who loves rap, his acquisition is one-dimensional. Acting was terrible, but simple because it mainly consisted of just dropping f bomb after f bombs just a bad bad movie if you wanted to see better movies like this: thumb sucker kids bully all <br /> <br /> you and I think they are better so I recommend one of those that you would like to see a good "teen movie" I hope my comment you found useful and I hope you hear future comments from me
