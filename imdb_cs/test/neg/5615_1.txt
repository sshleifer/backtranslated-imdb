Despite the great soundtrack and the presence of the ever more amazing Rappaport and Woods, this is another of those moral comedies where New York plunges into a hero in an attempt to show the writer and / or director what a zany place is. Yeah, there's something else in the movie that sucks, but that's important. It seems that the trend of independent filmmakers in New York is "I don't need to be talented, I have NEW YORK!" To be fair, the film has its moments. The flash of why this guy's name was Wacky Jack was pretty funny. Script is not a story or storyline, it's a lot of non-good scenes that are bound to each other by having the same character. One of the worst things is that behind the characters. Uncle Sam is supposed to deliver the kid to the kid, why? If that's so important, why didn't Sam do it alone? The lead character then lies in the scene after the scene and has nothing to gain from lying. The guy falls in love with a flight attendant and none of them have a reason to fall in love. Characters are a lot of pawns so the writer can move to see if anything can happen. <br /> <br /> If you have fun or watch bad movies because you feel smarter than watching bad movies, watch it. If you want to see what a GOOD bright criminal movie looks like, watch "brother" Takeshi Kitana. "Kicked In The Head" is a perfect example of why so many people hate uncontrolled indie movies: LOT OF THE SUCK. A note to the director: Don't be afraid to wake up, entertain, illuminate or entertain the audience. Being boring does not mean that you are a better filmmaker than those who are interested in me.
