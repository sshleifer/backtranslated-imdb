I will not lie, I rented this movie because it was a "bohemian" movie with possible explicit sex. I have the scene and (shortly shown) the breasts of Catherine Deneuve, but the rest of the film is just a usual long demanding European art film with lines like "I have a mother or a father, I don't know" (paraphrased). Usually shipped in long soliloquies. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about the transition of "art" to porn, it can be an interesting look, using the Fast Forward button (I was still too slow!)
