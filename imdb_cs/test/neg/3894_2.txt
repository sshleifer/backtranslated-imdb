I saw this movie twice, once a few years ago in college, and again last weekend. Even though I despised it for the first time, I decided to give another chance. Terrence Malick is an unambiguously respected director and IMDb viewers seem to think at least about the movie. But unfortunately it seems that my tastes have not changed at all. <br /> <br /> Where to start? For one thing, Linda Manz's story is terrible. Her voice is so uncomfortable that the terrible New York accent (please don't try to convince me that Chicagoans are talking like that - they don't). She admitted herself that she just sat down and talked about random things, which made her not a talented actress. She doesn't even work! I came to IMDb to expect her torn apart because her performance is just so utterly laughing, but people actually seemed to like it! She's just uncomfortable in every way - I was hoping Malick would kill her. The other actors were fine, but definitely nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but also had the only decent part. Besides the old guy - he was pretty good. Speaking of acting, how could Shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid? He bought a "brother and sister" because ... why should he buy it? Bill and Abby took every opportunity to be untouched, as if they didn't realize that their lives depend on acting in a very platonic manner. It was just incredible. Finally, after a considerable amount of time, the farmer suddenly realizes that: "Oh my God, they are together!" Then he walks over to Bill with a gun, but instead seems to hit Bill's hand and end up with a deadly stab wound. Speaking of it, the fate of the characters was similarly stupid (and, courageous) I say, lazy). Of course, Bill must die - could it be more boring than if he'd been pushed into a pond by a cop pack? Abby goes on with her happy life, goes to the train and feels really happy with the way things work. And the angry narrator accidentally finds his dead friend and goes to the sunset. But it's okay because Malick never gave me any reason to worry about the characters anyway. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, this film is endlessly drawn without real plot or development. I can't believe it's only 94 minutes - I could have sworn I was sitting in my seat in 3 hours. The sudden acacia disaster was like throwing the Bible into the face; I'm perfectly fine with metaphors and allusions, but this was upstairs. The message was obviously: "Don't give yourself money or bad things happen." Very original. I understand that the "Days of Heaven", as well as all of Terrence Malick's films, are to be a work of art. And I certainly agree that cinematography is simply overwhelming, and magical hourly footage adds a unique aura to the film. But I need more than nice photos to enjoy the movie, and this just didn't do it for me.
