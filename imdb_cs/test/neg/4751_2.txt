There were times when the Alien series was successful with the third installment, Alien 3, which promised a fresh and young David Fincher guild. The first Predator was a boxing hit mainly due to his story, "In The Top" star Arnold Schwarzenegger and Director John McTiernan (Die Hard). Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator have been very successful and have produced a massive sequel between general movie fans and science fiction fans. Probably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should signal the end for both franchises, but the studios were underestimated and saw the opportunity to embark on a reputation among the fans and connect them. Step in Paul W.S Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now Brothers Strauss (visual effects graduates, neither directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing the profound and revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to fall into the hands of an average director and now a director's novice, it did nothing but desecration, embodied by incompetence. To testify to Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR) dying fans will feel bad about their stomachs, which this series could be worse. One example of the film's deterioration in the series is in the opening scene and is likely to cause discomfort among the fans. The film begins with Alien embarking on a Predator ship, emerging from the chests of predators, growing into a full-fledged Predalien, and bringing predatorial craft (which now has far fewer predators than it was at the end). Alien Vs Predator) and all this is happening with the ship still in Earth's atmosphere. Once a ship crashes with the AVPR quickly resorting to inexpensive conspiracy methods and basic narrative conventions, it makes no effort to use any of the twists or subversion that appeared in the two original films. Tired of conspiracy progressing at a lengthy pace, interrupted only by almost fluctuating Alien and Predator conflicts, and when there is a risk of being bored, we will be treated either by a seductive blonde in a bikini or a quick shot. AVPR is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and conspiracy holes with little or no narrative explanation, ie members of the public who exceed the elite military unit or predators that do not comply with the laws set out in previous editions. It is a film that has total mistrust for its predecessors, breaking some of the most basic rules of continuation, and the person feels that he is trying to stand up as a separate function. Regardless, the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul, and with reference to other films, they lack the most basic continuity. This is attested through the arching of the film's narrative as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if this species had met before, they'd be even more proficient in the first movie, Alien, and not so badly prepared to meet them. he felt at some points urging the flashlight on the screen, lighting was so bad. By using these dark and dark effects, can the audience feel as if they have been deceived by some action? which is the irony of its purpose and also highlights the lack of budget. As with all science fiction, one scene is normally superficial as the most memorable, in this case it is probably a hospital impregnation scene, as it sometimes so subtly draws on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. Direction is poor, performance weak and rotten font. AVPR is the product of a film conveyor belt system in which ideas and techniques are assembled by inefficient people and then distributed to the cinema. This is embodied by the absence of cruel mortal scenes and drawn blood battles, because certification won't allow it? lower certification reaching larger target groups. AVPR was a purely business venture and nothing more.
