I was recently in this game. And the last day of the run I was thrilled to see that it would be on TV. I stuck the tape as it was late at night, and I watched it the next day. I must say, I was very disappointed. Actors in the film have made a few discoveries that are in the script. This is understandable because the resersal process is probably different, but it was upsetting to see. Much of the original scenario was also changed for the movie to make it better for the screen, but I'm not sure if the movie helped. I gave these 4 stars just because I know that script and writing is much better than what this film portrays.
