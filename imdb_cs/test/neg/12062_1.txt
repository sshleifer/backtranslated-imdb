Idiots go camping and behave like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you want terrible, bad than bad puns that fit thieves before a bad movie, "Camp Bloody Terrible") is actually quite depressing to watch. And she has all the ingredients to be a totally bad movie ... <br /> <br /> A terrible acting check. Bad scripting check. Tacky effects-control without originality anything-double check. It is not even trying to be different and it is riddled with every predictable clich√© imaginable. For example, the film opens a pair that has sex in the woods, so of course it ends up dead. One of the most disturbing things is that this movie actually gave birth to two sequels, how and why only a bewildered mind. Stay away from this.
