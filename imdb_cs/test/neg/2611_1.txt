This movie may have been the first puppet master, but it certainly bored me when I saw that stupid movie I wanted a replacement. That was a bad series for a puppet master and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks it was awful. For some it was great, but the rest was a snoring ticket and the boy was right. The puppets didn't do anything or kill people. People shouldn't see him, so I warn you not to see it. You will also be disappointed by the fans who love the puppet master; No one killed, but one or two, very useless. <br /> <br /> 1/10
