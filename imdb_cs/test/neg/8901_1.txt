If this film won the Lumiere Award for Best French-Language Film, then what kind of garbage comes from France today? The subject is important - how the African economies are international organizations that should help them, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of the government budgets of several African nations go to pay Western debt while their people suffer from illness, dehydration, and illiteracy. which could be conceived by a human - dryer than the Sahara surrounding the country of Mali in which the film takes place. More monotonous and action-related errors than any document I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre), one "witness", secondly, comes in this "trial" that is "captured" on a film that condemns the World Bank and IMF . Some critics may place a colored visual side within the movie, but they were out of place and had no additional soundtrack when they were on screen. They were better off in the coffee table book than in this movie. Even the characters in the movie say something like "This rehearsal is boring" and "When will it end?" Everyone in the theater laughed. Were the people on the screen reading our minds? Danny Glover had a short look in this movie. It is a television film within "Bamako" and it was set within Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any western-spaghetti I tried to avoid. The only redemptive part of these five wasted minutes was when a Caucasian evil man accidentally fires an African woman who has a child and shows no remorse. Maybe it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it was the unintentional killing of Africans. And last technical breakdown, subtitles were difficult to read with so many light colors on the screen and not enough black outline of the subtitles themselves. <br /> <br /> I've already summarized the film for you. Don't be fooled by the hype. No need to see this movie. You'll never get these two hours into your life again.
