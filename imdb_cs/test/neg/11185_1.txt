How can I describe the horrors? !!! First, some points: First, this evaluation should be taken with grain salt - I saw it more than 20 years ago when I was a boy at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Second, I give out some scenes and plot points. However, it does not have much plot. Finally, I don't like these types of movies anyway. This film was directed by proto-auteur Luis Bunueli. He was surrealistic and dadaist. It was modernist themes or a movement popularly critical in the 1920s and early 1930s. Surealism was an art school that made things hyper-real, yet often had Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is said to be the first word made by a child - Dada or a father. Made in black and white, it was also made by a group of Communists (or as they preferred the Socialists). Bunuel and his group of filmmakers and artists worked on a series of symbolic ideas and problems in Spain and France between world wars. Dadaism and Surrealism have influenced many artists - Police (Doo doo doo da), poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch, Rene Magritte, Salvador Dali and even Hitchcock (Psycho). Norman Rockwell. Here's what I remember most about this movie: a girl meets a cow; her eye gets razor-sharp; clownish men cavort on meadow. There is, as I said, a lot of conspiracy, but then again, it must be a point. It was then attacked as porn and it would be today. One of the trademarks of Surrealism is significant anti-feminism.
