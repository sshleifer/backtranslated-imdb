I have read every one of the Scarlet Pimpernel Baroness Orczy books. Counting this, I saw 3 pimpernel movies. I preferred this with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews. It comes out of the path of violence and action, sometimes totally violating the spirit of the book. I do not expect the films to be held on the ground, I have given up on being idealistic for a long time, but if the excellent movie from the book has already been completed, do not remake it with a TV movie that contains excellent actors and nice costumes but barely decent screenplay. Bonding to the 80th version .... Rahne
