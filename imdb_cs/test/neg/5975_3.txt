When the exploiters become evangelists, they still use it in the name of poverty! <br /> <br /> My first reaction after watching the movie is ??? God, bless me that I'm not a fish or other than vegetarian! The documentary is about Tanzanian Lake, where many beautiful fish species lived, and one day in the 1960s someone came to meet the huge Perch fish, which became an exportable commodity for Tanzania to Europe and Europe. Japanese markets. The consequences were hard? first, all the local small and large fish were extinct; secondly, the aircraft that took the fish could not travel empty because it does not mean commercial / commercial / capitalist meaning, so it is filled with weapons and ammunition (this is what Europe can give to this world); thirdly, pilots (like all migrants and travelers, such as truck drivers) must survive their sexual needs by making cheap local African prostitutes flourish for them; Fourth, brokers, dealers, middle men in the chain (especially Indian-originated entrepreneurs) get rich and Tanzania's poverty remains the same; fifth poverty drives children to crime, drugs, etc. <br /> <br /> The assumption that this document is excellent. But did director Hubert Sauper make a good documentary? It's a big NO. I say the reasons: As in India, it requires a higher Brahmin caste to stand up and project the world, Indian poverty and the inviolable; similarly, it requires a European documentary filmmaker born in Australia to tell the world the story of Tanzania and its crumbling and destroying economy and poverty. It is the pathetic motive of the unconscious breeding of this wealthy class (who has never seen poverty or known poverty) who survive, live, earn and hear as pests who plunge into the world when they see it. There is nothing more than contempt for poor people in Africa and India who see such images of theirs. Hubert's intentions and motives seem to be absolutely bilateral. Images, figures, national backgrounds, talks are too serious and dark, dark and disturbing. He uses excessive ignorance to express his case. At the end, we feel sorry and sad for Africans. We will also start thinking about the Tanzania government and the people as wicked. Maybe some people in the West who are sitting in air-conditioned rooms will find time to discuss and debate the pathetic living conditions of Africans, but nothing more than that. The director tries to show himself once on the screen? so that it is not identified among Europeans who use this poor country. This director Hubert can only survive as exploiters as today's media giants CNN and BCC. Hubert did not have the courage or common sense to talk to Europeans who eat or the companies that import these fish. Silent effort that is absolutely limited! But do I understand the same reasons? Hubert just wanted to deepen his fame, sit back and smile with prizes in European comfort. I reluctantly gave the document a higher rating of 3.5 Stars out of 10, just because the topic was correct; but he was pathetically exploited and blown away by an amateur ill-conceived director made exclusively for unintelligent Western viewers! (3.5 out of 10)
