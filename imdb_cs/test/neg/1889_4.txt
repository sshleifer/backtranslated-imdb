I've been a classic horror fan all my life. Many nights stretched into the morning and watched Universal movies for "Horror Incorporated" and "Creature Feature Night". Sadly, I was watching this movie in the early evening, and it almost slept. I don't think I've ever seen a "horror" picture where everything was so important. . Dr. Edelmann does not seem to believe in the supernatural, but has long treated Dracula and watched Larry Talbot turn into Wolfman while he barely blinked. He and Talbot discover the monster Frankenstein as it is an everyday event. Edelmann is fired to bring the monster back to life, but after Talbot, Miliza and Nina's protest is like "Aww, you're right. No big deal." After realizing Dracula's betrayal, he opens the Earl's coffin to the sunlight and POOF! Is gone, just like this. The only person who doesn't seem to be calling in her ranks was Jane Adams Nina. Her reward is bounced off the back of her back into the Frankenstein Monster pit at the end of the movie ... and no one is trying to save her! She, Dr. Edelmann and Monster all died while Talbot and Miliza leave the castle casually. Definitely the lowest point for Universal during his classic horror years.
