Esther Williams plays a romantically impartial water skiing secretary who wants to "walk on the water" and be the wife of a man; Van Johnson and Tony Martin are her potential choices for her husband. Despite the subtle water sequences filmed at Florida's Cypress Gardens, this romantic comedy is terribly outdated. Everything encouraged by the harsh director Charles Walters seems deliberately harmless, which does not lend power to the image. Even the great moments of Esther in the water aren't up to the mysterious jumps from her other swimming vehicles, even though they are more suitable than with men who are both colorless. Carroll Baker, in his film debut as Martin's dissatisfied ex-girlfriend, is the liveliest of the game. Really fragile things. * 1/2 from ****
