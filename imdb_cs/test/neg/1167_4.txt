Since playing in Lone Wolf McQuade, actor / stuntman Kane Hodder has been busy. His film, Hatchet, won all publicity last year. He should skip this one. Hodder seems to be the king of slashes. played by Jason Voorhees from Friday 138th Part VII: New Blood (1988) to Jason X (2001). He's working on a new movie that seems to be a Halloween remake. It's a lot I would call a type of serial killer with his methodical, bland thirst for blood. However, there was not much blood in this movie and there were very few events on the camera. It was like looking at an episode of real A&E law enforcement. I'm not going to blame Hodder's shoulders just because the rest of the actors didn't make much. The Hills Have Eyes (Michael Berryman) just ran through the mouth until Gein closed it. Adrienne Frantz ("Bold and Beautiful") was cute. Winning actress ("Three's Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes did a credible job. I'm sure there are other horror favorites, but they all seemed to run their roles.
