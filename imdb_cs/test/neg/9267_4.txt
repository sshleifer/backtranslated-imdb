With a cheap pound trade that just opened, I thought it was worth it to see if it was some cheap DVD that looked good. And while the back of the cover sounded like a Jeepers Creepers movie, it's actually an anthology movie! and he thought that one or two stories felt very good. It's still a fun horror / comedy. Land: <br /> <br /> Story One: Classic. The young couple feel it's time to try to prove their financial life by picking up a $ 1,500 car. But when that guy goes to pick a car, the car starts talking to him. The car (called Banns) says he got everything he ever wanted in life that he must buy Baans for $ 5000. So while the guys relationship is falling apart, Baans does everything in his power to show who is actually responsible. Story Two: Kitchen Culture. A guy who could be thrown out by his country's master, given how flat his room is, finds that to keep tuna pasta in his fridge for six months, it has now formed and evolved into a green moldy version of yourself!. And while they start out as friends, they end up with a big fall, leading to a final battle to see if the real guy or his refrigerator clone survives. Story Three: Too good to be true. The girl logs up with a dating agency and she gets closed wi th guy is perfect for her.But she is unsure that the guy is too perfect and when she thinks she sees him 'off' she starts get scared. The first thing I need to mention is the rating of the film in England, where he was awarded 18 ratings, even though he has no nudity, swearing or blood. all.A other special thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings where the goodies win. And while the first story is too close to Stephen King's classic Christine, the second story is easily the highlight of the film, with director Tom Parkinson who is behind The result of the nutritional character of the story, as the low budget Muppets episode! The final look at the movie <br /> <br /> Although it has a little 'remodeling'; Feel it shocking enough to make it a good horror "comedy".
