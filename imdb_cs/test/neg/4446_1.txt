Wow. I thought Eskimo Limon was the worst and most embarrassing movie of first sex ever. But I forgot that Germany always tries to compete. In this case, the famous German film producer Bernd Eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap. Harte Jungs is stupid, unbelievable and predictable, and above all: it's not funny. It is almost a tragedy that so many children have seen it in Germany (and I fear Austria, too). Tobias Schenke, 19, looks very nice to have no girlfriend and too mature to be 15, and his character is too stupid to be true. Schenke is trying hard to say that he knows nothing about sex, but that doesn't help. It seems that Harte Jungs is made by someone watching Al Bundy and taking it too seriously. The best actors in the film are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jürgens, who play Schenke's semi-liberal parents. Perlinger and Jürgens are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented in film acting. However, their performances are in comparison with the best and most fun. <br /> <br /> Full failure.
