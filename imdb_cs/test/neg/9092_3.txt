This film was disappointing. The story is basically The Shining with a castle (or a very inexpensive set of camouflage like a castle to be specific) replacing a hotel and a monster instead of ghosts. The budget is the same you would see on Cinemax softcore pornography, as well as photos, sets, lighting, and video on which it was filmed. The story is an unsuccessful attempt at honesty: there is no easier way for your audience to feel compassion for your characters than to show them the emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty banal. Want an example? A blind girl who listens to a language tape that teaches Italian words for colors begins to cry for what she will never see. This movie has had a few things: the monster is actually pretty cool, pretty scary. And Raffaella Offidani, who is the star of Italian "erotic" movies, is pretty decent. Gore, however, leaves much to be desired to do playing, even from experienced Jeffrey Combs. Other than this I just saw two other Stuart Gordon movies: Re-Animator and from addition, both were excellent. I won't let this little footnote in his career keep me from watching more of his films.
