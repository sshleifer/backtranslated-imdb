I feel that many people like this movie (not all people but many of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. People of medium intelligence, if you want, who pretend to be still so avant-garde and fashionable, who thinks Lynch is a genius. Lynch is like Tarantino to me. They are both great, but neither of them is a messiah because so many fanboys want to believe. No director can change the world, so chill out. They both make occasional swipe, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day. And clearly, because this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then a hack-jobbed into a feature film, it wasn't with all the passion and forethought one should put in the movie. Face to face, much of the film is crazy unintelligible, which cannot be understood. We can all make sense, Lynch can have his own opinion, but none of it matters. She sprawled inconsistently across the screen. Sure, the first part seemed deliberately intricate, intertwined with an interesting story, but then it reflected. Cowboy, a mysterious organization of men with their calls, lawyers ... come on. I can almost imagine David Lynch screaming, forcing the crew to gather around him and telling them, "Look how crazy and weird I am! Isn't that great? It's so weird and crazy!" Weird and crazy work if it's a byproduct of your style. However, it's pretentious and tired when you go out of the way doing nothing but that. It's like all those half-assed Pulp Fiction throw backs that came out of Pulp Fiction. It's not just cool.
