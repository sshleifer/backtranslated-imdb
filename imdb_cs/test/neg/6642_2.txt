There are many mysteries in life. For example: Why does someone other than Carrot Top agree to appear in this movie? Why did anyone distribute this movie? Why did anyone pay money to see it? I don't think any of these questions will ever be answered, but one thing I know for sure is this one of the worst films ever made. It would be bad, but the addition of "humor" Carrot Top is even worse. The only fun he could get out of this movie is to burn it, break it or otherwise destroy it in a fun way. If you put it against any movie ever made, it would be between "Problem Child" and "Biodome". Said Nuff.
