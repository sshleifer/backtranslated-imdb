This is one of the few films - maybe the only one - that has haunted me for years. It was the first time I ever saw people tortured, so much that they ran blood from their mouths to keep their teeth and screams, and so on. the worst thing I've ever seen on a movie. Dr. <br /> <br /> Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I've ever seen on film, and I've seen thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never see this movie again, nor would I recommend it. Makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers. If you see tortured people not your idea of ​​entertainment, then stay away from this movie. I know there are a lot of sick people, many of whom are professional film critics who seem to enjoy it. , a sick story. It's a "B" movie, as well, with stupid dialogue and some wooden play by Charles Bronson. This is not his better effort. Even if it is, there are so many horrible scenes you wouldn't want to watch. Trust me on this.
