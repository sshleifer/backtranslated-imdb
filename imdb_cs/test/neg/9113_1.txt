I love most of the movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean, so I thought I'd like this movie at least. I'm also Canadian and that's mostly a Canadian movie, so I was ready to reduce that serious release. Nothing could prepare me for the waste that is "Airborne". Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The action in the whole movie was so bad that I would have trouble sleeping tonight. I have only two wishes in my life. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you never have to sit in this movie. 2. I wish I could get those 6 hours back. Wait, the movie is under 2 hours - it just seemed like 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. Seriously.
