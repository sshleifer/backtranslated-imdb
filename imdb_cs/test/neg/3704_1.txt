This movie is the worst I've ever seen. Maybe you think you've seen some bad movies in your day, but if you haven't seen it, you don't know how horrible a movie can be. But wait, there's worse news! The studio will soon release this masterpiece (I am ironic) to see it all! The only thing worse than the storyline is the effects, acting, direction and production. Bill Rebane, Ed Wood of a poor man (not Ed Wood with a rich man) (I like Ed Wood's movies, though) can keep things moving at that pace in this movie. It opens with the capture of a baby bigfoot (Littlefoot? - who did not help him) by a pair of relentless hunters killed by the parent. This causes the entire town where the hunters lived to go hunting for the Bigfoot Jihad. This is largely for conspiracy. Nothing happens at a distance, and we viewers can never take care of any of the characters. If anyone is interested in Rebane's movies, I'd recommend almost everyone else. However, as I said, Troma will soon be releasing her to carry a new generation of film viewers.
