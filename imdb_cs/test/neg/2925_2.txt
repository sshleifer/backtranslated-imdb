33% of the nations still supporting W. Bush would make sure that this film, which shows the consequences of the French Revolution and the 1794 terror, was strikingly similar to the socio-political environment after 9/11. Maybe they could then stop worrying about rescuing their faces and taking what they deserve. It is a pity that when a politician destroys a country, those who voted for him cannot be denied the right to vote again. They have clearly shown that they have no sense of character. Indeed, in this film, the character's ambiguity is hopelessly doctrine like Robespierre; a creepy empty man who simplifies the reduction ideology cannot help him clarify the boundaries between security and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legal tests make it harder to create a hopeless situation. Sounds like any aggressive, exaggerated, retarded Yale cheerleader you know about? Wojciech Pszoniak blows off the screen. How likeable Robespierres's situation is, it's nice to know that shortly after the movie ends, he will have a jaw cut off and be sent to the guillotine.
