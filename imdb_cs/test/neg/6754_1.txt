Let's see how many ways you can offend my sex: 1. Of course girl # 1 is a horrible skank that cheats on her boyfriend and sounds / looks like a heroin addict. 2. Of course girl # 1 sleeps with the guy on the first day after she wasted. 3. Lesbians are of course "Germans" who are in S&M. 4. This one was actually a surprise. The ending of the film on the torture celebrated by most characters was frightening. Seeing a woman defeated is not my idea of ​​comedy. 5. Director's Commentary - Talking about playing actresses in a movie, just to know he's cool and incredibly unprofessional.
