This film is total. I like Val Kilmer and this year I was very surprised by "Felon" (good movie!). The entire DVD box is misleading. Val Kilmer is billed as one of the main people in this movie and is in the movie for about 2 minutes. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not entirely true. It could have been a good movie, but the direction was terrible and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually, when the movie is so horrible, you can sit down and laugh. This film is so bad and boring that I actually fell asleep (which I never did during the movie). Avoid all costs!
