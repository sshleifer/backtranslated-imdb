First, the cut of this movie consisted of one big mistake I don't understand how it was missed - you consistently see the microphones swinging in and out of the movie over your head. When I first saw it, I said "well, mistakes are happening" and blew away. After about ten, it became incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you haven't seen a movie yet, try counting the number of times you see the microphone; can do it for a pretty interesting game. Now, about the movie. This movie began with ideas quite a solid "ghost" story; however, the twist plot at the end only destroyed it completely. You start watching a movie provided as shown in the TV commercials that a haunted house consists of ghosts that only children can see; especially young children, which makes it even more strange because they will not be able to effectively warn the family of impending danger. The opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that it would remain a prerequisite for the film. ** (SPOILER) ** The film begins with the family being persecuted and eventually killed by the "invisible" power in the home. The idea that these spirits are seen only by children is set in motion when the daughter, at the beginning of the film, asks her little brother to tell her where the "it" is right in front of "it" grabs her and pulls her screaming into the cellar. The young boy also testifies to this supposedly "invisible force" that kills his mother after telling him to hide under the bed. After his family is killed, the boy tries to escape and hide just to be torn apart as well. As I said, this movie started with the ideas of a pretty scary movie in which the family would be persecuted by an "invisible force" with their only hope of survival based on a two-year-old observation. This began to be destroyed less than half into the movie as the daughter began to see ghosts as well; completely destroy "only children can see" the illusion of set advertising and the opening scene. No matter that the movie actually didn't get "destroyed" until the plot at the end. In which the man who helped the family reclaim the farm proved to be the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the film. Suddenly, after the man has been attacked by a swarm of healing, one gets stuck and tries to kill his mother, daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes it to be an HIS family; who in the beginning killed. The whole plot at the end just created a whole list of pending issues and let me go wtf. First, why was the family in the house trapped in the house? If the director went to Ju-On (The Grudge), in which the family would chase the house after the death of a tantrum and kill everyone who enters, why a haunted stop after his family's "captured" ghosts? If the spirits wanted to kill the man who killed them, why were they attacking a new family? Here's another. It takes several months from the time you sow the seeds until the plants are fully ventilated at the time of harvest. This tells me that a man who initially killed his family, a man who apparently had ghosts with the whole film, lived on the property for months. All this time, why didn't the ghosts kill him? This film included a lot of clich√©s "horror" scares, as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. However, I say ya, this movie could still be off right, if not for a fence twist at the end. It's like they run out of budget and just throw something to the end. In order for this film to be successful, they should get stuck on "only children can see" a premise and end up with either family barely getting away or being killed as a family at the beginning (would open the door for a possible sequel).
