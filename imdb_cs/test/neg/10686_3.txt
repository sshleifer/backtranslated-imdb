The geek scenes were not as bad as you thought. After watching Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The roughest thing was when the guy ate out of the mouse. But they were so fast and little that I didn't mind. Otherwise, the movie was a little interesting. I always liked to hear a stupid voice. He never sounds like what you think an actor / actress would look like in real life. I liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. The shots of strange looking bugs were also fine. The youngest princess looked really young, almost 14 or something. Combat scenes were not as long and boring as most combat scenes, so it was good. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
