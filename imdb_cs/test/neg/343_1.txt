It's an OK movie if high school kids would do it for their friends. It is the way under the limits to be called "professional". There is no conspiracy, a play of actors, and no visual appearance, as if you were seeing it through a plastic film. I was so glad I had the FF button on the remote control, 32x worked really well. I understand that everyone has to start somewhere, but it shouldn't be a reason to bring it to the public. If you are concerned about the quality and budget - "Open Water" was made at $ 60000 and more than half went to the guy who provided safety in the ocean and trained sharks. And the movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in filmmaking.
