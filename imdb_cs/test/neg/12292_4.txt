I am very interested in the tremendously positive reviews here. Although it has some good features, I have for the most part found that this film is heavy, predictable, and the worst of all is not even scary. The first 30 minutes of the movie were promising, the actress did a nice job in her portrayal, and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful. Unfortunately, there, the film entered the descending spiral. I went into this movie without a clue about what it would be - I didn't know anything about actors, directors, genres, etc. At some point my wife said "is this supposedly scary movie?" I suppose that is so, because the "horror movie" score from the boiler, which is full of whistling and extended vibrata, cannot mean anything else. There was not much originality in the film, the romantic interest was painfully evident from the very first moment, and the other half of the film came down deep into the ridiculous realm. A movie like this goes a dangerously narrow path and unfortunately comes a point where the viewer has to decide whether to continue along this path or to jump and laugh at the ridiculousness of it. I chose the other one for the last 30 minutes.
