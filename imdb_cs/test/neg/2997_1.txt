This is a good time to say how well I think I am on this page: it gives me the opportunity to feedback all the frustrations I have been living for two hours waiting for something to happen to say something what is to be said. gently, for symbol, idea, anything. No, just a long, endless violin, alternating with a tired piano. Tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. Boring is the long death of the mind, and this film is a public enemy in this respect. How many thousand live hours will still be stolen to thousands more innocent viewers. I am not entitled to my money back, just to my time and the time of the people I invited to watch this thing ... Oh God!
