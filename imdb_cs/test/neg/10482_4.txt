Okay, when I bought this movie, although this must be the ultimate b-movie, a space monkey landing on Earth and starting to kill people right away! Well, it was almost everything I expected, a typical low-budget movie from the 1960s. Acting must be the worst I've ever seen, especially the girl playing the lead role, and the girl who played the waitress laughed at me. So why 'Night Fright' doesn't fall into the category 'so bad is it good'? The reason is that some scenes were too long and boring. For example, the scene was policemen looking for traces in the forest it was only a few minutes walk without purpose. And then the big finale, people are waiting for the monster for about 5 minutes and when the space monkey seems to get in 20 seconds, the end of the movie. Yeah, 'Night Fright' is boring, but a few fun moments. I can recommend this film to all who like movies like 'Zontar, The Venus Thing' or 'The Curse of the Swamp Creation'. I give 'Night Fright' 4 Space Monkey from 10th. <br /> <br /> -Rob Gruesome-
