"Inuyasha" was terrible. This show was incredibly over-hyped, but it's nothing but a boring bunch of anime clich√©s. The characters are annoying and lifeless, the story is boring and endless. I think it might be something interesting if he had better writing, but the show's writers seem to have more intentions in the Inuyasha show and his stupid friends fight some monsters and then weep for their tragic love triangle with Kikya and Kagomeo lots of circles around the same things over and over. The script is cheesy and stupid and the animation is bad. Character design is very ugly, I don't know why everyone loves it, they all have the same face! Big eyes, tiny noses, lines like mouth and typical anime hairstyles. I found that "Inuyasha" is incredibly boring and stupid. This must be one of the most overrated animated shows ever made.
