Right on Colmyster. I totally agree with all your feelings and add them. I came to my PC, especially to write a comment on this terrible (minus) movie Bgrade. I wanted to say that today I am embarrassed to understand how someone could do such a pitiful film - but it beat me. Anyone who reads this and Colmyster's comments, believe me ---- Don't waste your time and money. It's a total shock. Acting is totally pathetic, the scenario is worse and (so-called) special effects are a joke. Surely no one has invested money to make this movie? I really can't think of anything else to say about this so-called horror sci-fi product, but it must sign this comment to make 10 lines of comments to be accepted for submission.
