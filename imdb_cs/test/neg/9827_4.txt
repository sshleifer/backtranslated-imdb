"Jefferson in Paris" is a really confusing movie. He presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the weakest possible light, painting him as a liar, racist and pedophile, but he does not offer condemnation for these sins. That's the way he was, it seems the movie says. The end of the sentence, the end of the movie, the door behind you. Arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson continues to win the heart of his wife Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi). homosexual English painter (criminally underestimated Simon Callow). Event turnover sends Mary to England, and Jefferson forgot her with astonishing speed for a man who, a few minutes ago, asked her to live with him in America. Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton) is charming, one of his slaves just came from America. Just because he's enchanted, it's hard to say - even though Sally is undeniably beautiful, she behaves like a simple child before Jefferson. When he does not say scary stories in exaggerated "brave" speech patterns, he slips past his bedroom, practically lusting for her prominent material. If her behavior is an attempt to apologize to Jefferson, it doesn't work. Damn it, Jefferson is drawn back when Maria, tired of waiting for letters, travels from England to see him. I haven't changed for you, insisting on offering weak excuses for not writing. To acknowledge her, Maria immediately sees the hopeless lies. When Sally appears and she and Jefferson flirt openly (and cruelly, in my mind) in Mary's presence, the illusion falls apart. paragons of virtue and morality. We assume, however, that we believe that a learned, acclaimed Jefferson would be attracted to Sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how "friends of Massy's Frenchie don 'unnastan' maize 'and who rubs against his front as he passes by, just before Mary's eyes? Although we left the picture, it was a terrifying revelation that Sally was only 15 when the matter happened (41). Oddly enough, this fact only comes to the end when Sally's brother James is understandably angry at her bliss announcement that he is carrying a Jefferson child. Jefferson is just as blissful when he says Sally has a baby and encouraging to tell her that she will be far better under his protection than free and live in France with her brother. But he promises to free her when I die and our children (including others who come, says Jefferson, in Sally's freezing declaration as * his *) when they reach 21. Oh, thank you, massa, you feel like a screen narration. Big problem. However, the worst scene is yet to come, but includes Jefferson's daughter Patsy. She's already mad at him, making her mother on a mortal bed for not marrying again for breaking her promise. (Obviously, the woman was not just talking about marriage.) Jefferson also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun, as she wishes, despite earlier moralizing about freedom of religion (that is, it means freedom to agree with him). Jefferson has promised Sally and her brother freedom and invites Patsy to witness the negotiations and promise to fulfill him if something happens to him. Sally's brother wipes out the impending birth of a child, and Jefferson asks, "Do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, though he has nothing to say. Her face almost twisted with painful pain in this revelation, but she controls her grief and whispers yes. If something like this and the filmmakers could have something to emphasize this point more, "Jefferson in Paris" is an indication of the status of a woman at the end of the 18th century, perceived by men as Jefferson as an attractive property, pleasant But without true intellect or soul. "We see that Jefferson has thrown a few tears for a letter from Mary, apparently telling him where to get, but he soon laughed at a wild dance from Sally, accompanied by blown hair and creaking chest. < I don't know if it's the exact portrait of Jefferson or not, I don't care to watch it just to watch it, this Jefferson is no hero or even an anti-hero. there was a child-molestor — and one who was getting rid of him — not the kind of person I wanted to see the film about.
