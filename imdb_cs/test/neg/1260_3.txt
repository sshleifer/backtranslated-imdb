That was more than a love story about one angel coming to the ground, even though the two angles of the story have a good share of the film. If I took this film as someone who knows and believes in the Bible, I would be pretty quick, but I don't think the general atmosphere was either lively or blasphemous. It was just ridiculous or just stupid. I mean John Travolta as a cheeky angel? Smoking? Scraping His Weaknesses? Do you quote the Beatles? "A Fighting Angel" Who Doesn't Know About Heaven? An angel who flirts with all the women? Yes, it is all absurd and certainly biblically incorrect. <br /> <br /> I could tolerate it all, but I don't know how many people, no matter who they have, who could become a boring movie that turned out to be during the second half. He begins to pull when the romance between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell begins. Some of these dialogues during this romance are so stupid that they are offensive to any viewer who is discriminatory. This is another film shot by Nora Ephron. Man, I can't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or controlled. At least it is consistent.
