Occasionally I accidentally leave the television after "South Park" and I end up catching some of the train wreck high school humor that is "Mind Mencia". It's the only time I want my room to be cleaner because I would be able to find a remote control much faster. The truth is that Comedy Central needed a replacement "Chappelle's Show," and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots who either miss Dave so much that they hold any minority shows or are happy with the plain. Mexicans love tacos "jokes that Carlos Mencia shovels every week. However, I understand that there are some people who actually find Menci * trembling. I stand behind my words when I say these people believe that there are only However, if you're really out there, I'm just asking you never to enter my housing estate and read these big differences between Carlos and "Chappelle's Show": <br /> <br /> 1) Dave was funny. wanting to highlight this. <br /> <br /> 2) "Chappelle's Show" was FIVE TIME, while Mencia could ever hope to be. Every time a promo for his little show airs, it's all about him, tooting his own a corner about how nothing we've ever seen, you're right, Carlos, and not in a good way Chappelle didn't have to tell people he was nervous and funny, we just got stuck to see the show to find out for ourselves 3 <br /> <br /> 3) Chappelle actually she had racing jokes that dug into the depths of different cultures - things some people didn't know about. Like his game segment "I know blacks". The big price was some hair cream used by blacks. That's deeper than Mencia could ever dive. So how dare he call himself irritable? If Mencia wrote that sketching the main prize would be fried chicken and kool-aid. And my accusations have some merit. I saw a promo for his show (which I loved to call 'My TV Monitor to take S - t in thirty minutes') a few days ago and it was some stereotype of the Olympic Games sketch that I confessed to myself was quite a funny concept. Then I saw that the Mexican who won won the Green Card as the main prize. And it is done?! So close to the fire, how do you want to get? Who ignores it - in the 7th year? For you fans of the show if you've ever watched and missed one of his punches - maybe because you and your friends have been discussing how "Duh-De-Durr" never gets old and is by no means part of a joke where someone funny had something clever to say - just remember that there are only five possible punching options: green card, tacos, border jumpers, lawnmowers, and of course duh-de-dur. Just remember - whatever it was, shouted. Enjoy it! 4) Species related to number two. Every time he says something that gets laughter, he'll be silent to tell people (while laughing at his own joke) that he thinks he "went too far with the last". So don't say it to God. Or let people decide for yourself. He and Comedy Central are still tearing down this threesome, it's such a story that is more controversial than "The Da Vinci Code". You're not. You will never be. I've never offended the show's content. I'd never give him that much. I'm offended that Carlos Mencia gets thirty minutes to shout unnecessarily. Yeah ... I'm actually offended by this fact.
