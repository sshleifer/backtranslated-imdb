After watching Avalon (who was only decent for very nice digital fx), and a few anime movies written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic), I decided to look at the Oshii box trilogy . As the Red Glasses and Stray Dog are related, I will comment on both. And let me tell you that it was one of the biggest waste of money I spent in a while. First I watched Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I'm sad to say that these movies are perhaps the most serious two movies I've ever seen. In just 10 minutes in each movie, you get some action between the characters who are dressed only in "Panzer Cop" suits for a few fleeting scenes. For the rest of the time, you will see a few very drawn scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations. I really don't understand the motivation of these two films at all. I love Wolf Brigade clothes and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves do not want to be desirable. I would suggest not to watch these movies, and definitely don't buy the box as I did if you don't use the money. Oh, and if you're wondering what I think of the third movie in the file, Talking Head, I couldn't bring myself to watch it before I cleared the box from my DVD collection over eBay for $ 20. If you want cool Japanese live action, check out Returner, or the Ichii Killer or Zeiram series.
