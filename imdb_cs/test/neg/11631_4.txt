OH MY GOD! Having had such a promising start, Critters 2 repeated the karmic rule of what's around. It is clear that very few things were invented in the filming of this movie and what was wrong with Scott Grimes! It was supposed to be the last trip to the Critters saga, but there was more waste on the way. That was the great reason I didn't follow Critters 3, and why does every bad movie series have an episode in space? (Critters, Friday 13th, Leprechaun in Space, Hellraiser, etc.)
