One of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie is so bad, I don't know where to start-- Okay, let's start with the assumption - a dude from the mainland that hardly knows how to surf in Hawaii and enter a big competition for a wave more or less expected. win. A good analogy for those who do not have surfing would be that they would roughly overweight to a pair of running shoes and enter LA Marathon with anticipation of victory. In any case! And the contest takes place on North Shore, which conjures up 15+ wave images, but the competition day waves are perhaps 6 feet. Playing? What does it work? If you have to see this woof to see on TV, don't waste your money renting. If you want to see a pretty good movie for surfing - that's wrong, but that's another story - rent a big center.
