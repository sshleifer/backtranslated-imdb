Do writers who have these types of "comedies" create such empty lives that they must embody them in tragic shows like this? Why talented and gorgeous Busy Phillips belongs to this basket? I, I can't build a Hispanic girl whose accent sounds very fake and is so rude and annoying as the other African-American girl with a sharp voice. Jokes are often stupid, a Jewish guy screams a lot and the show never goes anywhere, one particular episode with a solider looking for love was just awful. I don't believe there are many people working in an office looking for love and just one man? Of course, all women are in tight fitting tops and tons of makeup to replace their lack of talent. Actually, I found Holly funny in her older shows and I always admired Busy, but the show is stupid, empty and has nothing to do with it.
