Caddyshack Two is a good movie in itself, but compared to the original cant. Robert Stack is a terrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny just can't compete with Rodney Dangerfield. You Webb is funny, he's the only character from the original. Most other characters in the film lack the original blow (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except for hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the original humor, especially the scene in his office (I don't go to court or movements. chippindale, maybe bake the golden retriever (arff arff arff) and then eat it. Your Brand New BMW Up Your Tight **! Do we have understanding?). Offsetting his little role however, is Dan Acroyd, who is apparently no substitute for Bill Murray. His voice is not irritating and everything he does is not even funny, just silly. Overall, Caddyshack II is a good movie, but compared to the amazing original it just can't cut it.
