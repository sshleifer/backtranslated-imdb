I'm not going to lie and say I'm not looking at her. But it has a lot and a lot of shortcomings. 1) boarding school is perfect. The drama is to a minimum. Everyone is so nice to each other, you know. Suppose we check it out. Its impossible that every school is perfect as a PCA. Free laptops for everyone. Large bedroom. Mini Fridges. If there was such a school in real life, almost no one would be a virgin. Two, everyone there is so rich and his weird as no one has stolen anything yet. 2) Characters really unrealistic. First, the first to speak like them in the right minds. He talks like a perfect teenager. Second, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is an extremely rich "hot" boy boy. My question is, why is there almost no girl at the school at the school? Today he is rich and "hot", all the girls would be after him, even if it was a blockbuster. Chase is also the dumbest man ever. He's a shy teenager who says he's not in love with Zoey, yet he reacts to everything Zoey includes. He must be BLIND not to see him in love. <br /> <br /> Come on, Nick. I know you can do better than THAT. Please..
