The fact that someone could understand this nonsense and then make it is incredible. It's actually overwhelming that it was broadcast on TV and advertisers actually APPLY THAT IT IS ITEMS. This stomach-shocking excuse for child programming is almost too ugly to comment on. I fired - yes, burned - every Barney tape that people gave to my son. Finding this scary programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where, tell me where to get those charming actors? Don't their parents make sense? The kids will be on drugs before they're teenagers. Oh, God. The last insult is that I need to add this extra line to the review to get it on IMDb.
