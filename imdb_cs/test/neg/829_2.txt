When I went to see this movie, don't say I had great expectations. But only that I had a weak hope that this feature-length feature would have at least some of the jokes and jokes of the "Da Ali G Show" television show. But as expected, it can't be translated from a half-hour TV show to a 90-minute film. The film did not challenge what had ever happened and resorted exclusively to toilets and teenage sexual humor. Basically, I should have half skipped it, but it was stupid enough to think that somehow it could improve as I was wrong. I loved the show, but I hated the movie. This movie is just for those who find the fellatio from the canines ...
