I'm usually quite tolerant of movies, and very easy to entertain, however, this movie was terribly disappointing. I watched this movie after seeing on the cover that William Zabka was in him (a bad boy Karate Kid) and during this movie I saw it was the only reason. This film is a huge waste of actor talent. Music and sound are terribly cheap - I couldn't believe it was happening in the 1990s. I really wouldn't recommend this movie if you're not interested in one of the actors.
