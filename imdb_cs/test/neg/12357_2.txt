I saw it on a dull Sunday morning just this morning. Well, I was attracted to the fact that it's an outdoor movie. I was hoping to find some nice scenery, but views where it is limited. They just go back and forth in the same place over and over again. They use so-called hi-tech products such as this Motorola Bluetooth headset that they use to remove the use of the walkie talkie it was so funny .. they look like amateurs. And where as an advertisement of those poorly designed alien laptops that could combine up to satellite to find people .. I couldn't say more about this TV-movie .. The end was bad that it seems to shorten the short removal of rescue use helicopters etc. * / **********
