I saw this movie today on the big screen and I can honestly not believe some of the comments that people here. I was really hoping this film would touch me, but not. I'm ex Australian army and very patriotic to this great country, but I feel that this movie has no justice for us and a soldier who fought in this battle. The film is badly filmed. I thought the negotiations were terrible, they were not believable, and they gave me no reason to look after them. People say that this movie was graphic, there were several graphic scenes, but I found that most of them are very weak. The war scenes were very short and lasted only a few minutes. Slightly weak film that does no justice to these soldiers.
