It's too kind to call it a "dummy" Barker account. They're right, but that's about it. Russell is still hot, I'll give you that, but this is not the real Ma Barker, who basically cared for the boy by cooking and helping when they moved around the country, not planning or participating in crimes. I think it would be much more interesting to present the true story of a middle-aged woman who was captured in the criminal activities of her children and their cronies. I also have to agree with those reviewers who found that the shooting scenes were absolutely incredible. The victims of Barker / Karpis were a combination of innocent and law enforcement officials who pursued them, but they certainly did not kick half a dozen FBI agents every turn. (On the other hand, as several recent books relate, the FBI of the era emphasized the idea of ​​agents coming only from the legal or accounting background to the point that many agents had very little law enforcement or firearms experience. But the worst sin of all is that the film is basically boring. No one changes, no one grows. We know the end of the road is ahead of us, we just don't know which discharge will be. <br /> <br /> Russell fans only.
