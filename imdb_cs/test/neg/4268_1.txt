Stay away from this. The worst story is the worst. There seems to be an intention to convey some subtle spiritual / love / friendly message, but it is so pathetic that it lacks any substance that you can't help but cringe. In addition, most of the screen time is far below the standard story of thieves, criminals and our hero (es) dealing with some foreign time traveling artifacts. I know you're asking for trouble when it comes to time, but the story is full of holes than usual. You also have: cheap sets, bad acting and some of the worst musical arrangements in moving picture history, strong, cheap, sudden and incoherent. All I can say is "Man alive! This movie is bad!"
