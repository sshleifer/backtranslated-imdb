I am losing to find words to express how bad I thought this movie is. The initial rule was promising, but in all respects it was absolutely terrible. Let's go through the main points. Fence - a good initial idea, but really a terrible development. There were many points when I thought "no, nobody would do something so stupid". The end was incredibly anticlimactic. Characterization - All characters were either totally bland or grotesque cartoons. I'm trying to think about what wasn't - maybe my mother, but that's all. Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. Direction - absolutely amateurish. Camera - the doubts they heard about her. Camera angles / stability / zooming are often very bad. I'm totally confused about how this movie scored so much. It's the worst movie I've seen in the cinema for years, if not at all.
