If I wanted to, I couldn't spoil this piece of crap. After watching Dark Harvest 1, I thought it was supposed to be a worse movie I ever made, and then I watched Dark Harvest 2 and that made it a lot better. Then I watched Dark Harvest 3 or also tried. All I have to say is "when does it end?" Very bad performances and really bad special effects The only good thing about this movie was a shot. Don't waste your time on this piece of crap ... And now I have to write 3 more lines to submit. I wanted to sing a song, but now I can't think of anything. But the film finally ended (though it had an ending that might mean they will make another one of them)
