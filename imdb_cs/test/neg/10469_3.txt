Yes, that's what I felt after finishing watching this movie. Acting is below average and special effects are terrible. In fact, the worst I've ever seen. It's a very low movie budget. There is no way this movie can scare you, has no scary or frightening moments. Mr. Bone Eater was more of a funny creature for me. It could have been much better, but well, they didn't have a big budget. The film can't convince you that you're watching horror, lol. I would call this movie The Time Eater (Waster). I'm sure you'll have a lot of better movies / etc. Keep an eye on whether: 1. you have nothing else to watch. 2. You get to watch it for free. It is not worth renting at all.
