There are a few things about the movie. Everyone should see it. You see the nation of Iraq as you have never seen it, which is covered by the media, and shot from the point that most Americans hardly are considering where the film has its main audience. However, all these amazing things in mind allow you to look at a few other facts of the movie. 150 cameras were distributed to the Iraqi people, most of whom looked at the war and subjugating the occupation forces as a growing pain to improve their nation. And compared to Saddam, it's just a slight scratch on the skin. Also, Netflix, as its main distributor, advertised it before the fun choices we just had, by sending a bulk email to the entire list to see the movie. Many of what should be described as views that occur as facts reported by the interviewed Iraqis are incorrect. If it is necessary to review the records of the Red Cross on torture in Abu Ghraib, it was not Saddam's followers who were tortured, it was a fine mixture of 80-90% of innocent civilians and 10-20% of those lawfully detained. It has never been disclosed that 10-20% would be Saddam's Henchmen or violator of curfew. In addition, the Arab world has never seen "democracy" as one of its opponents, more specifically $ 6 billion a year at Isreal, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is completely distorted, but this film has the same distortion. I am afraid that the Iraqi people who are presenting this film have been modified to speak with the Yankee voice. Yes, it is true that Saddam is vomiting and that he sees many as best. It is true that some Iraqis actually receive a good wage. Just as it is true that no Iraqi people have control over their most valuable oil and US corporations. Nor did he mention that 20,000 civilians died as a result of exclusively American artillery. Not yet 15% of the country that once had running water and electricity. Nor did he mention that since 1993-2003 the UN sanctions imposed by the US government had killed more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians. She also did not mention that democracy was at a time when people were deciding on government, not a massive war machine that would send the message "Be killed or obeyed." I'm afraid the floor must have enough Iraqis who aren't so happy with the Occupation. Like most of the world, it wasn't for war. In fact, America, the British, Spain, and the rest of them are not democracies, they turned to him when they saw their pockets. Saddam is out of power, but I fear that no Iraq is yet in power. Companies are in power, the media are in power. Read your own research and don't let them blindfolded.
