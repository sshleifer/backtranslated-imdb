I don't expect a lot of scary stories, but I expect the story to make a little sense! Is it too much from screenwriters and filmmakers? When the evil man suddenly becomes a murderous maniac just because a bunch of people is yelling at him, then I have a problem spending $ 9.00 for a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock revolves in his grave. Has anyone taught anything in their 101 class? A good movie has an interesting story in its roots! Here are some of those ridiculous messages in this movie: If you have desperate financial issues to move from Chicago to the center of the no-where in North Dakota to grow Sunflowers (I kid not!). If your toddler has serious neurological problems from a traffic accident, remove some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to an isolated town that has a community hospital at best. Hire a rogue who will live and work with you, out of the blue, without checking any links when you have a teenage daughter, a woman and a toddler. (Glad they're not my parents!) <br /> <br /> A city where everyone knows they don't have a problem is missing a triple murder near the city. And, of course, blame the man's foolishness from the bad sunflower crop! (In North Dakota is there anything else growing up?) A few days after you bought your house - with huge vineyards that grow everywhere - that reminds you of Jack and Beanstalk, the X-Files guy, ala Smoking Man, (Glad to cigarettes didn't get him, I think he's not inhaling!) You're just suddenly sneaking at you when you work to offer you the selling price of your home, plus 15% more, for absolutely no reason! <br /> <br /> I think you have a picture. I've seen so many god-forgotten horrible films in the past month. Is it so hard to make a movie that doesn't treat viewers like an idiot? I am glad that at least the crows in this sorry film have shown that they have some brains! I wish I could say the same thing to anyone who thinks he's earning this celluloid.
