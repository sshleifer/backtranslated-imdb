I really enjoyed the first movie and when I reappeared without thinking or checking, I took a family of friends with me. I was ashamed of being so excited over them. <br /> <br /> Disney has produced an original film just as the human body processes tasty food - it takes something good and turns out ... well, you know. And because the dark-skinned person as an FBI man, the informant's fingerprint results were muted. Taken as an isolated movie, I think it's not too bad if you like the strange kind of thing, but when you read a book or saw the first movie - terrible!
