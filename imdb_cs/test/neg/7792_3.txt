The title is from the passage in the Bible (Deut 28:28). Let's say it's terribly ripped out of context - but that's where the name of this torture film comes from. Other reviewers cover the details of the plot so I wont rehash. A psychiatrist's husband gives a lecture on "Inferior function", where he discusses how one can meet another person and can experience a "catastrophic crisis" in his life, where he ceases to be the master of himself and incapable of righteous judgment. He says it on stage when he looks at Leonor Vail in the audience - a woman who becomes his mistress. Not too gentle for it to be really what happens to this poor person. I think the whole assumption of the film is unlikely and it just didn't work. Here's a psychiatrist over the hill and we're supposed to believe that this young, beautiful woman falls on him and comes among the happiness he and his wife shared. Even more unlikely is how a betrayed woman reacts when she learns of infidelity. Not only is this understanding, but she INSISTS her husband to let go for a few months with a hiker - "so we can all get some relief from this unbearable stress". Give ME BREAK !! I wanted to get through the screen and strangle not only the adulterer, but the mother who is sober. The fact that the whole movie is played out as a flashback after the film's end revealed at the beginning of the film (The fact that her husband had a terrible accident) leaves no doubt about the outcome of this sharp matter. I think it was a bad decision because it leaves absolutely no plot to look forward to because the whole movie is completely predictable. You already know that the wife at the beginning of the film resigned from the affair at the beginning of the film when she calls a lover to the bed of a dying man and does not express any bad will to her. Not only is the scenario flawed, but Noel Coward is terribly wrong (even if it's his script). He and Leonora have no chemistry on screen at all. Its interesting that Michael Redgrave was originally cast in this role but was replaced during filming. I wonder what it was? Finally, neither husband nor wife feels that you feel compassion for one of them. I think Margaret Leighton played a part of the strumpet pretty well. But she could not overcome all the negatives this film had. Also, as is the case with many British Productions of this era, dialogue is hard to understand due to the actor's cropped, quick speech. I saw it on TV and I couldn't even rely on closed captions to fill the gaps for me. Don't waste time on this.
