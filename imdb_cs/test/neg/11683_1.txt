OK, this movie wasn't good at all. Video games are not what I want to boast if I was 15 years old. Cool to play games, but to write a comment about video players can make this movie for being, it's weird. All you have to do is play a video game, do not feel sorry for the story of getting into one. I use my cell phone, I hope I won't lose my girlfriend. Erasing is the worst ever? OK, Grease has a very well thought out story along with a musical. Even if you don't like musicals, someone would say Grease is good. My brother plays video games all the time and watched for 30 minutes and left because it was so awful. I feel asleep.
