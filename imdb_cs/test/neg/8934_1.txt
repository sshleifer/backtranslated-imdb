This movie is too stupid for words. Even if you consider it a parody of filmmaking, if you consider it to be a camp, even if you are wasting your time watching - because you've seen it a hundred times before. But maybe you are a big fan of the high screams of girls, you are still loving Barbie and Ken and you can become this typical 80s electric guitar background noise ... Well before you have a chance.
