Including spoilers <br /> <br /> If you haven't fallen on your head like a kid and then used it as a football, then you agree with me that it is one of the worst yet cheerful series ever made. Centers around a woman who, as a young girl, was defeated by her father, who also killed her mother, spends time drawing, but is waiting for her, then becomes her superhero drawing and continues to fight crime, so she is "pulled by pain", so clever. The story is all right, but it's just how it is done, Jesse, writer and director has no idea how to write a script, just listen to a monologue with an 8-year-old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written. Daddy, who has a big mustache, walks around the house all day and looks angry, just shows how bad the characteristic is, especially the one where he gets angry in the first episode and starts to repeat the phrase "no longer" while holding his wife's head before killing using her marble work surface, the following sound effect and just his horrible behavior, how everything he can convey is simply angry. a script of over 5 minutes, but oh no Jesse doesn't want it, little Jesse, steadfastly postmodern, as if he just ate Donnie Darko and then taunted to death. The nonsensical jerk of the camera, all in strange angles, too repetitive lines, and even nonsensical sequences that filled every moment to fill long episodes. The conclusion is that the idea is not bad, it is just how it is done, also there is a big character fat guy on a bench who does not come up enough and is great, I just want to hug his lil chubby cheeks make them look so soft. The development of the character does not exist because the main character is just saying the first philosophically sounding thing that gets into her head, even though they contradict each other. But all in all, especially with ** t <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones 4 however is much better, write "Jeeharv" into you-the trumpet anyway, results can make you cry on the beauty of the world you will also hear lots of cheap sex jokes mostly gay.
