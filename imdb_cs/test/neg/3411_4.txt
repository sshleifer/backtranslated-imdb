The first of the three Aztec Mummies is the only one that to my best knowledge has never been completely dubbed into English. The film was cut and used in pieces by people like Jerry Warren in other films (linked it with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Chaney to make the Face of the Werewolf's Face. And that turned out in the Mayan mummy attack and elsewhere.) , a good piece of this film is made up of two later films that use flash backs as the basis. The story of this film has a scientist conducting a past-life regression experiment that causes his subject to travel back and discover hidden chambers in the Aztec pyramid. The band, as well as the ominous character known as Bat, hope to use this information to discover the hidden treasure. Instead, they discover a live mummy that has other plans. The long and long wind of this movie has too little action to keep its 80 minutes running time (worse mom doesn't even show until the hour has passed). Probably at least three movies that are easy to understand why this movie was cut off is the only way to make a movie without sleep. I watched the movie late at night and found myself fighting to stay awake. It was a tough move, and I found myself finished scanning to where Mum appeared. With a choice, I would go through the second two films.
