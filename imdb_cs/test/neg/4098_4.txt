Although I like Steve Carrell's work, Evan Almighty, as well as many other exaggerated films, it turned out to be much worse than I hoped it would be. It turned out to be a cheesy family movie, kind enough to employ a famous comedian to improve their image, but they won't be able to deliver in the end. The usual Carell dork humor is almost absent from the film, and although he laughed me several times, there was nothing funny about him in Evan Almighty. His 3 children, although probably important to the biblical character, were really useless and horrible actors in the movie. Even his wife was a third leg for such a simple story. Spending so much money on making a comedy was a huge mistake. Although Carell's career may benefit from this film, there is no real reason to see it. If there was a little less of his family, a little more Carella, Molly Shannon, and possibly other SNL casts, it could actually have been more fun. 4/10 for a couple of laughs here and there.
