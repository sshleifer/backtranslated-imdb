I watched the first 10 minutes of this show, I think I'll be a barf now! One of the worst shows on TV. It's not even funny. It's so lame it's disgusting. I gave him a second and third change, which I couldn't handle even five minutes. Don't waste your time. This is one of many programs that need to go bye bye. Speaking of regular night time shows you need to go. All the shows on CBS. All shows on ABC. All shows on FOX and Joe Buck. All shows on the new CW network. All shows on NBC (Accept Law and Order). All morning and afternoon lectures. All TV shows court. And every reality out there !! Every stupid game show. Period End! All home improvement shows! And all the media messages. it's a 24 hour loop of bad news. Yes, I have a favorite monk, the law and orders are for me.
