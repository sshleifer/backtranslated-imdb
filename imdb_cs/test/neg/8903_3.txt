Perhaps Abderrahmane Sissako knew what he was doing when he did "Bamako," but the rest of us can just sit in mystification and confusion to try to figure out what it could be. The nominal "conspiracy" includes a young African singer who plans to leave her unemployed husband to find work in the city. However, much more time on screen is associated with what film filmmakers call a "fake trial against key financial institutions" that deals with "the huge economic difficulties of Africa". I suppose it's all right and well, but when the arguments and ideas are interpreted as inviolable and pedantic as they are, they lose strength and impact. In other words, if the director found the means to truly include issues such as damaging the influence of colonialism on African people and the problem of African debt in anything distant, reminiscent of a convincing story, the film could achieve intellectual and emotional resonance so clearly lacks now. The topics the film deals with may be relevant and important, but trying to pass on what is equal to a two-hour speech as a true, honest God movie is unlikely to collect a lot of audience for someone's message.
