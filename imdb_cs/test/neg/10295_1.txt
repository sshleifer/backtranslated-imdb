The executive producer of the film is none other than the messenger of peace through transcendental meditation, the director's director David Lynch. I wonder what David's guru, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, would think of this production. Coverage here is as repulsive as the film itself. It's a safe bet that Samuel L. Dieteman, a serial killer of Phoenix and devoted to recreational violence, would love every minute. I doubt that many people would blame this film for their craft; at this level it's pretty good. But at the moral level, it's the coolest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING <br /> <br /> I think it's the fake of the thing that makes me most sad. Morally Insensitive Generation Xers learns an art school and a small postmodern aesthetic theory at an art school or film school and then engages in art and entertainment; and here is the result: a film that collapses in human suffering, injustice and carnage, many of which are witnesses of a nine-year-old who sees that the whole family is murdered by several recreational violence killers, who drive away to sunset at the end. <br /> <br /> NO MORE SPOILERS PREPARING <br /> <br /> Who are these films made for? Sadistically, they will adore it - why not? But who else? As I mentioned above, there is a really good craft, but good craft can be applied to any subject. Why apply them to similar things? The film is also very exciting, but it is not because of the graphics and the coarseness of the violence; it is tense because it is well managed and well functioning. I'm sure Alfred Hitchcock's spirit could explain this much better than I do. So what's been given to us here? And above all, why? Yes, our world can be ugly, dirty, even a bad place, but shouldn't we disagree when an "artist" makes her a business to wipe her face in it? Or worse, sticking to the faces of those nine-year-olds who end up on the home DVD in one way or another? <br /> <br /> I hope people will make sure their children don't see this movie. Yeah, I know - dream, bernone ...
