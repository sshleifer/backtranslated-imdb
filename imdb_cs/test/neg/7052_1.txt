The AZN TV in the United States bought the rights to this film and the network shows it using the English name THE PICKPOCKET. 1997 PICKPOCKET reflects an amateur movie in the style of home cinema on incredible levels of inconvenience. The film depicts a long-standing series of boring wandering uninteresting, confused men. This leading figure, Xiao Wu, is not just aimless. Unfortunately, viewers will soon realize that Xiao Wu has unsurpassed talent to seek and stay dormant near the most unpleasant sounds in China. Throwing empty tin buckets beats your wand - it's there. Every old engine in China is worried about agony - it's there. Crying baby? Yes, you guessed it, it's there! According to The PICKPOCKET, China is the most irritating unpleasant sounding place on planet Earth. <br /> <br /> A single element worse than PICKPOCKET sound is a photo. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes. Finally, the camera still, but then it falls on the knees of the actor and just stays there until someone in the crew realizes the error and starts shaking the camera again. Most shaking movies are framed in distant, long, long, long shots. Several times, when the camera gets closer, nothing is convincing for the viewer to join what is happening. <br /> <br /> The photo is murky, faded and often blurred. The use of color is - well, there is no hint of intelligence controlling the use of color. Most shots take 20 times too long. Few movies are so painful that you can walk. This film is painful to watch, and painful to hear. And then it just ends. John Woo fans can enjoy the sound of DIE XUE SHUANG XIONG because the lead character hangs out of the video store for many minutes. By the way, warn - PICKPOCKET steals your good time.
