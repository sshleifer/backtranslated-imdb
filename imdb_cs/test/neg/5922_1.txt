I mistakenly thought this neo-noir effort from Buffalo - Niagara Falls could be something else. Unfortunately I was wrong. There are many problems with "The Falls" that really have nothing to do with producing low budget videos. Immediately, we have to question why all the constant narration? My feeling is that if you have a decent script, viewers will follow without having to be offended by voice over narration. Acting is very amateur, which is not unexpected, but only adds to the problems. Finally, the whole thing is unpleasantly shot as MTV music video, which I thought was totally unacceptable. Narrative, bad behavior and unpleasant video effects are all good reasons to avoid this. - MERK
