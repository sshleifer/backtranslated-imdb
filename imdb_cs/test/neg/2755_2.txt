This movie reminded me of a lot of Dead Kennedys songs called "Straight A". Unlike this movie, however, the hero of the DK song turns to suicide. You want this bozo to go to kill instead of doing crime. The whole thing was intricate and at the beginning you sympathize with the film's hero, then quickly betray your sympathy. The long sequences just displaying the hero's face while he delivers a monologue will drag the film quite a bit. If possible, avoid it.
