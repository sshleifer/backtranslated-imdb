This movie is really pretty strange. Certain * events * portrayed the main protagonist as a Dublin criminal known as the "General," but almost everything else is simply wrong. We are not talking about the distortion of ancient history ... but about the complete distortion of irreversible, documented facts. The question is why? Garda is shown as the second day of Keystone cops, his gang as non-threatening, and the man himself as .. well Kevin Spacey. Almost pure fiction, why bother trying to seem realism? When I said it all, it's a bad exercise * in any way you want to look at it. Not worth a second of time.
