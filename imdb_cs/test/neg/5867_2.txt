I bought this DVD for my young son who loves ToyStory movies. I never expected it to be in the same league as Toystory movies, but what I got was just another lazy Disney cartoon, as far as I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is unoriginal, the characters are boring and two-dimensional, the animation is under par, and the Buzz is not that big. The film could be much better. Especially I hated the color of the story numbers. I know it's intended for children, but kids know when something stinks at this level. mutant monster, from there down the hill.
