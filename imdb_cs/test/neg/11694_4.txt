From the greeting I expected more from the Korean horror situation if it was seen in the same caliber as the story of the two sisters, as some other reviews said. This movie is not in the same caliber, except for the special effects budget. You think Amytiville's horrible. With tree and sparse dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a limited-dialogue movie, the line and characters must be rendered with a movie. This movie could be said quite well in a 30-minute short film concept, 2 hours with lots of staring at trees and scary scenes that make you not only afraid, but also what it's "what's ..." It's not a good horror movie. Those people who say that this film gave them lasting impressions must literally have heart attacks when decent horror movies lay down.
