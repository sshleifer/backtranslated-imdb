Perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's wildest lightweight career is a director, direct comedy, Caroling Lombard's pairing with Robert Montgomery as a couple who have discovered a mistake that has canceled their marriage. Where does it stand next to each other? Contrary to what others say, here is an element of tension: The idea that these two miserable people could run away from each other that they might have some, uninteresting friend on some. It's funny reading comments about how lousy Lombard's Ann Smith plays in this movie because Montgomery's role is as big as heel. Manhandles Ann, hitting witnesses, short-lunged clients - the kind of lawyer who gives a bad name to his profession. Of course, Ann is also thrilled to be the wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days on a tiny quarrel, raises things like what he did in Paris when he was 20 years old and still hasn't met her. "I forgave you!" She says she was big. For David, the marriage is canceled as an opportunity to make some illicit pleasure with his "mistress" before you heal. For Ann, it is an attempt at premarital sex, which must be repelled by a bottle of champagne in the head, followed by expulsion from the apartment and life. The acorn does not seem to fall far from the Tree, as Anna's mother is scandalized into apoplexy when she learns what David was trying to pull out: "Oh my poor child! Thanks to heaven, your father is dead!" " This is a rare good line in this laughter, an unlikely comedy. You can call it an example of a "new marriage comedy" in which marriage disputes are questioned in order to be reaffirmed. You can also call it an example of what Roger Ebert calls an "idiotic conspiracy" in which the plot depends on the main characters who act like idiots. Hitchcock seems to have laughed at the tense American morality, but he can't do much more with her than a funny scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of a loud plumbing. Lombard died within the year of the release of this film; It was the last movie of her lived to see. Too bad it couldn't be something better! She was also excited about "My Man Godfrey", but in such a nice way you didn't have to go with her, you wanted to. Here he plays for laughs that aren't there, while sadistically breaking David's chops over and over. Montgomery throws her eyes a lot like Groucho, a study of clowning. The only really decent thing in this movie, which lasts more than a few seconds, is Gene Raymond as David's legal partner Jeff Custer. play for Ann and treats with honor and grace. Raymond underlines his many reaction shots, and even the drunken scene, all in a good way. *** SPOILER *** So decent man is Jeff that Ann ends up rejecting him for fighting David. She went to confront him and called Custer a "piece of jelly". Jeff leaves the scene leaving Ann and David together for their future suicide. Here's one Custer who managed to escape the massacre! *** SPOILER END ***
