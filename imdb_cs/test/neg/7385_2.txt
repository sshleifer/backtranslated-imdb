man it was hard to watch! it wasn't funny at all, not well done, and it had no meaning or conspiracy at all. the deal was terrible. it wasn't good at all. It looked like a bunch of children of my age who just plucked and made a pointless movie. it is by far the worst broken lizard movie. If you're a broken lizard movie like me, you'll be disappointed and bored until your death. skip this nonsensical movie about ugly boys looking for chickens. you will not regret the advice. by the way, don't say that you didn't consider this review useful just because you disagreed with it. It is silly like this movie. The only OK scene was when the main kid played rugby and beat the bullshit. I liked the fact that I found that his character was damn unpleasant.
