Sadly, Schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production, especially given that he had not yet entered his own, and was still as hard as carton in his dialogue. Actually, it's not as bad as some critics say, but it's not good either. It's fun and it plays like a poor country cousin Conan, which makes it a conflicting, uneven, bad job. And speaking of the poor, quality is terrible, given the era in which it was filmed, but that's not the only reason. The story here is inferior, even on the Conan line, but in addition, losing in "Red Sonja must dominate the great powerful Schwarzenegger" trick, and completely forgets its purpose if it ever had one. It's fun but in a low budget, guilty - the way "B" way. <br /> <br /> Rated 4.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
