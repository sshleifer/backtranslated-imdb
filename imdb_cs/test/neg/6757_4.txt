The geologist realizes that a great earthquake is coming, but no one will listen. Worse, his father foretold the 1923 Tokyo disaster and was declared unworthy to be his successor. Of course, the big one will come and Tokyo is knocked down. Poorly dubbed Japanese film, which is a pure soap opera for the first half. The second half - after the earthquake, the model city destroys its escape drama. There are some nice moments, but the film is wasting them either by undermining the action of too many poor miniatures or by making people unreal things. Hokey and not very good that she has an ending that you will not believe ...
