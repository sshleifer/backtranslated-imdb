Significant spoilers! This is a sick, disturbing film ... as well as a sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch, who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It's not an actor's fault. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It is the way this film was written, and the way the characters were written, which was a measure of the really sick mind. I know I'll never watch another movie that was written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. It is a sick, twisted, spoiled, disgusting thought. She looks, speaks and sounds like a cat with a motorcycle, with a brain-fried brain that has spent 20 years in a difficult time. You can clearly see what type of person is by watching her on a DVD special feature in the "Surveillance: Watching are Watching" section. You can see and hear it for yourself. She was a bit bad as I imagined from writing this movie. I'm not shocked by the bad language, even though this director is definitely a sailor. It goes far beyond a simple bad language; worse than any film. The level of implied sado-violence and perversion he incorporates into every character he writes is a genre that is even illegal standards p0rn. This perverse, disturbing thought is clearly evident in her personality and things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was looking for. It is a snuff film. <br /> <br /> Remember to hear her stories of deleted scenes and the alternative end. This director / writer is really a sick person. I can't believe anyone would be in charge of the movie, much less paid for it. You can be sure that I will never watch another movie to which it is associated. In the thousands of movies I've watched and collected, there are only a few directors and writers who deserve this kind of boycott. She's offensive than anyone I've ever seen in the making of a movie. There were some bad directors and writers, but no one could compare it with her sick, twisted minds. When I saw this movie, which was just one murder after another. As soon as he got behind the murder of the hotel ... then the ill cops shot and brutalized the drivers for the kicks ... a holiday family with bad parents (who had no work in the presence of children) ... followed by drug addict .... even more) twisted, deviant serial killers. When I saw the serial killers appear, I began to wonder what kind of really sick mind he wrote the film. These were my real thoughts when I watched this movie. I fully wanted to find out what the writer had such a sick mind ... because the writer must be serious about long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise it turned out to be a director. When I saw and heard what she said on the DVD, I realized that the writer's rating was right on his nose. The DVD was a really sick, twisted person I imagined he had written such a disturbing film. While little girl (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins really stole the show ... I can 'Believe her real-life parents would tolerate this sick, reckless, director who would be anywhere near your daughter. some serious treatment in a psychiatric facility. As far as the end of the film is concerned, the alternative end should be the result of this terrible suffering. The film, the story and the flow of the film had no meaning and no contribution to the film of death. I'm impressed by the fact that the film was actually distributed by any studio. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the movie got the audience was because of the clever wordsmithing and creative display on the trailer. The trailer is not representative of the movie you see. Other than a child ... every character in this movie was sick, murderous, twisted, perverse, violent sexual jester, and their characters mirrored. the mind of the director of the writer who created them. But when you watch it closely, your parents leave; sick cops who shot from a pot; serial killers appearing in alternative roles; cops at the station; and even the station dispatcher ... each of these character roles included a sexually, twisted, violent pervert. I'm not sure some of the actors after watching them talk about filming a movie and a Canadian city in the Special Features section on DVD. This writer-director has such a personal mental deviation that, no matter what he writes, each character contains the same stamps. The only sign that did not have these deviant tendencies was a child. Watch carefully and you'll see it in every character. Then listen to the director's and writer's conversation on the Special DVD Features section and understand what I'm telling you about mental status and psychological issues. She wouldn't be tolerated in too many decent homes if she wasn't from a Hollywood film family. Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch doesn't have much filmography ... less than a handful of things. Since carbon copies those disturbing features in all of its character roles, I don't think we'll have to see many of the films written or directed by her if her father, director David Lynch, doesn't help her. I would recommend staying away from any movie he deals with ... and I'm not sure if his father's movies would be a little better. Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.
