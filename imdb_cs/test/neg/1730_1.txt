Terrible! I'm a teenager and I don't mind movies, but that's horrible! Aaron Carter plays this popstar named JD McQueen and keeping his grades up or something, he works along with 'nerd', Jane whatherlastnameis. But "average girls" are too predictable, and the clothes most girls wear in the movie are not realistic. How would any of those girls get away with wearing a bra, tube tops and shirts that expose their belly? AT HIGH SCHOOL? In my school, we'd be sent home for something like that. And one part of the movie, where JD writes Jane, says, "Sleep tight?" He must think I'm an idiot! I didn't know SMS was so stressful! 'How is a stressful text message? And as Jane and JD are obsessed with her and fell in love with her, she is very stupid. Dialogue is cheesy and stupid, acting is terrible. the music is somewhat amusing and the plot is of little use. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy tweens-boppers who still love Aaron Carter. If you're a casual guard like me, it's not a movie for you
