I was very excited when Paranormal State first came to A&E. I thought it might bring some more interesting ghosts. The value of production looked good and I really love the logo. Then, after a few episodes, I began to feel that this show didn't have to look for evidence but had a strong religious agenda. He can't even make a cup of tea on the camera, but everyone is scared. Then comes the power of Christ's ritual to save everyone. Also, very little focus on other team members. The whole show focuses on Ryan and he feels like one of those people who help you with the pamphlets of his church on the street. It should be on a Christian network. I was very disappointed.
