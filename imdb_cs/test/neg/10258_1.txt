This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen; It makes Plan 9 of the outer universe look wonderful. The negotiations are wooden, there is no plot and SFX. The only good thing about it is that it's not a long movie. The scenery is sometimes quite nice, assuming you like trees if it helps everyone!
