The only good part of this movie was the end. You know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you go home. No, not that it may be a bit rough - the dance in the movie was sensational, but unfortunately it is where the storyline ended. As long as the dance did not dance, the film went well. As for Chayanne's debut, it's not bad, but hopefully his next film will be a little more deep. When it comes to visiting the movie wait for a rental or TV. Don't make the same mistake I made and paid 8.50
