How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies still sit in this one hour ride? There's so many stupid things about this movie it's the mind it's overwhelming! I remember when I went to see JP as a kid that was my favorite movie and franchise, acting, SFX music, direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK the same, except some really silly moments (like a gymnast gymnast kicking girl .. please!) but on the whole a traceable and sensible film experience. But the third one has no meaning !! It is assumed that this will be a sequel that Carry comes from JP2, yet magically includes new stuff in a series that could not be left out on the previous 2 movies! for example: 1) "new" mega Spinosaurus - seriously, what the hell! This thing is watching them wherever they go, they can't escape his presence and yet in the Lost World (on the same island) do you see it once? do you hear it? does anyone think that? NO! It is ridiculous!. The star character in the previous 2 movies was, and always will be, T-Rex, so what does the d (urr) director "Joe Johnston" go and do? Kill it! once you see the huge T-Rex in all its amazing roaring glory, it will kill you and you will never see it again - the new Dino in town is an excuse ... where it comes from! ?? not the only explanation! and don't get me to start the whole thing on a satellite phone in Dino-belly! 2) Just when you start overcoming how stupid Spinosaurus is, you see Raptors, in addition to their new "Punk" hairstyles, they seem quite credible! * Phew * Will This Movie Be Traceable Properly? ... WRONG! now he speaks to himself! and excuse them to talk in this movie and not in the first and second are ... wait for it ... Evolution! - Yes, the process of millions of years in just a few months, when the second movie ended, amazing! Certainly they should have grown opposable inches and created tools now !! OK I'm not going to say any more about the conspiracy because it's getting into my nose, so I'm going to close at this point: Jurassic Park is classic, JP3 is a lousy fool to any of the original fans of the series, my favorite franchise was well and really dead after watching this Monstrosity (no pun intended) Avoid this movie as a plague
