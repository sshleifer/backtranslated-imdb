One of the latest (catastrophic) movies from York Entertainment, "El Chupacabra", is that his viewer wants to die after wasting him two hours. This movie seems to have been filmed with a replacement video camera commonly used for birthday parties. The only reason I could say it wasn't was because of certain scenes where the cameraman's shadow is in the picture. Almost every aspect of the film is plagued by this film, and I'm sure the film industry has set it back for ten years. Actors are limited, often silent while waiting for the off-screen cue card to change. The actor who plays Navarro not only slips in his dialogue and skips the word, but stumbles across the Swiss-cheese area with a squinting and confused look on his face. Other actors break the fourth wall and, in general, show the acting skill of a 12-year-old boy who is doing a science project in his yard. My friends and I have been purposefully searching for the worst possible movies and this has given us more than we have negotiated. The funny parts are rude and the rest are riddled with horrible clich√©s and conspiracy holes. As one friend humbly said, this film is a miscarriage of industry. I would highly recommend this movie to people like me who intentionally are looking for these movies, but for everyone else, beware!
