What gives Anthony Minghell the right to destroy two extraordinary works of fiction? First he destroyed an English patient, which was pretty bad, but now I found out that he was angry with Cold Mountain - loser !!! <br /> <br /> I had such a special response to an English patient. My son and I were going to see this first weekend it was released, and I was so disappointed but said my son I felt like I needed to read a book. I went straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it and tried to find out what critics are talking about in the world when they said Minghella believed enough in the intelligence of the film public to give them a great movie. That's what he probably didn't. I'm not usually reading a lot of fiction, but Cold Mountain was so recommended by friends that I felt compelled to read. I haven't seen Cold Mountain, a movie when it played in theaters, and it was because of what Minghella did for an English patient. But like a fool I rented it today and I'm so angry, I had to get rid of my frustration and most of all my sadness that someone could have taken this beautiful story and made it so beautiful. screen, and now they will never be. <br /> <br /> READ THE BOOK AND ALLOW THE FILM ROT ON THE LAND. I'll never accept the Minghella project again. I think he can be one of the worst directors working today, and I'm tired of the praise the Hollywood heaps have on his head. It must be that no one in Hollywood is reading. This film bears no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. Minghell's ego may not know any boundaries, and if he doesn't like the book, why didn't he write the original script and leave the book alone. Even if I didn't read the book, I would still consider this film as one of the worst I've seen in 2003; and I saw almost everything that was released for viewing in the US. Elaine, you won't like it.
