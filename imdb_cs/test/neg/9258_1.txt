Film director Staten Island Andy Milligan is well known in the horror community for being a worse director than Ed Wood. And with this example of his output, I'm willing to agree with them. In "The Gastly Ones" we basically have three bickering couples traveling to their orphanage (located on an appropriately isolated island) to collect heritage. There are killed one by one and the events develop in the murder / fashion secrets with scarred retard hunchback butler added to throw you on the loop. The film is in such bad condition that it looks like someone was just running through the dishwasher, the sound is terrible, the dialogue is ominously bad, there's some primitive mannequin gore (plus some rifts and guts) and it's technically awkward in all possible ways it may be awkward. But is it nice in the wrong movie? Somehow. It's unbearable to watch, but weirdly entertaining in train wreck fashion. Be careful. If you're not a fan of horrible movies, then six of them.
