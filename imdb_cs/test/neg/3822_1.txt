Some horror movie that throws Robert Englund (Freddie Kruger!) Then kills him in opening 5 minutes before introductory credits even running should be immediately seen with nothing except suspicion. Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a guide to the swamps (by the way his James Earl Jones voice is hysterical, I don't know or care if he's trying to be funny, but I laughed at it). Unfortunately, his role was just 5 minutes long. Other reasons for suspicion and quite rightly. Mercedes McNab (Buffy & Angel's AKA Harmony, I had to look at her to remember what I remembered but gets topless!), Marcus Token Black (not another teen movie) is Filling a comedy role that really is not necessary in horror unless it is intended as a spoof. Joel Murray (Bill Murray's brother & Pete from Dharma & Greg) plays Shapiro, the guy who shoots gonzo video with 2 cute girls. As they take the "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour", the two main male characters meet some other people and run on the rocks and have to leave the ship. So their now all isolated in the swamp at night in the rain. Once the real story of Victor Crowley is told (his makeup looked like a Goonies sloth), we found he was dead. (You will not return well from being hit by an ax in your skull!) Once the old man is attacked, even though he pulls down his gun and has a very clear shot, it takes Marybeth more than 30 seconds to shoot the guy. who is hacking an old man as opposed to an ax. Is she stupid? That is 29 seconds too long! As for the plot there really isn't one (I don't have a class of undead psycho like conspiracy, sorry) and stimulation is really bad anyway. You have killing, some run, some light relief then some slow dialogue before you start the cycle again. After an extremely long scene exploring a gaudy shrub with a raccoon in it, Victor reappears (with some kind of power tool) and kills a dark-haired porn girl, can he cut the guide half with a shovel? Leaving Misty alone to look at Ben, I felt it was quite obvious that the next one would die (I was right, but you don't want to see it). The filmmakers? Rain does not quench gasoline burning, OK? Idiots! After two closest mistakes in the cemetery, Marcus was next to the dying man, and Ben was wounded in the toe with a point, but he managed to find a ship after impaling Victor at the top. water invisible, trying to save her, then suddenly pulled them into the boat Victor and screaming and the movie suddenly ends. Yeah, like that. There's no idea if Ben was dead (he seemed missing his hand) and no idea if Marybeth would survive and what happened to Victor. It's a terrible ending and no doubt my verbal assault on filmmakers got the last review deleted. So much for free speech, huh?
