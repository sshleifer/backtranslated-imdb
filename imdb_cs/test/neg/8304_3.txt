Wow. Simply wow. Never before have I seen a horror movie in which a bad self insert fanfic seemed to have written one day in 20 minutes. And then I came to "Lady Frankenstein". This film takes everything you know about Frankenstein and turns it upside down ... and not in a good way. If you've seen this movie you've either stumbled upon it on Italian TV, or you have a dubbed version of the 50 Chilling Classics Box set up like me, like number 24. And let's say that's why these movies are here. Because they're not very good. enough for it, but for the movie. It starts with Dr. Frankenstein is trying to make a monster with his assistant who is .... obviously not for some reason igor. His college graduate daughter (?) Shows up and states how he just graduated with a medical degree because yeah. there were so many doctors. So he expresses how he wants to help his father with his work and says no. And then he makes a monster and kills him. So she mourns for exactly 7 seconds and then she and the assistant come up with a thief. The monster escapes and goes on the rampage. OK, I really can't believe they killed Dr. Frankenstein so early in the movie. dies ... 20 minutes. which ... does not make much sense, but surely. So lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill a monster that is now furious .... is to make another monster! Oh yes, how I love her logic. so her new monster gets the body by killing someone and putting the assistant's brain in it ... I know. Just nod and go with him. And so the monsters come together and go out. I love the assistant asking, "Why don't we just let the crowds kill it?" and she replies "They wouldn't know how to kill it!" and finally he kills him with an ax to his head. Ha-Ha. Yeah yeah, no one ELSE could figure out that one of them. so eventually the brain changed a new monster killing lady frankenstein. End. This movie was just ... weird. it was as if someone had written a fanfare. There is no other way to describe this film. There were also some strange nude scenes. Like, this girl had naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster picks up the girl and the guy leaves. Ha-Ha. nice guy. She then fights a little and dies from ..... be quite honest, I really don't know what died. But what. She's Lady Frankenstein. It doesn't have to make sense. This movie had a lot of "Why?" moments to the point of giving up. Movies shouldn't do that, but for some reason I see more than I should. So the last word is not the worst movie I've ever seen on this deck, but it's boring and full of many holes and random stuff. So Lady Frankenstein Gets 3 Frankenstein Porn Scenes, of 10
