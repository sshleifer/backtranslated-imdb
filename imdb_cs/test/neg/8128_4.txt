Sebastian Cabot is a wealthy jerk who wants to redeem the whole country because there is oil - although none of the locals is informed about oil. With the help of the evil shooter in black they kill and terrorize everyone. When the son of a murdered man comes, he refuses to return and confronts these forces of darkness. Wow. As I watched TERROR In Texas, I felt like I had seen this movie many times before and would probably see it again. This is because in addition to a few innovations (such as Sterling Hayden using a harpoon on an evil guy), he has a plot that is too familiar. Again, we have a rich guy who's trying to expel all the farmers to gain control of the whole country. And to do so, he brought hired weapons to make them sell or kill. I've been there, done it in too many movies. I love Hayden in movies, but I just can't recommend it as anything but a poor traveler.
