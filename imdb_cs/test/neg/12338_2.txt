Downhill Racer is basically a movie seen only for amazing ski sequences. Although there is a story, the character of Robert Redford, the skier who is trying to make himself an Olympic team in the US, is so unprecedented and unsympathetic that you wonder why take care of him at all. Gene Hackman, in a premature performance, adds nicely, but this is a movie that could be watched with the sound off, and that wouldn't make a big difference.
