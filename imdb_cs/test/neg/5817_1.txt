I'm a huge lover of really bad B movies. Above all, I love extraterrestrial movies. I say cheaper, cheesier, and camper, the better. The low budget and hockey idea are fun enough for most bad B movies, but this movie is so bad that I really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the ad-lib actors. First, there is no real plot, it's all kind of a "comedy" situation (if it can be called that). "Comedy" in this movie is more about the characters saying, basically, "looking at me, I'm in this crazy situation!" Isn't it funny? ‚Äù, But it's just pathetic, because nothing that does is funny. There is no comic acting skill, nor any impolite conspiracy to carry all these unimaginable scenarios through this harsh horror. Actors, actors say really stupid things over and over (maybe trying to scorn for phrases, maybe just b / c each in this is so bad), really unattractive women are played like hot chicks, and people barfing and passing in the bathroom. At the end of the film, there was one middle-aged actor I could say he had some acting chops and was a bit convincing in his role. In the bathroom with a weekend detoxification unit he was as motionless as a solid BM. Corey Feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes (fortunately we didn't have to place him anymore) and he was filmed off the web - probably outside his apartment somewhere. He said a few really fun things about extraterrestrials and extraterrestrial sex, and that was the extent of his appearance. <br /> <br /> If you value your life and lose 90 minutes (and the years of remembering pain) by watching this waste, you will avoid it. If you make a lot of drugs, like Adam Sandler's comedy style (and thus no standards at all), you consider this movie to be mentally slow. <br /> <br /> P.S. I think the people who raged on this must work for Tromo or something, b / c I can't believe that people can be so lame that they really enjoy this movie. (Does it really destroy your drugs?)
