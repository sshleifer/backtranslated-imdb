This is just one of hundreds of millions of movies where directors try to pull too much drama into a movie that is not at all dramatic. As in the beginning, the part where the monk's dude stuck an arrow into his own hand, then shot the same arrow in the gargoyle five minutes later - no sense at all. The only thing that was worse than that, the plot line is CGI, which would be very rivaled by the domestic flash movie. The actors seem to do the hardest to portray a lot of 70s robots. Dialogue makes so little sense that it's not funny. Many things just didn't happen, without any explanation of how or why, for example, a lady who was suddenly hanging around a zoo that had been closed a few hours ago. And when she sees THIS flying flying to her, her first reaction is that instead of doing it ten minutes later, she goes on a picture than what she has been doing on it for decades - no matter how on it life depends - which, of course not. <br /> <br /> We do not recommend overall. I wish they were still doing new MST3K episodes.
