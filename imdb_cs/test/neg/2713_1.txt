That must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After seeing this piece of sh * t, I felt like I should write Madonna and demand compensation for my time, but now I feel I should write Madonna and demand a great 80's album (since she can't record a good album to save her life) in return for this disaster. <br /> <br /> On the film itself, which can be summarized as follows: <br /> <br /> It consists of Madonna jumping around and acting like a spoiled teenager who has lost his way. He tries to impress this absolute show of the actor who plays the "lawyer" in the film, but the ending was the best. "And that's it? That's the end? What a piece of sh * t!" If Madonna wasn't a pop icon at the time of this movie, this movie would destroy her career, and the funniest thing was that I watched the movie, where they placed the song "Who's the Girl" Well, guess where they placed it? ............................ ..... ..at the end!
