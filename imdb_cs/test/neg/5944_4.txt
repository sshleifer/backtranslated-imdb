Recap: The band of five young Americans, all that remains of the platoon hard hit during the Ardenne offensive during World War II, was tasked as a forward base and was looking for hostile activity. They are in a very bad state, both physically and mentally, and they think they hit gold when their base is in a deserted, but once luxurious, food-filled mansion. But after a while there is some hostile activity, and it is very special. Not hostile, but strange. Looks like there is a German team, in the same bad condition that wants nothing more than to give up. Comments: According to the novel and my guess that the novel is much better than the story it does not seem to translate well on the big screen. It is actually another war film, much more about the psychological pressure during the wars than about the battles and battles. But I can almost feel that scenes that had to be full of tension, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just fall in the movie. It's not tense, just different and absurd in many ways. Many times people just act crazy, and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at. So when this mental pressure cannot pass, the main piece of the story, I thought the story was over. It wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the edge and I didn't actually send a message. Actually, he did nothing. The cast is interesting, many young actors who have turned into stars at the beginning of their career. Acting is good, but not stellar, and several characters have fallen into the absurd zone. Much of that, too, I feel that this story, these characters need the time, space and pace given in the novel, which cannot be mentioned here. And going half is definitely not good enough. <br/> <br/> 4/10
