The film is an adaptation of the Japanese story of respected author Yukio Mishima. It just doesn't mean going to a trusted story about British and Americans. The story moves slowly, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director fills in clich√©s. Boat wave prow, and a small route route filling in maps while their letters are heard in overpayment. The film moves so miserably that I have even quickly advanced through sex and masturbation scenes that, although long, are not really passionate or erotic. The film reached a notoriety rate when Kristofferson's then-wife divorced him for extracurricular activities with Miss Miles during filming. I think they liked sex scenes, but it's not exactly the same for the viewer. <br /> <br /> There are no characters you might encounter. A sexually frustrated widow is unlikely, a small child is disgusting. Kristofferson is so friendly that he simply does not have gaming skills that would bring much to the role, even though we may not want to deal with him too much, considering his ultimate destiny. As for a young child, well, he falls a little with a bad crowd after his father dies and helps him plot some evil against a man who enters his mother's life. Now it's a really bad crowd. There are not only shocked and smoky drugs, nosireebib. Slip mickey to the cat and vivisect it. This is shown in more detail. But of course it's just practice, so they can do the same with Kristofferson! So, most of the time, the film is moving slowly, without any kind of character it would cover, and when something happens, it's inexorably morbid. The end is just as unsatisfactory as any movie you'll ever see. All this could have made sense if the Japanese language and cultural context were preserved. It's worthless as it stands. <br /> <br />
