When I watched this film several times, I came to the conclusion that Milo≈° Forman made a very daring decision to produce a muse for Goya when the artist led what most of them thought would be a tumultuous, passionate life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged. all over Europe, certainly one that has enough drama to draw on. While I understand that Mr. Forman in the microcosm concerned the tragedy of Ines' life at the time of the devastation of the world, I felt that there were so many of Goya's omitted, so much of his humanity. The strongest and most promising point of this film was that each of us is a potential villain in the flow of life because of the fallen nature of man, each of us has evil in us that we must fight with the help of God. How eloquent when Goya says he should help Ines more, as is true for all of us! We must defend and protect the innocent. The brilliantly ironic scene in which a once-imprisoned priest sentenced to death sentenced the death sentence of Lorenzo, who originally condemned him, is a genius. When the credits ran down, I wanted something more. Maybe fewer unbelievable coincidences and more inner life of the characters.
