Danny De Vito shows us that he is definitely, really infinitely, better on screen than out. He plays the role of Owen, a miserable be-be writer with a rough old mother (beautifully played by Anne Ramsey) would like to see the dead. Billy Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated teacher who has an estranged woman who feels the same. Owen, after seeing Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train," suggests they exchange murders. However, as director De Vito, his control is inconsistent because he wastes this clever idea while his film lurks from a very funny to a very bland. He and Crystal are all right in the lead, but the show belongs to Anne Ramsey as Mrs. Lift. Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
