Take your camcorder, turn off all the lights in your house, and film people running with flashlights for an hour and a half and have a basic idea of ​​what this movie looks like. It's very unpleasant to watch this kind of movie. Being righteous, there are daylight scenes at the very beginning and very end of the movie. I like scary movies and features of creation, but this didn't do anything for me. I'm so sorry. I really tried. There wasn't a lot of conspiracy here before we got to find a way out. I didn't know too much about any of the characters, so it didn't matter if we lost one or two on the way. This is not the worst movie in the world. "Open Water" holds this title for now.
