I'm a big fan of the first four Ju-on projects. I own them and watch them every few months. I lend them to co-workers and friends so they can get quality fear of high-quality Japanese work. I think Takashi Shimizu created a great story and presented it very efficiently in these four installments. I was somewhat excited about the opening of the Grudge 2 theater in theaters. I saw the first American Grudge before I watched four originals. Grudge was actually pretty good. Of course, the originals are better but I have a good Halloween fear of 2004 American Grudge. Grudge 2 started badly and went from there. I waited for it to be better enough to show Shimizu's talent - nothing like that. The thing that is great about Shimizu's Ju-on work is a story. True, it's usually said in a discontinuous style that you have to think about connecting your components, but it's still a great story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of gratuitous deaths that you never had time to take care of. <br /> <br /> Editing was cruel. Discontinuous (as in Japanese originals) is one thing, but the full sequence randomness of the scene was exhausting. I was just wondering, "That's so stupid," and "No - didn't it sell out so much?" I wanted me to leave the theater, run home and watch the original work, just make sure that Shimizu didn't always do that stupid, generic, boring, incomprehensible, thrown teammate. /> <br /> If you really see that you like this movie, I suggest you borrow it for two months. Really. Two of the five people in the theater came out with me for about 45 minutes. I discussed whether I would do it myself. Going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend your time at this point. I'm really shocked at how bad this movie was. We pray Sam Raimi will not give more money to The Grudge 3. It's just not worth it. Sigh.
