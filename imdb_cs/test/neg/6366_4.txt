Tom is about to slip into a delicious Jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey knocks down and flies off with his snack. Not at all happy with his sarnie stealing from his nose, Tom starts in pursuit, determined to get his mouses' piece. Like Tom and Jerry, I have to say that this is a bit stinking: the story is rather secular; introduces a poorly conceived peripheral character that lacks charm; And it whips the old 'dress cartoon character as a female gag to death. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, 'Flirty Birdy' rivals 'Fraidy Cat' and 'Mouse in Manhattan' for title so far the weakest of Tom and Jerry caper.
