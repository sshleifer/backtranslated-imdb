I have seen several scenic and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this must take the cake as the absolute worst. My family has no idea about the DVD and couldn't even get to the first half. Later I came back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it was a Christmas present for me) and I was just horrified. The only redeeming factor (and barely enough to buy the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker playing Mock Turtle with Yiddish accent. It's one of the few moments in a work that has some real magic and can be taken somewhat seriously. Besides, the songs are half-song, the melodies are half-melody, and Meryl Streep can't make this direction look good.
