In the mid-nineties, the career of animator director Don Bluth seemed to go down to a minimum. Previously, Bluth made a series of popular animated films, many of which remain beloved today such as "Earth Before Time" (1988), "The Secret of NIMH" (1982), and "American Tail" (1986). It started with "Thumbelina" in 1994, and his films seemed to be increasingly declining in quality and popularity, and one of the many unfortunate contributions in 1995 was the "Pebble and the Penguin", a movie that didn't attract viewers. beyond parents and children under 7 years of age. Honestly, the latter are the only viewers to whom I can understand the enjoyment of this somewhat animated scene. The story is absurd. The film plays the poorly drawn, stuttering and chubby penguin named Hubie (voiced by Martin Short), who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head (Annie Golden voice). SORT OF as in real life, penguins represent their bride-to-bes with pebble as a replacement for the ring. But when Hubie is swept away with the current, he joins a lone rockhopper (James Belushi) with a dream of flying and races against time to return to Antarctica before it's too late. The reasons why they might be too late is one of the many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would remain weak even if they were there. Very soon it is clear why this animated children's musical is not going to work for anyone older than saying six or seven years of age. It just doesn't have any of the features that are needed for a good animated element. Number one, the film looks bad because of the very poor drawing style. The animation in this film is very cartography (even in animated films); it's dark, gloomy, there's no vividness in the colors, plus film design and elements are universally droll and laughter. Take, for example, the penguins playing in the movie. With only a few exceptions in the background, every penguin looks just like a bird. For example, Hubie looks ridiculously ridiculous with wide cheeks, musty beaks, big eyes, and the nonsensical hat he wears wherever he goes. Combined with a hand like a "fin" looks like Chris Farley in a penguin suit. The result: it's an ugly, badly cartoon character. But the most absurd-looking and absurdly designed character is the evil Drake Penguin, who sincerely looks like a penguin. He is a muscular man with a penguin mask. His chest is wider than Arnold Schwarzenegger's chest and his teeth are larger than those of leopard seals and killer whales that serve as predators of the film. Basically, it's a two-dimensional, recycled villain. He lives in a skull-shaped cave, wears a raincoat, laughs a lot, and gets mad when people laugh with him. Result: Who cares? And what is also bad, and perhaps worse, is that it is an animated musical, and there is no remarkable or unforgettable song anywhere in its run. The opening hymn was harmless, unforgettable, but harmless. But after that, the songs became more dull and dull, and there was one that grimaced me all the time. It's a moment when viewers press a fast forward button whenever it comes. I felt that "The Pebble and the Penguin" was ubiquitous, except for a few moments when Hubie and the Rockhopper Rockhopper penguin were in danger of leopard and jaw seal jaws, which were fortunately without dialogue and considered animals instead of cartoon characters. But in a way, for this reason, I cannot fully recommend this film to children. That's the reason. The film depicts killer whales, which are natural penguin predators. I am concerned that children who are acquainted with "free Willy" (1993) may be offended or humiliated by seeing their favorite sea inhabitants being portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore. The Leopard seal was a better adversary and was more humorous when he saw his jaws open wider than rattlesnakes and how he seems to be smiling as he growls. But the fact really is that these moments with predators? and there are only a few ?? And it's not extremely interesting, remember. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I can't recommend it to anyone under the age of seven. My advice: if you have kids around this site, rent them for them. They could enjoy it.
