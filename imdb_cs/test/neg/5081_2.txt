the people who told me "this movie is good" This movie is intended for viewers who have no difficulty looking at everything (especially when it's all about hard guys, gunners, chasing and temptations). movie with "The Inside Man". I'm tired of copying and pasting movies. I'm dissatisfied, but what can I do? fans of this type of movies are much more .... if you want to watch a good movie of this type, I recommend you "Lucky Number Slevin". I don't think I like this movie (weak actors, weak script, weak action). Probably someone else will like the fact that people have a lot of taste.
