The only redemption feature of this film is Steve Carell. Like John Wayne, I have never seen Steve Carello drag too far as an actor, but it doesn't matter. She always plays one role perfectly. As Marty Feldman once said, comedy must have an inner consistency. You can have 4 men on the podium sitting in garbage cans, and that's okay, but if you bring the fifth man to the podium that isn't in the garbage can, you have to explain to the audience why he's not in the garbage can. . Why does Evan not accept his role as messenger of God? Why, when he accepts it, is he so deeply embarrassed? Why isn't anyone more impressed with the way animals follow Evan (explained by the fact that unthinking doubters are explained as "trained animals" perhaps from the circus). In the end there is a terrible flood and most of the people who see hops on the Ark and are saved, but surely thousands of people would be murdered; in the end there is no emotional atmosphere after the disaster. Instead, most of the congress finally saw the light and was about to pursue the impregnable bad congressman for "profiteering" alone. I must admit that I am also glad that the fish in the aquarium respond to Evan's presence.
