Did you find that funny title? No no? That's because you're nervous. Learn to laugh, because if you don't laugh, you don't live. So please lower your standards as to what you think is funny for what a mere child is. Is it funny now? Not yet?! OK, that's because you're full of yourself and offended easily. If you don't laugh, you don't live. And if you don't like it, send me hate mail so I can write another review and say how much hate mail I am and try to twist it so it looks like I'm wrong ass. Are you laughing at my hilarious title so far? Not yet?!?! OK, that's it! You're a racist! You have to laugh, otherwise you are a racist. Why not otherwise laugh? Oh, it's not funny! No, that can't be a reason. I want it to be funny, so it's !! Smích zatraceně !!!! Please!!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK, that's it. Where's my notebook and pen? And where is my Richard Pryor DVD? I have to write some jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> A ...... scene. Thanks thanks. This is basically what you get from Mencia for about 23 minutes. Please do a favor and change the channel when this bum show comes. Even basic cable channels have things 100 times better than this. I'm not saying that because I hate him. I'm real. This show is like watching the grass grow. However, you are not sure that at least grass will not steal jokes. I sincerely try to save time. I even tried to watch his show. I thought "maybe it's not bad." But no, it is. When I watched his show, I'm completely out of the way. I tried to collect during the commercial break and focus on the show, but I couldn't. I resonated again, I think I was thinking about something more interesting, such as reworking a bed, vacuuming or folding socks. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yeah, it's so bad. Here's my last thought - There are so many things you can do with 30 minutes except watching this guy who says nothing for half an hour. Do not look at a show that is trying in vain to push racism into the face. I can support programs that try to alleviate the tensions of race wars, but this guy rather provides more racism than stopping.
