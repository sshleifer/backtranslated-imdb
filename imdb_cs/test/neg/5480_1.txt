This game was terrible. I think they worked too hard on visual work and didn't do much with gameplay, which is the most important part. The visuals look incredible, but is the game really "fun"? NO! I mean, it's like "hey, let's jump out of buildings" and all I do is hoist and A / X. There's just no game there and I disagree with what Ubisoft did because they had this hot girl (game producer) , Jade Raymond) and they were like "OK, we have a hot girl, Pimp her" and if you go to the game site, you won't see the game stuff Assassin Creed, you will see her face with a microphone and it will be like "We interview Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies ! "It's like a man, closed F * @ K UP WHO CARES?! Apparently ... a lot of people do because they bought the game and they like it ... I mean compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. Wii game that really does not abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and brings the most important parts, GAMEPLAY! They managed to do something with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still overwhelming, the music in the game was organized and sounded amazing, and this is a game that deserves the game of the year. NO Assassin's Creed, man, he doesn't deserve to be NOMINEE for the game of the year. Hype around this game where it was like "oh it's the next generation of games" .... really? I think not! Let me get it right here because I think people who like this game just like it because they're Jade fans, so I'll tell you that JADE WILL NOT EXPLOSE YOU OR ANYONE IF YOU LOVE OR SEND THE GAME! If you want a REAL game on PS3, get Uncharted: Drake's Fortune if you want a REAL game for Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and so many other games) and if you want REAL on all systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will hate many, but seriously, pressing the two buttons for all that is cool, is it really a fun game? The only reason that other games make this difficult is that after it is over, it will be much more innovative and fun. And this game just isn't. <br /> <br /> 1.3 / 10 LIVE HELL!
