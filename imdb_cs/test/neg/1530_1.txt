It is not the first time I am from a majority perspective. Oz is a horrible, arrogant, voyeuristic series. The makers have their cake and eat. Oz, Em City, etc. They are used as ultra-raw signals that the apparent roughness is a complete fantasy. This allows viewers of the weakest intellectual excuse to follow the soap operative nonsense seasoned with everything that is wrong with human beings. When you look at the episode, please remember that while it is a violent, absurd, unreasonably intricate, unconvincing, sick, imaginary drama unfolding before your approval eyes, several hundred children in poorer parts the world died of bad food or water. Oz is an exploitative drama at his worst place. It appeals to basic instincts, but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than Mahler's symphony. The dialogue is inexorably ugly and utilitarian. Freedom with reality is stupid. Here's a dandy nightclub that comes to Oz in his foppish finery, complemented by a ridiculously drawn contact lens in one eye, waving a hiding place of drugs that no one has found. Here's a murderous werewolf who got married to the warm death of the universe, begging him to be killed, but of course he was rejected by the rough way he approached and made a little improbable throat cutting. Action races at a fast pace so that a voyeurist, dark-witted spectator always thinks about what happens next than what has just been shown. Don't worry, betrayal, murder, sex scene in a minute or two. Oz is obviously conceited at last. You don't have to feel embarrassed to be carried by his stream. You can watch it and think that producers, writers and actors do everything with a huge blink (or the same word, but to change the vowel) to the audience. Yes, you can be an ugly viewer and apologize on the basis of the smart, postmodern, etc. skills of the Oz production team. Appeal to the lowest common denominator, while pretending to operate at a higher level. Really, despicable series. And every hour it shows, rewards its creators and actors and generates advertising revenue for channels that show it to people who have nothing better than to watch something so ugly and unnecessary, another hundred children will die whose lives could be saved dollars spent this terrible, successful and widely praised series.
