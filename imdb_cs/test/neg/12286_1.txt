The Dinosaur City adventure, even though it is a creative idea, was a blatantly curious attempt at filming. It is interesting to be sucked into the television and into the new world. Three juveniles, obsessed with enthusiastically half-animated dinosaurs, are not. Don't waste your time or brain power to see this certain loser. I wouldn't even let my kids watch.
