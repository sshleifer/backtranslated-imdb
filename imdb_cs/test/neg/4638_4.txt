World War I gets a shiny, sepia-toned human in the tirelessly whimsical Jean-Pierre Jeunet's "very long engagement". Jeunet's style is made up of a mechanical, almost hour-long narrative structure, decorated with rich values ​​in the production of chocolate boxes and flavored with artificial humor. It is an approach that has worked quite well with his previous picture, the romantic fantasy "Amelie", thanks to a small portion of the inimitable contribution of Audrey Tatou in the title role. Jeunet's method, applied to much more gloomy material, is rather discouraged. Here he is grown again in variation on the same kind of sweet off-beat character as Amelia. She is Mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting, determined to track down what happened to her baby boy Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), a few years after he disappeared in the war. Manech was one of five soldiers rigged for self-mutilation in "Bingo Crepuscule" in 1917, and sentenced to no man's land as a punishment. He is supposed to be dead by everyone, than Mathilde, who appreciates the hope of finding him. The film follows Mathilde's pursued quest to find out what really happened and when he delves deeper, he reveals a sad, even shocking story of high corruption and inhumanity. Mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various contradictory, overlapping, or incomplete accounts of what seems to be the last hour of Manech. All of this should be irritating and tight, but it's more often confusing thanks to the visual and verbal mess with which Jeunet mumbles its audience. It's just too much going on at one time, including a distracting narrative that adds nothing to our appreciation of story and characters. Without a moment's respite from the information overload, I felt denied space to think about Mathilde's efforts or room to deal with him under my own circumstances. Jeunet is still busy with camera spirals and swoops and circles, stroking every surface contour of his wonderfully designed production, but it fails individually to penetrate the soul under the skin of the story. The result is deeply unwavering and worse grotesque. World War I was a particularly dark hour in human history. Imagine being re-created as one of those picturesque ads for a famous Belgian lager, and you have the movie.
