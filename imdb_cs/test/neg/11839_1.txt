OK, leave one thing straight, I love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones. So it allows you to continue with that in mind. "Raptor" is a really horrible movie, in fact it is not even a movie in its own right, as it is paved together from pieces of "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" & "Primal Species - Carnosaur 3". There is some new shots with Eric Roberts as a sheriff, and his sidekick busts running around seemed puzzled, terrified or whatever it is there to try to communicate (badly) on the emotional scale but then how they can react to something that has been filmed several years earlier. Producers (yes Roger Corman talk about you!) They even went on to hire 2 people from "Carnosaur" to play bit parts, so you can re-use death scene grisly! So this movie is the cheapest of the cheap. Check out 3 original movies, there are no Oscar winners, but have some meritt and fun values, but avoid the "Raptor". Oh, she also has the most unusual sex scene that runs for almost 10 minutes! Do you think they're trying to run the run?
