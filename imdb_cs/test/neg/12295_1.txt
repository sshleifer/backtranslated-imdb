Horror, the unspeakable horror of this film. If you can even call it a movie. It looks like a first-year art school project, hurriedly tiled together. "Talents" will expose you to a painful mix of inadequate and excessive action, and virtually all scenes have been devised. and cocky. The film is by no means reflecting Malaysian culture or social conventions - no one's talking about it. I live in Malaysia, BTW. Spinning Gasing seems to be tailor-made to win a foreign film award for a Western film festival. And unfortunately, the trick seemed to work. Some reviewers would undoubtedly call it "exotic," but a more accurate word would be "appalling." <br /> <br />
