You know, I really hate the IMDb censor system because my entire review is almost gone if you curse. But we're going. Edit Time! The holy mole is bad. I thought it might be a great little movie, judging by the summary of the plot, because I knew I had blindly rented gems like Frailty and American Nightmare. But that's just an abomination. It's about a murderer who uses Edgar Allen Poe's works as a reference for his murders and the story of a detective who has to stop him. Can these glittering hacks not make a good movie without defiling the grave of a great horror writer? Kills here are absolutely free of thoughts or originality, and the references to Poe are hockey and fake without enough thought. They are shallow and shame Poe's work. Full holes, with severe sequencing. Action is also bad, reminding me of an abortion that was known as "Fear X" in some Third World countries, with all the pauses and non-emotional lines. I realize it's an indie movie, but it's not an excuse. I saw high school kids acting better than these morons, and I myself could come up with better scenes to kill and better plot, with enough time. <br /> <br /> This has no reason to exist. Avoid at any cost.
