Production values ​​for this film make it a lack of Hollywood blockbuster status, and the script makes it lack the cult status. What is left is a tired formal attempt at a catastrophic film genre that disappears with the outflow of tide. Decent cast, no matter what the cast is, or can't be bothered. Beautiful Joanne Whalley is unable to bring any gravity into the role of Commissioner Nash, who wears the most irritating matching waistband over her skirt. Jessalyn Gilseg plays the heavy role of the Thames Barrier Director with all the beliefs about the fair candy thread. Her Canadian nationality and accent was probably designed to address the transatlantic audience. That, and she, is failing. Her initial appearance in a tight-fitting pink running suit when she comes to work is undisputed. The part of the "old match that was right" is played by Tom Courtenay as if acting in his sleep, and the various twists that are designed to encourage his son, who plays Robert Carlyle, are trying to get away from any answer. Nigel Planer looks determined to commit hari curry rituals for his failures as Met Office Director, or for his play, or both, and only David Suchet appears with some award for his role as Deputy PM. There was enough in the story and the consequences that made a decent effort. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.
