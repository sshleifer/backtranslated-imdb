I'm a big fan of slimy and horror movies when you put them together, that's my place: terrible sleaze. But you won't get it in this movie. There is definitely a sleaze, in the form of girls who are kidnapped and tortured, tied naked on different things. However, Sliza is not too thin. There wasn't much registration on my sleaze meter, mainly because none of the girls was the least attractive, nor did they try to act as if they were threatened. They seemed to think more about what was for lunch, or maybe when they could score some cracking. Forget the effects, they were extreme. The malpractice contributed viciously; the effects are harder to believe when neither the actors nor the actresses buy them. The camera was bad enough to hire a couple of porn filmmakers to do better. In fact, it could increase the sleaze factor enough to make it pleasant. As it is, there are plenty of dark shots where you can't see very clearly, and what you see doesn't look too good. The horror factor is zero. Zero. Zero. Nada. Zipper. Zilch. I saw children's movies that were scarier. There's no camp here either. It's just a movie that tries to be shocking, but it's not even close.
