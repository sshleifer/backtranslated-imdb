Boring, absolutely predictable soap operas. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson, who has an affair with Christine Lahti. Moore is friends with Lahti and doesn't know about cheating. Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with her baby. YAWN! I am ashamed to admit that I paid the money to see it in the theater in 1986. I liked all three stars, but even their considerable talent could not pull it. He knew again what was going to happen. As another poster said - it plays as a PG-rated Lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> Has Lahti swearing nonstop in one place and even Moore allows you to release once! Also there is a pointless shot of topless women playing football (!!!). Other than it is television friendly. The only good thing about it was Timothy Gibbs playing Moore and Danson's teenage son. Very handsome and pretty good actor. Moreover, it does not recommend anything. You've seen it before ... and done better. Of course, it's forgotten. Skip it.
