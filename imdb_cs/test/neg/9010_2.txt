I agree that most of the 50s horrors are not scary by today's standards, but what the hell is that? When you see such a title, you expect to see blood and blood thirsty beast. Instead, we have no blood and a beast that wants to either take over the world or live in peace on Earth .... yeah, what people wanted. <br /> <br /> The overall story is fine astronaut returns to life and is one with the beast .... but the title really kills the movie. Night of the Beast would make fans more happy because there is really no blood to talk about. I like the way films from the 1950s had ends that left room for continuation, but never wisely done. . This movie is not the worst I've ever seen, but its almost there. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
