this show disturbs me. It occupies the nick slots on the thread that could be reserved for fresh prince or George Lopez. and a full house and Roseanne. are better than home improvement. First, Jill's mother worries me a lot. she's an excessive girl and I really despise her. Brad is a fat toad and is also annoying. and the youngest brother, I don't even know his name! I don't mind him at all! This is probably not an actor's mistake, it's probably writers. Tim is just a stupid ass. even though Jill DEFINITELY is my favorite, I don't like any of them. The only reason I gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to Randy. as a middle-aged child, he is still an annoying little brother, but an older brother, and I like his amusing character. the second star goes to Al. as a chubby friend, his character is likable. other than Randy and Al, this show is upset.
