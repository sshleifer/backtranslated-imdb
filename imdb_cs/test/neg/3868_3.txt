The seven collaborations of director Joseph "von" Sternberg and star Marlene Dietrich were so distinctive in appearance and tone that they differed from what was happening at the time, almost seeming to represent their own genre. Like every genre, they have their masterpieces as well as their absolute turkeys. Time to send Blonde Venus back to the farm. After dedicating the seductive hits of the Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, in which Miss Dietrich based her screen image as a cabaret-cum-prostitute, someone at Paramount decided it was time for Marlene she played mother. There is nothing wrong with that; as an actress she was up to that point. It's just that nothing else about the format has changed. It's like the Blue Angel and the Child. Fairly, the story of a woman who pulls her baby together on her slender escapades is a good prerequisite for a tragic drama, but that is not the case. Dietrich's journey is played as some kind of adventure, using her wits and accomplices to stay in front of the law. This is not some free example of pre-code libertarianism? it's simply bizarre disgust. Although Marlene can be accepted, she's a mother who's not too big, there's no way we can buy Sternberg as a director of heat and honesty. Despite being one of a handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit, Sternberg simply doesn't get a story arc. It is believed that the emotional payout of the film is a possible reunification of the family, but not even at the outset as something worth returning. As usual, Sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot to look like brothels or insane asylum. Faraday's home is actually quite a spooky, dirty environment and it's a wonder that little Johnny didn't wet the bed and asked to sleep with the light. But as everyone familiar with them will know, the purpose of Dietrich's / Sternberg's image is to make Dietrich look wonderful, and at least Blonde Venus is successful in this regard. Marlene is introduced out of the forest pool in a brilliant, glittering detail, and while she is limited to rags, the camera still loves her. The same cannot be said about the rest of the cast that Sternberg tended to perceive as a mobile scenery. The normally sympathetic Herbert Marshall is reduced to a moody grouch lurking in the shade. Even the courteous and lively Cary Grant becomes just a boring block in the background and doesn't seem to be interesting enough for Dietrich to run with him. The only exceptional moments in Blond Venus are Marlene's songs and dance routines. , especially the renowned Hot Voodoo, where he parodies his own Surrealist personality scene by emerging from a gorilla outfit. But even these feel as if they were cut out of another film. Sternberg's fans can welcome him as another masterpiece, as he used to do, but for the average diver, it's a huge disappointment. The listeners of that time did not catch it as her previous hits had, and it marked the beginning of the end of the heyday of Marlene. A year later there will be a new queen at Paramount? Mae West.
