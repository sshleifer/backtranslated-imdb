Super Troopers I found only slightly amusing at best (it seemed like a celebrated ripoff police academy) and I rented the movie in the hope of being better. It was not. Writing is absolutely awful and the pace of the movie is even worse. He does not feel that much is done in this film, or that it really gives us reason to take care of something from the characters. The actor who plays Felix is ​​completely uninspired. partly because of the dialogue he had to work with. In short, this film has gone wrong in many places. I feel that from films such as officials, independent filmmakers seem to think they can make films like this with long, embarrassed scenes of dialogue where characters try to be funny. But where the Clerks dialogue moves the story forward, it is hopelessly weighing in this film. It is assumed that films will have a decent balance between action and dialogue, and how tempting it is for filmmakers to try to have a lot of fun, funny dialogue, it just doesn't always work. Especially if they are not as good at writing dialogue. I hate to say it, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this movie - and the movie was so low budget that it was filmed on video.
