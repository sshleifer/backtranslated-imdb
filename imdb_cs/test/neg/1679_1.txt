I haven't had to look at the first record in this series yet, fortunately I was still able to watch a complicated and complicated plot, with all of its unexpected twists and turns, and applaud them for total originality of the terms here. If there is any confusion, let me not leave any doubt that everything I just said is covered with pure, carefully maintained sarcasm, a species that flourishes and grows exponentially when exposed to bullshit like this film. The clear sign that this is inconceivable is that it was driven by the visual effects creator, whose only other credit in this field is Henry Rooker's film, which was not well received. At best, the activity is average and I resist anyone who does not find ... a Scottish computer woman (come, seriously, what's with this surname?) Russian accent sad and / or irritating. There is an attempt or two at stylization in this, and they are rational. The action is not terrible. Camera and editing are fine. Music is pretty cool. The language is uncommon, even if it is. Violence is pretty bloody. I recommend it to fans of B-movies only, and I can say it may be worse. 1/10
