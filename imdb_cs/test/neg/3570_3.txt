I have to agree that the film is not the best I've ever seen, but I would like to mention that the actors depicting Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the real Dorsey brothers. The actors were amazing musicians. The film, based on their famous split, would be better had professional actors played parts. Many films made during this time frame took advantage of the popularity of large groups. Most often, movies were not so good because musicians are not traders. Most moviegoers did not go to Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey to play alone; they went to conspiracy and music. I've never been a very fan of Dorsey, but the music is good today. I have to comment on a previous post about actors who played Dorsey's mom and pop and that their accents will be considered extreme by the audience in Dublin. Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You may remember Mr. Shields as Reverend Playfair in The Quiet Man and Mrs. Allgood as Mrs. Monahan in Cheaper by the Dozen.
