I'm wrong about G.I.J.:T.M. mostly because I miss something that G.I. Joe had. Yes, he had something that G.I. Joe didn't have the celebrity portraits of Don Johnson, and Burgess Meredith, but I think G.I. Joe: The film lacked a passion for characters that G.I. Joe TV series had. Most of the voice over the artists sounded like it was a dead pelvis and they would die now. It's a good movie, but I wouldn't say it was the biggest movie in the world, I.M.H.O. :) <br /> <br /> Although violence is what G.I. Joe was built, I would say Serpentor, who shot Duke in his chest, was not the best way to get Charlie Adler out. He didn't even see Golobulus reminiscent of Cobra Commander, why he was chosen to lead the Cobra forces and then be terribly mutated after he failed to deliver what Cobra-La felt was their right. For the GI Joe series go out, but it's better than nothing. :)
