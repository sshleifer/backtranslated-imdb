I've never been disappointed with Kurosawa, but this is probably the first. "Doppelganger" is the worst I've seen from this director. What? The most scary movie from Kurosawa is definitely "Kairo". And if you think it's horrible, it's your surprise. It cannot be classified as a horror or thriller. This is a drama and it's bad enough. Many scenes that were supposed to be shocking turned out to be funny and plenty of conspiracy is really confusing. And because it's Kurosawa, stimulation is slow. But it's so slow that you lose interest in forty minutes and you want to do something different. What worried me the most was using CGI. CGI, if well used, can be really cool. But if he is executed with little care ... It may be a disaster. I think it describes one scene that has very minimal CGI usage. Koji Yakusho gives great performance along with the rest of the cast. But that's almost ... <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and go watch "Kairo" or "Ko-Rei" if you want to be scared. This is a bad, bad attempt at smart drama. What is smart, but ... Well, there's a lot missing. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for good conduct.
