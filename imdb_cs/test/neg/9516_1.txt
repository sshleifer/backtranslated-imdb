This movie was so frustrating to watch. Split screens do not allow you to engage in the actors' emotions. I kept going back and forth watching all the tiny pictures I found at the end with the wiplas. This is basically rip off "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode" I was very left down with this filmmaker trying to be cool. I wish I left as many other people.
