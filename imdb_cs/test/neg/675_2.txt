While watching this period and for several seasons, two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a "model" and two - run to the nearest ice cream shop and have a low fat cup. /> <br /> I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of ​​this reality show competition. No other "famous" model has thought of it, and it is very admirable that Tyra Banks is doing it. But as the series goes on and I conclude that it's a lot of people trying to make the mountain a hill. Women should not look at it; teenagers should stay away from it if they do book reports on the subject. Many women try on slots to compete for "Americas Next Top Model". They live together, cats fight together, shout together, let themselves go through nonsensical modeling shoots with senseless modeling and fashion people and avoid and almost all of them claim to see me again. Hell, I'm trying to figure out what happened to those who win the DID, actually. This is the dream of some girls and good for them. While watching this, I hope the other girls who see it and run like Hades in another way - like in college. I just happened to be watching more of this recent season because the "ploy" full figured models. That even made me think that it was a lot of people. "Fully figural models" were no more than average-sized ladies who compete with what I think is the thinnest group of models they have ever chosen - so of course it would seem to look even thicker - a "fashion" trick dresses all the time. Bad, bad, Tyra and crew. To be fair, "The Americas Next Top Model" is not about "fully built" models, it's about showing a showcase of beauty that can be marketed massively and sold as perfect beauty - and this the show is just looking for another fresh piece of meat to be added to the mixture. Hence the name of the exhibition. From here, many judges, photographers, associations are sorry. Tyra and her consistent "this is me" push every camera angle you can get. But again, this is the only thing I like about this show - ex-model gives others who wouldn't have a chance - a chance to enter the door. But after ... everything else is the status quo for this industry, which is why there are no surprises or week-week interest in the program.
