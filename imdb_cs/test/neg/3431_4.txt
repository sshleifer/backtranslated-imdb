This (very) low budget movie is fun if you're a John Krasinski fan, but otherwise is disappointing. At least it was short, so I didn't feel I had wasted too much time. John's scenes are pretty funny, but experimental "deep" scenes with Lacey Chabert are pretty naive. It starts to look like it might be a funny movie, but some characters are just so outrageous, while others are too serious to just fall. Don't get me at the end. It was totally unlikely and did not fit into the rest of the film. I'll say I was bored and that's why I rated it above three. John Krasins fans will enjoy it with a hood and stockings around their heads and eat Cheeza. And do not forget to look at John's deleted scenes, they are better than some that were included in the movie.
