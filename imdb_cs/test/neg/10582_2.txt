Superhero (2008) is the most recent in a long line over "parody" films that I despise. I wish this movie was the death of this genre, but I know it's not bad enough to put the last nail in the coffin. If we meet Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel for Hollywood movies, the movie Superhero is probably near the top. Unfortunately, Meet the Spartans was actually a mile below the barrel, and this film hardly does. Superhero The film has a decent cast of C-list celebrities. It's Drake Bell (Disney's Drake and Josh), Leslie Nielson (Airplane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock), and a few others scattered around the world. Although it has the power of a star to light a 40-watt bulb, the film fails to use some humor. This movie is about 80 minutes long, most of which is dedicated to watching Spiderman plot, and not one joke is funny. All the time I was not allowed to laugh or laugh. <br /> <br /> You can't see this movie. Don't even think about it. For love for the movie, just skip, and maybe they come out to get along with another. oh, who am I kidding? They'll probably come out with the next fall.
