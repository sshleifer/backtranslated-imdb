Well, I think I finally saw my last Woody Allen movie! I read a newspaper review and went to see this movie with the expectation of good Woody Allen (as I had many times in the past). Well, it wasn't. This film has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance of talented Sean Penn, this film has failed. One of the features of his other films is multiple characters - variety, humorous dialogue. Basically, this film consisted of only one character - very one-dimensional. He had almost no laughter. It probably looked good on paper! I think the only thing that was strange was Samantha Morton's performance. Now I'm going to look for her movies in the future. In conclusion, this film was a great disappointment. >
