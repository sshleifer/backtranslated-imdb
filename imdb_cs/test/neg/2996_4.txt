For most of this movie, I was pretty lost and I am the one who usually understands the works of such mysterious movie giants as David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Not to mention that Northfork doesn't make sense at some level, it just doesn't connect to create a completely coherent film. As time goes by watching the movie, its themes and intentions are clearer, but during my initial observation I was really confused and I find out that this is the main mistake of the movie ... its lack of direction. The plot focuses on the city of Northfork, Montana in 1955. The city was emptied and will soon be flooded to create a place to create a water dam. The main problem is that not all its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated. A group of men is hired to force the residents out of town before they drown, and to a large extent succeed in some rather special situations and burghers. At the same time, the film tells the story of Irwin, a very sick young boy (or is it a fallen angel?), Whose parents, who adopted him, returned him to the Northfork children's home for their illness because of their adoption. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) looks after a dying Irwin, but Irwin imagines (or he?!) That a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) came to a desolate and empty city and sought a fallen angel. Irwin has scars on his back and head and tries to convince angels that his scars are where people amputated his wings and halo. Yeah, and during all this, there's a strangely surreal animal on stilts roaming the landscape. There are many other small events in the film, but none of them end up much more than momentary intrigue. It is possible to appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it is clear that the filmmakers were deeply interested in this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film is still trying too hard to be different, and then surrendering and whining to the end without making a lot of statement. As I wrote earlier, it becomes clearer, long after the show, what might have happened in the movie. Irwin is dying, just like Northfork, and Irwin can cope with his own loss and death, most likely creating characters, from the thoughts he receives from objects that surround him in an orphanage to comfort him when he is abandoned and alive. coming to an end. But then, maybe he is really an angel, and he has found his kind and now he can go home. I must emphasize that there are really beautiful moments, heartbreaking, alive and full of loneliness and sadness in the film. Unfortunately, the film as a whole ends in a sense of disconnection and somehow incomplete.
