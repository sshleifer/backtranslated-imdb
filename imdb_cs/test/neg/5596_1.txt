Sure, this film, which takes place in Eastern Europe, is filled with sexy, but it has nothing to do with the rapid movement of Nicholas Cage's "8mm". Ambassador's daughter and her fianc√© mix her with a local woman in a trio who ends up recording. Tape is used for blackmail and bets are higher and higher when a couple tries to work alone instead of going to the authorities. Sex comes and goes - and would be the only reason to hire, I think if you like this sorta thing - and it's pretty gratuitous towards the middle when we sail the porn scene we're looking for "another woman" . I'm sure I wonder how he got into the Blockbuster and with the Restricted Youth label, which is considering just a hint over the edge of the soft core. (Oh, that's true, it's a double standard. Real flashy like "The Dreamers" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" get a neutered version of R, but Straight To DVD crap like this, UNRATED banner proudly attaches. Acting is terrible, the conspiracy is mind insensitive, but the worst offense is the idea that it is a continuation of 8mm, I'd give film D for grade and would be nice, but since they were trying to deceive me , gets the F he deserves.
