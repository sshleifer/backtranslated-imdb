An annoying group of former students from Monte Alto International High School decides to spend the night in a newly abandoned institution where the "secret" killer is called a watchman playing with the legend of horror Paul Naschy. "Features some references to such teenage slasher pins as" shout "or" Friday the 13th ". Climate twist ends looks like lilted from "sixth sense". The uncertainty as to whether the killer watcher is alive or dead provide some slight interest, but the characters are one-dimensional and endless scenes of walking through dark school halls really got on the nerves. The presence of charismatic Paul Naschy almost rescues this clich√© of slasher flick. There is also some decent gore on display, including wonderfully bloody beheading. It's nice to see Manuel Velasco of "Rec" fame in a small role.
