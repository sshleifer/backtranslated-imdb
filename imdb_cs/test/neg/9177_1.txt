The only reason I bought this DVD is because cynthia rothrock is in it.now everyone knows he's the queen of martial arts b movies. The problem is that it's not a movie martial arts movie.cynthia rothrock has about a minute or so of a fighting scene in this silly movie. ? All he does in this movie is a walk around, getting bored as much as I was when I watched this pile of crap. I own many of her movies and they're all b movies, but at least they had some cool fighting scenes in them. are martial arts fans shun it no matter what.i'm getting mad i wasted $ 4 on buying this dvd
