The reason I gave this movie 4 was for several reasons, but this movie wasn't that bad. First, editing I found to be too poor sometimes, the script (or what they had one) wasn't very good, and if not for Nunzio La Bianca, acting would be crap. but all this aside (ha ha know it's like the whole movie) its not so bad for extremely low ind. , low budget movie. If they got more money, a little better actors (but these were intimidating, so it was good) and a little more detailed scenario of this movie would be amazing. Someone has to tell me that this guy was influenced by a lot of warlords from Walter Hill. I think this movie is exactly that. Anyone who has seen both of these films agrees with me.
