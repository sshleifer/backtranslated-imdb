I find it disturbing that in an era when a satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across a range of possible beliefs that the charlatan and the Gurdjieff caliber scam (like a charlatan, is exceptional; it's a pity that he used it, though to enlarge his injured ego, feeding from the worship of careless sheep who were at his devil and calling and in awe of him) can inspire such extreme adherence and credibility. This film presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff's own, largely fictional and fantastic news of his formation and "awakening" (which I would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could overcome the mind and will of certain types of sadly disoriented people). You see it if you dare to have an uncomfortable look at how sadly we are deprived of true religious leaders, to the point that such a clown like Gurdjieff could inspire such devotion - and be careful not to have blood pressure at your fingertips if you are they are one of those still hoping that a healthy religion will emerge from the ruins of Christianity, as the highest example of cinematography throughout the campus and prejudices about a dysfunctional cult.
