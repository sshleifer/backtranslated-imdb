I don't want to seem too tenuous, but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveler would cause such a huge change in the timeline, how could it be because a butterfly was burned by a pyroclastic explosion. volcanoes exploding anyway? And how could passengers in time return to the same moments and not settle for a meeting with their former and later ones, who were also on the timeline for those few minutes? It seems there was a pretty big crowd standing in front of being dinosaur charging. While I can accept the idea of ​​a time wave, I seriously doubt that the wave would make only a few changes. As the wave went through, all the changes that would happen would suddenly happen during the passage of this wave. So scratch the idea that the city is becoming overgrown with jungle. And why the jungle? The location of the city would still be on latitude and longitude in which it was before and should have vegetation suitable for its geographical location on Earth. And an endless list of other illogical inanities. > <br /> Bwahahaha! This movie is a strange combination of some fairly decent production values ​​and totally ridiculous story holes and factual mistakes. Too bad. An amazing story that was filled with stupid science. Sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all that money on production and not even bother to prove the script to see if it made any real sense?
