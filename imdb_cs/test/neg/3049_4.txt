I'm starting to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just celebrated image tests for young and emerging talents. Get a first-class screenwriter, an inexperienced director, a few TV actors looking for a break on the big screen and see what they can do. "When a stranger is calling" is a little better than most of these recent offers, but is still completely-the-book; embroidered with conspiracy holes and genre clich√©s. The story is incredibly simplistic. The slim 87-minute run is heavily padded with insignificant friends and unnecessary cheating friends. The killer has neither the symbolic motivation of Jason or Michael, nor the killer of the original film, and as a result is never scary. The police behave so incredibly inefficiently and lazily that they resist professional behavior. Simon West brings the same driving appeal he has led to Lara Croft, but his style of direction is definitely general, has no indicators of real talent or vision. Performances are routine, dark corridors replace true horror, and terrors are tired Cat-in-The-Closet varieties. However, film and production design is above average for this kind of film. film. The house is beautifully designed, all dark wood and glassy reflections, and there are a few moments that are of visual interest. Although missing an ounce of dramatic originality, it acts as a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller, and keeps interest longer than most of its ilk.
