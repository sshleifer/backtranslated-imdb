This must be the worst show I've ever seen. I always liked Chuck Norris in movies, but why do we have to make these shows politically correct by adding a black hip that is as terrible as Shirley Temple at Little Miss Marker. I also thought the show was limited because many times you can kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. I know an African American who looks like this Trivette guy and he gets his ass kicked about once a week is all attitude. Chuck Norris is a man and he deserves all the kudos he gets, I think this show started great, but she lost the pair as time went by <br /> <br /> They should have a sack kick
