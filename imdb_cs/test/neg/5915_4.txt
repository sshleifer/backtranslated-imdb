Eddie Murphy, produced at the time of his career where he was to do whatever he wanted, took on the role of production, directing, writing and playing in HARLEM NIGHTS, an expensive but empty gangster saga for a group of black nightclubs / ritzy clubs during the 1930s , headed by a wisecracking hot shot (Eddie Murphy) and his adoptive father (Richard Pryor) and their attempts to avoid overpopulation by white gangsters who think they are taking the lawn seem to think they are just theirs, simply because of their color. That was an idea that probably looked great on paper, but it certainly lost something in translation. It was a futile piece for Eddie, and I think he's a little bit of a piece here trying to be the whole show here. It is true that it was a pleasure to see Murphy and Pryor together on the screen, but the rest of the big support lineup, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Foxx, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Danny Aiell, Jasmine Guy, Thomas Mike Mike, Stan Shaw and Eddie's brother is really given a rare little to do (though I admit Murphy's battle scene with Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably, the movie is the best scene). Murphy has poured a lot of money into the movie and much of it is showing up on the screen. Artistic and scenographic trends are impressive and breathtaking costumes were to win an Oscar, but this was a big mistake for Eddie when he definitely tried to wear too many hats.
