Sad in every aspect, this bad excuse for career growth for Connery was neither that nor the hit of the Warners wanted it to be. This movie and "Robocop 2" are 20 minutes more than twenty minutes and are filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, proof that Irvin Kershner had no real control over "The Empire Strikes Back". Connery wasn't hit because he bowed out of Bond in 1971, but it didn't bring him back. "Octopussy" was released several months before this film, and easily outgrown. Imagine - Roger Moore Bond not only better than simultaneous release of Connery, but also overcoming it (and compared to "Never ...", "Octopussy" is on the same level as "2001") <br /> <br / > The Worst Bond Theme Songs, Worse Than "The Man with the Golden Gun", the nonsensical scenes that drag on unnecessarily (with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - WHO ARE?!), and the most murderous collection of non-talent When it comes to the legendary "Bond Girls" go. Does anyone seriously think Kim Basinger is attractive in this movie? There were girls in my high school who could never have data that looked better than she did in this. And Barbara Carrera - Just stupid - but the way Kershner has directed her all the time has not helped her, it's a seedling that would become a very impressive "Onatop" that was the best of "GoldenEye". "But that doesn't mean you work with this movie. <br /> <br /> Casting Leit er as a black agent was a great idea, but a friend-loke interaction with Connery and he is supposed to be is terribly bad. they have never discovered such clumsy - witnesses to a scene where, in order to escape the local authorities, they strip off to their boxers and pretend to be outside - I can't imagine another scene in a movie that would try so sadly to laugh.
