To football fans everywhere - stay away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Lame playing, lame script, lame football and no overhead! I rented this movie during my stint in Asia and I was horrified that it was considered one of Singapore's best films. It was just nonsensical and thoroughly boring. There are thousands of rich, exciting stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about the peak and stereotypical Singaporean?
