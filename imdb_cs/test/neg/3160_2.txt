Spheeris used this document to displace the punks stereotype. This document is biased and guided, not objective. Cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview can be used to make the respondent's spoken word out of context. When you watch a movie, the idea that comes from punks is that they're pretty stupid. Band members and other punk seem to have low intelligence and are unable to explain their motives or provide detailed or coherent answers or even answers at all. I very much doubt that if some of the interviewed people knew what Spheeris had created or seen that the end product could be part of the project. This film gives the punks in the wrong light by appearing unintelligent and plain. Spheeris' film should not be considered a representation of the punk scene of L.A. If you want to see a good punk documentary "Another State of Mind" featuring a youth brigade and social bias.
