I can overcome political parody; Even if it was SUPPOSE to be "Masters of Horror" flick. But what I can't overcome is the obvious use of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washed out horror filmmaker statement. For me it was a purely offensive desecration of Arlington and our heroes. I have a family in Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) would even portray Arlington's graves that are being disturbed just makes me want to vomit. I did with Dante and did with MOH.
