This film is missing in everything. Aside from Bobby Dole, who is average in his own standards, no one in this film has come close to acting in one scene. Kangana is totally false in her acting spirit. The music doesn't compliment the movie <br /> <br /> that well. The contrast in music between Bobby and Upen is not so well emphasized. The great concept was completely wrong. The film doesn't have the right end. Please don't waste your time as I did on this movie
