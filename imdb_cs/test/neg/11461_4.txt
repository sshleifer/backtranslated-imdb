This sequel above - and the final record in "Kharis" - is a bit more enjoyable on the scene, but it's also more resourceful (hell, we even get bartender / hostess!): Peter Coe is the least charismatic of various Egyptian high priests which we have seen during these films, and Martin Kosleck as his follower is not interested in the proceedings; Kurt Katch is therefore saddled with a ridiculous accent because the man who discovers the newly reincarnated Princess Ananka: the second, in the form of Virginia Christine (later used by a great actress), gets her most important "role" and, in fact, the sequence of her resurrection from the swamp is the highlight of this the movie but the whole series. Unfortunately, even here, Chaney has little to do, because once again the emphasis is on Anan, as I said. his mummy (most often returned from Universal - apart, of course, from his signature role of Wolf Man!) remains undoubtedly his smallest studio monster.
