Terrible Star Wars will go out with a somewhat comic touch. Robert Urich is the leader of a group of ice pirates who are stealing ice because water is now the most valuable substance in the universe (as all poor people are alive is a mystery). He joins Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, around 25 and a total cutie), the princess looking for her missing father. Also in cast are embarrassed looking Anjelica Huston in some hilarious science fiction get-ups and pudgy, short-ish Ron Perlman (whom I thought was seven feet tall from his other roles!). And John Carradine, who looks days since death and Hollywood Squares funnyman (relative term) Bruce Vilanch. If you ever wanted to see Bruce Vilanch, that's your movie. But then again, though it is not worth seeing because it is not closing at all (I think it would be a robot, but I nodded several times).
