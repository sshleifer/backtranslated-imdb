If you are a fan of either of the two original franchises (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked or disliked the AVP flick in 06), you will hate this movie. The countless plots of holes, flakey, and incredible human characters, terrible special effects, and even worse overhead and battle scenes make this one of the worse movies I've ever seen. *** SPOLIER *** HUNDRED A Huge Conspiracy Hole Included Before / Alien Hybrid Riding From Chest Burster, On A Full-Adult Bad-Ass In Seconds (It Starts On The Board Of Predator-Killing Spree And Smooths ship ahead before ship even breaks Earth orbit.) AS IF. In the first AvP we saw the Sr. ship. Three juvenile hunters go to the hunters to go hunting their "lanes" and then finally see them pick up the "honest body" of the juvenile who was deprived. at the end of the movie. It is expected that we believe that single chest hybrids have killed all these hunters Sr. Also, (and it was an extremely inexpensive production value on the director's / producer's parts) glasses and glasses and glasses of face detours somehow miraculously appeared on board the ship, though the entire temple complex and Queen Alien were destroyed in the AvP movie. These facial male partners eventually play in the movie ... of course. And how do all these terrible faces become full-fledged foreigners in a few days? But that's a joke. Though there were many other holes in the hole, I don't think IMDb would appreciate having filled their servers by typing them here. For flakey and incredible characters, well, where should I go boys and girls? Where to start ... almost all these balls are clich√©s from other movies or TV shows. The city of bad-boy who left to avoid jail time, but only appears on the day when everything happens to save the day ??? Where did I see it? Yeah, last season at JERICHO !!! Then there is a 20-city sheriff (former problem creator) who was the best friend at the time. Where did we see it? Yeah, JERICHO and Walking Tall! Then there is a generic soldier (WITH NO RANK) who comes home from some generic war front who doesn't meet as a long past lover and hero at the airport or bus station, but at her front door OWN at her daughter and husband. And who is the soldier? What did she do in the Army / Air Force / Marines / Navy / Coast Guard? We don't know because the movie NEVER USES US. But ... dunh, dunh, dunh ... was some soldier / plane / sailor / sailor / coast who knows how to drive a Stryker Infantry and ... magically ... HELICOPTER !!! This character is just a general copy of every service worker who comes home, except that he brings a set of night vision to his daughter, which is worth several dollars. These are the things the soldiers have to sign and not "bring home". UGH! Special effects and combat scenes are what pi-sed the worst. These are the things I enjoyed most in the first movie ... watching the ancestors and the aliens! As it was filmed, the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close that you couldn't tell what was going on. You couldn't see who was doing what was going on when they were fighting. All in all, these hundreds of things kill this franchise and fanchise. No one will worry about seeing their favorite sci-fi monsters, and can only guess that the show will be dropping from here, because manufacturers won't like to continue in the millions of dollars.
