ALERT: This review contains the main SPOILERS. If you don't read this movie, you don't read it. Judging by the number of votes I received (my voice was fifth), very few people know who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, in the late 1980s, a professional match was pretty decent. The Federation of All Women, the Women's Professional Wrestling Association, opened. It was a great league and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the list. I always thought it was one of the best people LPWA had in terms of ring skills and acting skills. Unfortunately, LPWA closed in the early 1990s, so it seemed natural that someone with as many talents as Mimi would kick off an acting career, right? But was there an alternative to such things? This movie is really bad. As it went on, I compared it to the underrated Survivor Quest, only this film lacks all that makes "Survivor Quest" fun. <br /> <br /> When I started recording, I went to the fast forward in the preview to get the meat tape. At first I didn't pay much attention, but then I realized that the preview was on a movie with Mimi Lesseos. "Oh," I thought, "here's another movie with Mimi." But as the preview dragged, I realized that it was a preview of "Beyond Fear!" You know you have problems when the only preview at the beginning is the movie you're about to watch! The story is pretty standard. Lesseos plays an ex-kickboxer who lives with an opponent / friend's injury, so he focuses on his second career he shares with his friend Sammy: he is a wilderness guide. On this occasion, he gets a group of three pairs. Two couples are just there to take up space. Do you think a couple, a Caucasian husband and a Korean wife, will be explored because there is a problem between them in the middle of the film, but is ignored in favor of repeated bear jokes in the woods that consistently frighten a Korean woman. . The joke is funny when you hear it for the first time, but it's definitely not the ninth time. The third couple is just painful to watch: it consists of Mr. and Mrs. They trade insults back and forth and Mr. Page uses his camcorder for the art of voyeurism when he is not busy playing cruel jokes on his cheerful wife - just like your typical American couple! Before the visit Mr. Page spies on two stupid boys and their prostitute. One of them accidentally kills a prostitute and finds out that Mr. Page has recorded it. Thus begins the danger of two boys watching the group on their way and wait and wait and wait and finally wait for them to do something. When they do, it's a fiasco. <br /> <br /> You can't blame guilt. With the material they are supposed to work with, they try as hard as they can. The main culprit is director Robert F. Lyons, who has to return to playing bits and avoiding the director's chair. Lyons starts and stops the scenes in such a sloppy, sudden affair that you start to think he is suffering from dyspepsia throughout the shoot. There is one more incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene slips between some night scenes with thugs. Then there's the sound department. Background music and noise completely override the dialogue, so you have to move your ear next to your TV speaker. Don't hit your head on the screen! It's not worth hearing bad lines. Speaking of bad writing, Lesseos gets part of the credit there as a co-writer. Several interesting developments among characters are often abandoned for shots of criminals or bad practical jokes. In the beginning, Lesseos sets off the criminal with a toggle switch, so you don't think they're in danger from the two stupid criminals. When scammers finally get to their backs, when Lesseos is thrown in a well-executed and long fight, all of our teammates have a huge laugh, despite the fact that one of them was shot and bleeding everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy at the end. All but poor souls witnessing a film wishing good old days when Mimi played in the ring. Zantara score: 4 out of 10
