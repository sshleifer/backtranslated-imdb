Yeah, what did I expect? I thought it would be a movie about young adults in their life turn, something like "Sonnenallee" or "American Pie", which I really liked. I wanted to see a funny movie, maybe with an ironic look at the idyllic Würzburg. And what did I get? <br /> <br /> Beware of spoilers ahead! This film begins with a long dialogue that gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more lengthy dialogues. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and tried to hide that fact by improvising and repeating what he said. But as I think of Bleibtre as one of the better German actors, I believe that this effect was really intended. I think the author wanted to show how boring talking with close friends can be - especially when they're stoned. But really, I don't need a cinema to be bored with stoned friends. Boring dialogues make up most of this film. But all right, that's one thing. I can cope with it, I saw nice movies with nasty dialogues, just thinking of Schwarzenegger's life work. But the other thing is that the characters are cheap and flat and that the plot is as predictable as anything. Just one example (SPOILER !!): Why do you think someone takes a garden hose into a cannabis deep in the forest? Water them? Of course not, you won't usually find hookah deep in the woods, do you? The only reason this tubing is water is that the hunter who came while the two protagonists reap drugs can be dazed, spoiled, and finally filled with three bottles of Jaegermeister. I really hated this scene because it's really violent. Usually I do not mind violence in movies - slapsticky comedy is full. But in such a comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people do not get hurt when they fall on their faces or are defeated by chairs or things like that. But if it happens in a film that is otherwise realistic, the slapstick scenes also appear real. In this particular "Lammbock" scene, I really thought that this hunter had to be badly injured if he wasn't dead - the final scene actually gave me the impression that there was no way to die, completely filled with another booze that anyone could handle. And the protagonists just leave. It would be different if the author followed one style consistently; the scene could be pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Talking about being consistently - that's what I've missed the most about this movie. The whole movie seems to enumerate the small episodes that came to the author's mind. Things happen for no apparent reason - yeah, I know, that's life, but it's not a cinema because the cinema has to tell a story, not show boring episodes without any meaning. I found myself asking, "Where's the point?" throughout. Apart from the two main characters, you never know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with her best friend, Kai, actually tells you, but I couldn't buy it, not at all. I think she was there to give Kai the opportunity to deal with this childhood AIDS test sketch, which you have seen thousands of times before and mostly better. The protagonist's girlfriend you meet once is leaving Germany (what you don't see, and the man doesn't seem to care), and in one sentence she says she met someone else in America and split up with the protagonist. It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie a couple of free ends. In fact, he never did, you never know what's so bad about the study right that he is a father's son (dad finally remedies everything and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which in my opinion has made me one of the most beautiful characters in the movie) and Würzburg. Even dinner with a father's friend's friend who might have been determined to show how horrible it was to live a father's expectation, it seemed to be an apartment, just another nice dinner with family friends (except for the trip, which the guy is later on, but I think to show that consuming the drug before eating with your parents is not healthy, not the reason for this scene if it was any. I've had a much worse dinner in my life than this and I've finished my exams. I couldn't understand one character in the whole movie, it just seemed flat and unlikely. <br /> <br /> It made him a not so good movie, but not one I wouldn't look at. TV. It was really a few good scenes (most of them were not new, though, like the one with nice and sensible policemen), some were really funny, some of the interviews were nice and I like Bleibtreu's play, although he repeated his familiar stereotypes again. Not good, not disgusting, that's what I thought was half over after the movie. But then this incest scene came and I really found it repulsive. Incest just isn't funny. I don't even know if it was supposed to be funny, some people in the audience laughed, so it could be thought like that. This scene has ruined my whole movie, I could no longer feel compassionate - I can't feel compassion for anyone who is a helpless person for me, it's rape and rape isn't funny. It might have been a hint of drama, but incest never mentioned again (though we thought it might have been one of the reasons why the protagonist eventually left Germany, but as he never mentioned it, we wouldn't). I know.) It's even totally useless. I almost expected that the nurse would eventually get pregnant, which would just add the last touch of this taste, but even this final cliché is not fulfilled, just as nothing is really solved or thought about in this film. It's not really funny, it's not really a drama, it's not a road movie la Tarantino despite desperate attempts at violence, it's definitely not pleasant. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. Watch "Final Fantasy" is also bad, but at least with beautiful pictures and not so tasteless.
