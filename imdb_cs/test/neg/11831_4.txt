It is a semi-fictional memoir of "international man" who has witnessed various political unrest in the last 30 years. I was hoping this film would offer a unique insight into politics and war. I also hoped it would affect and influence. However, I failed this film. "Chico" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, Ricardo, staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As expected, no detailed story could be drawn in such a timeframe. The justification for moving to another place was often explained. The result was an unsatisfactory collection of shattered clips shot in different countries.
