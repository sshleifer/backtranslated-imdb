I had a bad feeling when I saw cheap work. It only took a few scenes to confirm that this movie is a real smelly movie! The only pleasure I got from this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the sound of "car sounds" disappears during the scene with Danny and the dog in the dog car). The production shows a complete lack of imagination (example - repeated repetitive movement of the machine gun). Sandra Bullock plays a bit of a role, completely useless for conspiracy. To say that this movie actually made the plot does more justice for writing than it deserves. Antique computer hardware is a little interesting. This movie was released in 1982 (not 1987 as the IMDb database shows) and then the current "high-tech" was an amber screen on a 4.8 MHz IBM PC with floppy drives. Maybe the PC was the real star of the movie ... at least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> We got it on a DVD for a few dollars at WalMart's store. As other reviewers have noticed, we have paid too much!
