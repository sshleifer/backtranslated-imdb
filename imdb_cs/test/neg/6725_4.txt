Bad behavior? Yes, but it wasn't a surprise. Stupid story? Yes, so what? But why, tell me, Headmaster, why all the slow moves? Combat scenes were bad, really bad, due to slow motion and poor cutting. Not for Seagal. <br /> <br /> "What if I accelerate it for 2 seconds and then slow down the other 5 seconds and then ... Maybe I have to turn the coin to make a decision?" What did you think, Mr. Director ???
