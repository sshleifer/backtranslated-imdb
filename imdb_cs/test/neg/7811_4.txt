It was stupid. Something like Adam Sandler's movie. There were several funny parts, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> I like some of the actors in it though. There were some So. Night People live in the movie. But I wouldn't recommend it if there's nothing better. And that was even better than any Jennifer Lopez movie.
