This film is incredibly poor. It was on TV when I tuned into the action scene and laughed at the cheesy macho dialogue and waited for Leslie Nielsen to appear. It took me a few minutes to realize it wasn't actually a comedy, it was meant to be taken seriously. It should be remembered that someone actually sat down and wrote this film, and worse - other people funded it and gave it a green light. Apparently Rutger Hauer did not read movie scripts before signing, either, or having some serious bad debts to pay. Oddly enough, this film is so poor that you find yourself staring at it, wondering how it actually got funded, and how television channel has to pay money for the rights to broadcast it. The dialogue between a hero and a criminal while trying to shoot from the sky is particularly painful, with a dialogue that sounded like it was created in Texas Intruments "Speak & Spell". <br /> <br /> The Hollywood money machine is the worst. Funny.
