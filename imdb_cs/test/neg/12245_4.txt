Spoof movies have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers' (1968) said, "Don't be stupid, be smart. Come and join the Nazi Party". This brought us wonderful films, such as "Young Frankenstein", "Airplane!" And even "Naked Gun". But they die young. Fortunately, the genre was managed until the late 1990s. And then ... Wayan's brothers launched an apocalypse: 'Scary Movie'. Suddenly, the word spoof was an allusion to gross sexual jokes. Most movies claim to be spoofs since then followed suit, including 'Scary Movie 2', 'Movie Data' and the film to kill the genre 'Epic Film'. Sure, there were some reliefs. There were 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. It will be Ferell becoming a spoofing vehicle near every sport imaginable. Also, Wayans Brothers left 'Scary Films' and they were made by reliable Zucker Brothers. While these films have some value in saving, the genre is tragically condemned to films that love pre-pubescent men who have just discovered what an erection is. People who do not explore the term 'spoof' and cut and paste movies together for a quick laugh. No heart, no brain, just cheap glue. Unfortunately, 'Comebacks' has been added to the list. Dave Koechner (who played in 'Anchorman' along with Ferrell) leads the underdogs teams to win against the coach (Carl Weathers fame 'Happy Gilmore') who got him back to coaching. Koechner turned out to be a promising actor, but as a lead in this film he just wrote the sounds. It sounds too much as if he read him passionately coldly. Also, jokes about being washed by a coach who encourages the team to fail at school during the film and later run from the police in their underwear were made earlier. Yes, this is a spoof movie. But let's not forget that even spoofs can be of good quality. Give the characters a dignity and a sophisticated view of modern society. Also, relying on stereotypes will not relieve us of any more laughter (who knew that one movie with people talking about living could lead to gangster stereotypes (not really, but you see)). Even if I admit to laughing at least a few times ... it wasn't par. The football team had a lot of stereotypes in it, including a Mexican, goofy sportsman, fat guy, skinny nerd and mentally handicapped. Even a single woman in the team has fallen to a stereotypical female humor, who was mostly embarrassed and hinted at. In fact, her character, like most others, has never been developed. It's a sad state for this movie. If it weren't so dependent on stupid sex jokes, it could do something for itself. In fact, this movie is likely to be the butt of jokes next to 'Epic Movie' for the time to come. Koechner deserved better. The screenplay generally was poorly conceived, even naming the championship 'toilet bowl'. So yes. spoof movies are dying. There is a movie called 'Meet the Spartans' (Be A Trend, Boycott Now!) Coming to include a spoof on Britney Spears' breakdown. So let the kids keep an erection ... but people grow up and lose them. We need nutrition. One day they learn to stop spoofing spoofs and restore them. Hopefully one of the heroes will be 'Get Smart' made by Master Mel Brooks, which will be released next year. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 of 5 (stars)
