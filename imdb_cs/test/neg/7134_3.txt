I liked the first The Grudge. It really crept up and it had something that made me see it twice. That something in this sequel is missing. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really wouldn't stick to your mind. People die because a ghostly ghost comes from the shadows and says boo. And most of the time it wasn't so scary. Plot-wise This movie is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but she had nothing to do, and Karen's death seemed unsatisfactory because she came so fast. I was also disappointed with Kayak's mother's subplot. I was thinking that she could somehow fight Grudge, but would die in her hands - hair? - Kayako. That was such a stupid twist. All in all, it's hard to feel for the characters you know from the minute she dies. In the same manner. And they can't do anything. He doesn't feel like they have a cruel fate. It's just boring because you know what happens. If they had anything to do with it, it would have another tension, even if they had failed. If there was any hope, it would be a more frightening justification. Now you're just waiting for them to die. Kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we saw her too many times, and some of them were taken away. I was still afraid of some scenes, but I got used to a huge eye and a blue face. Of course, the creators realized that this would happen when they added more spooky ghosts. Yes, I was scared at the scene of a school psychologist - even though I knew where it was, once she said, "I was in the house." Pleasant touch. But Toshio wasn't scary at all in this movie. I was much more carved by a non-blue Toshio with black eyes and a blank look that sometimes appeared in the first movie. The blue boy who was sitting in the corner wouldn't do anything for me. Some characters seemed really unnecessary - a famous milky scene with a girl whose name I don't even remember. I wasn't afraid, it was just "Huh?" I'm not sure if the schoolgirls were really needed. Karen could bring us resentment to the US. It could have killed people related to her life, everyone at a funeral, or something like that. Still, it would be dull to watch everyone die, but to be introduced to so many unrelated people who really felt uncomfortable. She hated the "I'm not going to call you mother" scene. Mother Aubrey's problems were just as boring. The little boy was touching character, though. Ju-On's sequel was much more frightening than this one. It had several new twists - dreams and reality were more blurred, for example - and even though it left me, I was satisfied. I have to think a little and be amazed. This film provided only cheap fears.
