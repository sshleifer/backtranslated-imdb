All right, I agree with all the Barney haters on this site. I think Barney and his friends are all ugly and unpleasant and the show is very bilateral and unrealistic. But the thing that dragged me the most is how Barney presented Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals on his show when talking about parents and relatives of the same sex. This would not be such a big deal if the creators of this exhibition did not use so much derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals. I think not all homosexuals wear mascara and love the colors of purple and pink, and not all lesbians are ugly and masculine looking at the chest clutching with the belly. As a bisexual woman, I think it's terrible for a children's show. If it were South Park, I wouldn't mind because South Park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. Many people who follow Barney are small children or handicapped people who usually can't distinguish fantasy from reality. And now that I think about it, Barney gets a little out of the ugly homosexual stereotype. Look, he doesn't have a girlfriend, he's a pinkish color and wears sequined clothes (yes, it's true). If you claim that these are rights of homosexual and bisexual individuals, stop mocking them from people who know nothing better. If Barney went black and ate fried chicken and melon at the same time, the show would have been withdrawn from the air before you knew it. I give this show a negative one in five. Don't show your kids such a hateful crap. There are children showing that they are so less offensive.
