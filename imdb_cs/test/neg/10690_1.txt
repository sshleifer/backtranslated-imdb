My friends and I watched this movie last night. It was unbelievable. it was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. at first it was tolerable. This is the BAD IMPROV stink, but it was quite friggin hilarious, although the scenes are too long & pulled and terrible quality (I read $ 400 budget over ... sounds about the truth) on the film itself. the biggest problem was the lack of script; With a background in improvisation, I know how difficult it can be to keep the scenes short and efficient. What happened in this movie was that the actors were left to improvise the scenes and did not know when to stop, they simply continued for ages on silly topics. at first I thought it was because the movie was short and needed long, useless scenes to make it soft. as the film progressed, I realized that it was just a really bad movie. there were lots of parts where I saw that the filmmaker has a really good idea to shoot, but not on the resources (or talent!? lots of scenes were taken from a single frame (cause, you know, improvise) for what seemed to be really long, so boring! If you can stand up and throw in an hour of terrible improvisation, watch it. It's really funny on the part, but also really stupid and uncomfortable. horrible, the only good part seemed to be parts that had nothing to do with the main plot, a boy who swore, a barber shop, etc. <br /> <br /> but badly pained. Or so, my friends and I were bored and left.
