Ok, I'm normally quite open to thinking movies. Normally I can see a good side of a movie that has been completely stripped of others. This is an exception. I'm not going to waste energy, I'm telling you what's going to happen, but I think that, like Bill and Ted, he meets the worst film of the Police Academy of all, and you won. t be far away. The thing that really got me on this movie was a stupid purist racism that was evident throughout the film. General topic latino / black guys = cool, white guys = lame is slightly fun for the first couple of jokes, but when the same joke was repeated for 500. time (not exageration by the way) it gets both tedious and offensive <br /> <br /> I spent months and waited for Karma's laws to return to John Leguizam. I almost gave up hope when the "My VH1 Awards" were screened in the UK. He was followed by Mr. Leguizamo, who performed a rare comedian performance on stage. You must be a complete sadist who laughs at him. Um. Ha! Ha! Ha!
