This "schlock-buster" should carry government health warnings. If you play it on your DVD machine, there is a serious risk of opening a crack in space-time and disappearing without a trace into it - so bad is this movie. The fact that this film was so successful that it demonstrates the desperate state of modern Hollywood film and the continual release of films that appeal to the "least common denominator" - even though I am really worried about the "lowest common denominator" that this movie actually appeals to !! I think Hollywood has just been doing some sort of rehearsal rehearsals when they did and screened this movie! I can imagine that a meeting of executive boardrooms in the studio ... "How bad film we can actually get away with what we do - and DOWNLOAD a lot of money!" Holy cow, I didn't realize we could go wrong! Woooo hooooo !! "<br /> <br /> The only films that are worse than I can think of (and believe me to be close) are Die Another Day (RIP Bond franchise, as I knew) and Independence Den! <br /> <br /> AVOID - AVOID - DO NOT OVER !!!!
