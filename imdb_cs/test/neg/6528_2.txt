.... and now I'm on episode # 7. I was really hoping it would end (not to mention the cancellation, once everything related to the show - including the actors - was unloaded somewhere with some toxic waste in the ocean, it will never be ) because this series is really awful. <br /> <br /> To be listed under the 'comedy' genre, this program is at best misleading! It is so hard to believe that Ben Elton could write something so bad, maybe it points to a lot of contributions from other writers in everything he was previously linked to. In some episodes I wasn't even allowed to be once again! Oh, and I can't believe that Ardal O'Hanlon stopped doing 'My Hero' and started doing it instead, his decision-making abilities were obviously concerned that day - perhaps he just can't read and didn't realize how bad the blessing scenarios are. Don't get me wrong, 'My Hero' is not a masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk. Well, when there are so many great TV series that are not released!
