Yes, absolutely terrible, And this comes from someone who loves bad movies - but there's a limit. I enjoy all kinds of horror / thrilling films and have seen the amazing work of European filmmakers. Unfortunately, Broceliande is not one of those amazing pieces of filmmaking. Working with the camera is worse than amateur. It's not fashionable, shaky MTV's "cameraman needs Ritalin" type of camera work, so many filmmakers use it to mask their lack of talent. This is simply a bad composition of the frame and a terrible composition of the image. Acting is farcical when it is not entirely two-dimensional. Dialogues are stilted and unnatural - even more than your usual run-of-the-mill horror / tense movie delves into pseudo-mysticism. I think that what dissuaded me the most was terribly choreographic battle scenes at the end of the film. They were bad when they were ridiculous. I've seen what a small budget can do, and it can do wonders. That was just a bad movie. Very, very sad.
