I rented this type of "soft core" before, but I can honestly say I didn't expect it to be in the same type as "Rod Steele: You Only Live Uil to You Die" - which was both sexy and funny. She had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. She also has Gabriella Hall, who is hot. The reason I didn't expect this movie was that the label "Must be 18 years old for rent" was missing in the box. I was looking for another "cheese" and less "cheesecake". First, I think movies should not be allowed to start with "actors" rehearsing for part of a talent agency (or wherever they try "actors"). In this movie, seeing "actors" rehearses about the lack of training that went into playing with the real characters in the movie. Well, when we found out that this movie was a soft core, I didn't. t necessarily turn off and demand my money back. But the dizzying way in which the extended "erotic" video adds to what was probably late night pay cable is very annoying and easy to move forward without enduring quality, say Rod Steele. You know they had to have some money because I think some of them are being shot overseas. I'm going to have to say that the main actor who's trying to NOT overheat an invisible potion is one of the most equally impressive work I've ever seen. And I saw Torgo of Manos! It may actually cost a dollar rent fee (this and Gabriella Hall). However, there are better corny movies for rent with your friends.
