I agree with other users' comments. It's hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams in the mid-1980s. I think it's dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match. If anyone can really say it's a good movie, it has to be locked. It's so sad how money has so much power over people that they do anything to get it. I feel I lost my intelligence when I watched it. Before I looked at Chuck Norris, I had a little respect, but now I felt bad. I bought it as part of the 3 $ 9.99 movie package and I can honestly say I'd rather literally throw money away. Forgive me Jesus.
