Who gave these people money to make a film? There was nothing funny about that. The fact that the dog's ass was the funniest thing about the disease says it all. First of all, it has nothing to do with Christmas, it's just called, and those people who liked the original Chevy Chase were counted. They took Randy "I don't have a talent, I'm just a fat and sweaty pig" Quaid (the only bad thing in Part 1) and made a film about him - there are only morons in his family, but not "They're not nice, a little moronic, but they don t they don't touch me 'a little moronic. Watching this pile of dirt helps you hope that everyone involved in it, DIES! They didn't even bother to get the effects okay ... when on the boat, the only thing that moves is a fake background ... when the pigface Quaid is in the water, you can tell by lighting it is in the studio. This movie was sexist (Uncle Nick), a racist (Uncle Nick) and should never be made .. no ... throwing money into a volcano would have much more use. <br /> <br /> Well I hope I got to some of you ... Nobody's been watching me and now I'm scarred for a Merry Christmas life
