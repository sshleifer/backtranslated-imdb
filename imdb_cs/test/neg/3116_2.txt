First, I don't see how the movie is on some "best" list or how it won some prizes. Compared to La Pianiste, which is also on the "best" list, La Pianiste is gold. This film lacked so many things on so many different levels, but I can't quite explain why I didn't like it so much. The lead actor was annoying, I felt like I never knew what was going on and I was BORED! Although it was supposed to be some useful change in life that Pierre started, I wanted it to end .... as soon as possible. Why did it have to be his sister and his cousin? Ugh. And why did Thibault think? Just bipolar. And it was me, or did I miss the whole purpose of what the guy was in black? Who were the people who played music in the big basement of a large warehouse? Why did they have all the strange equipment and weapons and all the other rooms where people could live? I mean it, but incest is happening in French culture a lot? European culture? I took 5 years of learning about culture and I've never heard of it!
