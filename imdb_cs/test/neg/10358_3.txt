Cruddy, innocent .. not smoking, drinking or cycling, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make it morally feasible for bad biker movie, post-biker (exploit) time. They knew, we knew ... Adam Roarke and Slate are useless ... but they lived on. And 3 out of 10. Best Performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is really just catching the final biker exploit movie after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (who also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It ended. They knew it. They tried to live. But, Jocelyn Lane (from two Elvis bad swings, TICKLE ME and something bad) in yellow and leather is a modern hot cat with J. Slate fighting for honor. It's worth seeing, but it sucks. But look at it. Well worth non-biker, non-smoker, non-boozing, "biker" types with hot chicks.
