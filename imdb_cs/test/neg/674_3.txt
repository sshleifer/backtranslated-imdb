Tire and the rest of the modeling world need to know that real women like me and my daughter don't care that all those ridiculous models are selling something. Special places, too much makeup and too much skin is not necessary. Sex is not always sold when you sell to women. The same goes for walks on a track that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes and sizes and they must have it at the show. My daughter has 36 "inside, is tall and slim and size 5, I'm more average in size 12. We'd like to see both - I can't imagine anything looking at me when he's wearing 2 I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one-sided on this matter, but we really would like to see this show as women of all sizes.
