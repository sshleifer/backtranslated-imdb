I played as Eugene Morris Jerome in my high school adaptation game and this movie certainly doesn't live according to Neil Simon's script or imagination. I know that this game back and forth can honestly tell you that acting was turned off, production was cheese. Changes to the game scenario have been made poorly. If you really want to enjoy this game, you should see a real game, not a Hollywood movie adaptation. Eugene's character lacked a soul and was too sarcastic in everything he said. Other characters were out of key. General disappointment, messy, disloyal to play, amateur executed!
