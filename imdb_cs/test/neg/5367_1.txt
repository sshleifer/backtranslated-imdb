There are really no redemption factors at this show. Simply put, it's just awful. Absolutely terrible. It's just a terrible "reality" show. Not only is it a terrible fiction. <br /> <br /> Imagine: A bunch of too imaginative teenagers meet one night and go "Hey! Let's make a paranormal show like" Ghost Hunters "and whatnot! So they catch the camera, annoy the locals and the film's random landscapes for a painfully "monotonous attempt that is dramatic but failing." This show is basically a bunch of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary. The only difference is that this show actually has a budget and a writer. Unnecessary budget and horrible writers. Oh, problems, how can I calculate them? First let's talk from a personal level. I'm not a total skeptic about paranormality. I am willing to believe in what is paranormal and what is not, and I am sure there are a lot of people who feel the same way. So, if you do a paranormal show, you have to do a good job of persuading the viewer that what he sees is either paranormal or not because the viewer can easily believe otherwise. I hate to compare it, but I don't know why not at this point. Take, for example, "Ghost Hunters". In "Ghost Hunters" you can say that the cast is aligned with the audience. They are not absolutely skeptical, yet they are still willing to remember the possibility of paranormal anomalies. They have to look at something and be willing to say "it's possible that its just nothing". And with that in mind, they went on trial and proved that they were wrong. They use technology and several other aids together with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal, along with that what can be monitoring cannot be anything in mind. Not only does he try to convince himself what is real and what is not, in a process that tries to convince you. This element of doubt is not present in a "paranormal state". Strike one. <br /> <br /> In "Paranormal State", the cast simply says, "It's a spooky place, and its HAUNTED, so we'll find some Spirits!" And you immediately know and say, "Okay, convince me differently". The cast is not professional in his interviews. In fact, sometimes they seem to annoy the locals of these so-called "Haunted" areas. They have no real evidence to support their claims, in addition to assumptions and theories, and the best they can be must be someone who "claims" that they can contact the dead, with no one ever supporting who this person is and how they are actually valid. . They could easily get out of the street and say "pretend to contact the spirit for our show" and go for it. It just happens in the "Mothman" episode. Without any convincing evidence to the end of the show, they bring this kind of individual out where he makes a random, painfully written "reading" of the supposed area as something is "haunted" in order to convince his audience. Very, very bad effort. I feel that one of the main problems with the show is that it feels written. During one of the episodes, the cast gets attacked by one of these "paranormal anomalies" at times in an attempt to be dramatic. These dramatic sequences might be a skeptical laugh, and even those who are on the fence realize what they're watching, just a bunch of tabloid esquire garbage. If the aim of the exhibition was to try to convince their audience that these "paranormal" events are real, they are doing such a terribly bad job. Strike two. <br /> <br /> However, there is always a counter. Just one last look to see if the show is actually something valuable. What if the show doesn't try to convince you that these paranormal events are real and just try to entertain you with good fiction? Even at this level it fails. If the creators of the show tried to create fiction to entertain their audience, the writing is too poor and even at a fictitious level, it cannot convince the audience that its cast members are actually experiencing unknowns in their full, frightening glory. Writing is simply not convincing and I dare not say, boring. Strike three. What is left of this show is simply a lot of teenagers who are too willing or too trusting to believe in paranormality simply because it is much more amazing than the reality that went with the camera. bad script and bad actors generally make a really bad horror documentary. That's all that is at this point. There's no reason to look at it, not even for fun, and there's no reason to worry about it. To be blunt, its lame. There are absolutely no redeeming factors about this show.
