Spoilery! Bruce Willis, part-time Comic and funny boy playing Hispanic killer nicknamed after African scavenger prairie dog? I think all good Hispanic nicknames like Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpion, Viper, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (Whip), Navajo (blade), etc. Not available? And why would a South American killer meet a terrorist from the Irish Republican Army? The last time I checked, IRA is not looking to open any branch in South America. And why would a prisoner, battle-tired Irish terrorist look like Richard Gere in middle age? I thought this movie would be the "The Crying Game" spoof when Gere's character was introduced as a person about to chase "The Jackal." What a bad casting! And why would the FBI hire perverted terrorists to watch killers? It looks like a terrorist goes for mass destruction, and the killer usually hits one target in an extraordinary way. But Gere is the only person ever to see Willis alive, according to the FBI. I thought this movie should be a remake of the very big movie "Day of the Jackal", but this movie is just a silly version of "Assassins" with Stallone and Banderas. Both of these films are really stupid and part of the stupid thing is that as viewers we are forced to watch Bruce Willis go through his routines and say "Wow!" PROFESSIONAL with Jean Reno was a much better murder movie. "Jackal" is just a movie about two fat millionaire middle-aged actors who could pay for standing around and looking pretty and pretending to be smart! "Jackal" is so poor that I expected to see Sly Stallon, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Jean Clod Van Dumme look like "next" hitmans or FBI. Needless to say, the "jackal" escaped the FBI for twenty-five years, but once Richard Gere gets to work, it's just a few days before "The Jackal" is a hood! I think the positive news of this movie is: "Thanks to the terrorists, our streets are safe from killers." Overall, "jackal" has no redeeming properties.
