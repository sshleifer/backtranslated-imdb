We've given this movie one star terrible, but it really depends on how you look at it. We are currently watching it on Channel 5 at 3.30 am, And we didn't stop laughing, so maybe we could give 10, just for fun. From the very beginning, with the "manic" thoughts of the stalker, which is transmitted comically, we laughed. It's me or that cat out of Knott's landing is looking like one of the Dark Crystal characters. I'm not going to mess it up for you, but you'll have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming, I don't think its smart enough for a double bluff. It must be the worst / best movie we've ever seen if we were playing the clich√© "You're drinking the game, and now we're going to be lost."
