In fact, I saw EVIL on the big screen. I saw it as part of a double function during the early 1980s (I don't remember the second movie) when I was middle aged. The movie is bad, bad. Embarrassedly bad. The effects are appalling (you can clearly see the cable pulling a black girl over the floor). There's nothing scary about that. In fact, I laughed for the whole movie. The story tried to create this great space for culmination when we think we'll finally see who's responsible for all the bad things and see the greasy Victor. Buono, who is as scary as a crowded Twinkie. Seriously, what do they think? Buono, who was a villain on the television series Batman, is one of the actors who have always liked the big screen on the big screen, and I just can't imagine being disturbed at a distance. EVIL is all forgotten now (for good reasons), but it's actually a very funny movie and I would like to see this turkey again, just to see that the black girl is being dragged across the room invisible power with this visible cable.
