This was an abysmal show. In short, it was about the boy named Doug who was guilty of much. He really felt guilty for killing the fly and then felt guilty for being guilty of killing a fly and so on. The animation was a grid and annoying and cheap jokes. It was aired here in Sweden as part of the "Disney time" show and I remember I liked it, but then I turned to 13. he didn't know. the characters were also green and purple. What was it about? A really terrible show. Obviously, it has produced a movie that I have never seen, but I have no great expectation of either one.
