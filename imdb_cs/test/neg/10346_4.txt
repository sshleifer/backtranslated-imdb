I watched this movie mistakenly think it was that another zombie radio was going to flick. Shonky production value and low-rental cast soon gave away that it was another of those cheap sci-fi style knock-off style. Central Performance Bill Moseley is initially quite involved as a dubious Radio Shock, but as the film goes on, it becomes less and less convincing because it is actually obliged to act. The rest of the cast has little to do, just to be interested in and has no depth. The camera is boring, flat and totally uninspired, as are many such movies. He doesn't even handle a decent piece of compelling gore, zombie makeup is literally pathetic, unlike one significant exception to the end of the movie. The film seeks to bring originality and message into it's blend of half-baked and torn ideas in some way to balance this outbreak with intolerance to Islam and war on terror. It is woefully treated with all intellectual influence for 6 years. As characters and seemingly writers, they are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion - describing all people of a particular skin color as "Muslims". Most notably one character is revealed to be a Muslim by the color of the skin itself. At the same time, the "Muslim" terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. Probably by far the better Pontypool had a similar budget to Dead Air, yet it shines wherever this film fails.
