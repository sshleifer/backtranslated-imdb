I knew it was going to be awful, but not so awful !!, because it's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, it's not damn! All characters are boring and the story is stupid and incredibly boring! The only reason I rented this piece of crap because I'm a big Michael Dudikoff fan, but he's unnecessarily lost here, and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion whatever it is! It's like a movie had no conspiracy and it was all about nothing, and Ice-T is a terrible god (though he is fine in some things), plus Dudikoff and Yvette Nipar have absolutely no chemistry at all. There's one scene the director was trying to do emotional, but he was unhappy when Yvette Nipar didn't actually show that much emotion, but there's a decent scene for Car Chase, but that's not enough for me to recommend this horrible movie! plus dialogue is cruel. Avoid this movie, like a plague that is not a damn thing going on, please avoid and believe me on this one you can thank me swords. The direction is terrible! Fred Olen Ray is doing a terrible job here, with a delicate camera, ridiculously cheap looking pieces, terrible angles, ridiculous use of footage, and keeping the movie incredibly boring. Acting is awful! Michael Dudikoff is nowhere near his usual amazing self, looks very bored, and shows no emotion what is still, his character is also very boring because I can't believe he signed on this piece of garbage, he also didn't have chemistry with Yvette Nipar (Dudikoff still rules !!!). Ice-T hardly has anything to do and also looks boring, and he didn't convince me a little. Hannes Jaenicke is not very good here, he was a bit ugly, I didn't like him. Yvette Nipar is pretty, but she was really awful, she didn't show much emotion and she had no chemistry with Dudikoff, so I didn't even give her a damn character! Art Hindle, (Owen Marsh), Kathy Harren (Katharine Marsh) and the rest of the cast are also bad. Overall, please avoid being a plague! Fred Olen Ray and Steve Lathshaw should be ashamed of themselves! BOMB of 5
