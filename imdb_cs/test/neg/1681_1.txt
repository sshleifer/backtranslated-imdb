Dull characters with one tone, without any development, unimaginable performances of people who sound like they're just reading lines, and ridiculous special effects that make it a real stink. The story begins with an extremely bland commando Russ and his soldiers attacking the Al Qaeda training base. The scene tells us that Al-Qaeda has recently come to find the ultimate weapon and is also used to illustrate the single Russo character, a tendency to avoid teamwork. With the help of a collection of empty shales and stereotypes of walking, including a Russian spy, Russo travels to Chechnya to catch a mad scientist working for terrorists. Along the way, they encounter huge hordes of bats that feed on meat that for some reason flies in broad daylight. From there, the film will become nothing but a draft morass ridiculous action, including a scene in which a swarm of bats slap a soldier's hand!
