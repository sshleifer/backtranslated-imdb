The trio sits at a table in a restaurant and stares into space without a word. Later, they lean on the rail and stare across the canal in England. Man works hoe repeatedly in his garden, only his head and upper torso can be seen on the screen. Man and woman watching another man peeing against stone wall. Each of these silent shots takes about one minute. Absolutely no information that could not be provided to us in one quarter of the time was provided. The editor had to sleep. I know I was. The film opens with a surprising shot of a crude sheath of a apparently dead body. One gorge is rising. But then (Schotte) exchanges a few words with the neighboring couple and starts to forget the brand and the case is forgotten for another half hour, while Schotte and his friends trade unfair insults with each other and with strangers. Finally, the case fiber is raised again, but progresses slowly, almost aimlessly, according to a stylistic pattern that has already been created. Sometimes in movies like this, shooting a place provides a certain atmosphere that compensates for the numbness of the story, but not here. French village houses are joined together in long rows. The facades of the house are directly adjacent to the pavement without steps. The queues show virtually no decoration and are almost indistinguishable. Flat farmland is dull. What could be one of the most exciting episodes - a visit to a stone fortress on the coast - is a bored trio until they start to behave like snobs and ask them to leave. Negotiations are minimal. Nobody feels particularly concerned when he wants to say something. There are no jokes. Nothing will happen. The policeman's face is almost as interesting as Randy Quaid. The little girl, a tall, muscular blonde, looks like a kind of putter on steroids used by the East Germans at the Olympics. I sat for over an hour before I gave up. Maybe I'll take some other time for it. If I don't miss something, or if Monty Python's pompous routine does not show up to the end, I don't think you can do much to rent out.
