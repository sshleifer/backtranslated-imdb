Arthur Miller has always been known as one of the great American playwrights for works such as "The Seller's Death" and "Crucible". "Focus" is one of his lesser known games brought on the silver screen. Knowing what a great playwright Arthur Miller is, but I doubt his original play was very similar to the movie. The film comes as empty and formal, with William H. Macy as a non-Jew mistaken for a Jew by anti-Semitic neighbors in World War II Brooklyn. Don't get me wrong: acting is fine, and I suppose people behind this film are probably trying to mention racism, but the movie just doesn't work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer just can't create an effective story with material here.
