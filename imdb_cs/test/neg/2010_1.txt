My original comment on this particular title has been deleted by IMDb or its staff, just because I don't like this movie to the point where I had to sincerely write what I felt when I saw this bad apology for the movie. Where is my freedom of speech? Obviously, this movie was made by students, so lame and amateur felt it. Of course he has to start somewhere? The script was an incoherent mess, and so did acting. With a low budget and class B actors, what can you expect? There is some CGI in places so poor, it looks like it's done by an old PC. Some may say this is a kind of "Alien" clone, only this time it's Dracula (in vintage costume) who is sucking the other cast dry, one by one. The kits are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large space ship. It would be fun to know what stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) were thinking about the film after it was released ... Coolio must be the worst rapper ever to be an actor ! It was a waste of my time and money, I don't know why I bothered to rent this movie. Honestly, I just hate the movie. With the house of the dead Uwe Boll, Dracula 3000 shares a dubious honor to be the worst movie ever. (Well, I've seen even worse than these two) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Any other film will be better.
