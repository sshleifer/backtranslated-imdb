What really happened to me about this movie was how little conspiracy made sense. So many characters were accidentally introduced, it was like I imagined that Tommy Wiseau was a "ROOM" that would be re-introduced to Disney Channel. We had a wiser older couple who still hung where "Jane" worked and told the same story about how "soda" was joined, or Jane's Mom / Stepmom / a random crying woman who would show up randomly. Aaron Carter's actress is definitely the highlight of this movie: Actually, I was looking forward to every scene he appeared on. The cut is painfully bad, with scenes that make no sense. "Jane" character is really irritating, monthly and moping about "J.D. McQueen." The scenes with the "Music Awards" are more depressing than anything else. And the end of this film is unreal.
