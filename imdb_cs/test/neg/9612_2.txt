I will not be too hard at this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey who tries to cope with her new half-brother, Derek and his loud, brutal family, while gradually making the princesses join them. <br /> <In Season 1, the story was interesting. I liked Casey because she was smart, strong, independent and conservative. She was well behaved and deep. I felt bad when she was bothered by her new half-brother in the new school. She was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as later episodes. Oh, and she was dating a nice guy who is now portrayed as one of Derek's idiotic friends. The season grasped the real tension that the exhibition title was trying to capture. Now I can't say that the show really went downhill because the story is sometimes interesting, but now I'm trying to get Derek instead of Casey. There is little, if any, interaction between the two siblings. If they communicate, it's just a short time. Oh, and I don't want any Dasey fans on the face. People, this is called INCEST, although they are step-siblings. My tolerance may go so far, but that's not the reason. It's special. Derek, as an antagonist, has become more sensitive over time, while Casey, a supposed protagonist, is more neurotic and unlikely than before. I like how younger children get more time, but parents are even more helpless than they used to. But this is not the biggest problem ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately we are forced to see everything from Casey's perspective, with limp background music. Over time she became more stupid and shallower. In one episode she was angry and wanted her friend to be more chivalrous, and so deliberately threw the food on herself and blamed Derek. What happened to a strong, independent feminist? I haven't seen much of the fourth season, but I've heard he's dating a guy named Truman who's a hell of being arrogant. I remember the fencing episode. He constantly reminds him that he doesn't like it, goes crazy about being a "sword", and finally joins him because he can "handle" him? What the hell? Why go first with the guy. In the first season, Casey would never mind him in his ... Or maybe it was my reaction. And she's a cheerleader. Not that it was a bad thing, but I think she fell on her head for one of her practices. And in the graduation episode, she cried because she couldn't find the "dress in her dreams," and was not entirely satisfied until she became the ball queen. One thing I noticed is that no matter how badly Casey tries to say her life is, it's almost always her way to the end (she gets a guy she wants, Derek gets some revenge, people She loves her, Derek is still quite immature, but I see she really matured. Edwin is also a little bit better and he's a good brother, Marti. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the show is so-so, and I rated her low because, despite some character development, I once admired, has now become like any "fashionable teen queen" you can see anywhere on TV. But it was good when it took.
