A hairy, cross-dressing little boy finds success on the Spelling Bee circuit despite unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing. Shirley MacLaine has directed and performed as a child's grandmother, and it is always fascinating to see long-term actors who have a chance to direct the film, the material they are drawing, and the actors they choose to work with. The only person who is well occupied in "Bruno" is MacLaine. Child actors seem to have been picked up for their flashes and cuteness, and the fool MacLaine holds their close-ups for unbearably long periods; Nothing about these cherubs seems natural, not lines that fall without consciousness from the mouth or interaction that they have with adults or even each other. When the boy's dissatisfied father, poor Gary Sinis, floats around the edges, in a shameful shame, always with a pained look on his face. Towards the end of the movie, MacLaine turns the whole thing into a passage hugging scene, and even ends up with a boy hugging the Pope in Rome! Another godless treatise from a talented actress-turned-director who, like Sally Field and her movie "Beautiful", can't seem to stop winking at the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity for shtick, and childhood innocence as a punch. The children in this cast coil their eyes, blink their sophisticated notes, use big words - but when one of the cubs says to our pint the big hero "gay", MacLaine's grandmother instructs him to go out and out. before the media!). What's the procedure? * of ****
