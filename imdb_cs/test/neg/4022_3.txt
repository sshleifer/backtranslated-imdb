What was the Zucker brothers' movie? I don't mind a bit of humor in my Holmes (I'm a big fan of Billy Wilder "The Private Life of SH"), but this version of "The Sign of Four" feels like Grand Guignol-esque episode "Murder, She Writes" that are the worst possible kind: a cut of the movie scenes) directed by Mel Brooks. Ian Richardson is a great actor and certainly looks like a part (he's a dead bell for those strands of The Strand!), But his character interpretation is all bad and too funny, from a silly smile he often sports (I thought the drug was Holmes was into cocaine, not weed) to his expressions of comic stiffness in carnival sequences. Not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man, he is so over the top that, despite the gentle make-up, we recognize him immediately. David Healy is infallible, but due to the circumstances acceptable to Watson, and not too many buffoon ... at least no more than the rest of the characters. Cherie Lunghi (Excalibur) plays Mary Morstan in exaggerated fashion mode from the 1930s vaudeville. Story-wise, there are some unnecessary additions (such as giving Tonga vampire teeth, appetite for raw meat and carnival pits as places to live that turn him into rejection from Dr. Moreau Island), and we we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the secrets besides Holmes as we are well informed about everything before Holmes learns. And this is full of tired clich√©s: not only do we get the infamous phrase "Elementary, my dear Watson" (who, as anyone Sherlockian will know, Conan Doyle never wrote), but we are exposed to such shameless customs as Hindu music pop out of nothing when Holmes goes to see a white guy in Hindu clothing. The Bottom Line: In Britain, in the 1980s, two competing television companies tried to create a long-term series of modifications by Sherlock Holmes, and produced initial TV-films as potential pilots. One of them played Ian Richardson, the other played Jeremy Brett. Fortunately, the one that got through several episodes was good! <br /> <br /> 3/10. Travesty.
