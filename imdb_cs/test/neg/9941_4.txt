I read some reviews that asked "Why was this movie made"? I myself have found that this question is floating in my mind when it seems that the hour and twenty-minute function are moving close to the center, just to feel that at the end it is raising a pair when it has actually done nothing like that. So, "Why was this film made"? I think this is a big question for those who follow Heftig og begeistret to ask themselves. This reviewer boasts director Knut Erik Jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope, fraternity and inspiration with this whole male choir, but I don't think Jensen would do enough to put a story on the table. Let me ask you this question: "Do audience members need more in documentary than just a straightforward story to keep their interest"? My answer is yes, and that's where Jensen failed. Heftig og begeistret was a good document, but it was far from big. Jensen did terrible work with the story and dedication of the subjects. It was great to hear songs, but over time these songs seemed boring, overwhelming and a bit premature. From the opening scene, where our men sang the heart in blind snow, I knew I was addicted, but I lost interest as the film evolved. Why? Jensen never brought us to the next level. He kept the playing field level and finally wounded the film's overall tone. Was it a movie about music or about men in the choir? The world may never know. Again, I would like to point out that Jensen has done a phenomenal job in finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with it. music, but it was as if the entire male choir was a bunch of the most boring men ever created. Jensen gave us great music, but the characters, subjects I didn't know about the end of the movie. In the mix, we had a 97-year-old man who had a driving license, we had a big man in a bathtub singing classic American songs, we had old men who were once a goggle in our youth, and we had tensions among young people. choir and veterans singers, and we even had an addict who was clean for only eleven years. Has Jensen developed these interesting stories at all? No, he left them on the table. It was obvious that these singers were willing to talk about it (see the political man who missed the political days), but Jensen seemed to have gone away from these heartfelt moments and headed back to interesting places where the choir could sing. Music was defined at the beginning of the film, I wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men. Everyone was charming, but Jensen seemed to ignore them completely. Jensen, by ignoring the main subjects of this document, failed to create any tension that would be over. I felt Jensen's lines. Instead of being bold off the line, he decided to create a moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness or sadness. Jensen took our items from point A to point B to point C without asking us to engage in form or form in some way. I can see how national sentiment has made this film a tremendous success in Norway, but for all others it was necessary to watch (ie ME). I wanted to feel these guys. I wanted to know if they would do well when they were traveling or just in their own city. There was no story, mostly to no development of subjects. When you look at modern documentaries (this movie was made in 2001), you want it to be similar to any Hollywood feature film. To tension, realism and drama, unfortunately, with Heftig og begeistret you get nothing like that. Overall, I have to ask "Why was this film made" again? My last reply, Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show how disturbing times and the changing economy can still produce happiness in the coldest places of Earth. I think Jensen wanted to show human devotion and how something as simple as singing can unite the population. With that said, Jensen perfectly demonstrated that in this movie, but did not create a good documentary. When you make a film of this nature, I feel that you have to look into the group, explore the choir participants and hear each of their stories to reach the end that grabs your heart. The only thing this film took was my attention as she tried to leave the room with a rocket speed. Again, I don't want to sound negative about this movie because the music was excellent and the singing of men brought a sense of honesty, but I needed more. With documentary films that have become the wider foundation of the film community, a little more than what Heftig og begeistret has given us. I want to see reality and people, not just another song and dance! <br /> <br /> Class: ** outside *****
