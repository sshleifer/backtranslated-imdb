Current? Definitely. Entertainment? Probably - but only to remove any piece of the viewer's common sense. Reality? Only in such a quantity that it was made on this planet. As thousands of people should die as a result of a 5-meter water wall in a city that was loosely occupied by buildings over 25 feet high, it is behind me. Carlyle is a line to the effect of "how could anyone survive it?" When the shot shows the forests of buildings with several floors above the water, is absolutely ridiculous. Further, if someone binds to an area (underwater) where one cylinder of air is not sufficient (ie die), why not take the simple purpose of removing more than one cylinder? Obviously, the writer thinks that people in stress situations cannot count for one (one cylinder, one floor). Rather than pursue this audacity, you would be more informed and entertained by throwing the DVD away and reading price information on the cellophane outer shell. Sudden, really pitiful and terrible waste of talent on screen. As for sexist propaganda, which suggests that only women can see problems with lighting solutions to be done by people to be consumed: even more PC 'tosh'. A small miracle that First Blood, Delta Force, Navy Seals and other such films with little or no merit will always be behind, while this blatantly politically motivated shed is being sold.
