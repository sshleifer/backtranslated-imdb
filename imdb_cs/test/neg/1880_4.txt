In addition to DA (James Eckhouse) and a short-performing woman who is convincingly fond of Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger), Ellen is in itself a convincing character - and a likable character in the film. It's the only one, not her dying mother who should be and is one thing. it is not only in the role, in Zellweger's acting, but also in the conspiracy itself ... Until the plot turns against itself - and makes the mother "one right thing" in the eyes of her weak husband who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter. The daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent perception must give way to the shallow sentiment of her husband, who is emptied both in the reality of her wife and her daughter. To start up, one powerful scene in this film, when Ellen confronts his father's cruelty, is given a lie at the end. Ellen is just another young, strong woman who has to be twisted into the crimson's father. Very faulty film - so defective that it is called a well and is not worth the time.
