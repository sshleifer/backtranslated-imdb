I rented a "Piano Teacher" video that knows nothing about it than what was written on the video. I did it with some concern, because the films that win the Cannes award are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this falls into the second category. For about a quarter of the way I found out, I said loudly, "This movie is boring." About halfway through the road I thought, "Where did I see it before?" In three quarters I figured it out. Despite its literary origins, this film is basically a remake of Robert Altman's much earlier film (1969) and better: "The Cold Day in the Park." and less study of character, both films are thematically identical, there is nothing "new" in this production. and condemned "love" that culminated in the opera (near) scene of death ("David Butterfly" by David Cronenberg 1993); that so many people found the film to be "shocking", "shattering," etc. This highly derived film seems to have been created only to make viewers feel uncomfortable and clear to them However, I am very grateful to have such a reaction to the lack of film experience. And while it is true that I saw that it is the "R-Rated" version I saw, I doubt that other scenes would change my overall view of "Piano Teacher". Technically, the film is not merit. There is some very good camera work and lighting is excellent. Isabelle Huppert's trusted performance also helps save him from losing time. This is Haneke's first movie I've seen, and if I had to see more, I expect to have the same opinion on him as on Ferrara. . Rating: 4/10.
