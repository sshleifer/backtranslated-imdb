It hurt to watch this movie, it really was ... I wanted to like it, even going in. Shot of course for very little money, I looked around and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. Unfortunately, even though I appreciated the film at this level, acting and editing was terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes was a tough burning area. A 95-minute movie should not be dragged. The evaluation of this rating is still good, but I am afraid that friends and family might have a say in it. What was wrong with these transitions? Dear Editor, did you only purchase the first copy of Adobe Premiere and make it your primary goal of using all the plush transitions that come with this stupid program? Anyway ... some better actors, a little bigger passion, and some other interesting cuts and it makes a decent movie.
