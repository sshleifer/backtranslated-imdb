This document is full of problems. <br /> <br /> How arrogant is to create a document about your own family? I understand that the topic is interesting. It bored me. This is not a fascinating story for me and I don't know why you think it was. <br /> <br /> I don't want to behave as an average, but I have to say: Most of them are simply not attractive in this movie. And that's okay, not everyone's nice. But your camera technique, keeping the lens in their face, so you can't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant looks because it's filling your 47 "TV is not pleasant. I had to put my hand up to half the time to shield myself from warts, wrinkles, bags under the eyes and yellow teeth, in fact, I try not to sound inhuman, but pull the camera, so it's not like total strangers who breathe in my face. <br /> <br /> The camera works in this "movie" is an amateur level class, it's a kind of camera work you see with everyone with a family picnic camcorder, uninteresting framing, unstable, even static footage carelessly if you do it for a living. <br /> <br /> Honestly I can't see what's going on in this matter.
