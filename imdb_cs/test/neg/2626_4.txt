"Changi" is an Australian comedy / drama in a WWII Japanese prison camp. The story deals with past events and the present, when old veterans plan meetings. This is a much publicized and controversial miniseries, here in Australia. Budget beats ($ 6.5 million Australian Dollars); historians and veterans have criticized its authenticity; and critics have pestered the restless mix of comedy and drama ("Pearl Harbor"). Series writer John Doyle (half of the successful Roya H.G. team comedy) tried to defend himself with comments about "characters are composites of real people"; "Soldiers used comedy to cope with the situation"; "it is only on the basis of real events"; "One of our actors was actually there," etc. I have no problem with any of these points. Many excellent fictional and factual dramas have come from the Japanese P.O.W. camp experience: "King Rat", "Tenko", "Merry Christmas by Mr. Lawrence", "Bridge on the River Kwai", "Path of Paradise", "Empire of the Sun", "Blood Oath", and "City Like Alice. Black comedy has often been successfully used in P.O.W dramas: "Life is Beautiful", "Great Escape", "Seven Beauties", "Stalag 17", "Colditz Story", and even "Hogan Heroes". So why is Changi a monumental failure? - playing in "Changi" is equally excellent, music and cinematography is good - it's writing and the direction they left it. Every scene seemed to give me deja vu waves. When Anthony Hayes stood in the blazing sun, I thought, "I haven't seen Alec Guinness in" Bridge on the River Kwai "?" Sudden flashes of surrealist song and dance brought Dennis Potter a "singing detective" but without subtlety. This borrowing happened so often that it struck lazy writing to trim and paste, rather than homage. Continuous cutting between the past and contemporary stories didn't let me concentrate. Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - he left me here from characters where intensity was required. "Entrepreneurship" is exaggerated - every conversation seems to contain "stone bloody crows" and those I said "get that point, I know they are Aussies". Cultural stereotypes have also spread to British and Japanese too young Japanese officers; a violent British officer; the wiser Japanese commander; fun-loving, rascally Aussies etc. I thought I was watching "Hogan's heroes on the Kwai River". After 3 episodes I tweaked.
