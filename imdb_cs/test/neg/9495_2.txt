I really don't know much about the Marquis de Sade, I didn't read his book, but I never imagined it as a flaming queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye Pro Straight Guy, or Jack of Will and Grace would easily fit into the role that Nick Mancuso gave us. The film itself was rather thin and looked more like a parody - or an apology to show a couple of times a Parisian court with men and women having a good time on the couch in the salon. What? Can't afford a room? I found it cute that madam (Irina Malysheva) felt she was doing her patriotic duty to take care of the soldier's needs. The film was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts - and I mean a lot! Gimli fans (John Rhys-Davies) might be interested in seeing him in a different role as Inspector Marais.
