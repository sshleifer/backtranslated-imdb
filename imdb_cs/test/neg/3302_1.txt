What can I say about a movie that seems to be two hours? The hero starts in ninjaville in Japan, goes through an identity crisis (saves shinobi), sets off for America (saving a slave named Sam) deals with a little wild action in the west (spares French / Japanese native Julie), goes hunting pirate gold, and then returns to Japan to fight the war. Obviously the film has no idea where it will be at any moment; I think the director modeled every scene after the last movie he watched. If you are going to watch this movie, I recommend renting headlines, so you and your peers can openly discuss how the movie is without talking over the movie, or missing another stupid plot. Films the director watched during the filming of this movie - American Tail, Fievel Goes West, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Gooni, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kung Fu, Vampire Hunter D, The Ten Commandments. Interesting Notes - Most fear inspiring lines of all time. About 90 minutes (or 19 days) into the movie, the leading character just overcame an American villain, and just as one of them is heading for vcr to end the pain, the hero declares "Let's go back to Japan" and the agony goes on. next week.
