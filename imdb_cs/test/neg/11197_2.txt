I mean, come on! This film had such a nice potential, but it's as if he ran out of money to finish the script, and just wired the rest of the film 2/3 of the way. The characters are beginning to churn out this film with the whole reason for the other characters who did not ask for information in extremely delicate spaces. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior because it must be what is expected in this genre of film. It's really sad because this movie could be a lot more. <br /> <br /> I was really hoping it would be a good movie. There was some good talk. Mark Hamill does a great job until the film breaks down, so Sally Struthers. It was fun to see them work and succeed in their craft. Majandra Delfino was pretty good for a while until her line kept up. I felt sad that she had to say these lines, which just filmed the whole film credibility for all movie viewers. Brad Hunt has an excellent job. He really has a surprising range of talents from another of his films, which I recently saw, Lucky 13. (which was a piece of crap). This guy could be a star if he could choose the right scripts and be lucky with the right director. <br /> <br /> Almost forgotten! The music was so strong that you think this project has been passed on to a smaller film school. I call this kind of music "Teller Music" because you can just say what happens next by music. Less is sometimes more. From this movie half of the music from this movie, a good movie editor, a little transcript or two, and that would be a very good movie.
