Riccardo Freda can have a good reputation; but since we now that many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late Big Mario Bava; It is clear that in the 1970s he was not one of the most talented Italian filmmakers. This film proves to a large extent that, despite the simplified plot; it is a vast mess, and in general I would even have to go so far as to say that the tragic ceremony is WORSE, rather than Fredy's crazy Giallo, Iguana with a fiery tongue. Apparently Fred lost this movie and I'm not blaming him for sure! The story simply follows a lot of kids who run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. They happen to be at the house in search of fuel; but it turned out to be a bad choice because the owner is just about to make a satanic ceremony ... hum. The film plays a leading role for Camille Keaton, who a few years later began to play in the Spit class on your grave, but would not impress here despite the cast of talented performers. The movie has one decent gore scene to end, but it really isn't enough because it takes eighty minutes tedia to get there. I have a high tolerance for rubbish from Italian films that don't make sense - but I couldn't stand it either. Miss, nothing is missing!
