This is a terrible outage. Not only the title, but the idea is the same as Jane Fonda, George Segal's vehicle a few decades ago. Why? I wonder somebody with influence Jim Carrey will be, not only a star, but also produce this tired, ugly, senseless apology for comedy. Instead, he could take the comedy to a whole new level, what it can assume is a safe area. Money, money, grosses, christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. I say it unpleasantly because I felt. When I was desperate, I tried to be funny on the screen. And unhappy. It could be an outrageous, politically incorrect, mirrored comedy of Enron's days, but no, that would be too high, too risky. What a shame!
