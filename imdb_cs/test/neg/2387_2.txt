If you see the title "2069 Sex Odyssey" in the video store, ATTENTION! The cover has Tori Wells and three other "80" porn stars and has the copyright of 1986. If you're like me (and I hope you're not), you'll think "80 Years of Porn? Tori Wells? Fraud!! It was made in 1974 and dubbed German stars! There's nothing wrong with the 70's German porn, but it's not my cup of tea, and it's nothing that will lead you to believe you are. As soon as I got past my rage about the recklessly misleading jacket, I watched it anyway. It's a bad, bad movie. I'm sorry, I really didn't get the rage for that.
