God, it was sucked. You can't end a horror movie with a happily-ever-after family setting. Yeah. I was a bit ambivalent about going to the final act. But my God. He did not have to kill the girl, did not die, the spirit of the spirit appeared with the cure (which makes no sense, because his spirit would be liberated after all the young were killed by the bad werewolves). What piece of waste. This is the worst horror movie I've ever seen, and I've been watching a lot of horror movies. This is for Landis and all the other participants in the American werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope it destroyed each one's career at Julie Delphy's Bar. And CGI: Something new and elegant in 1997, but today it looks just dull compared to the refined London work in the prosthesis / make-up area. By the way, I'm done, I hope I scared a few people. Instead, take the original, or if Howling fails. Or if American Idol watches fail. Don't look at this mess.
