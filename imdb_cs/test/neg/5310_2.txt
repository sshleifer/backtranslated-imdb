The movie, though a bit flawed, was quite entertaining. About half an hour to Be Cool I started to have flashbacks from Hollywood Homicide. But guess what? It is worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like the most cast in this movie so I feel bad about writing a negative review on it, but I feel compulsory. Rock, Andre 3000 and Vince Vaughn were in comedy. No one else seemed to decide what film genre he was working on. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought Chili Palmer from Get Shorty into the movie. He was absolutely consistent in this role, but this film is so different from the original that the character stands out as a painful thumb. I wanted to give this 4/10 movie because I like the actors so much, but there is an interview in a movie about a song that's so intuitive that I couldn't believe the artists actually said it. If you want to go to the movies this weekend, there should still be some Oscar applicants. That would be a much better way to spend time.
