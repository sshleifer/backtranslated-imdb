Elfriede Jelinek, who is not yet a home name, is a Nobel Prize winner for literature. Her novel spawned a film that won second prize in Cannes and the best prizes for men and women leads. Am I a dinosaur for aesthetic recognition, or has art become so corrupt that something goes? 'Gobble, gobble' is a popular spelling representation in Britain about bubbling noise from Turkey. In the film world, turkey is a monumental flop, measured by cash receipts or a critical reception. 'Gobble, gobble' and Piano Teacher are perfect partners. The embarrassed horror of this widely praised film cannot be exaggerated. It starts very badly, as if it bothered the viewer. Credits interrupt insignificant scenes for more than 11 minutes. We introduce Professor Erik Kohut, probably the alter ego of the acclaimed author, the stone professors of the piano. He lives with his husky mother. Dad is an institutionalized lunatic who dies unseen while going into action. The assessment of a piano teacher is difficult, except for his inconvenience. What we see in the film (and can read in the book, for all I know) is an inexplicable, exploitative, meaningless narrative about the emotional pendulum that swings and from there without moving. Erika, whose name is used minimally, is initially seen as a person with intense musical sensitivity, but otherwise completely suppressed. Not exactly, because there are handbags on two scenes with her gravelly expressed maman at the beginning that ends with a rich apology. If a reviewer (yawn) is supposed to extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word to do it easier), Elrik's violently changing moods would be. A young piece, Walter, who is studying to become a "low-voltage" engineer, whatever it is, and playing ice hockey in a few leisure moments is also a talented pianist. She meets Elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In fashion so much art, he instantly falls in love and begins 'cherchez la femme'. Reprimated Erika likes for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs the tissue taken from the garbage bin in the private cabin where she looks. Walter performs a great audition and is reluctantly accepted as a private student of Erik, whose teaching style is distinguished by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation. He soon proclaims his love and long before haunting Eric into a lady where they deal with mild hank dolls and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control of her lovesick swain. He promises to send him an instruction sheet for more pleasant exchanges. Meanwhile, cold jealousy, because Walter's kindness to a nervous student who's literally shit before rehearsing for a future concert, Erik fills his student coat pocket with broken glass, causing heavy cracks to those delicate piano games. Another big scene (by circumventing spontaneous genital mutilation, etc.) Appeared at Walter. Erika shares with her mother. Erik wants to be humiliated, tied up, slapped, etc. Wisely Walter is repulsed for the time being and marching into the night. It is almost an hour to travel by now. The viewer can worry about the worst. Erika watches Walter on the ice rink where hockey practice. They leave for the back room. Lusty Wally can't resist his hands pulling his pants. Its 'baby sauce' is soon eliminated with a different stomach content. Throw Him. Detonated, but curved, perhaps longing for revenge for an insult that was recently barfed on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what happens now? It's not too deep or hard. Yes, he becomes gross, while Erik becomes a victim. One moment she locks her mom in her room and smacks Erik, another who kicks her in the face, has sex with her and renews her declaration of love. <br /> <br /> Am I unfair in this report? Watch the movie if you want, but I would advise you not to. Anyone can see eternity in the grain of sand if they are in the right mood. I could have gone on a demanding portrayal of the human relationships that this film had conveyed if I wanted to. But I don't want to, because that's a cheap and ugly movie that appeals to basic instincts and says nothing. I'm supposed to say that parental suppressed Erika longs for love, inefficiently looks for her in pornography, inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly realizes she doesn't like hurt, blah, blah, blah. The world has, for reasons not explained, stunted it. She seems to be making a monster from someone who seemed superficially loving - but we all know that every person is a potentially violent violent man, because that is his fundamental nature, however he is trying to tell himself and the world differently. <br /> <br /> At the end, if you have the patience, there is a small twist. Before going to the final scene, where she is supposed to act as a substitute for a underwear student, Erika wraps her handbag. For Walter? Yes, you are ahead of me. She stabs in no life threatening area and leaves. Credit Credits. <br /> <br /> If this amount won the second prize in Cannes, how bad were the other items?
