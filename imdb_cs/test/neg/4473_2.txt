Hollywood does not stop at nothing to make money on film, though they still have to pull stereotypes and put them in the most difficult and stupid situations. This effort is a clear example of that and I really believe in my heart that such a film is racially irresponsible. The story is about a divorced lawyer named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) who is chatting with the lady on his computer and when he finally meets her, it turns out to be the opposite of what he expected. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a stocky black woman who does not intend to go with Peter, but wants her to look at her case of being a robbery. She wants her to go well, but she constantly emerges at awkward times and saves her work, reluctantly agrees to look at the facts of her case. Peter has his kids staying with him and Charlene turns out to be useful in raising them, but suddenly a newsletter announces that he escaped a convicted named Charlene Morton has escaped from prison. Peter tells her to leave when the FBI comes snooping around, but he finds out she is actually innocent when her old friend shows and threatens him. This film is director Adam Shankman, who keeps things moving at a nice pace and technically is a good looking movie, but the script is so unlikely and every character is a stereotype to the point where the 1970s movie "Lessor" is clearly more in line with racial relations than this disorder. I've always been a big fan of Martin and I think he's one of the most talented people in the area, but he likes to work all the time, and sometimes he seems to choose any script he was given. On the other hand, I have always had a problem with Latifah and the way it flows into Martin's life is over the top that it immediately becomes an ingratia. The basic premise that Hollywood loves to use is a hip black person who shows upright whitey looseness and then pass on some street logic to help them with their lives. This is basically what the story is here, but of course it has to let Martin dress up in black and overdo it as retarded by Emin, because Hollywood knows that's what viewers want. Well, I was pretty much offended in this movie and it's not because I don't have a sense of humor, but unfortunately (for Hollywood anyway) I use logic and common sense when watching a movie. Yes, I enjoyed having a conversation with Jean Levy, but do we really believe that Latifah would attract him immediately? I guess something stranger happened and how many times does the main actor get to save him in his pocket? Wouldn't a cell phone be broken if a bullet hit him? Even if the most fans Martin and Latifah did not recommend. I know I said it before, but it's not an attempt to make a good movie, it's an excuse to try to make money!
