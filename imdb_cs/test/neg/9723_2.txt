Most of the critics of this film were damn accurate. It is an hour and a half loss of time, followed by a bunch of very nice high school students who whine and cry about life. There is about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no scary or exciting moments. Our actress is treated like bits of ass and they seem to be completely satisfied with their position. Leading characters, these ipsmith sons are poster guys for any pop culture clothing store. You can't connect with them, you can hardly understand them. The story goes by itself, and when it finally reaches the final battle, it's no more than a volleyball game that doesn't last long enough to deal with this garbage scenario raped by O.C.
