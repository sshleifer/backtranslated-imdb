What do Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. do? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece about problems in low-income schools. While the theme is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses all the clich√©s in the genre and leaves as a textbook of popcorn. Characters are cutouts from the inner city version of The Breakfast Club or even the faculty. Watch it with your children when they change to 13 or 14. With them, it could be the starting point for learning about current social issues. For every elder, it will be nothing but watching and spitting at 4 am, as I recently did on Bravo. What was it about Bravo?
