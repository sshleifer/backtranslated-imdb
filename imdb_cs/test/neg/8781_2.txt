This film contains the worst performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks at least energy. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spades. I never felt in this movie that Spilsbury had anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in the cool view. There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the land is not forced to be friends, you do not have the impression that they would like to hang out. Plus, sidekick has a more interesting personality. Ewww. The dialogue is predictable and boring. The story is incredibly wrong and if you are familiar with the Duke of Hazzard, you can imagine what it is like. I can't believe the director would agree with that. This offended me as a viewer by explaining every line of conspiracy I witnessed. Hey, at least horses and locations looked good, maybe that's what happens when you hire a cameraman to be your director. br /> <br /> RATING-2 You may be able to watch this movie for laughter or show a stranger what a bad movie is.
