An incomprehensibly horrible mishmash probably the most famous of all the Roman emperors who have gone crazy, leaving the infamous party orgies and ruthless murders in his way ... I know there are several versions of this, and it is based on 102 min. he watched - but I can't understand how this may make a difference to the rest of the movie getting out of the way! For a long time I have heard of the alleged "shocking" sex / nudity content (which frankly is not very much - and boring when it is there) and blood, but beware - it's amateur technical production that well and really Shocks Here: Everything Looks Simple and Just Like a Junior Movie School Stream Project! Working with the camera is hopeless, full of strange approaches, unsuccessful frames and cluttered pans (to and from what usually looks like a huge theater stage!), Complemented by grainy, inexpensive photographic quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they inside or outside? Did they change scenes? Who is or should he be in the frame? Cut is the ultimate sin that creates confusing confusion of everything with random jumps, continuity errors, and random transitions that destroy any momentum, story progress, and engagement. There is a potentially interesting dialogue and equally interesting true historical story ... but these mistakes scatter so much it is tragic. The story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, a burned (and Fellini-like) turkey that is only good for a few absorbing laughs and Peter O'Toole, who makes Tiberius the most memorable. Oh yes, which brings us to great players. I would like to include them one by one and I asked: Who did you have free access to the orgy bonuses that are part of this? There I wasted enough lines on one of the worst movies ever - <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 from Ozjeppe
