The frustrating thing about a movie like this, with the real potential for size, is that it is almost happy to be heavily dominated. We are talking about allegory, metaphor ... but the truth is we don't get around the fact that there is no conspiracy or real character. they are ... even if we never understand where they are going. Every time I attempted to understand the truth in this film, I was dressed in a total of conceit. Call it beautiful, great and amazing ... I call it "cheating". All style and no fabric. Sure, it's a matter of taste ... but I'd never imagine a confusing modernist pastiche of symbols and splashing over the spiritual clarity of Jean Cocteau or Renoir. But if it works for you, I'm all for it. I think art is a personal thing.
