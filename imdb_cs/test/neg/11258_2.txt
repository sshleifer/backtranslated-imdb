I have to be honest and I admit that this film meant nothing to me, except that it totally confused me. She is burdened with a conspiracy that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women who then associate with the appearance of a body over 40 years old. The story never seems to be very meaningful, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts having conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never made it up.) . A terrible miscast was John Goodman as Julie "Baby Feet" Balboni, which in my opinion should be a local crowd. I just didn't think Goodman worked in this role, even though I admit that it could be just because I'm not very much John Goodman's fan. Justin Machado appeared as a FBI agent somewhere in the mix, though I never understood what the FBI was involved in, which could mean that my attention was still wandering from the screen. If it was explained, I missed it. Fortunately, it's a relatively short film, so you won't lose too much of your life on it. 2/10
