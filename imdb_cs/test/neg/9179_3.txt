Fred Williamson, one of two or three best blaxploitation stars. Cynthia Rothrock, one of two or three top American action stars. Imagine a movie with these two together for the first time! Now imagine THE WORST, which could be made together with the two for the first time. Welcome to "Night Vision". Of course, this movie was made in 1997 and both were around their prime number, but that doesn't mean they didn't have what it takes - they just needed the help of good writing and management. They're not even here. Rothrock gets to the end of a few kicks, but this movie is so horrible that you won't be afraid to see them. (*)
