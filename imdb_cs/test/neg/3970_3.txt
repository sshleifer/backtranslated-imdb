Parts: Clonus Horror is not such a bad movie. I have a version of MST3K on it and it's a hilarious but still the worst movie ever made. I'd like to go so far as to say it was better than 80% of the movies they're making fun of. The concept could work if they had a better script, more money, and decent actors. It could become a classic if it weren't so boring and it would be a little more exciting. Sadly, she was lost in production and ended up on MST3K.
