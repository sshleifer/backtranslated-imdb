'R Xmas is one of the only movies I have seen where I can almost say that nothing just happens. I felt like watching a couple of middle classes with drugs, with a baby, walking around, eating, smoking, chatting (excuse me, I swear) over most of the movie. And I don't think I'm missing a point. I think this movie was well managed, well done (though the performance of the husband was rather wooden), and the constant sense of impending destruction after every corner certainly kept the viewer engaged. But when the dust goes away, the left with zero (just ship-cargo leaks) . I didn't want to car chases, violence weapons, beating, etc. In fact, I'm sick of violence. But my goodness, let's get a little deeper into all these characters (let's get to know each of these corrupt officers a little better-don't just show them views from them like street thieves). so juvenile? They all spoke as if they were in a junior high. \ TI believe that even this side of our human race can say something other than fu_ _, sh_ _, etc.Time and the story 'R Xmas I found quite interesting, but the execution was plain and simple -empty.4 / 10
