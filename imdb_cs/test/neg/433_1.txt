Hello, people, <br /> <br /> I can't believe that "Shades" took over this role from what you do. I don't think Cory Feldman will take over this role. This film was a smoking pile of manure. Save your money and time, and you'll see every one of the top 250. I swear I wanted to slap the lady at the blockbuster stupid for allowing me to rent it. Stay away !!!!!! Mr. Hipp
