I was pleased with the end. I saw the movie yesterday and I wanted to turn it off, but I changed my mind. It wasn't at all in the direction I thought the story would end. That's probably all I can say about this movie. All actors are nobles, especially leaders. Even though she is an attractive young woman, she'll never make it. Writing, direction and action are wooded, something like what you would see on daily soaps. The filming locations were very smart when you thought it could be anywhere instead of being in Canada. Since it was filmed entirely in Canada, I suppose the whole series was Canadien, which is not entirely bad, as some recent television productions of Canadien: "Cold Squad", "Stone, Underover" are quite well done.
