If Jack Black was listed as the lead actor, I wouldn't be abstaining from the movie. It actually makes some of his movies look good compared to this movie. This movie should be filmed as a cartoon for ages 3-8 and it would be much better. It's nothing but a bunch of stupid parodies of other movies put together to make one big mess. The film seems to have been shot for about a day without any thought behind it. There are several times where it seems that maybe there will be a turning point and the movie actually actually plot to the movie or at least the story would develop, but the silly parody embedded just destroy the entire movie.
