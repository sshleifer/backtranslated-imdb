Wow, what's racist, a profane piece of celluloid waste and what an insult to a great genre of westerns. <br /> <br /> Exploitive? Sexual scenes are abundant, abundance abounds, violence and horror abound in everything that gives modern films such a reputation, especially among those who prefer classic films. This is a kind of sleaze that gives old people ammunition against today's movies. Somehow I just can't imagine naked male bathing scenes in the movies Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey. I can't even imagine hearing "mother --- er!" he called back and forth. I sincerely doubt that this word was more than 100 years ago. But the f-word is so widespread that you think you are watching a story centered in today's urban areas, not the old west 1800s. <br /> <br /> Prejudice? What if all the white characters were good guys and every black man was an ugly, brutal villain? Do you think anyone can complain about a racist movie? He comes home that we don't hear a scream when it is reversed in hundreds of theaters across the country, as shown in this movie? Remember this name. It seems to be "Ed Wood" of today's filmmakers. Even Spike Lee wouldn't be this racist. You can't be much worse than this movie.
