There are times when, less than in the middle of the film, I will start to think about what the creators thought they had decided not to burn every disc of shots and instead release a film that had no real merit. And I mean any kind. This movie doesn't even hold up as a pornographic cable. In fact, the tears of Heaven are completely and totally boring and sometimes a little distracting in its naivety. A girl who, as I remember, eighteen, is masturbating when she thinks of an older Nazi who hit her by car - "hitting her in the hall as a way to introduce herself" by the sitcom and Robert Zemekis movies. Then, at your second or third meeting - you - it's shy, one who is resistant to girls' sexual advances, and yet, all he has to say is, "I'm old enough. m wants, ‚Äùand took her to bed. Having slept with this girl, she barely knows, feels finished, as if he could die in bed with her and live a lifetime. It's like "Lolita" without a bit of social and personal commentary. <br /> <br /> The camera is the most boring part of the movie. No interesting angles or originality at all, nor for sex scenes to be the main draw for these kinds of movies. The masturbation scene is just a camera that circles around a girl's bed (very fake, as if it was on stage), and it is intertwined by her imagination of a man who is showering in a waterfall. The "I'm Complete" scene is just the detail of the right side of the girl (head down to her breasts) with the guy upstairs, and it's the same shot all the time, even though repeated cuts to a pretty unrelated scene of an older Nazi sister who has some kind of him incestuous crushing (it's ridiculous and stupid, so it doesn't matter). I think the whole thing takes five to ten minutes and it's neither enlightening nor exciting.
