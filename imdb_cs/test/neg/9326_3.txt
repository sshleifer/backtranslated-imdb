Once again, I was deceived by seemingly intelligent reviews that seemed to be intelligent comments about an apparently miserable movie. I actually put on my shoes, got in the car, burned expensive gasoline and went to the nearest rental. After reading these reviews and paying the required $ 4 and changing the rent of this thing. I'm telling you, this is not worth the slight pounds of calories spent on raising the index finger that switches channels on the TV's remote control. I even gave it a few minutes after I saw all the pedigree stories. These are referred to as clinical signs by a director who is a. Go senile or, b. A film that he is obliged to create is only marginally interested. I have seen a similar deterioration with the string of absurd caricatures of John Carpenter over the last few years. Here are some scenes as incriminating evidence. The priest has a disturbing dream ... supposedly a harbinger of ugliness to come, because hell seems to be trying to open up the archaeological element of the demon. Dream is a goofy collage of discontinuous images directly from the Twilight Zone footage. The ticking clock takes care of the black dream of dreams, which means, what, the inexplicable secret of time? .... big problem! Dilapidated head, painted in demonic features with high-quality Halloween makeup in a high-quality shop, blinks back and forth in spastic insanity. Every time I see this effect, a big fat rebound from Jacob's ladder, it pisses me off. This in itself almost instantly discredits the film. The whole construction of the archaeological excavation itself is ridiculous. Everything is so obvious ... so tired and overworked ... the only possible answer is boring. At one point in the hill, the priest comments on the finding that the statues of the angels surround the sarcophagus ... all facing down to the gun crypt. He asks, "Look at these surrounding sculptures .... It's like they're holding on. Something. It's supposed to build tension ... critical mass ... but it won't come close! How can there be tension if with the audience you will behave like a lot of sages who will have to exert tension when you go together The pictures are primarily revised, but the added comments add in my opinion just an insult to the injury. they were to guard the main atrium (another shameless blow of The Keep, btw.) Who, for a loud call, did make-up effects for this movie? The blood actually had that pinkish quality we could see in the 1970s. I became almost convinced that they just forgot about makeup and had to go to Wal-Mart for the sake of time and money. <br /> <br /> Don't leave a hot comment on this! I'll have a suspicious eye on Schrader. that it is time to hang up gloves, maybe a close friend will offer a slight admonition to quit while there is still a dignity to remember the movies that have been gone.
