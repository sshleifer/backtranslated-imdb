It's not really worth a review, but I think it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this Canadian bomb floating around there ... Bad behavior and slow moving, absolutely dull 'coming Age 'story in which 3 boys lives turned upside down when a man on the run shows up in their clubhouse in the woods. In the eater, the boys deal with the intruder, and at one point they even consider him a model model ... However, all these changes ... and you still don't care. You know Chris Penn, whose biggest film impact is Corky Romano, and young Devon Sawa, whose career culminated in 'Casper'. I was hoping to have 12 and Holding, War or Lies and all I got was a waste of time. This film tries to keep the audience's attention and never makes any difference or interest.
