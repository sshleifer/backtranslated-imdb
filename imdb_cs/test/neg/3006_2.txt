If this movie had a point, I never found it. A very depressing film that is allegedly about the final evacuation of residents living in the dam area on the Northfork River in Montana. The problem is that there is no real Northfork River in Montana. There are several northern forks, but they are branches of other rivers that have split into northern and southern forks. The opening scene of the movie is the coffin rocking to the surface of the lake, but the scene is never tied up by the viewer being left to speculate as to its meaning. But much is left to the viewer to speculate in the film. Another example is when a dam team responsible for evacuating residents arrives at the dam's dams. Some comment that is almost inaudible is done about these people, which make no sense at all, and there is no continuation in the film that would explain it. The film is torn into several stories and the film is constantly changing and the film is constantly changing. among stories that are quite disturbing. And the stories are special. In one of them, residents of one property refuse to be evacuated because they live in a house that is built as Noah's Ark. Another nonsensical story is centered around a sick orphan who dies and somehow shares his presence with a ghost house and an orphanage with a priest at the same time. If anyone can figure out what the ghost story was about the author he had to explain to them. The scenery was stern and the sun never shines. There are snowy mountains in the distance. I think the goal was to set the mood. The time period is determined by the fact that the evacuators all controlled the Ford Sedans of the 1946-48 era although the events would have occurred in 1955. Acting was moderate. When I saw the billing for this movie, he said Darryl Hannah is in the picture. If she was, I didn't recognize her, but I think she was a spiritual lady.
