This film is very scary with scenes where the devil uses Gabriels Horn to open the sky and pull good angelic dogs out and imprision them on Alkatraz. The devil sings and dances for a few songs about the joy of being bad, and in one place eats a living rat. <br /> <br /> We got this movie for free with pizza. You get what you pay for.
