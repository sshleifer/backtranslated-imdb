Even Emeril Lagasse cooking cannot save this discontinuous, overhead idiotic nonsense, starring with emeril lagasse as a food channel chef who, with the help of a crew, tried to make the show better, a bad plot and a stupid script. Sewer, Robert Urich wasted in a badly supporting role and unfortunately it was his last (RIP), This is the worst show of 2001 and will be on the list of the worst exhibitions of this Decade. I feel very sorry for Emeril Lagasse for writing this sitcom, even saying it was a stink. It's hard to believe they're the same women's designers. It did this mess. TV Review: 1 Star
