I had to skip a part of this movie ... I found out I was asking who it was? And when did it happen? We seemed to be jumping, but I was still watching the fear that I was missing something, and everything would be explained to me. I loved Lonesome Dove, but this movie didn't make any sense to me at all. I loved all the actors, but what happened to the rest of the movie? That made me go "what"? At the beginning of each section. As for the scenery - I thought it was okay. the boy waited for his father to let you wonder if his father would finally return home to his son and be a father because his mother was now gone. I don't expect this to win any prizes.
