The authors do not know anything about Russian prisons, the film is completely tap, it has nothing to do with reality. Also, not that foreign prisoners in Russia have a special prison, so strangers NEVER live with Russian criminals. Uniforms in this film look if they were stolen somewhere in Latin America. Prisoners in Russia also do not work outside the prison. Every killing in a Russian prison is under investigation, so prisoners are only killed if there are very important reasons. It is also forbidden to play football in prisons, contacts between prisoners are very limited, no chance of bloody fighting, etc. Etc. So this film has nothing to do with reality.
