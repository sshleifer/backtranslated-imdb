For years, I hesitated to watch this movie. Now I know why. It was even worse than I expected. Ashton Kutcher makes the worst movie mistake of his career because 'Dude, Where's My Car?' Tara Reid co-stars as Ashton's dream girl who asks him to watch his father (and his boss) owl owl for the weekend. Rules: 1. No shoes in the house. 2. No people in the house. 3. Boss's son stays outside the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. Well, by the end of the first twenty minutes you can largely argue about how the rest of the film will turn out. You know, there are movies like: "Meet parents" where bad things are happening to someone, but it's fun to watch in a way that you can't wait to see what happens next . This isn't one of those movies. You know right from the start that bad things will happen and they're usually stupid things that never really happened. It is an extremely frustrating film that I watch, and when I almost turned it off, it was about three times because it was so bad. But I paid the rental fee and found out I had to watch it now. Tara Reid was good and I'd like to see her in more movies. Although, I'm not surprised when it had a hand in hurting her career. <br /> <br /> The end result is a happy ending ... but of course with the kind of movie you don't expect anything to be too small. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. Honestly sorry!
