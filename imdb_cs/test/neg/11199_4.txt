I went to see the power of Albert Finney himself. He's one of my favorite actors and rarely can deliver. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just stupid: it's about a little boy to be born, but as his mother goes to work, he refuses to come out! This sends God and the whole human being into crisis, and Albert Finney is called from purgatory to try to convince the boy to change his mind and decide he wants to be born. So Finney takes the unborn boy to the Big Apple adventure in the hope of showing him all the reasons he should want to live. Despite the absurdity of the plot, I could accept it if the director did not try to turn it into a typical Hollywood sentimental moral film. The director, the film was made an unbearable, horrible soundtrack of the sentimental sentimental music that Hollywood directors seem to be unable to defend. This somewhat unconventional story was defeated by giving a hand at any moment. Whatever the twists and turns were in history, they were completely dispersed in the way the story fell apart. It was as if the director assumed that the audience was just a bunch of idiots who couldn't see the obvious hints coming from a mile away. Even Finney in his performance, though satisfactory, seemed a bit embarrassed and no problem. places; and a little boy with curly locks, though he was supposed to be cute, was actually a bit boring. Bridget Fonda seemed to be trying to double Demi Moore's performance in 'Ghost', when she noticed tears. I understand that this film has so far been unsuccessful in the US distribution, which surprises. me because I think it has the potential of a box office to be a modest hit, appealing to both children and sentimental adults. When it comes to quality, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not very good. (4 of 10)
