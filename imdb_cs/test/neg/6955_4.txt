Vehicle for Michael Cain. It's pretty well written and there is something in it, but it's actually a mess - it's not funny enough or scary enough. It's a flabby modern cockney thriller. <br /> <br /> I like this assumption - that even in the quarry moral background of East London people do things for the right reasons. The surprising result of the first proper fight that Caine's old school supported Billy Shiner is his paranoia. The other half of the film is haunted by shadows to deal with the disappointment of the first. MY greatest disappointment was that director John Irvin couldn't make better use of the relationship between Shiner and his lieutenant. / filial substitute Frank Harper. Harper is, British Tom Sizemore, understands his role well while those around him ignore him. Damage. 4/10
