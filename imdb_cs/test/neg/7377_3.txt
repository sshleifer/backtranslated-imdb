This show was performed live across the country with a wide range of castings. I saw it for the first time in Provincetown, the first summer in P-City (2001) - before it was curiously banned in that tremendously gay resort (codes that resulted in it being closed since then). I saw it again later in off-Broadway, a long-running production in New York. Oddly enough, the production of P-City was much better than New York - fresher, harder, more lively and fun - but it was only in 2001; The following attempts to clone production ("Bare Naked Lads" in 2007) were definitely third. This filmed production presents Los Angelos' production, and, as other comments suggest, is not the best. I rated it a lot somewhere between the top production of 2001 and the summer show "Bare Naked Lads" from last summer.
