With the heart of Hong Kong's Andy Lau and veteran star Ching Wan Lau, "Aau Chin" has everything that starts at the beginning of the movie, unfortunately, the film breaks down at the end. Andy Lau plays a sophisticated thief who has only 4 weeks to live, but still has one thing unfinished ... He pulls out a sophisticated program that the police police agency will encourage him to ... hot on his tail. Can he pull him out before he gets caught? <br /> <br /> Making a movie is good. The bits of pieces of traces are left for the audience to try to guess at the real intent. Unfortunately, the build-up leads to a disappointed final settlement. He feels like the writer has changed in the middle of the script and all the build is disconnected. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
