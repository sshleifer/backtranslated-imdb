That was the worst movie I've ever seen. I have to admit that I didn't see it from start to finish because the toilet cleaning was more fun. 'The Star' was the most unpleasant figure I have ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, scary and unpleasant are too complementary. It is painful to watch, there is no play, especially not from a star that acts as a doping mentally inadequate start on one of those loud Black actors with a mouth. As horrible as it is to watch one of those who can't close a black actor, Puerto Rican is even worse. <br /> <br /> The film's title is descriptive, it's a pest. This film must be missing.
