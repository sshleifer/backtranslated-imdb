There's something about a movie that includes female bodybuilders who always get me in front of the screen. I saw "Pumping Iron II", "Aces: Iron Eagle III", "Raven Hawk", and even the television movie "Getting Physical", which featured several big names in the sport. They were tolerable in their own ways (mostly because they featured Rachel McLish. ROWWR !!). Then I went and watched "Nemesis III: Prey Harder", the only one that featured such lights as Sue Price, Debbie Muggli, Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. I love ladies, it will always be, but after this I am a little happy that I missed the first two "Nemesis" flicks. <br /> <br /> Well, first. Most shots are lifted physically (and kicked and screaming) from "Nemesis II". In fact, one looked marginally fun with the evidence provided here. But even though Price and Flex flex and pose, they don't have much chance to do anything else (like, say, ACT!). In fact, this whole film is an oblique story, ambiguous characters and open-ended filmmaking (both in terms of filming and story). Nothing makes much sense, but even if it were, there would still be problems - such as small parts for women with a longer lifespan than these. What a crime. Of course, it was written and directed by Albert Pyun, so what did you expect: cohesion? Only one star, considering all the hard work Price, Muggli, Bruneau and Sarcev apparently put into their bodies, not the "craft" work they did in the film itself. Thanks, ladies.
