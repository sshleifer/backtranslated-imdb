"Son, you have to stop the experiments I started!" It is a pity that no one has said it even to the one who lit the project !! I was almost literally drawn into this film by my friend at midnight when we were in high school. Now, midnight movie in high school Friday night, you don't expect much, but c'mon !! And after seeing it again a few years later, I stood up to my original point of view. Great special effects, but so what !! Quite probably one of the worst movies ever made. If you like blood and intestines and see some Hollywood vets (Steiger & Hunter) make fools of themselves a buck. FUJ !!!
