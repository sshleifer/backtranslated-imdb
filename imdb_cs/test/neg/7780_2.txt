The problem with this movie is that it's not funny, it's not scary, it's not dramatic, it's not interesting, it's not stimulating, it's not, it's not exciting, it's not Not least interesting. I saw this movie recently on tape and I was glad I didn't have any money to rent it. It is basically a bad filmmaking attempt. I won't even bother to tell you the story. Story? What story?
