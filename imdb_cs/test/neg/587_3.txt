Wow, okay, do you know the shocking things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumped again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost 4 hours total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain for semi-normal functions each so often. I think this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous, to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous. They just don't! And when you talk, there is nothing, and I admit that there were some scenes where only music was needed, and the music is great, that was probably the best part, but then listen to the symphony or something and forget about the movie. So many people give this amazing review, and for my time I would say that special effects and filmography are pretty good, but in terms of acting, or lack of them, it just needed something more, no shooting or sex, etc. But a little more emotion, these guys were like stones, just sitting there with long faces. All in all, if you need to calm down, just play the movie, don't even start at the beginning, if you've seen it before, just start anywhere, lie and relax, it lets you sleep.
