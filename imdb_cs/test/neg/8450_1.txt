Like the poster above, I was burned to the headline that I got another Piranha ... This movie is all that the above poster said and worse ... <br /> <br /> Bad Camera and just a simple frightening story ... <br /> <br /> There was very little to look at ... How this movie got, it's over. <br /> <br /> Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want ... and not this one. The movie I bought was "Piranha" and not "Piranha, Piranha!" That's what it is ... This is the only way they ever sold this movie. Peace Out.
