The movie is fine. That means I don't regret watching it! I found the acting purely and most of the dialogue stupid ("oh no, this was my grandma's bible!"). It's such a bad U-turn remake. The man comes to the desert city out of nowhere, meets bad people and falls in love with a bad woman. And, among other things, they got involved in something, he thought he could leave behind him. The film is quite predictable and there is nothing new about it. When it ends, you don't care. Most characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green !! All in all, another movie from the states, but cool fun at the boring Wednesday night. IMDb voting: 4/10
