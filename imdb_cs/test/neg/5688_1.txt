The film begins with a 30-minute explanation of war, human cyborgs, battles, history, and then lists 2 actors in the gravel pit. They run around this gravel pit / desert area for about an hour to shoot each other. And it is done. Must be worth around Â£ 10.00, with a change. Avoid. Ten Brands: Acting -9 Sets 1 Costumes -9 Direction -50 Production 1 Title intro 4 <br /> <br /> I think improving this movie would be: Lose Comments (Let the guard decide what's going on). Remove some of the terrible CGI. Add some techno rave music to it. They could just save him .......
