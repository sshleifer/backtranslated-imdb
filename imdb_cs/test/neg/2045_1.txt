What can you expect from a direct DVD movie? You know what you're doing when you rent it. The quality of cinema reminds me of the reality of television shows. Why are the shots always so close to the actors? And why are they always concentrated? There's nothing to look at. (And the actors are so great looking, so it blows.) <br /> <br /> Writing and dialogue is just awful. This intro scene, with British Guy is cheerful. Just try to listen to these words, barely make sense, just go in circles. The lines in the rest of the film seem to have been taken out of romance and science fiction novels, as if the writers had no idea what they were doing. Characters sound like they don't know what they're saying. This is a horrible movie. I feel bad for actors tied to this project. Embarrassing!
