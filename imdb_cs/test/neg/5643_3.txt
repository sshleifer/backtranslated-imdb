I couldn't believe the original rating I found when I looked up this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately, it looks like I'm not alone. The movie is slow and boring, one of the sad things is that if the movie got a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then expectations wouldn't be that high. Unfortunately, it wasn't so, so when I watched the movie and saw a bad story and playing, it left me a 3/10 score. Vinnie Jones is great at Lock Lock, and also Snatch, and he plays a big hard man, but he should stick to this role. It's a bit like Stallone and Schwarzenegger have made comedy movies, they just don't work. He can't even play a leading actor, he plays better as supportive or other. When he plays the lead, his acting talent is too "in sight" and turns out to be not very good. Another good example is the Mean Machine.
