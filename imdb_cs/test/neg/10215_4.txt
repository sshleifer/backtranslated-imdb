Remember, it's not, but it is. As a wee tot, I watched this movie in a theater (Be a huge match and a fan of Hulk Hogan). I remember from the night that we were the only ones in the theater and that I didn't like it very much. I pulled the rest off for good reason. Bad movie on par with greats like "Gymkata" and "The Pumaman", "No Holds Barred" is a high-stakes wrestling world. Well, maybe the bets aren't that high ... and frankly, I feel dirty when I call these people "professionals" for anything. And indeed, except for the first scene we can't talk about. So I think the film is about the marginally low betting world of amateur beating-c - *** - out-of-people. Sounds good, right? Hulk Hogan Plays Ripa, WWF Champion (Never to say that Hulk Hogan was written, that and movies like Thunder in Paradise showed how he opposed deep roles) It really pushed the limits of his talent . Basically he plays alone, but with a wardrobe that is more black and blue than red and yellow Hulkster. He also has a hand gesture he does. It's something like a sign of the echo of the devil people at rock concerts, except you thumb in the air, and you curl the index finger in. My friend claimed it was supposed to look like "R." Try and see for yourself. If it looks like "R" then Mars needs women. But as well, Kurt Fuller and his frit detector have a TV series on television with his slightly homoerotic heart trying to get Rip, who is apparently bigger than Elvis, into his network. He won't have any of it (and will get out of the office with a triumphant hand gesture to anyone other than the camera), and so the film follows Fuller, who is trying to raise ratings and get back to Rip. He'll do it when he creates a brilliantly called "Battle for the Hard Boys." A marketing genius, this guy. From numerous hand gestures to somewhat idiotic combat scenes (all played as if the game was very real and deadly serious) to exaggeration, too frequent shots. Hulk in nothing but a movie, this movie has everything you ever wanted in a silly movie. It's frivolous, not too taxing in mind, violent and includes the phrase "What is that scent?" "DOOKIE!" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> Classic for all times.
