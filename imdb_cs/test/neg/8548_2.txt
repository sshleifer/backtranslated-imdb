YOU BELONG TO ME (1941) is an example of "ScrewBall Comedy", which began in the mid-1930s and ended up post-war. Some of these movies have retained their status. Others deserved undeserved praise when they were initially critical and punching flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is the one that has a value that still sinks. Why can it be rooted in the script / story. It reflects the credibility from going to go, betting an excellent cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA, who is insanely jealous. He would be happy to sit with his million dollars and love her, he wants to keep his profession as a doctor. She wants to become what her eyes are a useful member of society. This conflict should entertain us. This cannot be saved either by the director or by the support cast. Errors in this scenario can be clearly laid on DALTON TRUMBO's legs. The character of HENRY FONDA is written in such wide strokes that every viewer has an immediate dislike of it. BARBARA STANWYCK just has nothing to do, but reacts to every idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO had to spend a lot of time outside the studio when he was a "useful idiot" and then he was at work. Apparently COLUMBIA didn't get her money for it, maybe ROBERT RISKIN should take over.
