My friend loves cheap horror movies, so I often get similar things to a low budget. This is, however, when I was first forced to write a review of ... <br /> <br /> Simply put, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! Worse than Boggy Creek II! <br /> <br /> It seems that the whole movie budget was spent on the short scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus stands in this chamber and turns all the vampires. Br /> <br /> The only good thing to say about this is that after a few beers it was merry (but for all the wrong reasons).
