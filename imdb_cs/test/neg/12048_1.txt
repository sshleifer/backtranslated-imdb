Who the hell is responsible for this terrible mangling of one of my favorite books? This is just awful. horrible playing, horrible font. The story is not even close to his old self - and what did they think? Robin Williams, for Gosh! This really contradicts the description. You don't see this. Not really. Not even for laughter. Especially if you're a fan of the book. This may be the worst adaptation of the film - everything is incoherent and mixed - characters that are important for understanding the sequence of events are seriously marginalized and every potentially interesting place from the book has been changed (example: Vienna - New York) into something deeply uninteresting. For those who haven't read the book - it's basically a fictional resume about a growing writer, exploring his writing, and so on. His mother writes an autobiography that is welcomed (despite her protests) as a kind of feminist manifesto. The book is well written, engaging and long. His prose is just beautiful. This film, on the other hand, is about Robin Williams, who tells us again to grab the day.
