Sending Critter into space seems like a fun idea, but was there really any need for a third film much less of this fourth? The movie with Brad Dourif can't be bad, right? Well, maybe in this case. This cheap sci-fi effort is returning to the sweet Charlie (reliable Don Keith Opper), who is about to eradicate the last two remaining Critters eggs when Ugh (Terrence Mann) tells him he is about to break a Trans Species At Risk law. So at Ugh's request, Charlie places two eggs in special holders inside the space below. Unfortunately for Charlie, the damn thing starts in space and is trapped inside. Smoke under his feet stagnates in sleep mode and he wakes up 53 years later in a crumbling space station like Captain Rick, with a fat cigar, harsh alcohol wickedness and greed to the core is tearing the space below trying to find out what possible news is inside possible sale or trade. Unknown to him, Rick releases two animals that feast on his body. You see, Rick and his crew found a space tray that floated and flashed dollar signs in their eyes so they anchored it. Ugh's reports (now in order, a prominent position as advisor) that money can be made if they document on a space station under the organization Terracor. When the crew lands, they find that this station is in ruins with many corridors in poor condition, but worse, the station is Angela's computer. Angela is a real thorn in the side of the crew because it has been without maintenance for a long time. It takes a few tiny tricks to open and close the door, regardless of lifts and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, largely impresario of computer functions (.. and is largely the true leader of the group because he is the weakest and most intelligent). It seems to be the father-figure of Ethan (Paul Witthorne) who wants his father to get down to find his father. Bernie (Eric DaRe) is primarily in the film to become a druggie victim. In the movie, Charlie, after one animal enters Rick's mouth and eats away at his throat, becomes a crew guide in understanding what they are fighting against. The film has some elements that I found somewhat confusing (or, for a better word, ridiculous) .. two animals grow fast, somehow are able to coordinate a ship for Earth, not to mention that they will grow in this lab on a huge scale. space station. The crew is able to connect to Dr. McCormick {Anne Ramsay, whose badge is in a coat thrown to the side Ethan reveals his access card), showing signs that Terracor was looking for a way to exterminate a kind of worlds and people. Knowing it bothers Al Bert who wants to leave Angel and her bleeding stations for greener pastures. Things don't work like this because well-meaning Charlie (partly thanks to Al Bert's "ancient" Colt .45) kills a creature that aboard, but hits several ship's main guidance systems when firing several rounds. So many fixes, but they stop them when Ugh and his soldiers attack Angel and prove they're not what Charlie thought they would be. Ugh is a changed man, and Charlie realizes he's totally evil and his mission is to protect Crity for the cruel nature (representation of corrupt corporate government types?). This betrayal is what changes Charlie ... maybe it has grown a bit (a little bit) and now understands that some people are just changing for the worse. Charlie and Ugh find themselves on the face of the animals. Will the crew be able to escape from a space station that has auto-destruction? This movie doesn't really use animals like the other three movies. I believe we can clearly see this as the real end of the franchise. The first movie was a shock. But by the time this sequel to the cam around, the animals just wore their welcome. Cast, however, give the movie a lift. The creators make a little living, but their plans for global domination are underdeveloped. Their role in the film is not based on the greatest heights. I thought you had a huge space station with unfortunate traps on board .. couldn't you take this idea and run with it? Unfortunately, no.
