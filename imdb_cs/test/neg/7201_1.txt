If that were possible, I'd give this apology an apology for ZERO. It was far worse than I had ever seen. It was as if it were a home movie that some bored highschoolers decided to make a joke. "Playing" was scary. The "actors" didn't even react to being murdered. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I bought this movie by mistake. The Spanish title was told by Jeepers Creepers 3, so I thought it would be fine. Poorly. It was honestly the worst. I haven't gotten that stupid movie in the last 20 minutes. I skipped chapters and nothing interesting has ever happened. The cameramen were also terrible. It was like a home movie. NEVER recommend anyone to watch it. Terrible horrible moronic movie.
