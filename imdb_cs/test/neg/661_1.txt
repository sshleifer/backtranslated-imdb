OK, start with the best. building. though hard to believe that it had electricity and running water after 35 years and fire, gruesome walls and odd items found throughout were interesting. other than that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> If it's bad, its done WWE movies. WTF? is that you want to see it? if anything, stay away. terrible, terrible idea for them to make movies and allow Gregory Dark to manage it. bad choice. previews were more interesting and fun. I can't even start discussing how bad this movie is. unreal actors and disappointed, vague story. apparently many of the actors are "all saints." his wonder why I never heard of them or their show. Other than the one, the bus driver, who you never see, just closed the door, had more action that only everyone together. at least he does stunts for some decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like to see scary movies, really. but this was blowing so much, the whole audience was laughing at him and cheering halfway. very annoying. the child was screaming for me more during the previews of other horror movies. This is not the film you would see, even less if you had to pay for it.
