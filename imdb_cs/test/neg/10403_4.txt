Stanley Kubrick, the director I hold in the highest esteem for his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, The Shining, Dr. Strangel, etc.), took the movie from circulation and left it to hardcore fans and completeists. After watching the movie for myself I saw why. At the age of 24, Kubrick has already perfected his static photography craft for LOOK magazine, and has made several short documents. Like many of the first filmmakers who came in decades after him, his ambition for Fear and Desire was simply to go and make a film, cheaply, more than likely to see if he could. He was successful at this level. However, the film itself is definitely not. I can't say the movie is a failure because I like it. Even, as the story of the film went on a side tour, and the actors (whom Kubrick had no idea how to drive, not be a theater man), his talent for producing and capturing some great images gets his seeds in this movie. Sometimes there are some close-ups and quick shots in the exciting action scenes that are interesting. Unfortunately, that's all good I can really say about the movie. Although there are several actors in the film (Frank Sliver, who also appeared in Killer's kiss, and Paul Mazursky, the director himself), the performances are generally boring and routine. In fact, this is the main extinction of the film for me; Whenever I watch any Kubrick movie, even his morning film noir Killer Kiss and Killing, I can tell who did it because his style then became clear, which would continue as he developed as an artist. It wasn't "artsy" as I might have imagined (which is usually the case with former directors like Scorsese and Spielberg), but watching this movie not only was that it wasn't Kubrick, but it was like a lot of that time when I watched some movie B (or even C) director that the time forgot - not quite 'Ed Wood' bad, but close. Music is the norm as far as possible, pedestrians disappear, and the plot does not seem to hold so much attention. In short, as others have said and which I can agree to, it is a "scribble" of a future pioneer who will show some shots and a few adjustments that will attract attention (the best scene is overall when soldiers take the hostages stupid girls), but not enough to really recommend, except those like myself, who eventually see everything from Kubrick (or maybe, must see every ultra-low budget war movie ever made), if only out of curiosity.
