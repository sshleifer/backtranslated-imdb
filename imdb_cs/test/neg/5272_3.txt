Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time, he is in doubt on other lists as far as big actors are concerned. He even got rid of the good Irish accent in Ordinary Decent Criminal. But Kevin Spacey, as a mafia leader? Or even a thief? I'm not so sure he could go that far. The movie just didn't make any sense to me, and some of the stories didn't seem to solve me. <br /> <br /> I know again that IMDb will make me ten more lines. But I'm not so sure what I can say about this movie because I'm still trying to figure it out. Stupid, isn't it? But I'm sure more than a few IMDb users were in the same situation as I am now, where do you want to say something about the movie, but now you have to make ten lines? Wow, that should do that. : D <br /> 3/10
