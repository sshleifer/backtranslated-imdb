'Carolina Moon' is an adequate film made for television about a girl with psychic abilities that returns to the city where she grew up and where her best childhood friend was murdered. It turns out that every year the same day, another young girl is murdered, and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, has to solve the mystery before she ends up dead. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is a female leader and does a very good job of supporting it with the rather delightful Oliver Hudsome and still light Jacqueline Bisset. The script, adapted from Nora Roberts' novel, is a bog-standard and a conspiracy <br /> <br /> is lengthy predictable. However, this is again compensated, as I said, rather excellent Oliver Hudson.
