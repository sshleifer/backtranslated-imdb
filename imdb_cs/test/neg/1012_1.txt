OK, I just flipped channels and caught DW3. I watched him know it would be waste. But ... as a man who has seen tons of movies, this is one of the most purely bad movies I've ever seen ... I'm not kidding. It's so bad that you have to look at it like a bad accident that can't be turned away. Sometimes these movies work, IE, Troma movies ... but watching Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson spoil it like it's painful ... What's even more fun is that I pulled out an IMDb to see what other people say and actually a score of 4.1 / 10 ??? I can't believe it happened around 1.5! Just as funny is it not even the top of this series ... somehow this waste guaranteed parts 4 and 5? And to top it all off, some dude comments here referred to it as the best of the series and its favorite movie of all time? Expression like this scares me about this world!
