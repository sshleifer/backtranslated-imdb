The subspecies take place in Romania, where two American college students Michele (Laura Mae Tate) and Lillian (Michelle McBride) come to study local folklore with the help of local friend Mary (Irina Movila). There they rent hotel rooms and become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle, it turns out that there is a powerful and evil Vampire called Radu (Anders Hove) who stole Bloodstone from his father King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm). The council chooses three girls and begins to drink Mary & Lillian's blood while Michele falls behind a guy named Stefan (Michael Watson), who happens to be a brother to Radu. Michele & Stefan decides to join together and get rid of the world of evil Radu ... <br /> <br /> Directed by director Ted Nicolaou, this film seems to be very well regarded among fans of genres and while it is not terrible, I would certainly not do it. t call it very well & i couldn't really see much to get excited about. Subspecies is a rather slow movie, not that it really happens, and while trying to stay close to a certain classic vampire tradition, it's all nonsense about Bloodstone and some small monsters that for some reason grow out of the Council tips. A subspecies could be half a decent movie, if not because it's boring, I don't really remember it, well or bad. The characters are fine, but some f dialogs are stupid and there is a scene that came close to me when the girls are in the castle ruins and one says they have to go because it's still dark, but it's still clear in the middle of the day & very light. There is also a scene where one of the American girls finds a coffin that is in the hotel's attic and doesn't really seem to bother being crazy, but he's a guy whose house I stayed in a coffin in my attic . Be very, very concerned if you know what I mean. I don't think I ever want to follow it again, there's no real threat, the plot is weak, the classic Vampire motifs mingle with the silly subplots, and I was clearly motionless. It's not the worst movie ever, but hardly the best. <br /> <br /> The movie looks fine with nice locations and some local scenery, although you feel that the look is more in the budget than in the creators' attempts to authenticate. There is not much gore apart from decapping & some broken finger tips. For whatever reason, the creators fit into some average-looking stop-motion animated monster that doesn't really do anything or is of great importance to the story. The production values ​​in Bucharest, Romania are in order and better than the multiple production of the Band. Acting is not great because many of the casts show lower performances, while the ordinary genre of Angus Scrimm has a small portrait at the beginning. There is a bit of style with several scenes reminiscent of the original Nosferatu (1922), especially the one that shows Radu's shadow appearing on the stairs with a long claw like nails. Subspecies is a movie that seems to me that for reasons I don't see, I thought it was on average the best and generally rather boring. Followed by Bloodstone: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998), and spin0off Vampire Journals (1997).
