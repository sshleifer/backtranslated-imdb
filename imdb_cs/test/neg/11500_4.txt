Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the best known comedy duo in history and deservedly, so I'm glad to see their movies. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in the hospital, and when nothing else is done, Stan decides to visit him and take some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy. Chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollie by the leg he can pull out, and he can pull the doctor (Billy Gilbert) out of the window, hold onto him and get Ollie on the ceiling. When the situation calms down, Stan gets Ollie's clothes, because the doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, which she accidentally left a nurse filled with a sleeping medication that comes into effect when she drives. (which you can say is done with a car in front of a big screen. Filled with some nice grotesque and not too bad (though repetitive and somewhat predictable) classic comedy, it's not great, but it's a black and white movie Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had number 7 Comedian Comics.
