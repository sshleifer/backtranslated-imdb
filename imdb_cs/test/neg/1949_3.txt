This is a classic B-type movie that you would rather not waste time and see. It started well and I thought it would grow like a good thriller, but I was wrong. For a long time, you have the feeling that something interesting will happen soon, and it will suddenly turn into a tense thriller, but that won't happen. It runs slowly and peacefully to the end, with nothing interesting in it. The end was unexpected and original, but that's all. Vote: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why is this film equally rated ???
