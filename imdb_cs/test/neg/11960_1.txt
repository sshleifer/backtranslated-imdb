1. The largest amount of money paid was on a bundle of hot dogs that they put on the guy's belly, the ones to be gut. 2. Ken Shamrock is in it. 3. Ken Shamrock will be destroyed. (He won't die, which is sad.) 4. He lets you want more ... aspirin. 5. The creators of the film are people who don't care what their monster looks like. "Just give him a $ 30 mask." "Good enough for me." 6. Scarecrow RUNS AND CHICK OVER. AMAZING. In fact, filmmakers don't make their actors sing or play guitar. 8. The Scarecrow uses a volleyball pole as a javelin and implants a dude who doesn't actually play guitar or sing. 9. Scarecrow can choke a guy in 3 seconds. 10. Do you really think about all these things and write them down to other people. God, what I do.
