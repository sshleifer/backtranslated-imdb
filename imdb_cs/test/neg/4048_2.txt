When I first saw it, I thought it was a joke. All I could think of was: "You get an 8MM camera, I'll get my little brother's monster toys, we'll make a movie!" Why would anyone in modern times like 2001 do a science fiction film like this, it looks like it was made in the early 1980s. With actors who are as woody as a cigar shop, this is a script written by the director's four-year-old son, a camera that was stolen from a burning bakery workshop, special effects of poverty, and to be turned off, a director who thought he would do that crap would make them famous. The end result was not spectacular, complete with torn dialogue and continuity. From Venus had to be fun to make, and I'm sure everyone involved had a blast with their stupid little movie. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 for a brave, hopeless effort. <br /> <br />
