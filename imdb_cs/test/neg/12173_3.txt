In the confusing film of Michele Soavi's dying zombie, Dellamore Dellamore, Rupert Everett plays Francesca, a caretaker in the cemetery where the dead will not be buried long. With the help of his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco deals with the problem of zombies in the graveyard either by shooting undead in his head or by splitting the skulls with a spade. Soon after falling into a mysterious beautiful widow one of his recently buried, Francesco finds himself busier than ever? After collecting some particularly favorable comments from some of the more respected horror officianados of IMDb, I decided to see what that fuss was. I just finished the movie and I can honestly say that I wasn't somehow disappointed with the horror movie. With his rough, confused pseudo-philosophical conspiracy and extremely poor performance from Everett's leading husband, Dellamorte Dellamore is an unpleasant and stupid mess that can't even save some harsh gore (courtesy of Sergio Stivaletti) and welcome unjustified nudity (from the bust of Anna Fialchi). I am embarrassed to understand the amount of in-depth analysis and discussion that this challenging blow received from its misleading fans.
