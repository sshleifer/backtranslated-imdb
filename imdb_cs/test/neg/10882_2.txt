Clearly, Raw Feed Video is smarter than all of us who have wasted money! They will make millions of video rentals and their low budget investments will pay off large, which will fund "Rest Stop II" (unfortunately). I think they spent a maximum of several hundred thousand US dollars to hire an actor, rent a place to stop, burn a truck, and pull a motorcycle behind a truck and pay for technical stuff. And it is done. We should all be as smart as these guys, I won't knock them for having genius to promote offenders in good cash yields. The space of the movie was good and it could have been an adequate horror movie, but it failed by not bringing a clear story. I've always been looking for a gem from beginning film companies, but I haven't found it here or you. I'm sorry I missed $ 3.99 plus tax to find out.
