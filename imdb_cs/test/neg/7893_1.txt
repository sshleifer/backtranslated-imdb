I'll be honest - a shabby purple airplane with Snoop Dogg at the helm is a fun visual gag. It would be a decent concept for 30 seconds commercial, or maybe 3 minutes of music video. But the producers have committed the age concept of the sin comedy by stretching 30 seconds of material per hour and half of the film, and the results are predictably lame. The rest of 89 minutes is filled with the typical gamut of racist and sexist humor and fleeting jokes, offensive and ... worst of all - painfully indecent. The gravestone shouted under the weight of its controversies. It is best to avoid being drunk or stoned.
