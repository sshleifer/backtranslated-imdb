... I normally hate puns, but this seems to be the only appropriate summary for "Barnyard." I suspect I'm not the first. And I'm sure many, many comments focus on the bull's idiots. I'm sure it bothered me from the bat. However, there is much more error with this film than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work. Personally, if I were a parent, I would be irritated by a violent turn that lasts almost at the end of a coyote clearing. (Though at least a little imprinted on me.) And from the normal point of view on the screen, you can expect coyotes to play a bigger role in the conflict (Gee's widow's widow). Maybe her "husband" was killed by coyotes ... No ... there's a lot of silly explanation.) And what kind of farm is that? Otis promises to protect all animals from damage, but it certainly seems that there is no threat to humans. They refer to a farmer who is vegan, but what is his pig? In all animal stories for kids - Babe, Charlotte's Web, you name it ... the reality of life on the farm has at least touched. Maybe our friendly farmer runs some kind of rescue haven (there is some reference to this, but it is never explained.) But all the farmers get in return is the abuse from the horse in the scene to be funny, but left me seriously thinking if he is going to close buried in a shallow grave behind a barn. And what the hell deal with "Wild Mike"? It was like a Gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without a ball gag. Add some truly horrible attempts at emotional scenes, almost complete lack of laughter and ALSO UDDERS, and you've got the worst kids movie I've seen in age. I generally just post on IMDb to emphasize a movie that is not so well-known slam current # 2 box-hit. But this movie upset me. In my local theater, it occupied space that could be used to make something fit. There was a lot of good family fun this summer - at least 2 other kids' movies were playing in the same multiplex. But I can't see something like "Little Miss Sunshine", so Viacom can cheat families for another $ 30. At least I had a free passage. I know that as a 35-year-old without children, this movie wasn't meant for me. But it's no excuse for such a lazy, frightening children's film as "Barnyard" in the Pixar age. I am bored with "Ice Age" movies, but they certainly didn't bother me like "Barnyard". "Shark Story" was a weak attempt at street hipness, but it had quite a bit of laughter. To do this, you could turn on Nickelodeon at any time of the day and see something more fun and intelligent - and therefore should be ashamed of his name appearing on this waste. I'm giving it 2 out of 10, only because Pip Mouse was sporadically funny, and Maria Bamford had a few fun lines as the wife of the farmers. Well, not a farm woman. Some other farmer. In fact, they didn't explain who it is. They didn't explain a lot of things. Especially not why Sam Elliot - the ultimate "male man" - had a spindle that was swinging there. Ghostly.
