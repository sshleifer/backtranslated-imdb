Although I have watched it on Italian TV some time ago, I found it to be a surprisingly tolerable potboiler, which this time was surrounded by an international cast of familiar faces (including the confused Joseph Cotten as a Baron) and, unlike many others, another film from the sub-genre Euro- Cult, randomly charged land instead of lethargic stimulation. Creation in itself seems a little polite, and Cotten is too old to be taken seriously as an eager scientist who is still roaming the life forms of the corpses (one would think, that they would become an army that couldn't improve their technique now, but Mrs. Neri looks good in costume and beyond, and reliable Herbert Fux seems to be the best of a lush grave-thief / blackmail.
