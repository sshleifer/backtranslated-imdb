I've seen many horror, splash, monster movies in my life. And of course plenty of monsters from the 50s and 60s. When I first came across this, I thought it was from the 60s until I knew it was since 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, Jack Brook's character is interesting and acting in everything is For the movie splatter pretty good, but .... I was expecting a splatter movie and not a drama story about an aggressive plumber. The film runs for 80 minutes and I think the first kill is after 65 minutes. Although it takes hours to explain the story the reason why monsters are coming at least 3 minutes ... we have another 20 minutes of boring dialogue and finally, in my opinion, it's not a well-managed splatter sequence. Even though we have Robert Englund in the lead role, I only recommend this game to real horror fans.
