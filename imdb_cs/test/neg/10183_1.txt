It happened across this movie when I surfed the canals and it seemed like another badly made Christian movie about The End Times (which I find fun because they take it so seriously). To be fair, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed a part about UFO and Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long before I categorized her as an embarrassing and frightening representation of the Christian faith, as well as a somewhat pathetic film in any artistic sense. As a film, the screenplay was terrible, the deal was moderate and the stimulation was bad. Cinematography and direction were subparpar: no interesting visuals, no layered lines, no creativity. Don't just try it on a budget - movies can be interesting even without special effects. It was not. Christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and non-originality in the artistic sphere because of their message. And the message was barely "Christian." <br /> <br /> ** Statement: The rest of this commentary is aimed at Christians ** <br /> <br /> First, it's unethical in any business of bait and customer change. I don't like to say that I can win a free iPod just to realize that I have to spend $ 300 in participating stores. Nonchristians don't like the fact that they are called to watch Sci-Fi and then bombarded with Christian propaganda, which has all the hammer fineness. Hidden agendas do not win any friends, much less converts. Second, you should not use obvious threats to convince people that your beliefs are true. The actors, who represented Christians, looked like insensitive, self-satisfied rapists when dealing with the skeptical "unbelievers" - even so far that they persevered to scare him into faith. Representative Dialogue: "Turn to Jesus - OR Go to Hell!" "Fine, don't trust me, but you'll be SORRY!" "On the day you die, I can guarantee that you wish to give this Jesus more attention - WHEN YOU ARE IN BELLY HELL!" OK, maybe I was exaggerating, but it certainly looked the same. If you think it is a "clear message for Christ", you are wrong. I do not remember Jesus through threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in it for fear. So, Christians, please do not use it as a "witness tool" for your "unsaved" friends. It is a cumbersome, offensive and inaccurate picture of the true Christian message. Third, theology was wrong. In addition to describing Jesus as a means of infernal insurance, he did not give space for discussion or discussion and did not attempt to question the question of whether there could be a UFO or extraterrestrial life. Instead, she offered one stalemate: "UFOs are a devilish scheme to fool people when they get ecstatic", which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most Christians. As the Bible does not mention UFOs or extraterrestrials, you cannot use it as a source to make conclusions in one or the other way. The trance is not necessarily a widely accepted, healthy biblical concept, although most evangelical Christians now seem to believe this because of the popular book series. If you do your research (as many of the supporting reviewers propose), the idea of ​​two coming Christs (first as trance) is a relatively new phenomenon in the Church's tradition, popularized by some evangelist travelers around the twentieth century. Most Orthodox Christians are likely to find that the message of this film is quite a big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported assumptions. Essentially, this film lacks a brand of valuable entertainment and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I wouldn't recommend it.
