He plays at SHOWTIME right now, but will be released as a movie called THREE or was released for 2006. Mess up contains a supposed naked body that comes out of the waves with the bottom. You can have fun finding others. It was a decent, strange, hungry, cold, crazy video, but that's about it. And, of course, what a film without sex would be. The lady has a nice body and the men are nice, but the story is the same as Swept Away or A Savage's Loose type with some blood. I was wondering if film studios know they made a big booboo and have already released this show and will now release it as THREE. Billy Zane should wear a tip or shave his head. Juan Di Pace is amazing and there are a few good sex scenes. There is a voodoo woman who loves the character of Di Pace playing and in real life her name is also Di Pace too. He is not aware of any connection, but probably a relative or married.
