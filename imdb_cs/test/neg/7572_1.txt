And abysmal, over-the-top gaming, you can enjoy this garbage flick. Apparently atomic bombs make life mutate about one day or two (or, according to other viewers, wake them up). Or it looks. And apparently a massive atomic explosion on the Spanish coast does not mean that anyone would ask questions. Thinking about conspiracy doesn't make any sense at all (why would bad socks puppets attack beacons?), So nuclear weapons go for no reason at all stand out too much. All right, when you do it, and the fact that a "monster" is a glorified thing you do from socks in a kindergarten, you can really do it. But once he fails to completely eliminate the gore deficiency, leaving the monster attacks in all their "naked" bare rock-bottom-budget budgets. <br /> <br /> I doubt you'll be able to watch it, so stay away.
