I live in Mexico City, so I have to suffer trailers for every piece of waste that comes from all these stupid Mexican filmmakers. Want to admire a Mexican guy for great movies? Look at something that Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devil's Backbone), or maybe Alfonso Cuar√≥n (although I don't like his movies, but I respect them). Mexican filmmakers often produce some of the most horrible full basket (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, American Visa), but this is one of the lowest points in Mexican movies ever. If you respect your brain, avoid this piece **** at all costs. It would be more intelligent to watch a wedding video or watch a reality show from Britney. This is more IQ than everyone in this 'movie'.
