Ever wonder what the worst movie ever is? Stop wondering. I'm telling you, Michael's it! It's not "gratifying," "fun," or "Travolta at his best." It's just shit. If I had children, I'd let them watch Michael Deep Throat! Sold out by John Travolta, washed out and bald by William Hurt, who is about to die at any time, Jean Stapleton made this movie from the movie. But wait ... you'll hear Andie McDowell sing! Yeah. Hollywood really is ** t all over us with this!
