Ridiculous, naughty doggerel with terrible action; unnoticed, superficially and condescendingly hunts all the banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, about divorce and middle age. The main actor grimaces his way through the film, trying to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulating self-regret worthless character and script calling. I'm sure the book was bad, but it wasn't that bad! The camera is permanently equipped with a reversibly yellow "Tuscan" cord filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't enough for the Tuscan?), Which they forgot to remove when the scene moved to Rome and (as imaginative!) On the Amalfi Coast. You have never seen the white marble of the Vittorio Emmanuelle monument in Rome, which looks so yellow ... Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, so it's worth a look.
