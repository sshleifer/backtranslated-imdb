This film has the task of "Welcome to the Jungle" and "Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" for total divine horror. You have the most irritating hero in the history of gore, who spends most of the time sobbing and lamenting and screaming - all the time in the most horrific toilet break that the movie ever took. Why spend so much time in this terrible bathroom from hell is never explained. Even if the usual murderer driver tries to murder her, she refuses to leave the flock. When a police cop comes to her rescue, the truck driver runs over the cop's legs while the heroine just looks. Instead of grabbing her weapon for protection, she pulls a poor pet into a flock and locks the door. Then the cop orders her to blow his brain for pain. He does it - while screaming and sobbing and sighing - and blowing the back of his head. Then - a cop, still alive, beg her to shoot him again because she's still in pain. He says it while the whole back of his head is all over the floor. Sobbing, sobbing, the heroine shoots him again. The film goes on and goes like this, nothing makes any sense. The heroine is so shameful that you want to kill her to get her out on her. I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, so it doesn't cost me anything to watch, but I still watched the movie end up so bad.
