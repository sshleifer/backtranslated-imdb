Yeah, he was a tourist attraction long ago. It's a prison now. Species. Well, it's more like an airport mixed with junior high school, but there's a lot of guys running wearing orange overalls, so I think it's like jail. Not quite. When Sasha, the figure of Steven Seagal, is taken into jail, she is in a bound state and goes to another line to talk to her boyfriend as if he were on the airport security check line. Then he throws strikes with his friend and beats a few guards before too long. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something. You attack a repair officer in a federal prison, shoot you in place. Ja Rule would have been shot about thirty times before throwing his second shot. Oh, and there are guys who wear beanies and bandanas and what not. In prison. Federal prison. You can't dress like that at most high schools in America. Speaking of the rule of Ja, I must say that the one who probably used his performance more than anyone else on Earth, including Ja Rule himself, must have been 50 Cent. Just before I watched this movie, I saw one of those shows on TV about the biggest celebrity disputes ever and as number 7 or 8 it was a rivalry between 50 Cents that lived a thieving life for real and Ja Rule. Who not. Every time I saw Ja Rule on the screen, the only thing I could imagine was that 50 cents laughed at his ass. Ja Rule looks like a stupid 9-year-old every time he appears on the screen. Anyway, get back to the conspiracy. It is funny. Sasha is an FBI agent who works undercover and agrees to be sentenced to prison to get behind a criminal organization. He is sentenced to five years and the old line between determination and stupidity disappears immediately. Nothing else in the film does matter, it becomes a nonsensical string of action sequences, most of which are not even well choreographed. Oh, how come the helicopter falls over the roof of "New Alcatraz" in one place, by mistake liberating all the prisoners. "And what are they doing? They had a ball, but it doesn't matter, so the scene is so stupid that they could also play hopscotch. So a man is condemned to be the first person to be executed in Alcatraz's execution chamber, apparently not because of the $ 200 million dollars theft in gold, but for not saying where he was hidden once he was caught. Hey, good thinking, people, if you can't get information from someone, kill them. This is a great way to learn the truth, so some gangs break into jail, where they plan to stop execution and get $ 200 million for themselves. Oh and $ 200 million is in gold bricks. I doubt they thought ahead how difficult it would be to change it to a convertible currency. <br /> <br /> There is also a prison warden's question. It's a hard talking vato who thinks he's a tough barrio, who reminds me of a joke. I saw the comic as he used to talk about people in California who talk all the hard jobs to each other and the houses and all kinds of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, says the comedian, and they are like, "Oh my God! People live there? That's like a total shack!" It is best if the United States Supreme Court comes to Justice and this man tells her that her men can't carry weapons inside the prison, "I don't care if he's a Supreme Court judge!" This woman might waste him like a grape, and he thinks he's in charge. Ha. By the way, the Supreme Court Judge, who is captured in the film as a hostage, tells the evil guy he is 53 years old. That's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was funny. The only good movie scene is the one in jail, where Ja Rule gets in jail as a bag of cotton balls of this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I saw in a movie for a long, long time. You know, I work for a company that made this film (why I watched it) and I can't say anything positive about it except, of course, for one scene with Ja Rule, how the Asian woman crying. So read my opinion on Malen and see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this film Ebert wrote something I agreed with, just like anything else What he wrote: <br /> <br /> "I imagine the MPAA flywheels to congratulate each other on a good day of work because they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13 after giving anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine 'an R. "<br /> <br /> The way to go, guys.
