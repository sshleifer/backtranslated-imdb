I read 'Scarlett' and expected it for the first time. I'm afraid I was disappointed. The film did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. One of the changes I didn't like the way Lord Fenton was portrayed. It made no sense to become a bad man. The way things ended between Mr. Fenton and Scarlett was very different, and their relationship was too intimate. There was also a much less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the film than was originally written in the book. The film sent two in two completely opposite directions and did not seem to alternate paths often enough to make love seem to be among them. Penalty film, but I believe it might be better than it was if it were a more true book by Alexandra Rippley.
