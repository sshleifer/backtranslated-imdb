This is one of those films where I took root for the one who could finish the movie the fastest. I wanted to see the cops kill Keaton and Garcia to do it. Basically it's an agreement - two cops have to die and the third must get horrible burns on his face to get Garcia's son to receive a bone marrow transplant from a convicted Keaton murderer. It's worth it? No!
