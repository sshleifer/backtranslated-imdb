This film is one of the worse examples of hype. People who read IMDb comments may be tempted to see this complete waste of time, as I was, by fake tag lines like "return to the 80s" and what not. This film sucks, from playing to directing to the story. Terrible, all overboard. And I really like GOOD horror movies, I'm not a snob at all. That was sucked. For information, I loved The Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Chaisaw Massacre Beginning, Others, Ring, Jason X, Slither, Planet Terror, and really hated The Ring 2, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Wolf Creek , the hills have eyes (re-make) Hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. Gore doesn't enjoy entertainment or originality.
