He saw this movie on Saturday matin√©e with a friend. The theater was about 70% full. Although there is a lot of funny stuff, it's rather a drama / tension with humor that is sprinkled on top. Robin Williams gives a decent performance just like Laura Linney. Being a fan of the Daily Show, Lewis Black is pretty good at it. Christopher Walken also gives a good performance. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly and stays around for the first thirty minutes, then the tense part starts running and keeps you on the edge of the movie. Tension in the supposed comedy movie? I know I, like everyone else in this place, fought a bit. The character would burst a joke during a thrilling sequence, and you would only hear one or two laughs at the theater. In all cases, after the film was over, there was applause. So certainly, some people enjoyed this movie. I've given this film four out of ten because I believe the comedy aspect doesn't work very well in thrilling / dramatic films and actors. Though not bad, they were just decent. Again, this movie is not what was advertised.
