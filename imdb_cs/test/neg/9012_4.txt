What wrath of film reviews is injustice - 2.1 on IMDb scale as I write. People, that's much closer to 3.0, I'll even go out to the limb and say 4.0 where I put it. Come on - how can you have a film about a static network surrounding the Earth's and extraterrestrial structures of amorphous cells, and not give it at least 4.0 for creativity? Then you have that great dialogue like - "Dave, look at the composition of this mud." You know, I don't think they ever returned to the mud. Regardless, this is the kind of movie for which film 'Z' movies live, and now I can relax. I actually saw it a few years ago without realizing it, along with Corman titles like "Giant Leech Attack" and "Wasp Woman". I don't know what can be a fascination, but quote a character from the movie - "Whatever it is, it works fast!" Back to the Alien Structure of Amorphous Cells - I like the idea of ​​a third competitor element against your standard red and white blood cells. When astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) returned from the dead, I had images of a scene that could have been the predecessor of the "Alien" of 1979, but it shouldn't have been. Instead, budget constraints limit the image to a plumed big bird, though this concept has been gone for nearly a decade. Who knows where one idea goes and picks up with another? Look, this isn't so bad. Not so well, but not so bad. Whenever you can connect astronauts with a landing crash with an alien being bound to take over the Earth, you have a winning combination. Throw in the monster cheese factor and you're on your way. Just remember - "An injured animal that's not big".
