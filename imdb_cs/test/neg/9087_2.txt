Whoever likened this to RAIDERS OF LOST ARK certainly knew where he spoke. He could also compare it to some of the hero's adventures that followed. "Kay Hoog" resembles more than a little Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (Shadow, the main man of secrets - and the very first "Dark Knight" - was also considered one Kent Allard. If someone were to take Savage's first name and add Kent to him, would you end up - Clark Kent, funny, innit? Like Indiana Jones, Hoog is not above stealing the artifacts of ancient civilization (although his thefts are often more glaring and less "charming chatter" than Jones). Unfortunately, this double-decker is far from other series (of any era) in terms of overall quality. One of the first signs that something is right is a scene in which desperados on horseback, literally breathing around their throats, simply watch Hoog escape their clutches in the hot air balloon. Why not bother to shoot a balloon is just one of the many mysteries that these two movies bother. The other half of this double-barrel is even worse than the first. It is true that it was one of the very first series and as such it should be shortened, but there are limits of tolerance. (At one point, capturing a hero on the screen, but in the story itself! Talking about cutting corners ...) Fritz Lang becomes one of the greatest filmmakers ever to make films; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, SPIDERS is a bitter pill to swallow ...
