The retro puppet master is a complete and absolutely perfect CRAP. Especially puppets look stupid and miserable. Acting was unforgivable and the story was grim. This film returns to the past where the dolls where they were first created are not a puppet master. .Retro Puppet Master is rated PG-13, the first puppet master to be rated PG-13. The film contains no horrors or tensions. The fact that this movie was a puppet master movie despises mind because this installment doesn't have buckets of blood, good acting performance, or any entertainment program like previous movies did. on TV because this movie is outdated, not violent, and absolutely miserable.2 out As a puppet master fan, I'm disappointed ... seriously.
