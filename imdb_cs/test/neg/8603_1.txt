Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail had some things to do with this movie, among them "watching all the way through his 82 miserable minutes, and I guarantee you shake your head and ask," Did we really come down? "Yes, if we have a film that testifies to utter cynicism, tasteless and moral corruption of those who make and make British films, this is an abomination." Tookey continues "headed straight for the oafs with unwashed underwear, dirty minds and the joints that graze on the sidewalk as they walk, this sexual comedy is so unreal, indecent and smelly, it's enough to get you rid of sex and really movies, for life "before it concludes that" Sex Lives of the Potato Men is not just a really ugly movie, it is characteristic of a new national culture of immediate satisfaction, yobbishness and sadism, which is now celebrated on the screen. "I normally do not listen to criticism too carefully, but in this case Tookey was on the money. the wrong, indeed, goes beyond being rude and entering a bizarre parallel universe, where every minute of the painful minute goes to an hour and where the definition of "hilarious" seems to be "to call tw * t in Brummie." It's depressing for anyone who has half the brain that grew up with Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, No Nine O'Clock News and Fawlty Towers. Ideally, Sex Lives Of Potato Men should quietly disappear after his release of the cinema and join the equally horrible Vix spin-off The Fat Slags (2004) and the All Saints Honest (2000) unfortunate celluloid cemetery, but it seems to be meant for endless late night programming projection and misleading "best movie EVER!" praise from people who should know better so I have to apologize beforehand for trying to correct the mistake that the British film industry has made in its wisdom to a world that does not deserve. Yes, I'm so sorry I took it from the celluloid dead, but in fact I remember thinking it couldn't be as bad as critics said it was ... ... but how God is mine witness, it was WORSE. It works - from start to finish, it's a special mention for Mackenzie 'Albert Steptoe's legs on the young man's body Crook. Soundtrack - Cut and paste 'ladrock', mostly ska-based lager-lout-friendly pub jukebox piffle that brought back horrible memories of seeing those chirpy cockernee doin 'lambeth walk on watering-down imitation special studs-shiners Madness on every single comedy / variety program in the eighties ... and 'Ace Of Spades' by Motorhead as Cover Music? What the hell is he trying to wake up the memories of one of The Young Ones' most amazing scenes ever, when he ever offered ANY comedy show? Cheap shot, under the belt. Scenario - Written by a 12-year-old who has just read every single issue of Smut and Zit in one long Red Bull session ... SURELY? Well, no real, proper, secular, adult man could put this kind of retarded pig on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in it ... Mark Gatiss ... the least annoying member of the League of Lords and Adventurers who participated in such a massive pile of flying movie excrements? "One of Britain's brightest comedy stars"? No longer! On the League of Gentlemen, somebody gives me a couple of lead diving shoes and Steve's face as a broken Pemberton rectangle and a long weekend in a soundproof room before I die ... PLEASE ... <br /> <br /> Cinema, British or other, just not much worse than this. Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes (1971) is a new wave masterpiece compared to this outrageous smut.
