Holy bullshit, the beginning rose where the first ended (good start). Then it goes down the hill. It looked like you were watching TV and continued to switch between this teen soap opera, the Predator movie, and some miserable detective show. The characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes have nothing to do with others until the last 45 minutes (soap opera characters and the real Alien story). Then, at the end, the manufacturers quickly ran out of money and decided to quit the movie so they decided to drop the nuke. <br /> <br /> PS- What is a camera shop? zoomed in, can't you say what's going on? Seriously, filmmakers are doing a good job of fighting scenes and doing it where we can see the fight.
