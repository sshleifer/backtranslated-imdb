He came across this film on Amazon.com. I have never heard of its release, but three reviews gave it five stars and enthusiastic reviews, so being a German movie lover I bought a copy ... <br /> <br /> I must say that I was not impressed. Production values ​​are cheap, the story is derived, characters are less than engaging, and for comedy it is surprisingly short to laugh. Or maybe I was expecting a more independent German film than gay spin at The Full Monty and casting stereotypes. There are pieces in the film that have no meaning at all, like one of the leather bears. is he trying to get Ecki in the sling - as if he looked at him twice? Or a vengeful ex-wife who appeared in the match, but she finally made fun of her estranged husband? Bunkum is not a word! At least that explains the UK title, I suppose ...
