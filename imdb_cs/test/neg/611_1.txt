I am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer, try to give a creative license to TV writers trying to explain the real story. This story, about Karen Carpenter, could help so much, but due to overhead and editing, no. The story, in this case, is not fully addressed if one reads psychological magazines. While Cynthia Gibb displays realistic Karen, it is sad that so much has been done ... Louise Fletcher displays her mother and does an excellent job with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I give actors credit for surviving this project. Why isn't viewers allowed to see causation factors? The American audience is pretty savvy, and if they have a cable, usually educated. I sincerely believe I could have written a better story, not modified the truth, and allowed the actors to project reality. Richard Carpenter, as a director, seriously underestimated and insulted the American audience. Karen's story is important and it's sad that we never hear him.
