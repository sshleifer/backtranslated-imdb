I'm sorry, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe that after making the first in the series they managed to get another budget. Not that the budget could be a lot - that's the least scary movie I've ever watched and laughed to the end (in fact, I can't believe we watched it to the end), but I think it's because we couldn't I don't quite believe that.
