O man, where to even start ..... <br /> <br /> drop the weapon to get in hand to fight the zombies while holding a buried soldier who is debating him to shoot him b4 he turns , then he turns and bites the man who holds him, turns his back on the "fallen" zombies, shoots his chest continuously and sees that it doesn't work, so they shoot the chest even more, with the idea that the boy collapsed on the table w / blood coming out of His mouth is still okay, strolling across a football field like nothing wrong, and then suddenly noticed that the zombie football team does anything in the middle of the field, as if they could not be seen up to this point ... > <br /> I could go for a few more hours, but you get a point ..... childish writing and dialogue, bad direction, horrible special effects, a really sad and undeveloped storyline (zombie infested campus, must get the viral host then lose. ... twice), the only plus I can find them that this does not include the actual game du ringtones "action scenes" .... <br /> <br /> id say don't waste money, but id is more upset about wasting time, i saw it on cable and I wanted 2 hours out of my life
