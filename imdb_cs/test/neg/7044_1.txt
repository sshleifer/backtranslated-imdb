Wow. As soon as I saw this movie, I wanted to watch it immediately because it looked so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood movies just because they're so bad that it will be fun (eg Koi Mil Gaya). This film had all the elements of a horrible movie: "a gang of local criminals" that is totally harmless, a badly made motorcycle scene, a terrible dialouge ("Son of Congratulations, I'm very proud that you are a Bad Boy"), actors play basketball as if it were good, horrible songs ("I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad bad boy"), inexplicable plot lines like why they are good guys and friends of Bad Boy ??? And why is the hot girl in love with the nerd? I've never seen such a badly built story with such horrible stories. In fact, some scenes took up to 30 seconds, as well as where good and bad boys inexplicably run over a "gang member" poker game. Congratulations to Ashwini Chaudry, you're a bad director. If you want to watch a good movie, watch Guru, if you want to watch a movie so bad that it's really fun, then watch Good Boy, Boy.
