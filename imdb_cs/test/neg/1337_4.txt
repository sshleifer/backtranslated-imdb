Updating Clare Booth Luce and the 1939 movie is a big disappointment. The cast of women is excellent, most individual scenes work, but nothing stands together. There is no connection between the scene and the scene almost as if the film was created in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. He has given the story of a woman who deals with her husband's infidelity and how her friends help her and is now less shocking at the age when divorce is so common, but at the same time as always, wishing they could join all Pieces together because as it stands now you really don't feel pulled along the plot. Wait for the cable.
