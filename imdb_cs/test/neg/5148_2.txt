***** Spoiler Ahead ***** <br /> <br /> I guess you shouldn't expect much of a TV movie, but this was especially bad, the plot was a good idea, but poorly done, acting it was not particularly good. And the end of the movie was just terrible. The main character was absolutely normal throughout the film, and then suddenly, when we found out he was a killer, he turned into a mentally handicapped psyche. It's totally pathetic. This film, Yasmin Bleeth, is really just one reason we didn't see her in a swimsuit? Don't even bother watching this waste of time if you want a movie about the beauty contest world, then watch "Drop Dead Gorgeous" instead, it's just an infinite number of times better.
