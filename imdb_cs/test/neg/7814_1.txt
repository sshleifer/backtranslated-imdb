This film must be about one of the worst I've ever seen. Humor was rude, barely funny and was heard a million times before. The beginning was unique and worse as it went on. I got in half and couldn't look at it. Luckily, I just watched it on TV, so it didn't do anything, but I strongly recommend that you not waste your time or money. There was nothing new in the movie. The characters were not developed at all. In fact, I think it would be better if it was a small children's movie in that it was full of stupid unrealistic "funny" events ... that's something going on at home or something. It doesn't mean he was home alone, he was in any case so terrible.
