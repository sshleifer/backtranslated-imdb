I just saw this movie on TNT and let me tell you that this movie was downright sneaky and cheerful. But after a while I started laughing at my socks and telling you the truth, they should classify this film as a comedy rather than an action / adventure. The most entertaining scene comes when Delon and Kennedy loop 360 to avoid the French rockets that Wagner ordered to destroy Concorde. Our intrepid leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot the flares out of the window to stop the missiles looking for missiles ????? Stupid but funny --- kicker comes here - after one shot, dizzying gun fails and Kennedy tries to fix her in the cockpit and well ... if you want to know what happens to keep the movie. The silly parts of this movie include a total lack of conspiracy ---- yeah to have some action for 25 minutes to land in Paris and go ONE HOUR with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. Now you can switch to the saboteur for ten minutes, then the unnecessary rest of the film and the plane that visually disintegrates and PASSENGERS ARE NOT ALSO ONE WORK BEFORE ONE EYES !!!! --- final rating for this move --- (1/10) of 4 stars if it was an event of 2 out of 4 stars if it was a comedy
