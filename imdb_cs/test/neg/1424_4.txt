As Ben Elton once observed, nothing happens faster than comedy. Steve Martin's latest offer - 'The Pink Panther 2' - has recently opened to bad reviews and unfortunate players at the box office, while Mike Myers' 'The Love Guru' apparently won several admirers. In 1970, it was again Jerry Lewis when he felt a painful rejection (ironically, his character in this film is experiencing a witty turn whenever someone uses that word in his presence) when 'Which way on the front '? he has effectively taken him out of the big screen for almost a decade. In this second world comedy, "Brendan Byers 111", the richest man in the world who wants to join his patriotic duty (and also because he is bored when he is successful), is refused because he is unfit for health. Then he decides to start his own private army, recruiting another 4-F. He performed with absurd uniforms that look like the ones that 'International Rescue' wears in 'Thunderbirds'. Some good visual gags here. When they launch rocket launchers, they look pleased with themselves until they realize they have just destroyed a Texaco oil station! Brendan, who wants to learn German, plays a long-playing recording called "Songs to Mein Kampf By". When this army sits down to eat, instead of being in the hanging hall, they are in a lavish room decorated with a chandelier. John Wood is very funny as' Finkel ', Byers' ever - English servant. His best scenario is when he blackmails a mafia-type gangster to teach Byers Brigade to kill. The screenplay was not Jerry himself, but Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso, author of a series of episodes "The Monkees". The "front" often has the look and feel of a TV sitcom at a time when you almost expect to hear laughter. Where it is wrong, in the last thirty minutes, when Byers will replace the Chief Nazi Commander, and after ordering the Germans to quit, they will engage in a plot to kill Hitler (and Tom Cruise). is nowhere in sight!). As commander, Jerry adds the power of such a mind-numbing numbness to resist the description. He gives Brian a blessed run for his money in "the loudest man alive." It comes as a relief when final credits appear. Maybe timing was just bad - bringing out a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict raged was not a good idea. Or the public just had enough Jerry (the beard probably didn't help!). What he needed here was a good producer, someone took it in his hand and said, "The gag stinks. Throw it out!" "Don't raise the bridge, the Lower River" is a masterpiece compared to this picture. In the 1970s, the new comic icons became Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty. Python - Fresher, more scathing and in Allen's case, more human comedy styles replaced Jerry's slapstick brand. It would not be until 1982 that he would do something like a successful comeback - as a purported talk-show host of 'Jerry Langford' in the brilliant Martin Scorcese 'The King Of Comedy'.
