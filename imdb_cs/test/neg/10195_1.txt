How horrible is it? Let me calculate the ways: 1) This is a bait and switch movie that starts with a UFO investigation and then turns into a high-pressure work for Christianity. Come on! If the filmmakers felt so strongly about their message, why cover it? It bothers the unbelievers and pushes the fence in the opposite direction. 2) Not a good sales pitch! If the characters in this swing asked me to go to church with them, I'd run like hell in the opposite direction. They're scary! 3) Acting is terrible. They all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace. 4) The camera is bad. Wait, actually not good. 5) Bad, bad, bad script. All dialogue, no action. Like a tennis match, it bounces back and forth between the "talking head" ups up. 6) Direction ... what direction? There must have been a director somewhere. I urge you to find out where. Believe it or not, I have some positive comments on this movie. The adjustments seemed professional, but they couldn't change. Good adjustment of bad material is still a bad movie. The opening theme of music was actually very good! Very scary and UFO-ish. Too bad the movie wasn't about UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you can't say that, here's the bottom line. I lost my money when I saw this movie and it made me angry. If they didn't hide what the movie was about, I could say it was my fault.
