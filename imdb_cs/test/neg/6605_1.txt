Yes it is true. The movie is a terrible piece ... you know what. Almost all Sapkowski fans in Poland think the same thing. The truth is that Polish cinema cannot afford to produce fantasy films. It's a shame to compare, for example, "Wiedzmin" and "Conan Barbarian". I hope that no one outside of Poland will ever see this nightmare.
