This film was absolutely and unequivocally terrible. The story was so predictable and boring, and the screenplay was so clever and pretentious that I wanted to stab the closest to my eyes at the end. I don't normally write reviews, but I was impressed by the number of positive reviews he got. While I admit that acting was fine in some parts, the shortcomings of the scenario prevailed over decent behavior. The only reason I watched it was that a few of my friends watched it and represented it as the most likely movie ever made, according to the trailer. We were not least disappointed. Her only saving grace is that she contained my new favorite pickup line: <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I want to meet you. <br /> <br /> GIRL: You want to get into my pants. BRANDON: I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation. Overall, I would rate this film as the worst movie I've ever seen, taken seriously.
