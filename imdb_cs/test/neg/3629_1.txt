Zeoy101 ?? Indeed, it must be one of the dumbest attempts to get people into my age group's attention. It's a preppy girl named Zeoy and her friends attending boarding school. BORING!!! All he ever does is whine and complain and behave like a spoiled idiot. I remember that this show was released in 2005, I was 13 to 14, and even then I thought it was useless. The only episode I liked was when the boys hid the camera in the girls' dorm. AND IT IS DONE. By the way, I just don't understand why Nickel-Oh my bad-Nick feels the need for a syndicate of this excused bad excuse for "fun". Serious this decade is becoming a joke every year and it's the worst and the worst. What's with this generation ??? By the way, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998? / 2005?
