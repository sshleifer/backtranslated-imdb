Woo, talk about terrible. Don't waste your time. I wish I could see the first comments. I have to admit I didn't follow the whole thing. It was too awful. Worst, most capable dialogue ... I could go on and on. But what really made it unnoticeable was the direction. Poor actors. You can't even tell if they have any talent because they don't just have pathetic lines to talk to, but the director gave them no action. If you look at the director's filmography on this page, you'll see why this film didn't have a chance. It wouldn't be good if it was for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> Ouch!
