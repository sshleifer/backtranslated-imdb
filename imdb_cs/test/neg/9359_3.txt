I heard good things about the "States of Grace" and came up with an open mind. I thought "God's army" was fine, and I thought the Dutchman had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film started with some shaky acting and I thought, "Well, maybe it will be better." Unfortunately it never did. The image is based on the performance of two older - Mormon missionaries - and the viewers seem to be familiar with them and take care of them. Instead, the story falls apart into a very unlikely series of unfortunate events that emphasize the obvious disobedience of missionaries (something that undeniably exists but rarely at the level borne by the Dutchman) and becomes almost laughing. Only Dutchman's success in this film is his successful alienation of his target audience. The unrealistic and inaccurate portrayal of the lives of Mormon missionaries does nothing more than the anger of its predominantly Mormon audience. The film does not in any way reflect reality. The missions are nothing like what the Dutchman shows (when I myself served the Mormon mission, I can confirm this) and the life of gangs in California certainly contains a much clearer language than the occasional mild vulgarity. The conclusion that I suppose he was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to everyone was incredible (c'mon, the whole mission is gathering to see that this older sent home - and mom and girl stand next to each other!) and cheesy. Next time, Dutch, try to make a movie that SOMEONE can identify with.
