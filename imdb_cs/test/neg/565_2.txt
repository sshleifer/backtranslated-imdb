Committed fate and glomerulus Peter Watkins moves around the pond to take over the American justice system around 1971 with this invaluable piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far that it still falls. Watkins is a pure tourist when he assembles our gang tragedy with clich√©s of freaks, hippies, and black revolutionaries opposed to happy lucky cops and the army and a kangaroo tribunal consisting of dissenting calcified adults making a bad fashion statement. Discuss the revolution. <br /> <br /> We have a radical anti versus corruption system in the criminal park because the criminals convicted of crimes have a custodial sentence or a three-day trek through the Penalty Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course, law enforcement officials who follow their path will not play fair and, in combination with the suffocating heat, the fate of our protagonists looks sealed. The punishment park has elements of Kafka in both the environment and the theme. The rehearsals take place under a large canvas tent, where the inmates are screaming in defiance of hardcore love or leave a group of inquisitors (such as members of the Silent Majority for the Meaceful America) who growl back. Neither group spends much time listening to the other, and driving sometimes insists on teenage parental battle over the keys to the car. Mostly it's just one side that says what's wrong with America. Meanwhile, the Park of Punishment Martyrs encounter an endless dessert, while cops with weapons act like twelve years. It's something that looks and feels some of my 70s when we were younger and knew more than we did. Peter Watkins has always been on the side of losers and an ordinary man against what he sees as a corrupt powerful. Culledon was a strong charge of military atrocity in the 18th century Scotland that still resonates. War The game is a crude sober view of the nuclear consequences that should be required for all. Penalty Park also has a value, but for a reason other than the intended. Today, Watkins's vision is a textbook example of the left in full tilt of paranoia against the culture of the 1970s, and given the times (Vietnam, Kent State, Chicago 7), such a steep hysteria seemed not so great a distance from the truth. But 35 years later, the fever has subsided and the Punishment Park with its unlimited narrow view is a pretty stupid ride.
