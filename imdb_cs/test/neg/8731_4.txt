I suppose I should take something like that with salt. These lab films (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the lab) always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that the only people who fooled themselves have uncovered a secret beyond anyone's understanding. Of course, they will pay the price because their experimentation has the same drawbacks that Dr. Frankenstein. There is always something they have not anticipated. There are many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous covers that don't work here. The young woman is certainly charming and the doctor can't help but be a little discreet or even try to hide what he's doing. Things go wrong, and thanks to that reason, they get immense power, including understanding how it came. Rock Hudson looks pretty good. But he never does this in this role. He travels everywhere with a lot of clich√©s and stupidity, which reduces the underlying problem. Once he has revenge, it will be more convenient for her to leave and seek her out and destroy her in some great way.
