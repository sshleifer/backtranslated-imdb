To this day, Malcolm McLaren tells everyone stupid enough to believe him that the Sex Pistols was his idea and that the band members were his puppets to be used to make him money. It's a good reason he does it, and he's a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some real facts. McLaren was really approached by the band to be a manager. , not the other way around. The pistols were good, organic bands and were not created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. Rotten and Vicious also returned. This is what led to the unfair criticism of the Pistols in those years when they were compared to made boys' bands. * The band and no one else wrote songs, recorded them, played live, created publicity and provided interviews. McLaren did not start the incident Bill Grundy. The guns only appeared in the program because the queen pulled out. According to the band, McLaren crouched in the back if the arrests were to be made. Johnny Rotten came out of the band. He wasn't fired. Some of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers came from McLaren's praise at The Great Rock & Roll Swindle. This would suggest that McLaren is not too bright despite its influences. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * McLaren boasts the money he made from the band. If he were competent, he could do much more. He seems to be doing a lot of concerts. McLaren's claim at the beginning of a film that made punk rock can be refuted in about ten seconds. Pistols were not the first punk band, just the most distinctive profile. This is a horrible movie. The only parts worth watching are real band footage, later much better use in 'The Filth And The Fury'.
