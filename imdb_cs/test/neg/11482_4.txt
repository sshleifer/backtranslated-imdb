I expected much more from this movie. The preview looked interesting, so I decided to check it out. The bottom line is that "The Adventures of Sebastian Cole" had only one decent thing: Adrian Grenier. I like Grenier and his performance is very nice. The character is well designed, but everything else just stretches throughout the movie. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think his character was explained too well. I don't think it's too much to explain; she wants to become a woman. Something was still missing. <br /> <br /> The visible low budget movie was nice to see. I liked the fact that the film was filmed only on the screenplay (wrong in it) and just a few actors. It was a nice change. While the main idea of ​​the movie was really fine, it was disappointing to see a lot of scenes that had nothing to do with it. As I said, the screenplay looked promising and I must say that I was wondering where director Tod Williams was heading, but basically it was a very slow movie without too much dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" at the end looked good, but again fell back into the hole. The behavior was mostly good, writing needs some work, but the film's budget has helped it for a long time. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to somebody if they want to watch the peace. a movie with a strong lead character, but different than staying on. Personally, I wouldn't see it twice.
