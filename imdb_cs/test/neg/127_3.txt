I like science fiction and I'm willing to deal with it a lot. Science fiction films / televisions are usually underfunded, underrated and misunderstood. I tried it this way, I really did, but it's a good TV science fiction like Babylon 5's Star Trek (original). Silly prostheses, inexpensive cardboard kits, decomposed dialogues, CGs that do not match the background, and painfully one-dimensional figures cannot be overcome by setting "science fiction". (I'm sure there are those of you who think Babylon 5 is a good science fiction television. It's not. It's clich√© and not inspiring.) While viewers in the US may like the emotions and character development fi is a genre that does not take seriously (cf. Star Trek). He can deal with important issues, but not with such serious philosophy. It's really hard to care for characters because they're not just foolish, they just lack a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to follow. The creators of Earth know that it's a waste, because they always have to say "Gene Roddenberry's Earth ..." otherwise people wouldn't watch. Roddenberry's ashes have to turn in orbit, because this blunt, cheap, poorly groomed (truly no-break observation brings this home) trudging the Trabant show show into space. Buoyancy buffers. So kill the main character. And then bring him as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas again.
