A wide range of snake phenomena rising on the tourists "attack" their island due to their captain's ship damage. Some of the remaining survivors who are not caught by vulnerable snakes will attempt an escape mission, aiming to flee to available ships that can safely get them off the island. Presented Directly with Injection Batches Visual humor with lots of serpentine gags, Wayne Crawford's SNAKE ISLAND features plenty of different slither breeds of predators, in remarkable standing, ready to attack their prey. Star star William Katt, as an author of the snakes on the upcoming novel, is having fun in his role, along with writer / director / co-founder Wayne Crawford (as a ship's captain) as a traveling hero staring at the crisis. Kate Connor is an attractive love for Crawford, a lawyer on vacation. Other cast members serve either as tourists or crew, mostly feed for snakes. As in many other films of this type, director Crawford presents live snakes with computer generated and violence is really tame. Crawford even included the camera-view technique of the camera as the eyes of a snake facing potential victims (with the actor looking directly into the camera). They should never have taken a serious, tongue-in-face approach was probably the best way to shoot SNAKE ISLAND because the assumption is just too ridiculous to accept on your own. Effects and tension scenes rarely work because Crawford is often unable to successfully stage sequences where people face snakes. Snake attacks themselves will also never happen on the screen (.. one or two vertices), or are so limitedly presented that they leave little impression. This is no-no for such a genre. Katt fans will probably want to check it because they provide some facial comedy that determines the overall tone of certain scenes where they have to defend themselves against snakes. CGI scenes, where we see a large number of snakes in the general area, are not very effective, which would eliminate the realism that Crawford tried to create. There are plenty of better horror movies featuring snakes as aggressors than SNAKE ISLAND. Surprising moments of nudity, pushed to the scene where tourists and crew relax after a long day of bubbles, do not know the danger ahead.
