A 1940 cartoon, banned nowadays probably because of the 'black beauty' gag, in which Daffy rides a black person as if it were a horse. The whole story takes place in a bookstore where the characters of the book come to life every night. So we have Ugly Duck (Daffy) and the Wallstreet wolf. They end up in pursuit after the wolf tricked Daffy with a fake duck (hence the title). And chasing them is all that is in this little cartoon that has no real challenge today. Just fun if you're a real Looney Tunes fan I think ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
