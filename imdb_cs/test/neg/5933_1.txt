Lou Gossett, Jr. is an excellent and captivating actor, but to take him as a "president" and then act like him James Bond, running around carrying a gun and entering the warehouse to reveal a plot to kill Christians and then be able to escape the supposedly high security device to live another day, does not do justice to him - this movie has so many unresolved issues <br /> <br /> I will try to mention only a few: <br /> <br /> 1 - what was the purpose of "accumulating" the vaccine if no one is vaccinated? - for example, a preacher could be vaccinated if the "troubled force" already had the vaccine at hand - later the wife of Williams's wife gets with a sick preacher and she herself becomes ill; was the virus contagious? - If it was contagious, then why did Ray and his wife get to church without proper protection? - Why didn't they become sick? - and when Chloe drank wine and was "cured", how did she suddenly know that wine was "antidote"? - Was it California wine, an ordinary red table wine? - Could Red Grape Juice be adequate - and if the preacher had accepted a "community" at least every time he preached, might he already have a flowing body through his body? - Buck and Chloe got a "heavy" vaccine box that was never used - what mysterious message should we see in it? 2 - The performance of the "evil" forces working with Antichrist Nicolai to destroy the world as Russian, Chinese, etc. is truly a relic of the 1950s and early 20th century. The James Bond era and shows ignorance of modern society and humanity - should we believe that the Russians and the Chinese are constantly trying to destroy this planet? - and for what purpose, mere destruction? - It was such a narrow look at this world, and he was so clich√© to be Laughter. 3 - The main purpose of this movie was a scene almost at the end, where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett, Jr are proselytizing non-believers in the audience (by showing Kirk proselytizing Lou) - it was a movie without a meaningful story, too much disconnects from reality, and a totally awkward plot for a great actor <br /> <br /> That's why I included it as 1 because Zero isn't available
