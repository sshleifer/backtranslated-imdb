Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), a pretty adopted daughter of a recently deceased Japanese entrepreneur, inherits control of her father's company; her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), miffed that he was not abandoned to run, orders a hit on his niece. When chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) slips into the wrong hotel room by mistake and throws out the hitman Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is mistaken with the killer and sent him to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls on a pretty heiress and ends up promising to protect her. However, she is kidnapped by Kazuo Men while Kensuke is taken to play the arcade game with Cop Daniel (Sam Lee). Uncle Kazuo holds Yumiko in a hypnotic trance and takes control of the store, but runs when his gangster friends threaten to reveal their illegal activity if they don't allow them total control. Meanwhile, Kensuke teamed up with two martial arts experts, Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo), who hunt Invincible. He learns Kung Fu and tries to free Yumiko. A mixture of widespread grotesque humor, scary scenes and battle scenes, No Problem 2 is a disappointing film with regard to talent: the 80s kung fu superstar Yuen Baio a few fighting scenes but these days is a bit of acrobatic; director Kar Lok Chin brings the kind of silly parody I would expect from the Scary Movie; Jung Yuen resorts to ridicule his character in Operation Scorpio; and Sam Lee? Well, Sam Lee is as annoying as ever! On the other hand, Collin Chou, like gangster Ben, impressed me; He has apparently a strong presence on the screen, which Hollywood has not seen since he has played in two Matrix movies ever since and will soon appear in D.O.A., directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed by Wakana Sakai, but for a very different reason: this beauty is easy to see and should go much further into the film industry. What movies are parodyed, but after 104 minutes I found that this film is a real pleasure to sit. If people are pulling funny faces along with silly sound effects you will burst your sides laughing, then no problem 2 might reach you. Otherwise, I'd leave alone.
