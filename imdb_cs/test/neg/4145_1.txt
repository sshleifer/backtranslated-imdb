Unspeakable launches in Los Angeles with Jim (Roger Cline) and his wife Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll), who guess how they drive after the rain, unfortunately Jim crashes the car and his daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) ends up dead when Alice turns to vegetables bound to a wheelchair. Destroyed by the death of his daughter Jim begins to visit prostitutes, then kills them for the voices in his head. Erm, that's really. Written, produced and directed by Chad Ferrin I hate Unspeakable as a movie. There are some movies that occasionally see that moving 'wickets' as it was with regard to everything you watch afterwards, some movies are so brilliant that all others will be judged by it, while others like Unspeakable are so bad, that sets a new film minimum. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen & I'm seriously surprised mostly by the positive comments on IMDb, although I'm not surprised by the low overall ranking on the main page, I'm not sure if something missed me for starters. the story and much seems almost random. There was nothing in the Unspeakable that would interest me or have fun, and as a result, it became a test of perseverance to get to the end. The film is trying to be shocking with some limp scenes of the sexual abuse of a bounty boy by a priest, there is a scene in which a disabled person falls apart, an icon appears on the floor, and her irritated male nurse begins to feel her dirty genitals, legs and underwear. If anyone can find such a crap fun then I'll just cut my wrist now, the character is a few of the worst I had to know about the disaster, the dialogue is merrily bad with some that sounds like it came straight from some dirty bassoon porn of the worst kind. It doesn't work like horror, because it's not scary in the least, it's absolutely cheerful and frankly insulting to claim to be a serious drama about someone who has suffered a great deal and tries to cope with it and overall I think it's nonsensical, rubbish, Poorly made piece of crap from Troma. Director Ferrin movies like some badly made documentary, special effects are terrible and are out of 'let's pour tomato ketchup on the face of our actor & face viewers will be convinced they have died a bloody death variety, except suicide when someone holding his own knife in his mouth, there is no graphic violence. Due to the amount of prostitutes in the Unspeakable nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum ... <br /> <br /> Apparently Unspeakable had a budget of about $ 20,000 & all I can say is where did all the money go? A quick note for filmmakers if your sound recording makes sure you don't have your actor to release their lines next to the highway, which probably half of Los Angeles is rising ... period. The unspeakable is totally bullshit in my opinion. It's probably not the worst I've ever seen, but it's down there and I can't remember seeing such a horrible film recently. One to avoid if your masochist or insomniac.
