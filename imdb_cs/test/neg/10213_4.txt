Hulk Hogan plays as a wrestler wrestler (real actor ...) called Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his greedy girlfriend who wanted to sign him for his network (because the match is selling!) Rip Drops, the net gets the circuit to fight the championship called (and I'm completely serious) a "hard guys battle" who is champion Zeus (played by Tiny Lister Jr) possibly the deadliest man alive. Rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and into the hospital. No Holds Barred is pretty much what I expected from Vince McMahon's production of the least versatile actor in the action genre (Hogan); In other words, it is not unlike the match itself, so I give it a fair assessment mainly because everyone who rents knows what they are getting. The movie is inexpensive but well made for what it is, and really match fans will probably enjoy it. I myself found that it was cheerful in the end. These are moments of such absurdity that you just laugh. (So, as Hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limousine, forcing a guy to coil and of course the way Hogan lectures from his cuecard.) Barred Holds is a lot of fun, true, though it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is. ‚ÄùCamp fans should really enjoy this smart slink. <br /> <br /> * * off 4- (fair)
