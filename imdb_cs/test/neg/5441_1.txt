After a series of successful 'Man and His Monkey Films', which included the key "Every Which Way But Free", "Every Which Way You Can" and "Friends of Peter", the genre fell on difficult times. In an effort to rejuvenate this once-celebrated area, director Frank Marshall brought Michael Crichton's acclaimed novel on the big screen. Do you think 'Gorillas in the Mist' meets the 'Tron' minus the box office of Bruce Boxleitner. It is one man sentenced to a love affair for his talking monkey. He did not help him with bad accents (Tim Curry fights Romanian), baboon scenarios, hungry hippos, primate paratroopers and Bruce Campbell. Ape-Sh * t.
