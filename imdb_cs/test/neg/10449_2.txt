The plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder, who is a real bastard and wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately, it can't. Yeah, and he's haunted by the memories of his mom and dad eating megalodon when he was a kid. The man will meet some scientist who is quite hot, and they and this crew of about a hundred people set off on the mainline submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents. The shark in this movie is really a fake-looking CGI shark. Basically it is sorta like Shark Attack 3, besides more depressing. if you don't get what I mean, listen. The opening films of the film show the "home movies" of the main character when he was a child with his parents before they were killed, and there is a really sad and depressed piano music playing in the background. you expect to see a shark or something and you. the short shadow of a CGI shark floats around every few seconds, but that's just it. I also don't remember one happy facial expression at all during the film, most of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story gets even more boring and all the characters (also shark) die at the end. I thought Sabata could kill the shark and manage to save himself and the girl, but no, they all die and the film ends with a shark, they all blow up, and the submarine (with Sabato being crushed and burned in it) sinking into the abyss. If you are a happy person and do not like depression, avoid this film. If you're the opposite, congratulations, you've found your movie.
