This "movie" and I say it easily is nothing but pure waste. I'm sorry for the people who actually wasted money to see it in theaters. I saw a friend from the film and since then I regretted it. As a black woman, I'm embarrassed to see it. What's more, I am extremely terrified that people from other races have seen it and could believe that it is the behavior of blacks in general. It is full of stereotypes against all nationalities and sexes, terribly vulgar coarse jokes and lame monsters who have been harassed by somewhat familiar African-American comedians who were better off after reading this scenario! I must also mention the numerous rap and hip hop singers / rappers who fill the film as if it were too long a music video - there was absolutely no place in the movie. I think it was "chewing and singing"? GRAPES. "Writers", producers and those who were stupid to fund this "film" should be shot or locked in the room and forced to look at this crap for the rest of their lives. DO-NOT-WATCH-THIS-MOVIE !!! It is a waste of time from life that you will never get back.
