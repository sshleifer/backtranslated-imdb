Yeah, I bought the blood in the camp, unnecessarily about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money for this crap, I think I didn't expect an amazing movie, judging by the front cover I didn't really expect anything big but at least no boobies in first 3 seconds (i'm not complaining about goats ..) i complain what the hell is it to do with something? This film should be held there by hand camera at home as a joke .... suck .. Why was the blood more brown and ugly than the real blood? ... cheap I say ya think everyone was not in color was just colored yellow, and the other thing that made me die to laugh this sad apology for the movie was the fact that they were trying to pretend that the clown was a woman all the time, even though his bright flat chest black short hair man. ..did someone else noticed that the only special effect in this movie was a slow jump .. it was also a bad oh and dissolution effect that you can find on many basic PC programs like ... powerpoint .... it movie wounds
