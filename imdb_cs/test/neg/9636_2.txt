This is the type of film that is loved by 50-year-old teachers and people who consider themselves socially aware - but they really have no idea. Actors - I think they're all amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of clich√©s and stupidity that they can't save it. Kids Work On - Bringing back all your worst memories from game classes at school. The lyrics to one of the songs resemble something like this in the morning: "I'm a dwarf company, an emotionally mutilated individual." <br /> <br /> Please!
