I went to see "TKIA" with high expectations, which could affect my opinion on it. I've seen all the Dogme movies and this TKIA is by far the worst. The story mingles with themes from Shakespeare's play: King Lear, but never fails to capture and care for the audience. The directing of the actors is very loose, even for films in the Dogme style, and leads to poor undefined acting. The story lacks any dynamics and I lost interest very shortly. There are some scenes in the movie that can shock the viewer, but I don't think they can improve the story at all. Mifunes sidste sung and Festen are both Dogmefilms, which turned out to be well directed and had good stories, so I'll look forward to better Dogmefilms in the future. Maybe Aake Sandgren's "Invisible Man-Dogme 6" turns out to have picked up the quality again. For it is like Vinterberg and S.K. Jacobsen is a skilled and educated director.
