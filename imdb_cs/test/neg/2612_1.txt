This seventh (yes, you read right - seventh) Puppet Master movie shows how demented a group of dolls came into being; a French puppeteer who uses them to avenge a group of ancient mummies behind him as soon as he learns that he holds the secret of life. The wizard taught him, also on the run, before he died. He used this power to bring normal puppets to life. This sequel is basically nonsense, sprinkled even more nonsense, like most of the puppet master's continuation. We have no fun puppet murders for PG13 rating. Think about it, there are no damned puppet murders. If there were one series that would have to be cut off, it would be one. Nothing more .... God, please no more ...
