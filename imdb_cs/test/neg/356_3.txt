Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Master Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented role as curmudgeon seems to be forced and even uncomfortable, rather than funny. The film itself overflows with macaroon sentiment. In addition, the viewer has numerous references to religious beliefs and patriotism in the US, which are reflected more as worship than authenticity. Clifton Webb does the best with bad script. Edmund Gwenn plays another jovial clergy and has nothing in common. The management of a child actor plays a hopeless child who has a flat effect throughout the film. His only claim to fame as an artist is apparently a bullfrog-low voice unusual for someone of his age. However, once you have heard it, you have heard it and you do not have to hear it again. Unfortunately it is in most movie scenes. I find this child so uncomfortable that I move quickly when it appears. Given that she has a lot of scenes in this movie, it means that a lot of the film is moving forward. There were and are so many talented actors; it is a pity that this film has nothing in itself. Yet Clifton Webb is in a traditional hat and shorts with a wide rim that is worth seeing.
