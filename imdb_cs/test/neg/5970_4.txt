My mum and I went to see this movie because my brother is serving in the American Peace Corps in the same region he is set up in. In the middle of the film, I decided that since it failed to measure what it pretends to be fulfilled, this title is challenging. The topic he deals with could mean an excellent documentary, but given his bad execution, he left much less education on this matter than I hoped it would happen. I agree with laura-jane from Canada ("executive report but lagging behind."). I also agree with the user who remarked that the style of this filmmaker's narrative is the opposite of what Michael Moore has, but I do not agree that he presents different perspectives and invites the viewer to decide for him. I agree with one user's comment that "the lesson is learned better when we draw conclusions ourselves"; however, our conclusions cannot be anything but poorly based if we have little relevant information to draw from. The main points of the document seemed to be that 1) The African people who live near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer greatly. 2) The introduction of perch to Lake Victoria, caused by Europeans, has destroyed its ecosystem. 3) The villages surrounding Lake Victoria are financially dependent on perch farming. The best things I can say about the film are that they tried to combine the mean people's perspectives in sub-Saharan Africa, which unfortunately is an anomaly between the films, and that it was trying to portray poverty rather than a dysfunctional economic system than universal, inevitable phenomenon. I liked the irony that caught the massive amount of fish leaving the land from famine. I appreciated the display of how U.N. As with all documentaries that do not have the word "women" in the title, this film does not do a good job of representing the voices of women - most interviews are in men. Maybe I'll have to watch the movie a second time to capture some of the key points I may have missed, but I couldn't reveal Sauper's theory of the relationship between the introduction of perch to Lake Victoria and the unfair living conditions of nearby Africans lake. In addition, I might be wrong, but I thought Sauper could improve his interviewing skills. Not only did he ask the questions he asked and the answers he contained, they seemed arbitrary, but they seemed to have a real talent for being uncomfortable and uncomfortable. The most urgent development of the film is the suggestion that the perch export now acts as a mask for the import of weapons and that the real economy that overcomes Tanzania is war, not fishing. Sadly, Sauper avoids conducting a thorough revelation of the idea (or at least a conversation with a reporter who apparently knew what he was talking about in relation to the import of weapons) and cope with the "decide for himself" approach <br /> <br /> If Darwin's Nightmare were supposed to dispel the myth that the world's first exploitation of the Third World gave them "a chance for a better life", it didn't do a good job. If it meant how the US and Europe arms industry was responsible for many armed conflicts around the world, it didn't do a good job. If it was to portray what drives people to prostitution, it didn't do a good job. If it should illuminate U.N. to do his job, it did not do a good job. If it was said that poor Tanzanians earning from perch is not worth the human cost of rooting with Mother Nature to create a profitable product, it did not do a good job. If it meant that Tanzania would be much better if Europeans never came, it didn't do a good job.
