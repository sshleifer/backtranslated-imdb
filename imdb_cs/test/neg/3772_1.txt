This film is incredibly confident in nature, which assumes that the mere impression of the story is as good as the real story. It was painful to watch, and if I wasn't married to buy a DVD for John Travolt and a positive buzz, I wouldn't do it carefully. and it seems to rely on serious (and frankly, cumbersome) characterization. Between Purslan and Bobby Long there is one scene of quarrels in which television is destroyed when it is out, it is incredibly flabby and badly timed. he watched. It was probably a very fun, wise film school to make it possible. But it's terribly boring to watch. You shouldn't waste your money on a lenient and pretentious film school project.
