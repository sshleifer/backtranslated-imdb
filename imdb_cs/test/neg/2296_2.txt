Calling this movie for a decent or pleasant horror tribute is too optimistic. Damn, you can't even talk about it as a nice spoof of the genre because it's below average (it's funny, but not "haha-funny, you know). Anyway, all the people who complain about this movie here in their comments, they just blame when you see the DVD cover of this movie, you should know it's not going to be on the same level as "The Piano," so don't complain about it ... Evil Ed might be something I suppose the main idea of ​​this film is to criticize the growing "cutting committee" in today's horror that shows editor Edward, who is slowly (well, not too slow) going nuts by seeing all the violence and gore in the movies produced by Big Boss is named Sam Campbell ... Funny, right? I was also expecting a character named Bruce Raimi, there was no urprise, anyway, this guy got rich by making "Loose Limbs" movies ou equipped (and I am kidding!) Scenes in which the girl is raped by BEAVER (?) And then gets shot in the head by bazooka !!! Now, who says the horror is no longer original? <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe with all the gore and 'free limbs', but it's really very boring. After a decent first 25 minutes, Evil Ed turns into complete boredom and never gets out of it. The only thing left to do (except for the eject button, of course) is to look for an obvious amount of reference to other, much better horror movies. I've seen scenes apparently stolen from The Evil Dead, Silence of the Lambs, Braindead and several others. And there's a huge amount of classic horror posters on the wall to admire as well. Evil Ed finds out that this is an origin in Sweden. I am convinced that there are a lot of talent, far north (as an example, take Danish "Nattevagten") ... but none of the talents has joined the cast or crew of Evil Ed. Just to see if you're in a silly mood and don't want to use your brain at all.
