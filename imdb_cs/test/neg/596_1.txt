Evil Behind You, was created for a specific purpose in mind, shoving writers / directors personal opinions on who either gets to walk on the water or who gets to dance with the devil. Sadly, it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point of view that they are power away completely by the power of feeding their point to the viewer. The Way His Message Is Presented Almost reminiscent of the stories I heard about the Spanish Inquisition! From one real Christian to another, Avoid it, such as plague, a fear tactic never works when trying to send this kind of message !! Negotiations were terrible, the choice of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair (they are terrorists, so they must be Muslims). The assumption was good, the story provided a great message for his message, but it was the implementation of those thoughts that they had lost, so it was very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speak. It would be better if you got rid of your old Ghost DVD with Mr. Swayze to get this message better. at least the film wasn't trying to shove his throat. Or if you like good Christian movies with a strong message, try "End of Spear"
