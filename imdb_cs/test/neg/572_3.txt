The film about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on the ear should be fun, romantic and fun. Instead, this film is more about things that have not been said and have not been expressed, so it gets to the point where you are grateful that something is said, even if the dialogue is not exactly citable. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> When the relationship that says the most is the one that is least visible on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you have problems. But these two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie that screams for some real people. THE END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> Capshaw's job is to create a character from not much and is not entirely successful. As I said above, it seems that the topic is repression and I understand that it is an element of life and love, but I don't even want to see a movie about it, at least not this one. I can't recommend it, despite the very talented cast who take care of themselves.
