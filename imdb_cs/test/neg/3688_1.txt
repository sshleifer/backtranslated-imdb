This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it's the worst. I wonder why he is shot mainly in the dark, and mostly with Vincent Gall, who is leaving the camera or looking down? Because he doesn't want to show his face for agreeing to be in this movie. I liked his earlier stuff, but the conceit of "Brown Bunny" and then the cast in this drivel knocked him into a peg in my book. And Val Kilmer? Actually, I want to send him a sympathetic card. "Doors" to this ??? In fact, the casting was the only reason I watched this movie, and Val doesn't show up until the film is more than halfway. Just a sad movie.
