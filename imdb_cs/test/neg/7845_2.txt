This movie was terrible. John Wayne is occasionally a brutal actor. The lead woman playing the role of "Maura" did a good job of trying to make the scenes believe, despite Wayne's inept, one-dimensional, over playing. Seriously, did you see him when he was supposed to talk in his sleep? Ridiculous. And his character became such a terrible person in the second half of the film and then did nothing to undo his behavior, and is still forgiven, including his arched nemesis, without being as far as "sorry". The story was totally unlikely. We should have believed that two adult men, both tremendous accomplishments in their respected areas, would have been busy working and risking the lives of innocent men simply because they didn't like each other? You can, to a large extent, randomly choose any scene and it will probably leave a shaking head in disbelief that someone has paid the money to make this movie. It's too bad, because the only other Wayne movies I've seen are the shooter and Rio Bravo, which were both great movies. If you're not paid, don't bother to watch this.
