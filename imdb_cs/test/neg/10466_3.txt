Another Indian legend you've never heard of before is released. As the name suggests, it's a vengeful wraith who likes to absorb people's skeletons when they're still using them. As usual, the ancient burial ground (you can say, "Poltergeist?") Have been disturbed by clich√©s greedy land developers build things. CGI, if it was better, could have the effect of a more treacherous look, but saved on the budget, and it shows - the comic effect. The senseless creature should be kept off the stage during the first few killings - that could bring some secret or threatening doom atmosphere - but the awkward director decided to show us what it looks like in the first five minutes and it wasn't impressive. Deaths are only badly done, again with a delicate CGI. I think ancient ghosts always kill using cheap special effects. As for the "victims", they seem to laugh at any time while they make goofy screams. It is always clear who gets it: a character with a few lines appears, strange sounds are heard, CGI dots fly, characters stand out. Repeat (several times). Yet there are several chase scenes that contain a monster that actually watched this thing. The director seems to use them as a device he can return to (so often used) when he can't think of anything but his characters can do. Overall, it's pretty stupid, but I've seen worse. This movie is cheap, but it's weird to watch.
