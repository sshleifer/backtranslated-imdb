While the film was beautifully shot and acted well, the script was boring. torment and nothing we haven't seen before. Never in this film have I ever received the feeling that these people are really in danger. No noticeable climax and very standard resolution. I believe these types of films have been exaggerated and should rest. After all, not everyone on the planet sees "Schindler's List"?
