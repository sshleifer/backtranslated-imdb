This film was made by the largest producer in Costa Rica. Though their authors praise it as the biggest Costa Rica movie they've ever done, and their actors even dare say they didn't get an Oscar Nomination because of its political importance with oil (- on, right) ... Well That's all lie. This film was allegedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera on a love triangle (the theme of super cliché of soap opera), and his side story is about an oil problem on the Atlantic coast in Costa Rica with an American oil company that wanted to explore oil deposits in the region, but at the end it was never approved by the government. Now he can have some nice shots about the beaches, but that's it; nothing bigger than ... it's all in the camera. Most actors are lousy, except two or three. The rest of the lack of sense of what acting means: it overcomes most of the time. The story is quite common and clichés, worthy of cheap Mexican soap opera, as I said .. because the crew advertised as a protest film about oil, but 80% of the film is based on a silly love triangle. The script is nothing overwhelming, it's very simple, and the dialogs aren't too imaginary. It also has some trouble adjusting on several scene changes ... but besides, it's pretty decent. The director had a good job, I think he's not like Oliver Stone, but he did his job with the resources at hand. I'd like to question him why instead of using a costar actor, he spent most of his money abroad. I think that after all they boasted of being 100% Costarican Production ... that's what you expect. The end is not well done, there are errors and details that do not match or are useless. Besides being the most sophisticated film in the history of Costa Rica, I think it's average. You can make more interesting and better pictures with less money. I've never heard of "Pi"? By the way, if you're wondering about Costa Rican or Central American movies, it will do that, but you're definitely missing.
