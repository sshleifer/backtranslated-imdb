That was a character movie. The plot was not so hot when it was there, but the characters were interesting and very well-functioning. The story focuses on the Travis family as a result of the oldest son's suicide. I say it freely, because the story is mostly about the surviving son and mother, because if the father had a story focused on him, they changed the film badly. The negotiations in all parts were very good, especially Emile Hirsch as the surviving, confused son. The characters were very interesting and I didn't mind watching them until the late movie when it seemed to be pulling. But my big complaint was a story. The son himself was supposed to be the center of the conspiracy. It really wasn't. It was something that happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything went every way. Then they mentioned that the son had been killed to remind you that it was the main thread. The second thing was that the big conspiracy of the twists were never really explained or built, but only there they were accidentally thrown and often left. All right, the end was very, very cool. But it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (half that was not padding) was largely raised from the story in Pearl Jam Alive. Which reminds me ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" in the movie, allegedly written by someone who killed himself. I couldn't be the only one who knew that the poem was canceled, word by word, from the same song. I don't know, this was a movie that I had hope, and really, really dropped the ball.
