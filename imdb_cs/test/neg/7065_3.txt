This film begins with an interesting scenographic design and a promising premise, but it does not provide iconic movie goods. It is set in a bold parallel universe where everything is owned by "Blump" Corporation. It is a terrible stand-up comedian who finds success when he grows a third hand from his back. <br /> <br /> All the potential for big cheese is here - washed out by 80th star Judd Nelson, Wayne Newton, offbeat visuals and strange conspiracy, obese women in meager underwear, necrophilia - but it never pays off. <br /> <br /> Stimulation is a major issue. Every scene is explosively slow. Nelson's stand-up routines are supposed to be funny because they aren't properly funny. But every performance runs until it's tangentially funny, just boring. Imagine someone telling you the longest, strangest joke you can imagine, full of smirks as he thinks it's funny and weird. Imagine that after a two-hour tiring period you never hit. You've just saved your dark backward trouble.
