The film starts well, has something to do. About 1/3 of the movie stuff goes down the hill. Carrey starts to sit around number 23 because he sees it everywhere. So what? This is not the reason to go nuts and start writing things all over the body and on the walls. The act of playing his son is bad. Since returning, as soon as he hears his father's obsession, he jumps on the train and is hysterical about it. Absolutely incredible. I hope I never see this kid again in another movie. It's a waste of time watching this movie. Grab another. Boring piece ... well. The number kills him? Give me a break. I'm not going to spoil your end, but let's just say it's just as disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
