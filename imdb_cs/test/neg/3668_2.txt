Incorrect, misleading, dark, endless insanity due to the high-gloss MGM A-budget finish. Kate Hepburn plays a bride who comes to suspect that her rich, handsome husband (Robert Taylor) is not a dream she married, but a psychotic killer. MGM's attempt at Hitchcock's thriller is condemned from the outset to the torturous, confused, ridiculous scenario and idiotic casting of Hepburn as a threatened woman who is afraid of her life (who could imagine Hepburn afraid of anything?) Louis B. Mayer forgot to say Vincent Minnell that he directed a thriller, not a musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum, who is also a good man, retains his dignity in quiet, unobtrusive performance. Karl Freund is a respectful cinematography that creates scary beauty images - and has been wasted on the wrong movie. Result: Metro "Parnell" 1940s.
