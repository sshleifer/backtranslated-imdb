I have read all reviews of this direct video. I agree that the film is not "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact". However, if you're looking for a way to go through ninety minutes, it's a movie that is bearable. I started watching the movie early in the AM class when I was doing some geek stuff. It was very nice because I was able to switch back and forth between what I was doing and watching the movie without missing it. It's a predictable movie and acting isn't for some of the actors (eg Dennis Hopper) up to par. But I must emphasize that I only paid $ 2 (US) and how old the saying goes: You get what you pay for! If you're looking for some profound meaning of the movie that will have to watch it over and over again, then it's definitely a long video. On the other hand, if you're looking for something to go through, then there's nothing wrong with Tycus (which, incidentally, was called "Comet: Final Impact" in Mexico, where I found this video).
