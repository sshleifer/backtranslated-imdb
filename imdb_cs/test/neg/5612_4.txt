Rutger Hauer helps with a film that can basically be summed up in a young person who finds himself in a category and rather so needs a lot of help. a movie that could turn into Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's too bad because I really got to the top. Then, like the opening soundtrack, it went from big and interesting, basically nowhere. <br /> <br /> It's fun with plenty of attractions and interesting characters. I'm sure it will be enough for many people. The problem is that everyone feels inventive and empty, which should be ironically the main discovery for self-realization of the character. Not the film itself (it's not a film that recognizes itself), but that character is supposed to recognize his own life is fictional and empty.
