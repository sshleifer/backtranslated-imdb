There is not much to say than a lot of Wire-fu and supposed Sholin monks ego-tripping over Kung-fu and a cartoon of a Japanese conspiracy to take over China. All this would not be so bad if it were not a completely false Japanese sword fight. If you watched Samurai or two, you can say that "Japanese" fighting in the movie is just the same "Kung fu" (really circus acrobats) who do the same things except the Japanese sword. However, there are a few fun moments like when a Japanese woman Ninja pulls her clothes off in mid flight to disarm a monk and catch him with a fishing net. It seems to be a bit of schizophrenia if it should turn out that the Japanese should be utterly despicable, or if there are exceptions. The "Japanese" protagonist is shown as very honest but not beyond ruthless cruelty such as when he assassinates a pacified monk so that he can have his duel. Pretty disappointed with a very stupid end. It does not even give a moment to the appearance of the idea of ​​an epic battle.
