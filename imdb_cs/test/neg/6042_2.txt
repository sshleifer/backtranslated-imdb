Someone said that WEBS is a lot like the SLIDERS episode, and I have to agree. Spoilers: I never liked the Sliders actors, and I rarely saw it, except when there was nothing better. WEBS is a kind of movie to see if you have other options. Read the book. WEBS has those types of TV actors that appear to be part of the PROBATION or Work Release program. Some low budget movies have actors who at least look enthusiastic. The WEBS actors seem to receive a paid minimum wage and work on the clock. They have such a desperate look as "Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce". The queen spider looks great except that it is rarely seen, and there are no other spiders (and no sites). Queen Spider bites people, and they become Spider Zombies, which means they're trying to keep WIDE OPEN's eyes when they attack people. All people fight among themselves for a variety of reasons and are not likeable. After meeting all the "people" I would recommend a magic character school. All that WEBS felt to me was APATHY. I was numb to the characters and hoped for interesting gore and special effects. Gore was minimal and special effects were reserved for the ugly queen of spiders that looked good. If WEBS had a lot of Spider Creatures who ate people, it would be fun. Apparently they could only be "spider zombies." WEBS is a sad entry into SPIDER-oriented movies. It can qualify as the worst Spider movie ever, because eight-Legged Freaks had great special effects.
