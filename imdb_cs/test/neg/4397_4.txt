This film is best described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. How many vaguely humorous misunderstandings can you inject into one movie? Notes are wrongly placed, bags are changing, conversations are wrong, people are mixed, situations are misinterpreted, and somewhere along the line people are supposed to laugh about something. The writers are really trying to keep everything going, which makes the dialogues really enforced. If someone in this movie acted like a real person, everything would be solved in about two minutes or so, and everyone could return to their lives, but they must leave a misunderstanding. Sometimes this movie also tries to go for some teenage laughter, but all of them are doing to remember how funny "American Pie" was. The nerd scene that told a hooker (who thinks he's a foreign exchange student) to "eat his sausage" lasts forever, not a second of that funny. I have to give this movie some credit: because of the subplot of stolen money, it's not as boring as it could be. He also has laughter here and there, but unfortunately he returns to another misunderstanding. Overall, this film is too lame.
