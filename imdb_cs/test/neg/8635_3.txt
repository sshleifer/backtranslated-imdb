The original version of George Sluizer, The Vanishing aka The Man Who Wanted to Know, offers one of the quietest disturbing sociopaths of European cinema and one of the most memorable finals of all time (blatantly stolen by Tarantino for Kill Bill Volume 2), but has plenty to offer. Playing with the chronology and reversing the usual clichés of the standard “lady disappears” graphs also offers excellent characterization and strong, under-played but convincing performance. Unfortunately, I can only assume that when it came to Remake, Sluizer was so determined that no one else would get a chance to destroy his film when he could do it alone, but few could anticipate how complex it will destroy its own work. His career has never recovered from this disastrous journey. The main culprit is Jeff Bridges' stunning performance, which has been thought out in every detail at a really catastrophic level. A friend who produced one of his earliest films noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor if you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this movie is proof of pudding. Every movement is precise mechanically, making it look like a rusty toy watch, while its voice is a bizarre blend of Tootsie, Latky Gravas from Taxi and Dalka, who all enjoyed an epic lesson from Dok-E-ville. No banality of evil here, just looney walking around with an invisible sign overhead and saying, "Please. Leave me. I'll kill. You. Thank you. For your consideration." But the blame really needs to be shared here, none of the performances is good: often, nor do they look good? Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than an upset man at his wits ending up in the hurrying scenes at a gas station, Nancy Travis flounders ill and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession.No to give them some help either by the director or writer Todd Graff, who is particularly weak, the chronology has been changed to focus on Bridges at the expense of couples opening the film, the rush in which the film is located, draining the life and character of every scene in his race to get to the next place . / low mood swings in a couple relationship or seemingly casual, but careful positioning, we get just a few arguments that give you the impression that it is probably better without it when it comes to a new and improved happy ending tent dard woman chased by a nutter in a threatening forest stuff complete with lame 'Let's end the joke like a TV cop show' moment ??? best to go there? which is the advice that applies to this entire train. Even the shocking and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this.
