I watched it after I saw the "Death Tunnel" (this is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life), so you can understand that I went into the eyes to see the directors and producers of this movie jewel responsible for this. At first I thought the director and producer were the same. Both are Kid Rock meets Dawg the Bounty Hunter. I looked at the TAPS investigation and I am not a skeptic - I think TAPS is closest to what will ever get into the science of the industry. It was cool and believable - I believe they are being persecuted. But this, like the aforementioned reviewer, as a tour. Well, tour, all right, but "investigators" and "group leaders" seemed to make a nice penny and have a financial investment to make it scary or not, so when they have fantastic stories, I have to take it with a teaspoon spoon salts. As someone else mentioned, I could tell what they wanted me to see about 50% of the time in the picture. The rest of the time I couldn't make out anything. Also, with no relation to photos - daytime, camera type, room humidity, dust particles (which 75% are what the balls are), weather and other factors I can't accept, I can't accept them. Also, I can't help thinking that some could be supervised. Why would the band keep the door numbers? Vandalism? Also, during the TAPS investigation, they tried to dig up the death certificates of these nurses - and only found one that was controlled "accidentally" (people did not want to officially declare suicide). But when one of the guides mentioned it, he said, "Yeah and his suicide." It really feels like guides haunted houses here in October. However, DID I like talking to patients and staff from an old hospital (s) who really gave it a lot of perspective and personal contact. I am also glad that they mentioned that employees have the best intentions, and were not some ghoulish-wardens. They weren't the best methods, but all they had. They desperately wanted to stop the disease.
