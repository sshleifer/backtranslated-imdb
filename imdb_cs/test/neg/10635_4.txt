How could a film dealing with illegal Mexican immigrants who have been robbed and defeated over the border be boring? Well, the "border incident" is. No wonder the song and dance man George Murphy's career ended long after this horrible movie came out. Politics was certainly a way out for this future senator, who would die a terrible death in this slowly changing movie. Film stereotypes of a typical Mexican migrant farmer, as they are shaken and terribly boring. The film only intensifies as Murphy and Ricardo Montalban's identity has emerged as federal agents for the US and Mexico. . Disappointment at best, we see similar problems in our own society today.
