I was looking at Cheats a few years ago with my boyfriend. He made him a great funny movie that is one of the best comedies ever. I think he was on crack or something. I recently learned that this movie was not released to theaters, I understand why it was perfect. The basic chart includes a group of guys cheating almost all their school assignments to get good grades. This is the main problem with this movie is that morality is bad. There are other teenage comedy movies where students do bad things but it is most often things that do not happen in school. So I think the concept of having a whole movie, which basically has kids cheating everything, is bad enough. I didn't like the characters in this movie either. The main character guy is a totally smug arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist. Actually, I'm not sure if you could say there is a protagonist because everyone is cheating at school, which is bad. Other supportive characters weren't funny at all, and they basically throw wounds in this movie. This movie has bad news and worse acting and characters. There are other teen movies that are much better than this movie. So you don't have to see this and that's a good thing because I don't recommend this movie at all.
