Oh, how much is this movie! I don't know if it's a horror or a drama, it's a story, and both genres aren't very good! The story doesn't move, it's slow, boring and sleepy from start to finish. This movie really bores me! But I really enjoyed working with the camera, it's authentic, fresh and clear, acting is also great, the little boy was great in this movie, but he didn't make me jump from my place. But this film makes me catch a pillow, lie on bed and sleep until the credits come back ... <br /> <br /> Boring! It's not worth watching! I tell you, this film is sucked! <br /> <br /> 1/10
