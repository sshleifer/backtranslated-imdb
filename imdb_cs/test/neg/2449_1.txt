Before I saw this masterpiece, I'd never know that a devastating and outrageously contagious virus could be defeated by the use of Lutheran prayers ... and "erbs". The performance of Ralf Moeller is enormous; realism glowing. I was so inspired to fly straight to Zambibwia tomorrow to release pesto and take my hands to the Third World prosperity. God bless this film. Seriously, I have to watch Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty just to believe that it is possible to think of a more fragile dialogue. It is so tortured that taking cheese cheese into the joints may be preferable to sitting in it. The only subtlety she can achieve is in his sparsely obscured racism, because poor islanders turn to ineffective collective prayer that does nothing until the Ã¼bermenschlich, the Lucine hero Moeller, with a straight line on Yahweh, assures the Blood Sample that scientists horn blowing can get to work and save the unfortunate natives. This movie is upset.
