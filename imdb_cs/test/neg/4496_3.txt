I saw the Greek Tycoon when it first came out in 1978. I found it very boring. I thought it was nothing better than a travel book except one thing: For the first time in my life, I realized why it would be good to be rich. When I saw the scenery of the yacht Aristotle Onassis and got my first glimpse into the lifestyle of the rich and famous, she opened my eyes. Paraphrasing Martha Stewart: It was a good thing. Funny, I don't remember the sex scene. I haven't seen a movie since it was on the big screen and found a love session with a lover unforgettable this time. Maybe because I was younger and free at the time, it wasn't a big deal.
