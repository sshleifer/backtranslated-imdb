A bunch of medical students yuppies gather in their free time to connect with each other and power cables and die. Then they stand around counting time before brain death, and then start CPR and heart-massage and bring them back to life. The fact that Julia Roberts was in this movie should say everything. FLATLINERS is like a GHOST group. Anyone who wants to see their dead relatives and visit their old dead buddies, so what better way to do this than having plenty of medical students kill for five minutes and then bring you back to life. The rest of the film has predictable relationship problems, plus the predictable "GEE MAY IF YOU STORE ANY OTHER, ONE OF THESE DAYS ONE OF THE US WHICH IS DEAD?" D'OH !!! This film was to be called BRAIN DEAD. The fact that the figures were portrayed as medical students made me wonder if they went to a Foreign Correspondence School to get their education. The only thing that kept the film from laughing was that it wasn't just the fingers of the electrical outlets that slept to "die." This movie would be a great STOOGES movie.
