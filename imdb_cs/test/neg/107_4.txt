Low budget horror. If you don't want to increase your expectations too high, you'll probably enjoy this little movie. Beginning and ending are good enough, sometimes it stretches and seems to be going nowhere for a long time because we are watching the foolishness that gives the atmosphere but does not continue to conspire. A little gore. I enjoyed Bill McGhee's performance, which seemed very believable to such a low budget, that he was able to carry the film when nothing happened. Sister Charlotte Beale, played by Jesse Lee, played her character well so be ready to slap her to the end! She makes some really stupid mistakes, but then, that's what makes these low budget movies so good! I'd have been away from that place and five states long before she thought it might be a good idea to leave! If you like this movie, try Committed of 1988, which is basically a rip off of this movie.
