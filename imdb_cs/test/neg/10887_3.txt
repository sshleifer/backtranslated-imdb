SPOILER Wolfcreek meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre .... if you saw them, don't waste your time with this. A typical slasher film, nothing new except SPOILER "visions" that just add fluff to an already weak plot. I would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and it's either seeing this movie or staring at the bare wall for 1.5 hours. The only semi-interesting part of SPOILER is when the chick starts drinking in an empty sheriff's office, I say it's interesting because at least she used that liquor instead of using it stereotypically to launch a fire to kill the bad one, he went that way to the end. All in all, lame, bad and not worth the effort.
