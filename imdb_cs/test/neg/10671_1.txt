I have to raise my hand and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last !!!) to see this movie. Where to start is a complete mess. The main attraction of course was the soundtrack. What's obvious is genius - that's what Himesh does best. But as they say, don't give up your daily job - HR definitely doesn't. <br /> <br /> HR action is simple and just awful. Even if the movie had a plot, what worries you the most is why this man is on the screen and what the hell he is doing there. Two words of HR - to abandon acting and secondly to use the capitule. HR does not have any on-screen presence, no actor skills and female leadership seem too little for him. As for Malika Sherawat - the same old shiny crap. <br /> <br /> You can pack the product the way you want it to, but it doesn't hold if there's no substance. Don't waste your money ...
