First let me start by saying that I'm Laurel and Hardy buff. I've read every book about them and I've seen all their available movies more than once. I even took a chance once and called Stat. He was very kind and spoke to me for over ten minutes. I followed the letter and wrote a letter to me. I still have the letter. This film has some subtle comedic moments, but Stan and Ollie are not in their usual form. The tent was heavily ill during production and seemed worse than he did ten years later. In my opinion it is worth seeing any movie of Laurel and Hardy. However, the final view of this film comes from the great Stan Laurel himself. To quote him, "This film should never be made."
