That must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The general idea of ​​a coronal mass ejection that hits planet Earth with EM disruption is fair enough, but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a sustained 155 ° F? Acting was so terrible that I felt that casting agents just grabbed a handful of people from Santa Monica Avenue and threw them in front of the camera. In all honesty I saw less wooden playing from my ironing board. I'm sorry, but this movie was poor, poor, poor.
