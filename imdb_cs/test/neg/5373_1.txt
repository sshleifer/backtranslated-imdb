For a while I was addicted to shows like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and so on, though I thought they were full of crap that I found interesting and fun, so we're watching the entertainment television. It's fun to shut down the brain and believe that every shadow captured on the camera is not just a shadow, but some crazy ghost of a crazy asylum prisoner or something if you can later return to the real world. What has been said, enjoying Paranormal State requires more than just closing the brain off, it requires you to consume lead in large doses regularly during your childhood, then suffer from repeated head injuries, then do huffing colors in your teens. Then you have to get high / drunk and watch. Paranormal is out of pseudoscience (which I can enjoy with some degree of critical thinking) found on Ghost Hunters (which I still find to be a reasonably interesting and entertaining program), it's a pseudo ... everything. The show follows the adventures of a group of students from Penn State University (not to be confused with the University of Pennsylvania) led by Ryan Buell as they take on themselves to drive out demons and spirits through rituals from any religion that at that time, it seems to be the most dramatic (from Catholic exorcisms carried out by undergraduate college students to Wiccan spells that are deprived of socially awkward Gothy, to native American cleansing rituals, loans, these are done by Native Americans). If you believe in Wicca, or if you are a Catholic or a follower of traditional Indian religions, I think you would want their cleansing rituals to be performed by someone who ... is not a bad student with some free time. I do not remember the scene in the exorcist where the priests threw their hands and said, "It's nothing! Invoke a school from a public school after school. This one is too much for us. Probably read an Wikipedia article about exorcisms." The Intelligence of the Viewer The show introductory title sequence has Ryan talking about PRS (Paranormal Research Society), says that when he came to Penn State (note that you don't see any shows where the host says the same, but instead of Penn State says, "When I came at MIT "or" After I got a theoretical physics course ... ") he found other people with a similar interest in paranormal behavior, saying that they are sometimes" warriors. "I remember pretending to be a warrior and fighting I was six, then emotional Ryan springs up a flashy and unpleasant Chip Coffey, who pretends to go to the trances and becomes obsessed with quarreling I thought people learned something about how ridiculous the idea of ​​psyche and media is after "Crossing Over" came out of the air. The show takes itself too seriously because this small group of social misfits pretends to fight against some ancient, cosmic evil. Production values ​​are low, stories are boring, and unlike ghost hunters who occasionally capture something unusual (though probably explanatory but interesting) on ​​their equipment, PS requires you to believe that the sounds and creaks they hear are proof demons, ghouls and maybe leprechauns. The only thing scary at this show is that there are people who take it seriously. The only thing that is paranormal is that people on it are able to do every episode while keeping a straight face. Call me tired, but I feel like the great secrets of the universe and the afterlife. too big to be resolved in a half-hour TV show by a journalist in a public school. All I have said, I highly recommend that everyone watch this show at least once if there is no other reason for it to be pure entertainment from watching a really horrible movie or TV show. Or you can make it a drinking game. I think the other would be more appropriate.
