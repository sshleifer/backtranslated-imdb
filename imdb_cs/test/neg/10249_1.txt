... what would a porn movie look like if you took out sex and left it in bad dialogue, cheap sets and bad gambling, you would have Galaxin. This movie came out when Original Star Wars proved that there is a market for science fiction. This in turn leads to some gems like Alien and Revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and of course it was one of them. (I say, of course, because I haven't even heard of this movie a few days ago.I missed it when it came out in 1980.) <br /> <br /> Here's a basic problem. Dorothy Stratton couldn't act, so she didn't even try it for most of the movie. I understand that her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but for life I can't understand why. The film has undoubtedly attempted Spoof Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens, but they clearly don't understand, than when you spoof something, it has to be FUNNY! This movie wasn't, or at least, comic timing for jokes that could be funny. The science fiction is ripe for a parody of how Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest have done. But this film did it wrong.
