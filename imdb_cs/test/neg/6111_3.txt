Somehow I have failed for a few years when I saw this film, although it was quite successful and created a lot of discussions in Israel. I am sorry that I did not postpone her indefinitely. "Kadosh" is a very real and painful place for those who know the Jewish religious world - the place of women in an orthodox family. and society. The basic situation in the movie is perhaps, the problem is that the way it is displayed on the screen and the "solution" that the conflicts described in the film get is wrong. Gitai does not seem to have too much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach to selecting characters who are either fanatical or unable to express their human feelings makes the story seemingly simplified. Even he does not have much better service to his female characters, even though he shows more sympathy here and also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and talented actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. Overall, Gitai's vision is too one-sided, his film resources are too basic, focusing on the technical details of Jewish religious life, which may be of interest to people who do not know them, but are not really relevant at all. full story. Based on the interesting spaces we get here, there is a boring film that seems to be longer than it is, with a very static way of acting, an obsessive use of music that plays in the same register not only from the musical but also from the emotional point of view. very inconclusive, if not even confusing. What is the difference between this film and "Ha Ushpizin" inspired and describing the same social landscape and which has managed to transmit human feelings to the screen. There are too little cinemas and too few human emotions in 'Kadosh'.
