I was quite excited to see this movie when it came out. The advertisements seemed unpredictable to him, and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of both looked like an interesting idea. Unfortunately I was terribly disappointed with Sister Betty. Personally, I have usually found that graphic violence and comedy do not go so well together, and the only directors who have both combined these experiences in my opinion are Tarantino and Coens. There is not so much violence in Sister Betty, but what kind of violence is that I felt a little weird when I was laughing. Of course, for me part of the problem was also that there were not many places where I was asked. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't work as a drama too. Betty from the story of Renee Zellweger, the protagonist of the story, is clinically insane and impossible to relate to. I will say that Zellweger is playing quite well, and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear are doing well. The problem is in writing; Freeman is the only person who plays an interesting character. It's really bad. 3/10
