One would think that because this movie has a bad rep that I would be exaggerating when I say I hated this movie. But I am seriously this movie was just so stupid and so rude, and such a waste of time. the first 30, I had a big headache and a smile that I had on my face (it was mostly preparing to laugh) was wearing off.When this movie was over I was so glad and because I had a good expectation that it would It was funny I was extremely disappointed. The effect is not great, comedy moments are lame and rude. Sometimes there is something good about it because I laughed like the 2 parts. Overall, it's so boring and I can't tell you how horrible it is, I think it could be used as a suicide technique. I think I don't think for some of its i watchable. with all costs.
