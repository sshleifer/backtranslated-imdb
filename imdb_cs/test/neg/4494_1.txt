This film serves every imaginable Greek stereotype. In one especially galling scene the tycoon says, "I'm just an ignorant peasant." As a grandson of the Greek peasant immigrants, who passed on to their children and grandchildren the legacy of wisdom and love, I found that this film was scornful and disgusting.
