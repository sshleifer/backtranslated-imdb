The Mod Squad begins "after" the formation of "Mod Squad" without bothering to develop any character or show us why someone is doing what they do. In addition, most of the events in the film seem to be instrumental in the plot. Without any character development, the Gen-X meander fence is projected into action scenes and back again. <br /> <br />
