I wish Depardieu was able to finish his book and see that he was a brilliant success. At the very least, he would end up with something. The film surprised me as meaningless, agitated and very stylish, like some other recent French films. Not to knock it. The most up-to-date American movies are pointless and unrestrained and have no style. We believe that we should be grateful for the photograph that evokes a European city in the midst of a windy continental winter and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> Be a too good thing. Golubeva is in the middle of a chilling night stumbling near the sea and in a bad accent on dreams and the like. (There are several dream sequences that include things like swimming in a river of blood. You'll love it when you're Vlad.) A lot of people die. Catherine Deneuve dies of suicide by motorcycle. I do not know why. Golubev's young girl also dies and I don't know why she dies. She gets slapped in the face, falls on the sidewalk, and dies. There is an allegedly explicit sex scene too. I will have to take their word because, even if it is photographed in style, it is photographed in almost total darkness. Don't worry about being shocked. Probably asleep at this time as well. Depardieu is not a bad actor. We see him deteriorating from a carefully groomed handsome young man - well, handsome, except that his nose can't get out of his way - lame, murderous, hairy physical wrecks. Golubeva has a beautiful face with huge half-hidden eyes and wide cheeks like a doll. Her next film should be a remake of Lewton's "I Walked With Zombie". Then there's the mysterious man who leads the band. I think it's a band. If I did, the band consists of a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. Every viewer will find the resulting sound of interesting but uncultivated listeners who like "easy listening", they don't have to enjoy it. If you don't like music, it's a payout because a sinister composer and leader is thrown over the head with Depardieu's walking stick. I have to say that I'm barely worth sitting around. (And it is also long.) Sometimes it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing, while a long long freight train slowly roars, sometimes it stops completely. I wish he had some jokes.
