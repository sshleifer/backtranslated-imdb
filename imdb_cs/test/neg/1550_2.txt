Well, the episode I've just watched had an older "Gastineau Girl" whining about why people still mention their husband (Mr. Gastineau, apparently a well-known American footballer). She seems unwilling to accept that she is the only reason she doesn't rotate hamburgers, marries someone she knows, so she has cameras on her. When asked to explain what she is doing, she has given a beautifully circular reason why people should pay attention to her: "I work really hard on my reality TV show". Then she said, "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm a personality." I'm not entirely sure who to turn this series into, except for people who had all their intelligence removed. It is certainly not a model for anyone except gold diggers, because both stars do nothing but spend money, and all they tell you about rich people is that they have no financial problems.
