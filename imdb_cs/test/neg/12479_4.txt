There are some horror directors for whom I have built so much respect and admiration over the years that they can't disappoint me to know what it's like to waste. Lucio Fulci is certainly one of them, but damn, he tries to disappoint me with his later efforts! You can simply afford to skip most of the movies that Fulci directed or produced during the late 1980s, and simply watch instead of "Cat in the Brain" because that one title collects and repeats the best and absolutely strict shots that are no less than SEVEN Fulci. -clips, including the worst sequences of murders that appear in "When Alice broke the mirror". As a whole, this film is definitely one of our director's weakest and most sensible achievements. The scenario is incoherent as hell, the basic assumption is totally unlikely and somewhat stupid, and there is absolutely no tension that should be enjoyed. I love the title, but it's actually quite insignificant. There is a character in the story called Alice, but it's just a supportive role and certainly won't break any mirrors. I suppose she could just break things up with her voice because she's an opera singer, but she's not. The plot revolves around a medieval and gambling-dependent playboy who spends his days seducing rich widows and killing them for their money. Ladies Lester Parson (as well as unwelcome witnesses) in horrible ways, makes steaks from their youngest body and feeds the remains of his cat. There is also a stupid psychological subculture in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. The difference between "When Alice broke the mirror" and some of Fulci's greatest horror movies ("The Beyond", "City of Living Dead", ???) is that she is not totally bothered to create the horrific characters Lester has included are colorless And boring and murder are usually shown as the most common thing in the world when you put a woman's head in a microwave oven or repeatedly drive a car to the human body. Lighting is bad, cinematography is very ugly, clumsy and amateur editing, and acting performances are totally unfortunate if I don't know anything better, I think Lucio intentionally made a lousy movie to protest against all the rough movies. critics who do not like his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he has put into it. around his chain saw and cuts off the woman's legs, "when Alice broke the mirror" is an unassuming piece of horror entertainment, but besides that there is not much to be recommended.
