As others have mentioned, could there be any other reason to see this movie than to see the former star "Wayne's World" Mike Myers playing a serious role? The story is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by free ends and bad characters. If there were any good scenic shots of Ireland, then it would give another reason to see it. Instead, it focuses on a small, normal village, which is obviously surrounded by the "green pastures" of Emerald-Isle, which often appear in Irish films. If there was any cultural "spice" that would admire an "Irish personality", it would be worth seeing, but it could have been almost shot in England. Too bad for Myers, but this cannot please or satisfy the hearts of anyone who wants to visit the Guinness Country.
