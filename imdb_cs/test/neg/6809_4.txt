Dustin Hoffman's debut debut is not as bad as it is called; Spanish / Italian co-production shot in Italy with director using the pseudonym "Dan Ash" (!), the film is uneven, but generally diverges and deals with a number of shadowy characters in search of $ 1,000,000 hidden by gangster Cesar Romero (who, despite being The third-billed - after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expires before the credit sequence has even rolled!). Hoffman's performance, of course, is nowhere near as nuances as in later movies, but manages to avoid embarrassment by playing what essentially means friendly klutz - an American treasurer agent of Sicilian origin who it is prone to accidents called Puzzu that no one can get! they remain "inconspicuous", but instead they get into trouble forever - even if they can finally be surprisingly resourceful when they find prey, thwart the cheaters and win a girl (Martinelli as Romer's daughter, who is somewhat useless here) !! However, Riccardo Garrone, still a great gangster, is still at the top of the film: in addition to his personality and cheerful use of the dialect, he is surrounded by a trio of nitrons, who are more than a barrier to their various regimes! Also, with regard to the story taking place in Rome, it is strange that a policeman investigating this case is a Spaniard (no doubt a co-production agreement)! Over the years I have omitted Hoffman's other Italian comedies - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - several times (I think, mainly because Leonard Maltin evaluates only 1 * 2) in his "Movies & Video Guide". but the MADIGAN MILLION gets BOMB!); with the director and director Pietro Germi, who plays with the kindly Stefania Sandrelli, the credentials of this film are certainly more respectable and I hope it will soon appear on Italian TV ...
