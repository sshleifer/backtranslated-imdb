Robert Lansing plays a scientist who experiments with the passage of objects through solids, but goes too far in one night and unintentionally becomes four-dimensional! The atomic age of fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way. Perhaps it was considered sophisticated science fiction in its time (with psychological overtones), yet seen today the film is slightly overbaked and naive; It's a camp-fest tailored for television late shows. The wooden performances of Lansing and Lee Meriwether barely rated themselves as one-dimensional, though Patty Duke (playing a cute frat in front of "Miracle Worker") gets a colorful, memorable output. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
