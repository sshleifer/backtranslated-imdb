I'm from Romania ... and I'm sorry if my English isn't that good. I just finished watching this movie and I must say I'm extremely disappointed. I've always liked Wesley Snips movies, but this is terrible. I regret spending more than 3 hours on this movie. There are many mistakes in the movie. For example, the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The stadium name is Ghencea. The name of the football team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. Stadium Tables are unable to display graphical images: videos, live images, etc. It is a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers. Uli's opponents (Seau) are shown on the scoreboard as Din (probably from Dinamo Bucuresti - who are Steauy's main rivals in the Romanian football championship). The football match pictures are from the match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - look at the internet and see why). Police cars in the movie are not properly executed. There is not a single dark blue police car in Romania! They're all white! The "bug list" can go on and on and on ... but I'll stop here! In short, this film is terrible. It is not worth to rent it, it is not worth buying a movie ticket, it is not worth downloading! I sincerely apologize that Wesley snipes played in this movie. His previous film ... 7 seconds ... also shot in Romania ... was fine, but this is terrible!
