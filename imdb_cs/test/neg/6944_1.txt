This is by far the worst movie I've seen this year from Bollywood. I must not lie, my wife liked this film very much. It wasn't Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal, which made this movie incredible, but it was Amisha Patel. She performs the role of a blind woman who gets into trouble when she almost falls off the mountain, where (fortunately for her) Arjun Rampal's hero comes to rescue her (in the middle of nowhere). I'm surprised how blind a girl is aware of the danger of getting out of the mountain because she doesn't see her environment. From this scene, I began to watch the movie closely and in every scene there was a mistake in Amish Patel's acting. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way he does it is not to look into the eyes of the person he is talking to. When I saw this movie, I respected Rani Mukherjee more with her performance in Black. Amisha never reaches this level as an actress. In any case, he falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It's a clich√©. A sudden Arjun kills a man who is madly in love with Amisha. Amisha is in despair, but then Bobby enters the movie. She also falls in love with a blind girl. Bobby Deol is, in my opinion, a great actor, but the movie can't go to a higher level where Amisha Patel burys him deep into the ground. I have to say that Bobby deserves a better role in better movies than hitherto. Bobby grew up playing from the first movie his grandfather gave him. He was so bad at acting in Barsaat, but when you see him act now, you get shivers and believe every word he says. His film must only fulfill a film with high potential, such as Yash Copra. Well, when Amisha also falls in love with Bobby, some come into her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes this stupid thing? No. Why didn't one of the ugly boys of the film family (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) play their part and give Bobby a role in one of Amitabh Bachchan's blockbusters? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a scream for an actor like Bobby to give him a big role, but it deserves much better than Patel's bigscreen t.v. face movie. This film was so terrible that I regret it.
