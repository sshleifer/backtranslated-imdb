Just terrible. I include a spoiler warning just because I included paired jokes from the movie - there's nothing else that could go wrong because it's already rotten. This slag was made during what had to be one of the sellers of "For a Few Dollars", when he took some bullshit for a few bucks. I saw it as a 15-year-old high school student in 1972 and then I hated him. No need to review it again; After 35 years, I remember it as one of the five worst movies I saw as a child. As I recall, Sellers had more continuous roles than leading here, but even his presence couldn't relieve the stale jokes, lame plot and infantile repartee. One ongoing theme revolves around Sellers' use of his fingers: In one scene, he holds his open hand to a group of medicos, and by folding his fingers, lists the groups for which the hospital exists - interns, nurses, administrators, etc. - until only his middle finger remains, then he says, "... and patients!" Har Har. In another scene to avoid costly laboratory tests, he dipped his finger in the urine sample and put it in his mouth to check the sugar, then asked the trainees around him to do what they did. Then they advise them to place their middle finger in the urine, but they will suck up their index finger and encourage them to pay attention. Hee Hee. (The only reason I remember that, and this movie, and I'm writing this review, is that my friend told me today is a stupid version of this "joke"). If it's a layman, you'll want it. If not, see 'Hospital', with George C. Scott (released the same year, 1972) for some real, amazing black medical humor. Better yet, read "The House of God" by Samuel Shem, and if you can, check out his movie version that has never been released (please copy it and send it to me - I'd like to finally see it).
