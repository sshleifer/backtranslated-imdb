NY (George Segal), a moderately educated lawyer, has gone crazy. He promised his father on a mortal bed that he would never send his senile mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. A few years later he cares for a senile, dangerous psychopath. She meets a beautiful sister (Trish Van Devere) and falls in love. But his mother still scares him. Segal is ready to kill her .... <br /> <br /> Ummmm ... This is a comedy? I have nothing against sick, black humor, but come ... there must be some limits! This film goes out of the way to throw everyone tasteless sick a joke it can think of, and rub your face in it. Too bad none of the jokes is funny. Jokes include rape, nudity, public humiliation, senile old people, curses, and racism. Basically, it is a movie that thinks it's clever to try to shock people and think they'll laugh at them. I was disgusted and I wasn't allowed to laugh once. The film is morbid, disturbing and (surprisingly) boring. The cast is the only thing watching me. Segal and Gordon were both amazing in their roles - especially Gordon. And Van Devere is also pretty good. But the script is against them. The only interesting thing (not humorous) was the absurd scene of the courtroom with Rob Reiner Jr. (and try to spot his then-wife Penny Marshall as a spectator). In fact, this movie could be worse - Segal and his mother had the ending to pretend to be poppa! That was (fortunately) changed. A real lousy, sick movie. Lower barrel. I give it 1.
