I've always been a fan of Chuck Norris for what he finished and his movies. While I wanted to watch this movie, but for some reason he had no chance. Apparently, I wasn't missing too much. It must be one of Chuck's worst movies. So this trucker, Billy Dawes (Augenstein) gets a chance to get his delivery, but on the way he is being rounded up and forced into jerkwater town, where the stupid local corrupt judge Trimmings (Murdock), who drives the entire city, has arrested him and fake accusations raised on it. They deny the charges and run for it. The local cops defeated him and he disappeared. His brother JD John Dawes (Norris) is looking for him now. He soon discovers that the city is being run to buy a defeated judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. Not long after hitting just about everyone in town. Meanwhile, the movie woman calls local trucks on CB radio and everyone comes to hurry to the city that is demolishing him. LOL with large kits. Eventually Norris finds his brother and defeats more criminals. This movie was pretty bad. It actually starts OK and you feel great when Norris starts to break some of these local corrupt cops because there are such losers. But there is virtually no story, acting is wrong and ending? So it really doesn't. The judge has his house rammed into a large platform and you never know what will happen. Is he alive? Norris will never catch him. Meanwhile, Norris takes some robber at the end. Who cares? Norris also manages to take everyone in the city, gets his hand broken and shot to the side and continues the fight. Come on! This movie was apparently made to cash at CB craze time, why there was one behind me. Barley even uses CB in the movie. Adding to it, a movie near the end seems to drag and you wonder why it's not over yet. This movie is bad, but if you are bored and you need something to watch, it will be time. As for Norris, he continued to produce much better films. 3 out of 10.
