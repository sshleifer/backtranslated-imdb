The only reason I rented this movie was that Val Kilmer rarely plays in the wrong movie. Of course it's the first time. In many ways, this film proves that sheep are not as easy as we think, especially by foreign directors. The only one who got it was probably Sergio Leone, but even his films lacked something that was uncertain for our American psyche and panache. American actors in Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda helped. Now I see why they changed the original title from "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bounty". That alone tells me that producers and directors had no basic knowledge of the Western world than the standard scenes and violent themes. I think we can say the same about American directors who are trying to produce Polish film, while they are failing in this process.
