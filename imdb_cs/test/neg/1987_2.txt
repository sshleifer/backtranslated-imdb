This film tries to be artistic, but comes as a puerile as the first film school student. Next, she tries to be erotic, but comes as clumsy as the first virgin attempt. Finally, he tries to be cruel and gripping, but except for Kinsky's performance - which is powerful but noticeably wrong in the middle of an amateur melodrama - it's as appealing as your hand around wet noodles (which is a good metaphor considering how non-erotic this movie is ). It features a smoky scene that is even more lame than ChloÃ« Sevigny's career-inter performance in Brown Bunny. Now run when you have a chance. Find a Victoria's Secret catalog instead - it's more artistic and erotic than this tripe.
