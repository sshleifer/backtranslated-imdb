I absolutely can't believe my fellow IMDb reviewers. All the praise about how "original" this movie is, it's like they never saw "Ring" or a million imitations that come out in 10 years from that movie. And some of them claim to be horror enthusiasts! I think not! "Shutter" is fine. I would say average. I give it 5 out of 10, but it's not the way it's original and great and the "scariest thing I've ever seen" as one reviewer said. Puh-leeeze, people. This one is simple. It's predictable. I swear if I see another ghost movie where the hero follows the ghost's past to find out why he's crazy and after them, I'll scream. br /> <br /> "Original"? Give me a break. You have to get out more. Or at least stop saying "horror fans".
