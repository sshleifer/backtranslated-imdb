As an overall film geek with a happy video manager job, I tend to watch all kinds of movies, from good to very bad. It was a film with so many corn ball lines, shabby CGI effects, and predictable plot points that I laughed extensively thirty to forty minutes ago. The genre of "creation" of genres of films in recent years (no one? Godzilla 2000?) Explained some frightening things, but this film makes me think that the creators didn't even try. Perhaps it would be worth a look at what it is "fun of me" (count shots!), But I couldn't recommend it to anyone in a clear conscience.
