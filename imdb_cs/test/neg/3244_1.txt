I am ashamed to admit in public that I once again held the cover of this film! This is the absolute reason why one should explore the film before seeing it! The "creators" of this film called us all fools and gullible losers with too much time on our hands. Based on the mythical Indian shape that pushes powerful cobras and rebirth, the story takes us as a painful ride. College Goes 40+ Actors (Now Really?) Are the Goal of Their Former Friend Manisha Koirala (Who Was In Her Former Cobra Life, But Is Now A Ghost!) And Her Pathetic, Eternal, Mighty Cobra Friend / Killer Machine Friend Munish Kohli fortunately not seen). Now you need to know more? <br /> <br /> I am voting for the upcoming school test and not the film! Give it a pass if you're healthy. If not ... you will probably enjoy it.
