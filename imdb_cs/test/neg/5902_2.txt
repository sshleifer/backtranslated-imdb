It is generally not my practice to review films that I do not like to a great extent. However, once or twice a year, I have temporarily abolished my rule to comment only on the things I would like to point out. I find it more fun to comment on something I like and raise it than filming on bad movies. But some "movies" shout at the razor. Bilitis is one of them. The camera is not the only aspect that is blurry and blurred here. Almost imperceptible conspiracy (certainly incoherent, though there is one) bad behavior, cheese scenario and terrible stimulation. These are his main problems. Understand, I firmly believe that not all movies are created the same and movies should be judged by their category. It is not reasonable to judge, say, the Bingo Beach Blanket against Gone With the Wind. I judge Bilitis against other films in my weight class. Measured against movies like Emmanuelle or Chamber Secrets, it's really very bad. Even eye-candy must be fun and Bilitis is definitely not.
