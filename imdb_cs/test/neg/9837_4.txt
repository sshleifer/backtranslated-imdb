This one is one of those classic B movies that uses two hobos. It's done really cleverly, and Big Stupid runs one-track like a cardboard jacket. But Jack Elam steals every scene he is like creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is a lynch crowd and a dad's voice that rises 10 octaves ("Did you love it?"). Danny, the protector of Big Stupid, is surprisingly stupid, but not as ugly as our leading star. There is also a quaint scene of a dude man in the dining room. Joyce Meadows is a sweet, naive pretty girl and probably the least uncomfortable. And the yellow ruffles (RAWR!). Oh, and booze is bad according to Mr. Stupid. This film is a hoof. Watch the MST cover of this and Crow's amazing tribute to Elam!
