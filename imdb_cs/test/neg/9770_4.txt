I'm a big fight. As a story that is unreal, this movie could be great (as great as some appreciate it), but mixed with acting (director and relatives who play major roles for financial reasons I thought). .. although this acting calls, it's not just a part of this word, but it gives it a new meaning! Brand new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you are in surrealistic movies (there are some that I really like, look at the Japanese Strange Circus, for example), you may be able to overlook the gaps (see above) and enjoy more. After all, there are great ideas! Many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but while watching this (with a group of friends) almost all of us, we just couldn't stop laughing ... not the director's intention of course! Again, everyone has their own hobbies, as can be seen from the high rating of this movie, but I could only recommend the film if you are aware of the work that Alejandro Jodorowsky has done and / or is a fan of!
