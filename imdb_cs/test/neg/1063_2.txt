... He said the continuity detector should be broadcast by TACTICAL ASSAULT. When I saw the first two minutes, I started thinking that Rutger wanted to get a new agent. After seeing another ten minutes, I began to think that Rutger might want to retire, saving a potential audience from his other performances. Yup is a really horrible movie. I wasn't expecting much and why should I have the name Rutget Hauer appear in credits, but I realized within a few seconds of the initial title credits, which were introduced by NATO war planes with USSR brand bombing Bosnia, that I would be forced to feed three inedible turkeys. after Christmas. There is no attention to detail. NATO aircraft were designated as the USSR, and then it was said that Hauer's figure spent six years in an Iraqi prison that would be born in 1997. What NATO bombed the Serbs in 1997! I think manufacturers didn't think viewers noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy, but I know I did. The producers also probably hoped that viewers would not notice the lack of continuity, such as fighting with Iraqi jets, which suddenly changed from MIGs to F-4 Phantoms and then back again.

I'll give the producers some credit (Maybe the credit is too strong a word) because after seeing the plots representing the nannies from hell, the police from hell, flat friends from hell, we now have a fighter pilot from hell, which means every 20th century job appeared in hell type plot with maybe TATICAL ASSUALT is the worst movie of the series
