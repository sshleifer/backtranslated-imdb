This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a thriller with a somewhat ridiculous ending. I watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something really bad. The film played two actors I love, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Sure they had decent chemistry, but what? The beginning of the film was bad and the execution made it the worst. Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor, a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense is dependent on multiple personality failure. This will give you a lot of help where the movie goes, and the identity of the killer. Soon, he gets an unexpected visit to his father in the film. This was done in the '90s when a bad dad was in Hollywood, is another guideline to the final conclusion. Mr. Banderas plays a mysterious man named Tony Ramirez who comes to Sarah's life. The first meeting and the first meeting between Tony and Sarah is so poorly executed and so unconvincing that you are interested in how it was even shot. And there is a sequence in which both of them should know that she is so satisfied that she does not belong here. One thing I would admit was that there was a sex scene that is very hot. The fearsome things are beginning to appear only after the arrival, the arrival of special packages, the fall of things from the wall that could kill Sarah, an incident that says things are no longer normal. Overall, the film was poorly conceived, sometimes the cut seemed unclear and the conclusion was ridiculous. Another thing that annoyed me in this movie was the whole orchestral music playing in the background. A finer musical score would be better. I have to say, no matter how bad the end was, Miss DeMornay was very good in that order. Sadly, she never got first class materials in her career. It's a rare combination of talent and beauty.
