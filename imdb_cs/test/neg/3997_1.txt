Before I watched this movie, I realized it was a low budget movie. But even with these low standards, this film does not cut. The problem is not that filmmakers have a low budget or bad acting, writing, directing, sound, music, and editing. I expected everything to be bad, and that's it. The biggest problem with this movie is that it didn't even do a good job with kids and gore. Most "actions" take place off-screen, and all we see are the following effects that look very fake - even the low budget standards. There's really no excuse for gore being so badly done. Peter Jackson made the same low budget 'Bad Taste' at the same time and he somehow managed to make a much more convincing gut and gore than it was shown in this movie. Failure at almost every level, I can't recommend this movie to anyone. Avoid it. <br /> <br /> <br />
