This "remake" is a total shame: so average, cheap and prosaic that it deserves more than a few malicious lines. It's also cheating, with a laughing scenario serving in such a way and amateur "playing", you always realize that there is a set, camera, false, no direction, no suspended reality that would allow you to immerse yourself into the story. The claustrophobic, stifling tension of small spaces and rooms in the original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 & 2) are only lost in crowded sets and spaces. But the worst of all is the moral enormity and unbearable suffering, both of which gave the ruthless logic to the original mother, and the child victims, which have turned into relentlessly vengeful ghouls, are utterly destroyed by utter nonsense and hollow boogie-man ghosts. If an American audience does not want to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator, preferring instead to swallow this kind of uplifting hogwash instead, f basically deserves this pathetic curse: the film itself.
