MTV's sci-fi "Fon Flux" is animated with Charlize Theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the fortified city of Bregna, 400 years into the future. For her last mission, she was sent to kill city leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but on the way she reveals the secret. Aeon Flux falls into the category of good assumptions, average realization. Interesting story, but the movie was a bit boring. A lot of people say it's one of the worst movies of the year and it's not true at all. It may be an unsatisfactory movie, but at best it is an average movie. I've never seen a drawn version of the movie, so I can't compare these two. It's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. The film isn't so confusing, but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. Acting was fine, nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and seems to be dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also provides decent performances including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film, including Sithandra, Aeon's friend. The problem with Aeon Flux is that he takes himself too seriously. The whole movie has the same serious tone, which is a bit tiring. There is no humor and the film is sometimes bored. That's the same problem Elektra had. Since the film is so serious, the dialogue sounds raw and serious scenes seem to be forced. Action scenes are pretty good, but that's not what the movie is really about, so don't just expect an action movie. The twist at the end isn't mind blowing, but it's still a nice ending and better than the other thrillers that came out last year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are a bit weird, but they still look nice and interesting. The visuals were also done well so the film at least looks nice. Film can be a case of style. Interesting is to look at, but may not have your attention for a very long time. Eventually it's not the best movie out there, but it might be for a decent rental. Rating 4/10
