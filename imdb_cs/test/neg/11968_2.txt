So unfortunately, my friend watched me !!! It was pointing to the Sky Channel here called the "Horror Zone" which basically shows the crappy B-movie horror films 24/7. It was a boring Friday night so he decided to laugh and give it a look. Besides cruel acting, terrible conspiracy, terrible effects, rude work with the camera and the brain that did it all, it was okay, LOL! In all seriousness, it was quite a laugh that the holes were gathering in him and laughing at the goofy actors. There is a bit of semi-nudity that takes a perked movie a bit, unfortunately it was "uggo" that got topless as my friend calls her: oD If you're bored one night and it happens to be playing, take a chance, maybe you like it :)
