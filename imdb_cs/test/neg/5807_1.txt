Honestly, this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I saw Spider Baby and No of this Earth. Hell, I even saw 200 Motels. Having just discovered the Freaks and Geeks series and surprise Linda Cardellini's acting ability, I checked out the reviews and decided it was worth a try. This is the LAST TIME I will rely on to review the IMDb. I didn't realize that MORONS was writing IMDb reviews while they were waiting for their calls on the AM radio. This film is so far behind the bad that mere words cannot express the poor state of its reversible state. Seriously. Watch this movie if you think Will Farrel is really really funny if you think Adam Sandler is a comic genius. Look at this movie, but PLEASE!
