Jude Law gives Keanu Reeves a run for his money as the most wooden actor around, Renee Z's character is straight out of Beverly Hillbillies, and the two lead have about as much chemistry as Darth Vader and Queen Amedala. "Bad guys" are the worst kind of clich√© and there's no gentle moment in the movie. Incredible that some critics really liked this film.
