This thing, it shouldn't be called a movie, is almost worse than "Manos," but you just have to see it. If you see it on a video store, you can view it, if you see the 10th anniversary release, yes, there's a special edition, you buy it for $ 10, if your friend borrows it, all you have to do is see it. The deal is so bad, and gore is so fake. After the show, you ask yourself why they made this insult to the art of film? This is assuming that your face will not dissolve as Nazis in a "robber". If you can see it, remember to vote this movie as 1 (horrible) so it can make the bottom 100, it really deserves a place there. I'm surprised it's not number 1 right now.
