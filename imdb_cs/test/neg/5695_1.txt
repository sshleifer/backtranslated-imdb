I did it half, but it wasn't enough masochist to see it all. The first half of the film had no dialogue! Almost everything was voice over the commentary to the story. The writer forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain a few thousand years of detailed history in voice. At the same time, he forgot about any character development. Most science fiction fans don't need a huge amount of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main heroes who survived the destruction of the cosmic squadron ended up. There are some good things going on in the movie. The soundtrack was great. Some computer graphics are very good, but others were just average.
