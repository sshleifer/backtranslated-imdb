Believe me, you are an American service member when I say this film does not accurately depict the emotional state of our soldiers / sailors / airmen / sailors returning from deployment. That was said. This film is one big smoking pile of clich√©s. Behavior as horrible (with the exception of a little girl) background characters are weak and laughing, and the plot is ridiculous. This movie is so bad that I created an IMDb account to warn every half brain from it. Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente should be really, really, really ashamed of this film. If he disagrees with American foreign policy, he should write a letter to the US government, not punish the entire English-speaking world with a monumentally crap movie.
