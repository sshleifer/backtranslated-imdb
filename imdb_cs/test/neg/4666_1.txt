I don't remember when I saw a worse movie. The acting was exaggerated, the dialogue proved painful to listen, special effects of the second level and the overall story of laughter. I never wanted to go to the movie more and if I was alone, that's what I did, about 30 minutes to do it, and I saved almost the OTHER TWO HOURS of the dialogue causing nausea and plot holes than Swiss cheese "size Texas". "I can't emphasize what was a miserable experience with this overall waste that went through this total waste. <br /> <br />
