I thought this movie could be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead, it was like something someone in high school would do with their parents' video camera. It's not just a low budget that makes this movie a bad one (many great movies were made on a low budget), it's just a bad movie and it wasn't bad enough to be a good camp. Case at Point: For the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens, except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking drugs, put on their makeup, and then answer the phone call. You are waiting for something to happen, but it never comes. The sound was so bad that I had to turn the whole TV around to make out what they were saying (which wasn't that interesting). If I paid for renting a movie, I will usually suffer, even if it's bad, but it was all I could do to sit for 20 minutes. Looks like the person in front of me felt the same way, because she didn't rewind the tape and didn't leave the place I did. The only reason I gave it is 1 because the rating system doesn't have negative numbers.
