Taran Adarsh ​​alleged critic praised such dubba movie <br /> <br /> The film has a special story where a lover sells his love to a brothel because he wants money to save his mother and then he also gets forgiven LOL <Br /> The movie is crap <br /> <br /> The whole first half is focused on romance, a comedy that doesn't work Twist shocks, but the other half is a mess and the top is a cliché <br /> <br /> Direction Aditya Datta's Bad Music is Typical Himesh <br /> <br /> Emraan plays his serious role well, but his wardrobe, his way of walking through the songs.etc is similar to his previous movies Geeta Bhasra Annoyes Ashmith Patel Can't convince this actor was good in MURDER just so far and then downhill Mithun some time screen and he is fine, but his disintegration into the song is forced Ranjeet is fine
