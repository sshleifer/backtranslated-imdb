One can only sit in utter amazement at this movie disorder and be amused at some of the rave people granted it on it. The biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to figure out whether it's a black comedy, a farce or a combination of both. It meanders all over the place in search of direction and has some utterly awkward performances that might be more appropriate for bad sitcoms. What a pity is to see talented talent Dianne Wiest is wasted and still annoying Jane Birkin is so up that she is more annoying than usual. The French nature of the film - hence it is referred to as "intelligent" or "brilliant". It's not so. Instead, it is a bad audacity that leaves a somewhat rancid after-taste. Merchant-Ivory should stick to serious things because they certainly have no comedies.
