Again, we get the melange of topics that are covered with so many previous movies. Good and bad son story, courtesy east of Eden. The story of an American naval hero who does not consider himself one for what he knows. And a grieving wife who has potentially fallen in love with another human story. Because theoretically they could still be better presented and solved every time. This time unfortunate, because all three of these fibers eventually fall in the same way. Because a bad son never opens up with his father, the conflict is never resolved correctly. In addition to her father, a bad son began to appreciate by refurbishing the kitchen of a grieving woman. Now, how satisfying it is. Another, surprisingly return home maritime suspicion his wife infidelity conflict never gets solved. Because he never talks to a man who is suspicious, namely his own brother. So once again we have passed the free end. Finally, the theme of American military heroism, where the sea state is publicly considered a hero when it passed through the dirt of war, should not really be called one in its own standards. Because the film ends as soon as the first time he can talk to his wife about what he has gone through. Where the real story really would start at the same point, namely its healing process, what it would look like and finally face a family that it should have some big blame to confess. All this, all really interesting pieces are passed and ignored. So while the story wise this movie is serious, and I mean serious, disappointment, I still would give it points for impressive cast. Although no movie should use Maguire for voice over because it belongs to Spiderman. Especially adult Gyllenhaal seems to meet all the expectations he has woken up as a young and aspiring actor. So much that I would actually like to see him entrusted with a truly profound and challenging leadership role. So, although the cast seems to do what it does, I consider this film totally forgotten otherwise. Shallow and finally demanding, totally unsatisfactory tear. Report du jour to writers: we know the blows already, see a number of Vietnamese movies. You want to earn some recognition, show us credible healing.
