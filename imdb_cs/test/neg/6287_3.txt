Poor old Robert Taylor. Other than FEDS, nothing much happened - this almost shocking waste of ninety minutes and not much more. It's one of those cheesy detective crimes that tells the story of a leading character all the way - it's usually reserved for comedy these days, but this movie is taken too seriously! Damage; Australian films, especially in the 2000â€“01 period, were of exceptional quality overall - but I suppose there must be a few mistakes. Why even make a movie that will not, of course, be good?
