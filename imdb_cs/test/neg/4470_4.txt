Let's put aside the sophomic humor that we can find in racism and be honest ... it's not funny. I was horrified by the fact that the two main stars would agree to make a film that is so offensive and so damaging to racial relationships, and I don't mean the obvious black-and-white commentary in the movie, but the straw towards the film. other ethnic groups, such as Betty White's characterization of hispanics. We should just put it together to agree to regard this film as a sign of senility ... is it too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical waste? Or is it a writer's fault? How about a third assistant makeup person ??? No, the mistake we make here is that we keep this kind of crap (in a comedy veil) that Hollywood will continue to feed us until we have enough decency ... racism is real and there's no laughter. We are all different, let's celebrate this diversity, not be fun at it and promote division.
