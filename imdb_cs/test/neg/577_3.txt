I have to be honest, I like romantic comedies, but that wasn't what I was hoping for. I thought Ellen Degeneres had the biggest part to be because I didn't like the two fighting partners. It was terrible. Poor Tom Selleck !! He had to deal with someone who was in the picture so much that it was him and Ellen in most of the movie. They were the only believers. The only really funny parts were played, not Kate Capshaw and the Everett guy. Cool that my mother came out of the closet, I thought it was a nice surprise. I'm glad I saw it on the cable and didn't pay any rent money.
