Ugh. Even the increasingly popular Diane Lane could not save the film, and the most interesting thing about the film was if Rourke's face moved. One heard so much "gossip" about his lifted front lift, etc., Like a roadside accident, we just had to slow down and see the wreck. The story was thin. Here we have a very professional crowd, which is somehow entangled in a wild and uncontrollable punk, and in this film we wonder why this guy will stay with this idiot, let alone get him in the first place. Then a crime that has not been committed is supposed to go for witnesses. Then he would be there and jump up. But then we wouldn't have a movie, did we? And why did realtors even agree with blackmail? There were more holes in this film than in the colander. Acting was scary, the whole movie predictable until a minute and even an end. And so much could be done to make it a much better film. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and you don't use any brain cells in the process, then this movie is just what the doctor ordered.
