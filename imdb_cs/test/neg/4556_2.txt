This movie was so bad that it became pleasant. If you want to see the show, decide to do an action movie, that's for you! Excessive, irrelevant incidents, unlikely dialogue - it all has. The main character has a divided personality and cannot decide whether he is a thief, a loving father or a hero who risks his life for others. None of these roles is plausible. This sets the standard for many other characters. The company boss, whose building is set in flame, shows the same unpredictability as his wife. And the punch line - who took the chip - beggars beggars. I found myself heartily laughing and for that reason I suggest you look at it.
