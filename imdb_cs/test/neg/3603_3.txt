Another direct video movie from Disney, which is basically ideal for kids. The Groove Novelty Trouble I Find Out That Everything That Made The First Movie An Entertaining Superb Drive Is Replaced With A Sadder And Darker Movie. In this movie, Kronk learns a lot of lessons with many other 'expenses'. It takes a lot of time to spend a more fun movie. Kronk's New Groove deals with two stories: Yzma returns for a payback, and one Mrs. Birdwell hopes to beat Kronek's counseling championship. All this leads Kronk to face his father and his disagreement with his son's life. From Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's Thriller, Kronk's New Groove recycles every time that lets you have fun. viewers. If you loved the original or are looking forward to the upcoming Kuzco TV series, I recommend Kronk to my loyal fans.
