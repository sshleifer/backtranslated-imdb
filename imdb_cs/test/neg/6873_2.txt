Here's another movie with dysfunctional leaders who are absolutely immoral and yet we should take root? I do not. No character in this movie is worth damn. Robin Williams plays a car salesman "Joey O'Brien." The man has no class, defeated in every moral sense, and a guy who thinks he can talk about something. He knew that Williams' ability to speak was good for this role. The women in his life also control him. Some of them are not much better than him. Tim Robbins plays a similar life that begins to take over the film when it is fully loaded with explosives, falls into the showroom of car dealerships and holds on, including his wife, hostage. Robbins, as in the normal case, plays a disturbed and ridiculous character. I think these roles can easily reach these two actors in these cases. Gee, I wonder why. There are so many shouts and screams in this movie that it will give you a headache. Combine these two screams with Fran Dresche's nasal voice and get a really annoying cast. It's like listening to the chalk on the blackboard for an hour and a half. This is a comedy? No, this is lame. In fact, for Robin Williams, who has only a dozen reviews, he'll tell you something. It's far from his best movie.
