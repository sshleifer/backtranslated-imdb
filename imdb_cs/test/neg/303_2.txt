This movie was made earlier. It's basically a non-original "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Sordid Lives". There are some funny pieces, but otherwise it is a boring clich√©. It's a good first movie attempt and the director (who also plays and wrote this feature) shows a lot of promises. However, writing was a bit jerky and the story was not very original. I swear I've heard some lines in some movies. However, the acting was very good and the film was made in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to see gay-themed movies not so fit with political correctness and tired stories of anxiety. The main character looked pretty well groomed for gay teen in rural Texas, so no saccharin, coming out of the drama here!
