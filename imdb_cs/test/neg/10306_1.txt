I'm very open. I follow all kinds of programs to the end ... good or bad ... just to give them a chance and learn from good and bad aspects. This show had the potential to be good. But my God, what were the writers, director and director? The cast of the actors is terrible ... with the smallest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers) and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) sometimes they get good lines with the best hand of the game. The rest of the cast kills the show. It's the same story in every episode. Sam's planning to do something. His boss disrupts these plans by giving him ridiculous work projects. Then the foolish ways in which Sam tries to accommodate both in a way that is primarily stupid, lack real intelligent humor. This is EVERY episode. It gets very tedious. Season 2, they ditch eye candy. Two "hot" girls on the show will be written (but my brother will stay? Explain to me that he has shortened my casting). I see why they wrote them ... they didn't have any essential role ... but they didn't add anyone better to replace them. The horrified character of Derek Tricolli is constantly being shown in Season 2. His performance (along with others) resembles many of the poor 80's sitcoms ... it could be funny ... but now painful. The exhibition could have been much better by a few good writers and some people who had some talent to perform them. This exhibition lacks everything. Production quality is the only good aspect of the show. It's great in this respect ... unfortunately the content is sadly sad. <br /> <br /> My God. FOX, what was nothing better about? I keep showing up like "It's always Sunny in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock" for now. The bar should be set up by programs such as those that actually assume that the audience is intelligent and are not constantly drooling at each other using all their brain skills to continue breathing.
