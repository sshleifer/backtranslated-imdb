(The beginning can be a spoiler ...) <br /> <br /> "The Eye 2" is a sequel to "The Eye". It's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident with her. The sound effects scared me, though for a moment, but that's the only scary thing. Some of the scenes from the prequel are quite similar, and the cooling effects of the chilled are repeated. "The Eye" has a pretty scary and indelible impression, while "The Eye 2" is a forgotten horror-cum-drama movie. Leave it by observation. Watching "The Eye" is pretty good.
