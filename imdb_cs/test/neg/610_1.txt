This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of a thick idiotic blue collar with a beautiful (and sometimes clever seeming) woman and a crazy in-law (s). With this show, he's a fat indecent comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a parcel delivery driver. She has a beautiful wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as a legal assistant and senile father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in her daughter and son-in-law in the cellar. Kevin James' Doug is your typical beer drink, sports loving, television watching the freedom of a husband sitcom who would rather watch the trumpet than deal with his marital problems. He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the issues he encountered a couple of this show. In addition to a few laughs that Jerry Stiller added to the crazy old man's character, this show was generally unfair. Kevin James's imbecile behavior usually caused show problems that his wife usually solved. This show continued to run sitcoms with a fat stupid father / husband and their pretty wives who for some reason ran on ABC.
