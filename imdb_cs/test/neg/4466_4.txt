After seeing the previews, I was looking forward to seeing Steve Martin in a comedy I thought might be a goalkeeper. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The problem was, the previews were the only funny parts of the movie. The rest of the film was largely a lot of junk, scenes that were made to death and the characters we all saw a thousand times. on the table you can talk to someone. Steve Martin is my favorite, but this was a big clunker. The only actor in the film that was worth observing was Eugene Levy; he was the best of the mighty lame group.
