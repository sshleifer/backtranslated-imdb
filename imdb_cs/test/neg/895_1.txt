I know it sounds crazy, but yes, I'm a huge fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it !!). I hated Part 3, and then here comes Part 4. Was I glad you were kidding? Kid 'n Play is nowhere in this movie, and it would be okay if they foolishly didn't tell them the movie party 4 as if it were in any way, shape, form, or fashion related to its predecessors. Every time this movie arrives late at night on the US, I shoot a rifle TV. Honestly, it's just so cruel. * hurling * <br /> <br /> As the only remaining Kid 'n Play fan to really admit he's a fan of tee hee hee, I was horrified. Remember the stupid little boy Immature? Snuck your way to House Party 3. Okay, well and well, but how can Part 4 be just about them and nothing else, and it also looks like they're not even the same kids from Part 3. * Confused !!!! * House Party fans: do yourself a favor and stick to the House Party 1 and 2 and the Class Act. Besides, everything else is ridiculous.
