This is the most stupid movie ever made in front of the camera. I can't believe I was trusting enough to rent this piece of waste. I've seen some bad movies in my time, but it takes a cake .... Ice Cream ,,,, and Chips Too. Omg, I still can't overcome how bad it was. The action was a joke .... The fence was non-exclusive .. and the camera work had to be done by a 3 year old baby. I've never seen a movie take so long to go anywhere. I think the whole movie could be shot in less than 30 minutes. I think this guy had some time on his hands ... (Like 3 hours.) Plus $ 60 in his wallet and decided one night ... (Hey .. Let's do the dumbest movie he ever did. Give me a break Now I'm heading back to the video store to get my money back Anyone who has watched this piece of waste should do the same.
