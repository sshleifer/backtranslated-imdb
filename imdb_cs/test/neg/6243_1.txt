I hate it when people in the cinema talk back to the screen. This is one of the main reasons why I stick to DVDs or videos. I saw The Clearing on DVD, but if I saw it in movies I would have to get up and SCREAM "NOT YET YET, MORON!" Clearing is another in the long list of horrific movies that feature Mr.Redford. Legal Eagles, Havana, Indecent Design, Close Up and Personal, Sneakers, Last Castle and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something I would do differently. But the worst thing you can do for the audience is this. Say you're kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. Most of the film is on you. You turn the tables on it and start strangling it. Whatever you do, you're still strangling it until it's DEAD! Don't just make him ten seconds. Stay with it! At least ten minutes. But Bob stops too early, leaves and forgets about Mr. Kidnapper until he gets up, finds a weapon and holds it back to the hero. I wanted Mr. Kidnapper to shoot Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I also wanted to shoot him.
