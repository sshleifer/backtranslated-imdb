I honestly thought this movie would be cheesy, though I liked Alvin and Chipmunci for LONG TIME! I was very bad. IT WAS GREAT!!! It was the best movie I've seen since October! In my opinion, this is a movie that everyone should see this holiday season! Enchanted (I thought the same ...) was terrible, the Golden Compass was fine, but the end was pretty miserable for His Dark Materials fans and I'm a legend, but I haven't seen it yet (or National Treasures 2) okay. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give up, but this movie is great for everyone, especially for kids!
