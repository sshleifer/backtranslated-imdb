What is the story on screen. At first I have to say, don't touch this movie, it's best for you (it sucks). And what's really a story seems to be fine at the beginning, but after ten minutes everything gets worse. And that's not all, you can barely see what's on the screen, it's too dark all the time. <br /> <br /> Don't touch.
