In this silly symphony, a mouse from his country visits his cousin in the city. Most of these two mice examine the dining table. The animation is fine where this short suffers from a lack of humor. Maybe I just saw this "dining table" adventure in too many Tom and Jerry shorts. Although it came first, I just didn't think it was fun.
