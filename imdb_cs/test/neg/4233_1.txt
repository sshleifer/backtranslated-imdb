I saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival and I wouldn't recommend it. It is two and a half hours long, during which nothing happens at the speed of wading through the porridge. The main characters are powerless and totally lack charisma or personality. Nobody smiles at all during the film (even if I have a life), and although Domino has a healthy sex drive, she doesn't seem to enjoy sex at all. The whole experience is depressing and cumbersome, the director takes every scene so that I rather crazy than painted the beauty of his technique. Too many questions remained in my mind: why does it do? sniffed Algerian man's head? Why levitates? What is he looking at over the fence? Why does he kiss Joseph? Why did we go and see this waste rather than order another bottle of wine at Bouzy Rouge?
