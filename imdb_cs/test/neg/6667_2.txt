This film looks at the suffering of the family at the death of the child and at the healing that can finally get to them. The family is learning about the death of their son on Christmas Eve, 1991, destroying them for Christmas. They have not celebrated it for many years. The daughter has an interesting commentary to remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation. Matthew's character refers to Jesus, but I suspect that the other notes that come are coming from non-Christian sources. I wonder if other viewers would recognize these comments. If so, it would be an interesting addition to the details of this film.
