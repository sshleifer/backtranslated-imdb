This thing, driven by the French feeling of Patrick Sebastien, is the worst of all the turkeys you have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazaam, Patriot, etc ... you get a picture, these are pits. Sebastien is a television celebrity in France (if you need the equivalent, let's say it's Jerry Springer with I.Q 13), it's his first movie, hopefully it's the last one. I hope Troma or somebody would distribute this film in the States to suffer the worst French smell. Let's say it briefly, this is a masterpiece of S ** t.
