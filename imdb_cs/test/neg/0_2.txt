Mr. Costner again pulled the film much longer than necessary. In addition to the amazing sea rescue sequences, of which very few, I didn't care about any of the characters. Most of us have a ghost in the closet and Costner's character is realized soon, and then forgotten much later when I didn't care. The character we should really care about is a very polite, convincing Ashton Kutcher. The problem is that he comes as a boy who thinks he is better than anyone around him and shows no sign of a crowded wardrobe. His only obstacle seems to be a victory over Costner. Finally, when we got around half the smelly, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We said why Kutcher is controlled to be the best without prior ink or herald. There was no magic here, it was all I could do to avoid doing an hour.
