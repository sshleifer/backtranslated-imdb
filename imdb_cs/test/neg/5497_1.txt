A movie that this stupid never has to see the light of day. Behavior is lame, violence is everywhere, creeping end is just stupid. platoon. No one has ever seen him, not even hits. So he and the beautiful lady are on the run and trying to find the leader of this R.I.C.C.O. squad before they find them. Then the film goes to romance, shooting guns and voodoo. Now, how the hell did voodoo come. You will never see this film if your life depends on it. Believe me!!!!!!!!
