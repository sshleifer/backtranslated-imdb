Produced by Nott Entertainment, this film is "nott" very good at all. I sat during the first 15 minutes of the movie before I decided that acting was bad, casting was bad and working with the camera was bad. As I heard it is downloading this movie floating around on the internet, it's "nott" not worth the bandwidth. Until I wrote this review, the average vote for this film was 8.5, which made me look at it, and for him the average high was ten, obviously voting about liars and shillings. This movie is "nott" for everyone. Or parents, if you want to punish your children with this horrible movie, have them sit on Halloween.
