I rented a Dark Harvest (first) because it looked like a cheesy monster on a box of exciting driving. The scarecrows also scared me. The film had an effective title sequence, but what followed was enough lame (flat, bad lighting, playing, editing, direction ...). Recently I noticed that DH 2: Corn had a rather extensive advertising campaign. I thought the first of them was only marginally successful, so they did a bit of a battle on this battle and maybe they managed to get some more fears and fx out of the ghosts' killers. There are no scarecrows in the video ... It's not a problem. Problems begin with DH 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and stripes that wipe out titles and what's not. When it comes to real photography ... every time the sun shines in the shot, you should have all these exploded white, confirming that you are watching some ultra-low budget mini-DV project that some Midwesterner filmed at his Uncles Farm. Negotiations were not at all possible. The inexpensive rupture of two The Shining girls was under the standard of a first year student. The cut was extremely amateur and lazy. The sound was shaking and tearing. (eg, every time the editor cuts a new shot, there would be a change in the perspective of changing the sound with it). It's as if someone has gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera in a cornfield for three days, put light on him at night sequences (without a joke - that's what they actually did), burned over some tape, Stuck shots in their computer, cut (very) rough version, threw in some music, bypass all imaginative audio work or mixing, burned it directly to DVD, and threw it into the shelf of the video store. Every horror fan should be offended by this type of video work that is invalid for ANY skill or style. Just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get a bit of a picture on the tape doesn't mean it should be published. If I could give this rating lower than ONE, I'd do it.
