I saw the movie when it came out. Now let's see - the guy who used to ski on Mount Fuji is able to accumulate money and hire staff to document what surface sounds look like a brave and bold act - to go down the top of the world. Well - And Here Are the Spoilers - What Happens to See, After a large crew of people manages to get to the top - and life is lost in the contract - gets on the skis, he manages a very short path on which place his PARACHUTE OPENS ... and that's it. And instead of firing shots to hide this incredibly anti-clutter ending in an embarrassing debacle, the guy goes forward and releases him. SPOILER ENDS I admire the amazing courage and effort the movie crew had to bring to get some of the amazing shots they got. OTHER SPOILER - Oh yes, one of the Sherpas is killed by falling into a crack. The narrator who quotes "daredevilly remarks, that according to the Sherpa religion, because this man's body cannot be restored, his soul will roam the world forever and never know the rest. It is worth it, the narrator thinks." he replies - because it served the purpose of letting this clown "ski down Everest." I don't remember ever seeing a more cheerful piece of celluloid.
