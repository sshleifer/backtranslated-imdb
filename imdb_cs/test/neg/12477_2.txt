In 1994, the Power Rangers became a huge franchise and t.v. US Network managers hoped to get into action and come up with Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters from Beverly Hills, in which the evil Emporer Gorganus, who seems to have a home made costume by Darth Vader, and his talking bird, which looks like a rubber toy Chewing, coming to the ground and attacking it with giant monsters that look like a rejection from Godzilla's 70s movie. Fortunately, a Nimbar stranger who looks like a giant piece of clear jelly recruits four teenagers to defend the country, Nimbar gives them each tattoo a different star constellation that allows them to transform into enthusiastic superheroes who look like dancers of the eighties. music videos, they could also join in a huge knight. Forty episodes were made. The US network did not have the money to try to adapt the show from Japan as a Power Rangers, and created this show on its own using a 1950s scifi movie. Battle scenes are general, special effects are bad, and some of them look like they can fall. The actors have largely realized how ridiculous the show is, and they have largely tucked it in and out. I can only imagine their shock when the show was canceled.
