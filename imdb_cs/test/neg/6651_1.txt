This film is absurd. Absolutely terrible. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia really need to work on this movie. The story is not entirely believable! Michael Keaton agrees to donate the bone marrow to the dying son of the detective, but then escapes. He can avoid the police in the whole hospital - unbelievable that he has so much knowledge about the hospital. He chooses an extremely complex path to get out of the hospital, blows up electricity generators and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And above, Andy Garcia (the dying boy's father) and the doctor help the criminals get the bone marrow. The story is such a balloon! Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen.
