Well, that got my nerves off, they were right. I rented this movie for the first time in the 1980s when a friend of mine opened a video rental shop that carried every precious film he could find. He also carried all the shock, horror, and exploitative movies he could dig, and I went through almost all of them. Previously I saw the Blood Feast and the 2000 Maniacs and Gore Guide. They were fearsome (mainly for a time period), and the sorcerer Gore was pretty ugly. However, Gore-Gore girls were the ones I remember the most disgustingly bloody. <br /> <br /> A while ago I rented them on DVD because I wanted to hear a comment and I think it might be some cool dancing and clothes. I forgot that it was made in the early 1970s, so fashion had a little downhill before that. I also realized that it was a movie that I didn't really have to see more than once. She had fun parts, but gaaaah! It was much more disgusting than I remembered. I'm very tired of the movie, but I got too far a few times and had to turn away. It wasn't a good movie selection to make the DVD all sharp and cleaned with better sound and picture quality. The commentary is fun in parts, and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6100.00) Maybe HG Lewis didn't feel good that day but sounded tired overall and had the courage to offend when the interviewer from Something Wild Compare It's Ed Wood Jr. I'm sorry, buddy, but you're not exactly Martin Scorsese himself. Extremely thin plot is about a series of topless go-go dancers in strip clubs. A cute reporter and a truly uninteresting private detective will unite (as if he doesn't seem to be able to build it) to try to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman owns strip strip club. There was a bunch of really ugly murders. I apologize beforehand because I don't want it to look like I have to shine, but this movie was so misogynistic that I was more than a "Men's Society". Especially because the main character and director's extreme dislike of women - and the audience - emanates from each frame. It's not just murders. A highly unattractive detective comes out of the way to treat every reporter like a dog dirt on every occasion, for no apparent reason (it's not a George Clooney threat as I said) and still follows him as a puppy. She faints when she sees a terribly disfigured body and he looks disgusting at her, then pours the cold soda out of the can on her face to wake her up. Later, she calls the police to report the crime - "No ... no rush ... it just seems ... she lost her face." This guy is HERO. You can imagine how other characters feel about women. I could go on and on, but you have an idea. Please note that this film makes me much more politically correct (and much more fun) than it really is. Most actors are the type of actors you pray and never take your clothes off. Not too easy on your eyes so you don't have to watch a movie to see nudity unless you're too picky. All go-go dancers seem to desperately want to have a scene at the end, so they can get their $ 10 or whatever HG paid them and get their medication. OK, it's not that bad, there was one dancer who seemed to be a professional and also one other great dancer with a huge afro who didn't look as miserable as the others, but still wasn't very excited. The only fun things were a few moments of brief, unintentional humor, for example, when police officers in charge of the murder scene scream angrily, "Get out here before I arrest you all!" not to a bunch of reporters, but to any other policeman calmly about their work (they mutter and walk away, though). But Henny Youngman is a bit funny, as Lewis says, saying his lines so fast they almost needed headlines (I'm sure he's trying to hurry all day to pay and get to hell out of it, even though he doesn't seem to wanted to watch naked chicks). It could be worth seeing just from the morbid curiosity - for the era when the movie was made, it was probably the most horrible thing on the film at the time - or if you're a really big fan of HG Lewis and find it or low-budget movie-making someone fascinating. Otherwise, if you've seen it once, you've seen it and you can move on to other nasty but much more fun low budget movies from the early 1970s ... this movie won't even come close, say, "Pink Flamingos" when it comes to o skip-the-popcorn factor. If you've never seen a HG Lewis movie, I recommend you first try "Blood Feast", you'll have a much better time. <br /> <br />
