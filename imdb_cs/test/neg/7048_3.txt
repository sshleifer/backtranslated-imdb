My wife and I were watching this movie because we are planning to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately) the landscape and landscape (complete with tuna) are the only believable members of this cast. We expected a reasonable, well-written and well-played film, but we were disappointed. Her only redeemable grace is a widespread and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity: throwing tuna, nets, wooden boats with long oars and passionate, superstitious fishermen. The sequencing movie is stagnant, its dialogue Stilted, and acting ranges from stiff to totally "over-the-top." One scene in which Bergman points out that her macho, a native and naive husband, his ferret on an "innocent" (but apparently already deceased) rabbit would be perfect for Monit Python skit. When the volcano blew out, we were hoping for a merciful end to suffering (ours and litters). Unfortunately, the film continues and finally sets out on a melodramatic and absurd end. If you're really into ancient tuna fishing, pass this hokey effort.
