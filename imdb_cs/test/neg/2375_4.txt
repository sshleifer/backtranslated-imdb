It's not terrible, but what about waste ... Lousy gags, bad music, bad drawings and animations ... <br /> <br /> As for the impressive number of animators and intervallists in this picture One hundred different studios around the world? Come on, how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie this way!) I wonder if one person on credits = one drawing! The lines are rough, 3d work inadequate (I'm not against it, but not in this movie) But the background is right. The plot is somewhat stupid, far from the BD's precise cleverness and, of course, aimed at an international audience. The distribution of film around the world does not mean that everyone in the world behaves like an ordinary person ... The cultural object is much more interesting when it comes to a foreign film (in this case French). it gets worse!) <br /> <br /> Some new things are doing well (Olaf's character, sometimes as a stone explanation, but it's not great), but modern links are irritating (music, SMS-not even verbal a joke, just a stupid bird named short message service: does anyone know the imagination?). But, hey, it's M6 / TPS production with some Celine Dion in it ... pathetic. Asterix is ​​underestimated and Obelix is ​​talking too much. Goudurix might be great (as in the book), but he's too clearly a "cool guy" who has a love affair (with an uninteresting female character). In fact, only the Vikings (except the guide) are funny. Too many actions, not enough laughter. The best part of the film is the final credits. It's not music, but the few photos it contains. BD style. Well, certainly, Asterix is ​​not designed to move!
