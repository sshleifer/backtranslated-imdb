This movie is off Horrible to avoid all the cost! I want my hour and 20 minutes back !!! It's not funny ALL you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once. Oaths pour out of the speakers like a waterfall, each one more annoying as the last one and not contributing to the OR plot fence (general comedy - not this film in general). Everyone in all, his lame-and $ 5, watered-down -typed- "Out Cold" ish movie - But incredibly awful. The film focuses on two groups of the city of Poories and Richies (as is obviously stupid, isn't it?), Where both opposites have snowboarding battles. (the story is similar to a four-year story without all the oaths and stupid jokes) MOVIE - 1/10 - because you can't give any lower scores
