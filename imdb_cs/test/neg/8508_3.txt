At first I am a huge Tolkien fan and as one of them I will base most of my critics on his books. <br /> <br /> The film is a standard adventure film that is superbly crafted with clever special effects, nice track and gentle play. If this film was called something other than the Lord of the Rings, the reviews would not be as good as they are here. The problem with the movie is that it takes the basic story from Tolkiens book, but then it goes and "hollywoods" everything that can, numerous scenes from the book are lighter missing or a lot of changes, characters are changed from Books also, a thing that I think should be criminal! What the movie is missing is a deep insight into the characters in it, I know it's almost impossible to make a good movie out of a good book, and it didn't work here, which is mainly the motivation of the characters being left hazy at the best. As an adventure film it will rate 7+ / 10 As an adaptation of Tolkien it rates 2/10 <br /> <br /> I mean honestly what on Earth was Arwen on rivendell ford? And as for the comments that this movie is "the best", I can only say that you are much younger or have seen good movies ... <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson was to call this movie an adventure film based on Lord of the Rings.
