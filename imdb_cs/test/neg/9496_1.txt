I have never felt the need to add a review on this website until now, but when I was just in the movie, I felt it necessary to warn parents who thought they could show it to their children. Please no! This is no Disney movie. This film tells us that life is cruel, and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you too. The video box describes the film as "a pleasure for all ages", and the outline of the IMDb chart describes it as a "family movie". All I had to do was find a definition of "family film" and I came across the following: "Usually it is a comedy or adventure, these films are often based on children's literature and can include any number of useful animals, friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds, all focused to stimulate and attract the imagination, whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and generally learn the lessons on the way. It is not a concise description of Tarka Vydra, which contains several thoroughly unpleasant scenes, totally unsuitable for small children, and the end that qualifies this film as "feeling bad". The lesson? As I said, life is cruel. Family Fun? I do not think so. If you hate your family, it is. Another review that is more revealing than this, but worth reading, can be found using the "external reviews" link.
