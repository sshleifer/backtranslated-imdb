Like many other people, I caught my dung while surfing the canals. It's a horror movie, set in the woods, has a stupid title, but hey "Michael Rooker" is in it, and he was part of some big horror swings, I know he wouldn't do me wrong ... Ugh! The most offensive part of it is that I actually watched it. I see director Johnny Martin is a stuntman, but this stunt just sucks and how he got to some of the actors who have this watery motion of the gut is the greatest mystery of everything ... I understand Casper Van Dien, but shame on you, sir . Rooker. Your reputation in the horror community has been destroyed forever and your agent should be fired immediately. I'm sure this nugget fecal material is available on DVD, but if you like the 99 cents menu at McDonalds, you should get more for your money.
