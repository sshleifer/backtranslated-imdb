Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known in his homeland for at least his Japanese gangster films of the series, with which the film shares many features. Violence and political intrigue are both Shogun's samurai and non-honor and human battles, and both have a leading character who finds his loyalty questioned by betrayal. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have a small purpose, but to die, and because so little is done for their development, their deaths have little impact when they come. This film has other drawbacks. Make-up, costumes and sound design are scattered poor and battle scenes were also non-standard, worse than other samurai movies from previous years (seven samurai come to mind). Sonny Chiba plays Sonny Chib in a samurai shogun samurai, a master swordsman who goes through the film and frowns menacingly. What is this guy? he even gets an eye patch. If you were expecting to see the legendary Toshir Mifune, you may be disappointed; his appearance is a little more than a portrait, and when his character seems to do something interesting, he disappears. Overall, the film's strengths are a story that is infinitely more comprehensible than gangster films and challenges that represent the traditional concept of good and evil. Two brothers are demanding to the throne of their recently departing father, who had some help out there. At first, it looks like we are dealing with several characters who could not be more clearly good and evil; After all, the older brother stutters and has a birthmark, a certain sign of a villain. Eventually, however, it is clear that in the power struggle that takes place, the winner is without heroes and villains, only winners and losers.
