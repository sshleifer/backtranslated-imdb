A giant praying mantis wakes up from her sleep in the articula area and heads south to cause confusion. Ships, airplanes and trains meet their struggle with the flying creature. Before unleashing his full anger at NYC, the mantis meets his destiny in the hands of the armed forces in the New York Tunnel. Of course, the special effects are rough according to today's standards, but for the ten-year-old boy in 1957 it was very memorable. Cast William William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway.
