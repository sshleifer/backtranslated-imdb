Here is definitely an average Italian post apocalyptic take on hunting / killing people for ala theme's most dangerous game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and Running Man. Fun as the other mentioned items and is further pulled by a bad voice over work, generally insignificant action sequences, an amount totally free of tasty scenes such as prolonged rape sequences and some truly silly and illogical points in the world. Take, for example, the end of the film when our hero infiltrates a mixture of criminals. At first he kills the guard and leaves him in the jeep. After discovering the dead body, will the villains answer? (considering that our hero murdered them all brutally)? They decide to wait until next morning to look for the perpetrator (!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> However, I think it is fair, although the film may remain observable if you can suspend your distrust of such stupid scenes and immensely benefit from the presence of always excellent Woody Strode (even though his time on screen is very limited) It is not a classic of any imagination, but just a worthy watch for Italian B enthusiasts -Movie.
