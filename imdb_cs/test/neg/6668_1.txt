I felt I had to add a comment after I saw the breathing blast of the second comment. I was taken to see this film as a child by my unconscious parents, expecting normal Norman wisdom, a cheerful comedy. Instead of what you get, this crazy British sexiest comedy is the worst kind, where Norman (Norman!) Is playing a swinger, whose goal is to get as many birds out as possible. Absolutely typical of this genre - badly filmed and acted without the appearance of a scenario over the worst kind of double, and very vague hints of 'nothingness'. And all this on the special grain film collection, which is reserved for British low-budget films. The only memorable thing is the unpleasantly catchy melody on a theme that still appears in my brain after 30 years. Finally, in the last scene, you can also look at Norman naked - running through the sand and frozen. I think that's the way - at that moment my mother pulled me out of the cinema. I saw it again, many years later, and guess what it was, it was still horrible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan or interested in a little man and his career, you will apply the 10-foot-bargepole rule. Believe me, you don't have to see the back of Norman Wisdom.
