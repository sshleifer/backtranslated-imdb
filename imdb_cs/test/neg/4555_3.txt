Dean Cain, this time Super-Man, plays Max Hooper's super-thief. He can break into any company and steal any thing at the right price. Unfortunately, his last robbery ends him at a height where someone gave fire to cover up his own attempts to steal the product. The thief now has to become a hero to save everyone in the building. Unfortunately, the second thief is still in the building and F.B.I. & C.I.A. are outside waiting for Max. The film is barely clear. Dean Cain is an entertaining actor and thanks to his improved material he is doing much better, but here he is saddled with a weak script and in the wrong direction.
