The actor felt like you were looking at a kindergarten game. The story is full of holes and gaps and skips so you don't know what just happened. Half of the scenes are useless. There is no hint of character development. The score / soundtrack consists of approximately three tracks, one of which is played in approximately 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I rented the movie, but I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs if you don't want to see some decent actors give terrible performances. Most of the budget seems to have been spent on putting a few names tag actors in this less than bad movie. This movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club, trying to get you excited and captivated, but just as you think something will become your thrown into some unrelated scene and let you figure out how you got there.
