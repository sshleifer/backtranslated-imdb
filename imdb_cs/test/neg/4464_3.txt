In this desperate and thoroughly silly attempt to keep Hammer's Dracula franchise alive despite losing much of his power long ago, our legendary vampire is brought back to life in a swinging London in 1972. Exactly a hundred years after his archenemy Van was destroyed Helsing, an occult pupil named Johnny Alucard (getting it? Get it?) Gathering his wonderful friends in an abandoned church, among them Van Helsing is a grand granddaughter of Jessica, and performs a satanic ritual that resurrects Dracula in a haze of smoke. Dracula's only mission is to thwart the entire Van Helsing Line, and the fragile Jessica is the ideal victim to do so. That's probably the only 70's movie that goes tremendously over the top in an effort to look like a 70's movie! In view of the previous six films that were in the Victorian era, director Alan Gibson is really trying to emphasize the fact that we are in the 20th century, and so his film enriches the unbearable hippie characters, the nasty fashion trends of the 1970s and the horrific 70 years. music. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing seem hopelessly lost in this environment, and unfortunately their performance shows. Flashback and showdown climaxes are quite pleasant, but everything in between is painfully boring and totally contradictory. The greatest elements in this series of films have always been the dark castles of Dracula and the exciting coaching races. Fortunately for fans, the contemporary Hammer Studios has released other films on vampires that are much better ("Vampire Lovers", "Evil Twins", "The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires"?). Not recommended.
