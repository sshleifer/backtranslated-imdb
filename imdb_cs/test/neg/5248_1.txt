Renting this movie directly on video I didn't expect amazing cinema. (Not to mention just because the movie is in the movie.) Only a very loosely followed story translated in an epic poem, this film provides a unique view of the story of monsters and super people. General photography can be summarized as conflicting, with its mixture of medieval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max). With the rock and techno soundtrack to start off, you get a little broken. Combat scenes, though incredible, are fun, and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting combinations of weapons I've ever seen on film, though often unflinching. The special effects used for the Grendel monster are surprisingly effective and are one of the few peaks. Christopher Lambert brings average performance like Beowulf. It will be nowhere near as memorable as the Highlander, but at least it was not as poor as the fortress. The support cast is rather neutral. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good action adventure story with a complex and engaging plot, I wouldn't suggest this movie. However, if you want a movie that is of little importance, full of battle scenes in the camp and a somewhat predictable chart, find a copy of it.
