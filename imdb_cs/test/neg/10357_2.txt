Some people say that the show was good in the early years! I disagree with everyone. The show is just stupid and pathetic. My mom hates it, I hate it, my father hates it, I don't know about my sister, but good. Here are a few reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1. CHARACTERS: Children who are used as adult-style figures are stupid. Children are simply premature and uncomfortable. Adult adults and adults are stupid and unconventional. The worst figure is that Angelica Pickles (she really does it for your ear drums when you have a long, hard and unhappy day at the office) and also that Kimi Finster, who appears later; is too optimistic and pain in the ass. She can't decide where is French or Japanese: it doesn't matter; You are an American citizen and you know! What I'm talking about, all the characters from this show suck! 2. STORIES: Stories are unoriginal and silly. Do it as if the kids were on a big adventure, yeah in the backyard. In one episode, the little goofy dude, Tommy Pickles Leader broke into a TV control room and almost literally destroyed him. Don't give children any idea to break the normal control room of T.V (paying them a lot of money in real life). I can imagine what broadcasters have to feel about broadcasting this episode, they will probably start looking at their machines all day when they are afraid that the child will brake. Sad! 3. The show has been going on for many years and people are still creating stories and new series and spin-offs. Get out! The Simpsons went almost as long, but they are much better and more fun than children. The show is simply overestimated! People where your common sense is! Anyway, I was surprised by T.V Stations all over the world want to broadcast this series today. The show is absolutely junk and should never be made. Two movies for this cartoon sucked as well! 2/10
