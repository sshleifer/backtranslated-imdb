I expected this movie to be originally before the election. CBS is the last shot to throw a kick on Bush. This movie was still horrible, but I'm still watching it. ** Minor Spoiler ** I think CBS has the same people who "provided" memo it to do a semi cut in half sequence. What's the story of a bad friend? Acting can be more inventive or dialogue rather like Ed Wood. Who ever came up with this scenario, please do us a favor to stop writing. If you want to see decent B grade movies then see the earthquake, flood etc. Avoid this movie mess. A tip for CBS to not tell us this crap. Instead, give us CSI again. Better action and more credible.
