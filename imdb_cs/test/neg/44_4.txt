Rather lame teen slasher from Brisbane. While the plot is based on a fairly decent idea, writing is deeply lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden. The problem is that children have to go through with their plan, that they have to be much more reckless than it is shown, but if it were the devil-maybe-care, it might be difficult for them to be sympathetic, so they wouldn't really be. In fact, I only started enjoying the movie when I wished their death. One of those films where about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realize we wouldn't have a movie if they did, but it would be nice if we could believe it wasn't really. Avoid.
