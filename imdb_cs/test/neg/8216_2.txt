Okay, don't make a mistake - that's a pretty horrible movie, but I actually thought it had a few scary scenes and overcame its pathetic budget. At the very least, it is unintentionally funny in spots and has some air of scary and discomfort (a scene that burns, a part with a spoiled bride). <br /> <br /> This child falls into the category of "so bad it's fun", so I'd give him a star. The effects are terrible, acting is bleak and the whole thing seems to have been shot in the day. At the beginning you also have to love the toy! It brought childhood memories that he saw it on late night television many years ago. While Alpha DVD printing looks faint and as if it was recorded directly from an old TV or something, I liked it in this case!
