... and I bought a Vampire The motorcycle staggers the line as a drunk with laces tied together. Some "bad" movies are very enjoyable (like Norman J.Warren's Inseminoid), some "bad" movies are just bad (such as Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but "bad" movies that try to be postmodernist badly conscious should always be approached with extreme caution. Many people think that Troma is Terror Firmer, for example, a bad taste masterpiece, but I guess anyone at the age of 19 will shrug like a worthless dreck. Then there's the dark star of John Carpenter. Yes, it's quaint, and certainly the product of its time, but as a movie it's just two notches above worthless. This no-budget British black comedy-horror trip seeks to achieve a satirical tone, with its endless references to his fellow shocking splashing splashes (among them Psychomania, Horror Hospital and almost nothing Pete Walker), but due to poor performances in the second - TV series actors (the front lady looks like Amy Winehouse), a script that seems to be written on the back of a peeled beer by two "boys" without understanding how film comedy works, Dean Friedman (intentionally?) Elevator-rock soundtrack and production values ​​never go beyond average, pure result is a movie that can only be mixed by AT rather than s. If your idea of ​​being an anthropomorphic turf, Chinese kiosks called Fu King and links to long forgotten TV ads, you'll enjoy it but don't expect too much.
