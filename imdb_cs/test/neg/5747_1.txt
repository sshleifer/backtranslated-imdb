He called a sick job - watching it in bed and it was so bad that I would go back to work if I could get out of bed. The dog ran away with the remote control so I was stuck. I'm sure the hammer took care of the eldest daughter to become his beeeatch. Fearful to watch - made me vomit more than what I was doing. So here you go - that would be a movie that will play in Hell's waiting room before you go inside. Or maybe your stranded movie for eternity with kids Hart. Just remember to take your gun with you.
