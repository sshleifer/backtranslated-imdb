This home movie is basically a scandalous waste, but you have to give them 3/10 a try. Blood is garbage, but Grandma, who kills them, is pretty fun and I think the concept is good and make-up is fine for a home movie. However, thank God it was only 55 minutes, and the twist at the end is literally a Fight Club (as in almost like a waste as a movie). Just read this comment, don't watch the movie.
