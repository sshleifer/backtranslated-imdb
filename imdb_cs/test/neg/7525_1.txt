Guy Pearce looks and works as a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo boys who wears Levi's jeans and stands in front of a buffalo flock because they realize Buffalo is also a Levi. In every scene Guy Pearce seems to say, "Look at me, I'm so nice!" As a hero, his character is a total wolf. In every scene that calls for courage, Pearce gets the short end of the pole. SPOILERS: At the end of the movie, however, this creepy book-worm-figure releases a pack of Morlocks baboon that can run and jump on walls (like Spiderman). At the same time, it seems that TIME MACHINE is causing a nuclear explosion of some kind that wipes out the entire valley. Surprisingly, though Pearce and his gal-pal Mumba are about a footprint from the last Morlock who is killed; Seconds later, Pearce, Mumba and the tribe watch the valley rise from the safety of its mountain. Now it's FAST RUNNING !!! Jeremy Irons as King of Morlocks is great. In fact, it makes the film much better than it was. Mumba, a model-turned actress is not very cute, and she does not play much in this movie. The 19th century scenes have no real atmosphere. Even though period dresses and vehicles are shown, characters act as caricatures of how people think they walk and talk. The original version of this film was much better in this respect. The characters of the period were much more realistic and were much better actors. The original version of this film made PAST look like a real base of the characters. This new version lacks the essence and feel. The scenes in which Pearce deals with Emma's death and then can't save her from her fate are very good. The question of Morlocks being cannibals is not very well explained, and it does not make sense that they have any great dark butcher shop full of knives and cutlery, yet they are never seen using any weapons except for blow-dart. Also stupid is a huge pit full of water and bones. Throughout the underground, Morlocks are walking around chewing on fleshy bones. So how can all those skeletons be in the pit? Looks like there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their people and eat them out of the grill, and more Morlocks just like fillet meat ?? And where are the toilets for all these creatures? As I watched dozens of Morlocks who were devouring the human body, I thought they had to have a very advanced toilet and plumbing system because they thought they were throwing themselves into lots of bones. All these questions have never been addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce holds Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her boyfriend, Mandingo. One more irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop music of LION KING, which is in the background. As soon as Pearce arrives in the future (802 710 a.d.); LION KING's music will never stop, and every time there are natives in the neighborhood, there is the African Moaning Singer (it's Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?), who starts wailing and moaning over the jungle of LION KING. I watched credits at the end of the movie and jungle music is not specifically identified, but I think Elton John should probably look into this. Time Machine was an average movie with some good FX. You see it once, then forget it.
