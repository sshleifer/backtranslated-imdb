I went to this movie that I like. I usually like dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc. I got into this movie because I was at the edge of my seat. Plus, I'm a big Pacina fan. <br /> <br /> What a waste. Perhaps the worst movie I've seen in five years. This makes Pacino debacle in Any Sunday actually look good. First, half of the film follows Matthew McConaughey. OK, we'll get it. You have the shape of Matt. We don't need to see every other scene with you pumping iron, no shirt. Second, how many holes are there in this movie? Why introduce a phone call from Brandon's long-lost father and never address him again? What was the meaning of his mother hovering on him - why even telling her that he was sending too much money - what was it? The guy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? Given that sports betting is illegal in NY and its recognition illegal, how can they guarantee a bet at the end? It was just a very badly written script. It had potential, but it lacked a coherent graph. I thought Pacino had learned his lesson about scripting after Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My Gosh, this is the same actor who played in the godfather! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
