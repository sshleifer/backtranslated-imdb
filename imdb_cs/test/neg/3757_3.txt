You have to hand him over to writer-director John Hughes. With great success behind him in the genre of misfit-teenager / high school, he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy and find a great ally in ally actor John Candy. Here, a goofy adult Candy becomes a better person after agreeing to watch his brother wiseacre kids; it is a certain formula that will delight both cynical teens and their parents, and it is no wonder that the movie was the winner of the theater audience. Still, Hughes relies almost entirely on Candy's magic to end the script, and one can eventually grow tired of repetitive gags with a star in front and in the middle. Children are sitcom-smart, other adult formless spots, and Amy Madigan is too intense, too upset when Uncle Buck's girlfriend plays. Later he became a TV series that fits because the material was already TV-perfect. * 1/2 from ****
