Hello - I normally like movies. I am 19, I have seen many and I don't like just one or two. But this time, when it was over, I had to pull out my sister (who wanted to see it) by the arm and I started to laugh when I got out because it was such a ridiculously horrible movie. Why it was horrible: - all the cows had a udder, especially the SMALL with udders - none of the characters were unique or engaging, except perhaps the main Coyote Dag - the idea of ​​keeping cows watches against coyotes are simply ridiculous - "funny" moments are repeated and become simply the succession that makes the last - there were no cooperation topics to be present at the end. Instead, people get the impression: Well, I'll take it all to myself and in this case, I was lucky that my friends decided to support me without my knowledge - all moments similar to the lion king (as shown below) They were out of luminosity, even even for children's film. The hyenas, with Dag, head of Coyote, being equivalent to Scar) The farm falls into chaos, Odis (cow, though basically Simba) wants to play around, and is shocked that his father died, believing it was his fault (though in This movie, it was his mistake), confronts Coyotes and gets ass ass, after which Dag tells him to leave, and on the verge of leaving, Odis somehow decided to go and save some chickens and his friends back him up (of course a complete surprise leaves, without knowing that they will help him). Other things from King Lion: stars moving around as a sign, figures of a father referring to stars / signs in a mystical loving way, apparently the circularity of how Father Ben found Odis and took care of him, and how to at the end of Odis's love interest, he has a similar experience. Birth at the end? GOOD GOD, what the hell ... and even similar music that seems to be completely laced at the end because it's completely different from the previous one. Honestly, this is the first movie I ever saw where I was really rooting for bad guys - I never understood what other people are saying until now. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Don't waste your time going to see it. Convince the kids not to see it, and watch the left king. Either that or take them to Ant Bully, who was creative and artistic.
