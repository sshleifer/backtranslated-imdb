The supposed writer and director, Mr. Dhawan, has copied almost the entire Hollywood movie "HITCH" with Will Smith. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The storyline was just embedded in a copy and some low humor (probably Mr. Dhawan's own creation) and frequent dances were added to make the movie's time to local standards. Although Salman Khan and Govinda have acted some smiles, however, this does not suit legendary artists like them to become part of plagiarism, especially when they tell people to stop buying pirated discs!
