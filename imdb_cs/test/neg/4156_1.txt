Many times the description is "full of sound and fury, which means nothing" and is right on the target. Unfortunately, "Code 46" lacks both sound and fury. A little fury would be greatly appreciated. The figure of Tim Robbins (William) is so disgusting that the idea of ​​his fall in love with Mary (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so passionate that one starts to wonder if the possible water supply of this future world is complemented by thorazine. There is a "Brave New World" kind of atmosphere to the movie that is helped along with each scene being shot about 2-3 stops overexposed. Unfortunately, this technique is tedious and rather hard on the eyes. Cutesy mishmash languages ​​also grow tedious when there seems to be no obvious reason for its existence. Many futuristic, scifi movies are criticized for being all flash and no stuff. This film has no flash or substance. It's code 6 all the way.
