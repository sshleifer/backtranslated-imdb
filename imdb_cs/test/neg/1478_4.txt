But again, I see myself as the only person on planet Earth who is able to criticize Japanese films made before 1970. "Fires on the Plane" (1959) is another in a seemingly endless series of "classics" that receive all kinds of praise for no obviously good reason . Just as I like to regenerate and psychoanalize all those viewers who have such horrible tastes in the film, it is still almost impossible to rationalize why anyone would think that poorly made fluff like this one should be declared some kind of "Masterpiece". Indeed, ironically, fans of "classics" derivatives, such as "Fires on the Plane", have so much focus on "inside the box" filmmaking (orthodox classification standards such as script, acting, camera, etc.). "classics" is the most inadequate in these standards. For example, one of the most beautiful laypersons for filmmakers involves forced verbal exposure, where characters basically explain everything to the viewer, even if the scenario created is completely artificial. Most surprisingly, the first scene in "Fires on the Plane" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme. After a funny head smack, the following unnecessary dialogue attacks the viewer, "Why can't you landed west under a heavy fire to strengthen the troops in Tacloban, we lost two thirds of our men and our artillery was sunk in transit , we tried to go to Burauen airport by crossing the central mountains, but without artillery it was the enemy counterattack forced the fanout across the valley, so why, exactly, is one character telling another character something he already knows? they are too lazy to imagine more natural ways of communicating this information, and you see that a quality film would actually show these events happening or, at worst, would be a dialogue involving one character who doesn't have these events no knowledge, damn, even the introductory summary in the form of a paragraph that focuses on the viewer would be better than what appeared here. Such cases of poor filmmaking are strewn all over "Fires on the Plane" to where this film feels like being written by an imbecile for imbecily. For example, a leading figure encounters some skeletons wrapped in Japanese clothing. Instead of doing a natural thing like ??? Oh I don't know? Giving a depressed mannerism, the character exterminates "Japanese soldiers." Thanks to a friend, but I could imagine being one for myself. Worse still, this movie is saturated with too dramatic tricks. The funniest scene includes shoes. Imagine this. The soldier walks together and finds a pair of worn out shoes. One would think such a finding is useless, but it turns out that the soldier's shoes are in even worse condition, so he picks up his worn-out shoes and leaves SUPER shoes on. Well, I got it. The soldiers are in a rough state? The fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn out shoes to begin. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let her go until the second soldier came! See, they find that the previous soldier has SUPER worn out shoes and announcements? get ready because it comes here? that his shoes are SUPER DUPER worn out shoes! Lucky man, he lifts SUPER worn boots and leaves shoes SUPER DUPER. But you see, that's not all? because then comes the Third Soldier! He finds out that previous SUPER DUPER soldiers wore shoes and inspected them, along with their own SUPER DUPER shoes. Because both couples suck, throws them aside and smiles as they continue barefoot. At this point I was ready to throw the TV through the window of my living room. Heavy handedness, overdramaticism, and the most absurdity of this succession is beyond poor filmmaking. It's SUPER DUPER bad movie-making. There are several similar, totally silly moments to be. Just as the lead character asks someone, "Hey, are you dead?" Just like the guy answers "Yes," if he really kicks a bucket. I will also be the first to condemn the performance of a leading actor who is the basic poster for an artificial response. During that opening head, I laughed, where his head opened in place with this stupid, goofy look on his face. The fact that this trivial piece of hair gets an average IMDb of 8.4, while a certifiable masterpiece like "The Story of Two Sisters" (2003) just gets 7.5 is the height of foolishness. And to think that some people are actually deceiving themselves when they think "AToTS" doesn't make sense. Well, not every movie can have absolutely outrageous SUPER DUPER shoes on its side.
