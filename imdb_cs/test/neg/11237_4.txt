I just captured this movie on TCM and I understand why George Murphy went into politics if it was the best MGM could serve him. It's so slow that trying to make it truly film-like noir looks. It featured two of my favorite <br /> <br /> players in Eve Arden (totally unnecessary) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the movie), but what really struck me was that the front lady Frances Gifford went through 90 years. minutes (it looked longer!) without changing the look on her face - her fainting scene was comic. John Hodiak played his part of OK, but the script left him, as did the rest of the cast, very badly. I gave it 4 stars mainly for the photo. It would be in the first half of the Program, when it would be two functions.
