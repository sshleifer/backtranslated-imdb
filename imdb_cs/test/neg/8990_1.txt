This fantasy was utter waste. I thought Michael Moore had covered the market for ridiculous anti-government movies, but this was far worse than he ever did. Not surprisingly, British media critics complain that it is powered by tabloid journalism. This movie is the left wing of the greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen. Anyone who would be a bit angry should be appalled that he should be funded. However, I am sure it will be good in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. It's hard to believe that these days, mad Muslims who kicked out innocent commuters are anyone in U.K. who thinks Britain should give up in the war on terror. I think it's no longer a country that I admired for 70 years ago standing alone against the Nazis. All hail Neville Chamberlain and pathetic concession policy!
