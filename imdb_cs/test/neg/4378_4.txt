Hero and horror is in my opinion slightly below average. Yes, Chuck is a real martial artist and kicks ass in this movie, but it's slow and acting in my opinion is largely below average, though Steve James is doing a decent job. Like my friend Ryan, I was confused as to why the psychopath decided to go to the theater at the end of the movie, rather than go to Norris's girlfriend. Until then, the killer only killed women. Well, I don't think it was as predictable as I thought. Definitely a movie you can pass on.
