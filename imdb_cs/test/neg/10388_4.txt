I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although Kristin Erikson did a great job playing an obsessed girl, I don't really think Isabelle, the character she was playing, was obsessed. I have seen that people have psychotic breaks as a result of sexual abuse, and never said whether their father actually abused her or not. I also had to follow some of her parts again to see what the letter was saying, what the character names were, and I'm still not sure what happened, whether they were real or not. . I'm trying to find the "original" story on which it is based and compare facts, but I can't find anything about it online. It wasn't a bad movie, but some of the dialogues were incredibly cheesy. Special effects wise, the film was not bad for grade B, largely, and those scenes they held, it was all worth it that ... that is if you have nothing better to do. LOL
