That's the boring, pretentious and stupid movie I've seen for a long time. I saw it at the Beverly Hills Academy and there were a lot of people in the hall looking for shelter. They all shook their heads solemnly and looked as if they were at a funeral. This is a waste of time and money. Even worse are the critics who gave this flashy prospect a good review. What's wrong with them? Are they afraid they won't be considered "hips"? Podplatili? This movie is incredibly bad. Do not take the date when you expect a detailed interview at Cheesecake to follow. If you see this movie, it was your idea, it will beat you and keep you for the rest of your life.
