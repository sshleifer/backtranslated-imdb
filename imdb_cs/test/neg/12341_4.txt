Director Michael Ritchie and the second documentary drama actor Robert Redford "Candidate" is a political satire that still seems fresh and relevant today. So it is a pity that "Downhill Racer", which was made shortly before, seems to be contrasting. Music is ugly and perhaps innovative ski sequences are now the norm in the television broadcast of this sport. The world of skis seems to be strangely amateurish (probably due to the time the movie was made, but it's hard to relate to today's professional world), and the Americans in Europe also seem to be stupid in the age of easier travel. Perhaps the biggest problem is the flat fence, aimed at the arrogant but mysterious hero; unfortunately it is the overwhelming performance of Redford, which gives us a little insight into his worries or motivations. A character-driven movie without much character is never a good bet. I expected a lot, but unfortunately it's a boring movie.
