Esperanto Is NOT Esperanto <br /> <br /> I've been watching this movie specifically because IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages ​​used. However, IMDb is wrong with the languages ​​used in this movie. Esperanto does not exist at all. It's almost all English with a few Navajo words. Don't look for this movie if you're looking for Esperanto movies. Other options instead are "Idiot's Pleasure" (with Clark Gable) which has a bit of Esperanto, "Incubus" is all Esperanto (though completely misproncated), and there are some Esperanto Street shows in Charlie Chaplin's "Great Dictator". It should have been assumed that there would also be some spoken Esperanto in Gattac, but I never heard anything. Besides, the second reviewer is right. This film is a complete mess. Spend time elsewhere.
