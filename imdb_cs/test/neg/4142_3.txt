This film was a thorough diappointment. The story did not develop. Viewers were thrown into the story without explanation and let themselves be taken care of to find out what was going on. The action sequences were fine, but confusing. They weren't Matrix and they weren't Crouching Tiger. This movie is best left to cable TV where you don't have to pay to see or convince a friend they should hire and then go and watch it. As a huge fan of Jet Li, I expected more. How can anyone involved with a long time ago in China give their name to this?
