I can't believe I let that piece of garbage be rented! The behavior was so poor that my grandmother could do better. The dies thrown into the movies were nowhere near the figure Scarecrow was knocking on the floor. The movie has become a chore to watch! So this group of baseball athletes decides to go for leaning, even if they don't order the coach to be in the aftermath. So naturally they go the same way. They decide to establish a loser on a post with the so-called "Scarecrow". When the best friend of the loser learns of it, they go to rescue him and his girlfriend. The boy is found to have diabetes and is hospitalized. day. The scarecrow finds them there and kills them all. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you really don't mind. In any case, Scarecrow ends up joining "Diabetes Boy" and the boy begins to finish the scarecrows as soon as the scarecrow is killed. Yes, it's really shabby. He thought this movie was full of bull sh * t. Sooner or later the only living (naturally) are a friend and girlfriend who are the main characters :) The evil is then transferred to a friend and killed, to break the curse, so no one else will be hurt. Touching hey? No, don't lose your hard earned money, I give it one score because it's the lowest, otherwise it doesn't deserve so much.
