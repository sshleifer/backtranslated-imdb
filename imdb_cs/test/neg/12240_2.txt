Comebacks is a spoof for inspirational sports movies, and let me tell you it's not good. Apparently, Tom Brady (director) found it cheerful to refer to sports movies (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! Airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a delicious job, you thought it was written for I found that if the director loves the genre, the film will be good, obviously Brady doesn't love the genre that is spoofing, this film is a messy piece of garbage that's not worth a tour, so you can't see it!
