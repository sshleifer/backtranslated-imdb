This movie would probably be good if they didn't use CGI (computer generated images) for werewolf scenes. It caused the creatures to look fake and werewolves looked cartoonish. CGI is great for certain effects like dinas in Jurassic Park or Twister.But when we see a movie Where Creation Must Look Absolutely Real, CGI is not the way to go. Look at the American werewolf in London.No CGI. Just make-up and mechanical creation and what you came up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel. This movie offered several gags that were fun to watch and humor in this The movie seemed to draw me, but it's no more than a movie that I thought OKAnd wasn't good enough. In my opinion, the American werewolf in Paris does not hold the original.
