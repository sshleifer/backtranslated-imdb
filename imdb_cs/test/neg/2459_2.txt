I don't have much in mind of the factors that others objected here - acting, lighting, and so on. These things were largely executed well enough to carry the film and put its points across. After all, it's just a horror movie. What I thought were the points themselves. Because it is a deeply moralistic film and its morale is deeply cheap. In fact, it is fundamentalist Christian morality, and that is a fundamentalist Christian film. Look at 'sins': <br /> <br /> * Sutherland's character chose a child at school when he was a preschooler, leading to his accidental death. * Baldwin's character used masculine subtlety, persuasion, and good looks to avoid quite a few women, some of whom were filming. Ooh, pig! How unhappy that women are such passive, powerless creatures that they have no complicity in this matter. Roberts' father returned from Vietnam to a drug addict, so he was ashamed of being caught for firing that he would kill. Yes, what a terrible sin! Why couldn't he become an alcoholic like everyone else? and Bacon's character chose another schoolboy. How awful! The fact that he was a child himself seems to count for nothing. Children seem to be divinely judged by adult criteria. Well, maybe many people support this level of moral absolutism. Certainly they seem to have gone unnoticed in the comments of this film. Everyone just buy something like that? At the very least, human laws treat children differently from adults and recognize that their ethical sense is partially shaped. This film has no such remorse, and I find it very problematic. Ditto the idea that women are helpless, fluffy creatures from the evil demands of young men. Or that a Vietnamese veterinarian for drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option. Pathetic.
