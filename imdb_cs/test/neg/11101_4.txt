After a mum at a local museum passes through a cat scan, a metal object in the brain reacts adversely to the procedure, releasing the spirit or phantom if you want a mummy, Belphegor. Due to the favorable circumstances, Lisa, who lives near the museum, finds herself in a bad spirit. Soon after, he steals the museum's Egyptian treasures under his nose. Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch a supernatural thief. This is quite practical if you have not seen any other "Belph√©gor" incarnations before. If you have, I recommend skipping this particular version because it can't help but pale compared to others despite nice locals and scenery.It plays like (slightly) a higher Sci-Fi Original movie, and I don 't really mean that it's a compliment.
