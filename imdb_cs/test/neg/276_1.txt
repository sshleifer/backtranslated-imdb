The man I loved is 11. Intelligent movie. All eleven characters were decisive for the robbery, because each of them had their own specialized skill that was needed to get out of the grand finale. What was the world of the oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I suppose it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones, but in fact she wasn't part of 11 when she tried to go out and work the whole movie against them? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones characters, a boring relationship with some of the original film that was thrown just to get some burns in the seats and watch the movie. With O-11, the gang was always one step ahead of Benedict (Garc√≠a). They always managed to outwit him. What happened here? Catching them after the tip-off and suddenly are all brave? The whole film is that they can get the money they stole and the interest to return Benedict for the robbery they took him three years earlier. So the next film is about to re-create courage and brains and get it back to pay for the first robbery? This film could only be achieved with Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 minutes of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene. Slowly moving movie, not energy first. I tried to enjoy it and I'm usually very happy, but I'm really disappointed. <br /> SPOILER !!! Twist - The whole movie didn't have to be done because the real robbery was done in front of everything you just saw in the last 2 hours. <br /> <br /> SPOILER END. Please wait for it to come on TV, or if you're a fan of the 2001 original, please don't look at it.
