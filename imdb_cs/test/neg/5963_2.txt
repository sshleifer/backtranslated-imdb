Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: The legendary South American goat sucking vampire, El Chupacabra, is a freelancer, feeding on anyone unhappy enough over his way. Animal Control Officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Chupacabra Expert / Author Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) are trying to track down the creature, but their progress is hindered by a pair of stupid cops, locals interested in getting the beast for fat rewards, and a few criminal scientists who want a monster for their experiments. El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even the fans of incredibly bad horror movies flood over a two-week taco. can try to sit. With my terrible scenario, terrible direction (not one but two talented hackers - Brennon Jones and Paul Wynn), a laughing dialogue and some of the worst actors who act pornography, I recommend this movie just like I drink tap water in Mexico . As Navarro and Starlina continue their investigations, viewers are treated to some incredibly weak gore, the worst book jacket in history, the most convincing dead person I see from the blinking corpse in Dr. Butcher MD, and a high-tech computer security system consisting of a keyboard nailed into place. To be fair, for a guy in a rubber suit, the monster himself is quite fearsome (hairy, with large claws and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but his appearance is little and far away, with more time for screen spent on boring rehearsals and torments of whiney officer Navarra than on the murderer of the antiquity titular creature (how many times is it necessary to see Navarro h.) and in paperwork on his bitche boss?). <br /> <br /> If, like me, you make the mistake of wasting hard earned money on this horrible latino leak (in my case it was a full 50p), consider using a disk as a tequila track instead of it they watched.
