Oh If he ever wanted to look at a supernatural thriller that would become a comedy, watch this movie <br /> <br /> This was a shocking movie because there were so many actors in it, but what do they do and how do they fit? Handling college scenes is like a school game where everybody comes to talk and then the next person gets infront <br /> <br /> Good reasons to laugh on the movie: 1) Akshay, Suneil, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi as College Students 2) Akshay Carries a Gun at College 3) Some Pathetic Pieces and SFX <br /> <br /> There are several other drawbacks such as why the snake does not store his rape lover and will it come so late? Also, because they don't just kill them all together? But finally he has to do 2 hours + movie so you have a tortorius movie <br /> <br /> It's a Painful Watch The movie was directed by Rajkumar Kohli who was an expert who made such movies in the past and had a successful recording of films like JAAN DUSHMAN (1979) and NAGIN Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's non-existent career Law of VIRODHI (1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR (1996) all the flops he tried to promote his son and also they cast big stars to notice his son, unfortunately nothing could help his son's career <br /> <br /> The film has several comic scenes, such as death scenes, as the actors are fit to fight after the snake was guessed Rajkumar Kohli's Bad Music is Bad <br /> <br /> This brings us to cast Akshay Kumar - ordinary things, has nothing to do, rather than stunts Suneil Shetty- awful Sonu Nigam - The Worst Deb Unik√°tn the prize goes, gives the cartoon actor a new meaning Aftabrable Arshad Warsi- nothing to do Sharad Kapoorbad Aditya Panscholi- irritating Sunny Deol- is comic in the scene when he comes to rescue Son LOL they are as usual Raj Babbar- hilarious for the wrong reasons that girls are terrible What brings us to Munish Kohli This guy has a huge figure, he is even stronger and taller than Akshay Kumar Sad that he stumbles like and with poor guy Akshay His voice is terrible , his expressions are painful The only thing he has to do in the movie is to wear glasses and make a bad face Rajat Bedi is terrible
