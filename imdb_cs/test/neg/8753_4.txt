Yes, the film is not a work of art, but when I first watched it, I was 10 years old, my parents were gone and I stayed with my two brothers. It was May 1970 (I know I found a note about a horror movie cycle that one network had). It's one of the liveliest memories I have with boys. We all ended up in one bed and covered our heads! Our first horror! We've been talking about it for years and laughing at that moment. They were horror movies. Nowadays horror movies are always the same. Or was it better when we were children looking forward without analyzing the storyline and the casting and the dialogues? Surely it was. But it's a great movie for me!
