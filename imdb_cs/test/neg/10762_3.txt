Although it is better than most movies made for television, "Buried Alive" is nothing but a story of revenge. There are so many plot holes in this, it's a wonder why screenwriters have not passed the series re-writes. The end has a nice twist on it, but it's hardly believable. Negotiations Jennifer Jason Leigh is amazing as always, but Tim Matheson's ham with cheesy one-liners, which resembles one of Jack Nicholson's "The Shining". Don't bother with this.
