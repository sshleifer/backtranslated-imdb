Humm, the Italian movie was played by David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I didn't expect too much to be honest and actually took even less than I expected. It doesn't mean that this movie is the worst I've seen because I watched worse than this, but the plot was most confusing and uninteresting for most of the time, and some good gore scenes are the only thing that saves it. Besides loving some special effects, they are really kitschy and bad. Now I just want to watch "Troll 3" by the same director, it certainly won't be worse than this.
