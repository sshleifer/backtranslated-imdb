This very forced attempt to merge Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (which is wildly overrated) is neither informative nor entertaining. Character development is arbitrary and incredible - especially in the last scene of criminals and a little boy, as other reviewers have noted. Also, a few humorous moments aside, the film is not as fun (black humor or otherwise) as the director thinks it is.
