Everyone remembers the first CKY, CKY2K etc? Back when it was about how to make crazy cool things than watching Bam Margera act like a douchebag, spoiled 5 years old, super / rock-star wannabes. The show was amazing, however, Bam's fame and wealth led him to believe that we now enjoy him childish and idiotic, more than the real things that were former ones. CKY2K. The acts are so repetitive, it's nothing new, except for the annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments ... The only things we see are Bam Marger, so he shows us how much he doesn't care how much money he got or anything. I really didn't mention much, except what CKY2K returned to us because of Bam suck .. <br /> <br /> I like watching Steve, Knoxville, etc. a thousand times more.
