A film that tries to say something and generally fails. Just as the exhausted academics who fill the film, they meander and replace the endless conversation (they seem to listen to it forever) for some action or direction of conspiracy. Unfortunately, this is one of the best examples of the Canadian language. The movie I've seen.
