My wife and I never made it to the movie. We thought it was a way to get into sloooowwww and many headlines. I understood that they needed them for Vietnam, but it took a long time to get out of Asia. It never did that they had hard times trying to get to America, but I wanted to see him and look for his father. Not in the end, but to form a relationship. I mentioned that it was slllloooowwwwww.I like to watch a movie to feel good, not sad at the end. They are the only ones who are watching. I'm renting a lot of netflix and now blockbuster, maybe 20% are worth seeing. I don't have my knees realism or facts just a movie that's fun and makes you feel good. Gary
