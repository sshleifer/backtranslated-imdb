J.S. Cardone directed a little-known 'Video Nasty' in 1982, entitled "The Slayer," and has since held a handful of feature films; including The Forsaken 2001 Vampire Film. His latest feature film, Wicked Little Things, boasts a conspiracy that sounds decent, as well as a haunted-looking poster that seems to be a memory of the surface a few years ago in relation to the movie that Tobe was to direct. Well, I think he felt that this was too similar to his stupid zombie mushroom movie 'Mortuary', so it changed. I don't even blame him for that. The story focuses on her mother and her two daughters, who move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. But what they don't realize is about a hundred years earlier; a group of children who were used as miners was trapped in a shaft. Of course this is not their end and they have managed to survive their suffering and now walk through the area in search of revenge? The film is basically a collection of clich√©s; from the youngest boy with an "imaginary friend", the mother who releases him and all the usual zombie trash. J.S. Cardone tries to get horror fans back to the side with shocks and cruel scenes (mostly with kids) but not enough. The story doesn't win at all and really reminds me of too many earlier Mortuary, and that's not a good thing (although Mortuary is actually a better film than this one). Action is not about what it would write at home; Lori Heuring is a decent looking as well as the eldest daughter of Scout Taylor-Compton; but it cannot provide interesting performance. Chloe Moretz is a little better than a regular child actor. The story is barely trustworthy and the scenario doesn't even bother to explain why children are attacking locals. It all boils down to a typical and somewhat boring ending and, overall, I have to say that if you know your horror movies then you can just skip!
