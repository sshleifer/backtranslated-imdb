It was so incoherent - it seemed that the jump from place to place - and the "thief" was obvious. He was a poor man (not to mention high school) "Less than Zero". I would like to pass this film because it has very little. So many questions remained unresolved, and that's fine - but the fact that it jumps to the point where you wonder what's going on is terrible. The voice is needed because the movie doesn't work alone. Avoid this movie, and watch something else about rich teen anxiety. I'm sure there are a lot of others who are watching. Don't waste your time.
