STAR RATING: ***** Inadmissible **** Very Good *** Okay ** Could you go out for a meal instead of * Avoid all the cost <br /> <br /> Story of Titular Adam (Mark O ' Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in Dublin slums and their daily ambitions in their insignificant lives looking for another fix to their day. Along the path he tries to reconcile with his close family and friends, who have managed to let go and destroy them over the years. I know that many Irish people like to drink, but some of them seem to have problems with heroin, also according to the appearance of this movie. I know there is a little drug problem, as it is in many parts of the world, so another funny look at the subject is not a completely unexpected thing. remember the last Irish movie I've seen (the movie is filmed in a style that makes it out of any movie I've seen lately!) And of course I am not so enlightened to their humor as I could be. The movie is somewhat humorous in some parts, but of course it's another comedy that is not afraid to rise up laughing near the joint. The scene in which a mentally handicapped boy is robbed of the back of the aisle is certainly the truth of what a few drug addicts could do to feed their habits, but still utterly despicable and not sure if it was intended as a dark humor. by no means, but it certainly didn't make a smile on your face! It's also in stark contrast to their earlier actions when they see their soft side swinging baby-and-fro. In light of this, some may find the end sad, others may see it as just desserts. Overall, I just couldn't see the point of the movie. I haven't seen any motivation in that 'story' it was narration. It looks like it's together without involving the audience in any way. Unlike Trainspotting (which has dealt with similar topics!) It is largely a failed effort that made me on the verge of nodding despite a very short run time of 83 minutes. It really is no more pleasant than following two real lives for one day. **
