"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible remake of a not very good movie that can only be used for topless images of former supermodel Renee Russo. <br /> <br /> That's it. The story is negligible, Pierce Brosnan called in, and Dennis Leary (as usual) plays an annoying Irish cop, but I couldn't take my eyes off Mrs. Russo. There's a loving scene in the staircase, a terribly sexy ballroom dance, a scene without a cloak and a roll in a bag. Oh, and there is a picture stolen from the museum and the catamaran sinks. Hopefully, however, other directors will recognize Mrs Russo's energetic attributes and occupy her in more, highly visible roles.
