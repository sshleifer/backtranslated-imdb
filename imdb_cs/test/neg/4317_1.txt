This film was disappointing for at least two reasons. The tension created has disappeared because of the horrible behavior or lack of leadership from the director. I don't know .. it was like a tasty gum that seemed to run out of flavor, but you'll continue to chew on it because it once tasted great. Like most thrillers, the tracker had a promise that he couldn't deliver when I was clear and ready to turn the volume (I watched the movie myself ... in the dark) This so-called thriller just fell apart like Lego transformed into something another. It just ran out of gas and left me staring at a made-for-tv-movie-style movie with one exception .. it was probably rated-R.
