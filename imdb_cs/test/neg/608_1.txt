This is a lame comedy. Here's why: a man and a woman sitcom. Okay. <br /> <br /> My husband's a shower bag. Wife is Einstein. <br /> <br /> How original is it? Jerry Stiller is the same guy on Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Gags are lame. No funny one-armed inserts. <br /> <br /> I've had enough. Stop it now. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: Stupid. The destruction of the average white guy continues on ABC. Worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. It's just not here. Leah Remini is a great eye-catcher, but is unlikely. The word is useless. Bad sitcoms.
