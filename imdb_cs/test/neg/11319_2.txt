This is a story in which GROWN MAN tells the story of his youth. Yet you see things like personal computers, emails, faxes, and so on, which are used in the late 20th century and early 21st century. So when this person is about to tell this story - in 2020. Gee, I wonder how advanced we are. How about say that. There are also some legal issues that also make no sense. In the courtroom scene, the story gets into the usual evidence of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court in that country. Also, a grandmother would have to be missing in most states for at least seven years before being officially dead. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Elmo Shropshire. You are now officially SELLOUT.
