The main character is an exhilarating, irresponsible study of how to settle aside. Losing her in a drop of hat, pathetic, schizophrenic, and letting me wonder why he doesn't understand on Earth why her "friends" didn't call her in three years. (Get the trail, sister - you're a youthful mess!) I couldn't stand it with friends. I never felt connected to any character. To make the whole film more unbearable, somebody went far out of the way to give the world's most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted caps to a film for eternity. Negotiations weren't terrible, but not believable, and finally the only thing I took care of DID was two hours of never coming back. Don't waste your time - go catch up the dentist's appointment instead!
