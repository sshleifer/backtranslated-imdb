Corey Haim will never be known as one of the great actors of his time, but at least in films like "Licensed To Drive", he was more in his element ... lowbrow humor. Dean Koontz's book "Watchers" was one of his earlier works, and still probably his best so far. Sadly, this magnificent story of a brilliant dog, a mutant mutant, and a genetic experiment that has gone wrong is massacred. Acting is so lifeless, maybe you think you're watching a zombie movie. Only a dog gives a decent performance, and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog, you should be better watching "The Incredible Journey", "Cujo" or even "CHOMPS" ... well, maybe not "CHOMPS" If you read the book, avoid this movie at all costs. If you haven't read the book, read it and avoid this movie. Thank you later. A little better translation of Dean Koontz is a capable thriller, "Phantoms".
