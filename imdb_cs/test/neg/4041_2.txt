It's tempting to watch this movie as a bold avant-garde experiment. I think the director was trying to find out if it was possible to take all the conventions of a comedy movie and make something that was totally, utterly, totally rude. The answer, judging from "Venus is a loud 'Yes. It may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but my brain seems to have suppressed all others' memory. it moves only at the border: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not so badly that my inner censors wiped it out of my consciousness. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to imagine what the Director and the cast thought that they do when they did it, or why they set out and set out as soon as they did it.I doubt that someone who participated in it has earned a lot, but surely they could have put together enough money to buy all the prints and burn them This is a movie that has nothing to recommend it, it's not even bad, it's just a movie that doesn't do anything interesting, I really thought I'd take it back and ask for a refund which is not something I did before. <br /> <br /> And Don't think of hiring it (much less to buy!) This horrible accident.
