I know ... I know: it's hard (if not paradoxical) to have such a thing as a "plausible" fantasy. But for me, there is also a condition in which TOO is LESSERING incredible contradiction or abolishing my overall view of the film. The other one was the case for me regarding Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have too many unanswered questions about the story, but some of the games, I also thought, was a little over-the-top. (Maybe it was writing: they asked them to recite too many banal, predictable, clich√©s.) Others said enough about the conspiracy. I wish it was done - and I think it could have been - more convincing. P. S: This is a FRESH commentary on this movie - I just watched it a few minutes ago; it is not a memory of previous years.
