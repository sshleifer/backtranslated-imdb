That must be the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. Randy Quaid funny as a side actor in the original, but not as a leader. Too much Eddie. The original is classic. Like the original, the actor who supported them showed him. Ed Asner was very funny. He's Eddie of Christmas Vaction 2! How come Snots looks the same after all these years and everyone else in the original looks 14 years older. After 15 minutes watching this movie, I don't believe I was laughing. The island thing just didn't work. If it weren't for a good-looking guide in the South Pacific Island, the film would be a total loss. I sat on this review for a week and yes, I still think the movie should never be done. We hope there is no THIRD! Shawn Gearin
