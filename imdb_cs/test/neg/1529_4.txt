First, Season 1 is unbearably bad. The prison is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters are so two-dimensional that they are almost transparent and the direction is terrible. It works like bad video games in high school, characters traveling behind the camera and chased timed and rehearsed tracks. Soon the show gets better, but not much. Returning from a commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue of wheelchair users Augustus Hill, who plays impressively Harold Perrineau. The only time his character is still bad is during the poor performance monologues of art, most of which take place in an unexplained cube and generally has nothing to do with what's going on in the show. Unfortunately, the bad ideas in Oz could fill the encyclopedia of several volumes. Consider the whole situation first. Prisoners are able to hang out unconscious, get drunk, do drugs, and they have not only CD players (CD? They can also go through steak knives), but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by PRISONERS. Christ, the place is like a male club with guards. Guards that won't do much. Near the end of the second season, the grandson of an elderly prisoner is diagnosed with leukemia and all the prisoners on the field are in thick bundles of $ 20 and $ 50 bills to help him send him to Disneyworld to fulfill his wishes. They must be the richest prisoners in the world. Each of the prisoners in Oz suddenly became a caring, loving man besides Kenny Wangler, an irritating character, but one of those convincing. Even Adibisi wanted to be nice. But that's okay, because there is no order or meaning on the show, so this is not much distraction either. Later, in a shocking way, there is a boxing scene in which one prisoner is wearing "I Love Cops" t-shirt. "In jail !! Can you imagine? I have a cousin who was a few I sent him an old picture of us with friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends held a sticker "I Love Cops" and one of the "forests" (guys who were in jail for years and years) saw a picture but he just grabbed it and tore it in. My cousin was lucky. Kenny Wangler also keeps watch over the guards and even more senior officers who don't call him Bricks, one of them even tried to bribe him to You may lose track of who is in charge, inmates or guards.More than one investigator, for example, goes to the prison secret service and is killed trying to stop drug trafficking. hundred investigators to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Shillinger≈Øv OD son's loneliness and nobody thinks that he should ask the guard to get drugs. Just ... got them, I think. And make sure you pay attention, otherwise you will miss the reason why inmates have enough money to be able to afford cellular skin grafts when they get bad gums. I did not know that guests at maximum security prisons had such luxurious treatment options. And what about when Robson asks for a Dr. Faraj is so scared to go to the warden and finish his job on the site to ask what genus he will give chewing gum to. Do doctors and dentists have no right to ask them not to see some prisoners? After the poet and O'Reilly make the announcement to the entire prison, Robson asks him to see Dr. Faraja, and escorted to his office, brought without knocking, and the guard immediately leaves without a word. They could also give him a gun. <br /> <br /> I shouldn't go on stupid ideas in this show, but it's like a flood, I can't stop it. Who thought of Chinese refugees who can't speak Chinese and who disappear massively out of sight if they aren't needed? Who was thinking about goofy religious wars and all prison prisoners? But who would be on Robson's gum transplant? What about Busmalis and Agamemnon? Agamemnon, because they obviously do not belong to prison and Busmalis because of his grandson's cause. Macbeth, because it was nothing but a ridiculous way it was. But what are the worst ideas? Things that go nowhere that are constant. An Irish man comes to jail and builds a bomb. He threatens to blow up the whole prison, the bomb turns out to be a bagpipe, and the episode ends with being taken away by a bombing unit after the entire prison is evacuated. He never hears anything from him or the whole situation. It's like it's never happened. In one episode, prisoners get dogs to train. What the hell? If it wasn't bad enough, during one training session, the guard would fire the guard from the deck in the prison walls as exercise exercises. No one seems to mind. I also like how whenever a fight arises, the perpetrators are withdrawn, nothing is said, and guards or guards or sister Pete, or anyone always says, "I hope you don't think I'll leave it go!" And then they leave and let it go. The audience will not remember. Maybe I'm spoiled by Prison Break, but Oz is just a goofy drama that could be better than a game. Short. At least a low budget movie. There just isn't enough to maintain a multi-season television show. Then I watched the DVD for six seasons again. Sometimes I don't understand ...
