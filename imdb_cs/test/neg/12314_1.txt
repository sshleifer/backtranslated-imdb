The sun did not shine, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies, the cold, cold, wet day. "Cat in the Hat" was the name of the movie, and when it ended, my stomach was sick. Mike Myers played a cat, his humor was lame and kids didn't have to see it, humor wasn't tame. The film was like drinking milk, from an angry cow, so it's fun to have fun, but filmmakers didn't know how it was. This film is just cruel. The behavior was bad, the plot was too fine and the humor was surprisingly very rude. It starts with Conrad and Sally, a member of the rule and the future sheriff. When their mother has to go to work, Mrs. Kwan gets a babysitter. Maybe the lone funny part in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan is watching the Taiwan courtroom, `la C-SPAN. Soon he will fall asleep and the cat will come. The film is getting out of control. The cat tried to let the kids have fun. He has Thing 1 and Thing 2, who suddenly begin to knock down the house. He improvises TV Infomercial, and accidentally cuts his tail away. And when Cat goes Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Probably his only humorous disguise is like a hippie activist. And there's a fish trying to warn the kids about Cat. Too bad he warned us that this movie was as fun as sour milk, or chopping tail. Soon, the kids are out and are looking for a family dog ​​that has a key on the crate on their collar. If the box is not locked soon, their house will be home to the feline universe. Here's a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film. Overall, acting is terrible. Mike Meyers Brings His Brand of Indomitable Austin Powers to Cat, Says Things Like "You Dirty Him" ​​and imagine yourself as a woman for the rest of your life in the morning in the testicles while posing like a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as a troubled Conrad and Dakota Fanning is as cute as Sally, though they alone are not enough to save this terrible aortic dissection waiting to kill John Ritter (an accident waiting to happen). Neat and slim Lawrence Quinn Alec Baldwin is disgusting when he is trying for his mom, played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, mom's boss, and is also the voice of fish. The last three are also dim. Overall, if I were a parent, I wouldn't take children who are humorous because there are plenty and more. Save $ 7.00 and see something else. As late big dr. Seuss, <br /> <br /> It's fun to have fun, but you need to know how. Really, Universal, stop it! Theodore had already turned in his grave. As my mom always says, "Curiosity has killed a cat."
