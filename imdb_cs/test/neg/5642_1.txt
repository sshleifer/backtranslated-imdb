I am not surprised that the creators of this hopeless film could not find a UK distributor, and then had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. Distributors could clearly see what filmmakers and Sunday newspapers couldn't have been, it was one movie that just didn't want to compensate for its costs. Because it is a riddle thriller, it would help if they chose a leading actor who could properly express himself, rather than a mumbled Vinnie Jones, who apparently pronounced a "riddle" as "riell." And that would help if the dialogue was not flooded with noisy places or scenes flooded with disturbing and inappropriate music. The story is ridiculous: Charles Dickens' lost story allegedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders, but that would be a copy of Herge's Tintin adventure because the connection between Dickens and Jones is more than non-existent. And we have the ridiculous assumption that any investigative journalist who would put his hands on Dickens's undiscovered manuscript would take a few days to read it. he had a connection to it. Which is not. If you found a new Dickens manuscript, wouldn't you go somewhere quiet and read it? The film ends with one of those surprising revelations that have become mandatory from Sixth Sense, but in this case you are not so surprised as an insult to your intelligence. If the movie suddenly turned supernaturally at 12 o'clock, then it would be more acceptable if Vinnie Jones were a robot. It couldn't have looked so puzzled if the movie was stylish but not. And in some places it seems to be definitely amateurish. There's a scene where the table is laid by a 60-jump jump, but they didn't make sure that the person laying the table is completely out of frame. As a result, you can see things that change at the edge of the frame when you really should watch things changing in the middle of the frame. The good rule in making a movie is: If you don't understand how to make a technique, then try something different. The real riddle is why someone thought it would be a good idea. On first place.
