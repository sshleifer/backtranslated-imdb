I think it was a mistake that was on Disney's work. First, Kuzco does not have to go through the "imperial school" to become emperor! It has never happened before. Second, the new voices do not sound like originals. Very bad repetition. And while I adored the New Groove Emperor, New School is just stupid. Like all the jokes are the same, and a lot of the movie. The story gets redundant, always Yzma (is it how you spell it?) Trying to become Empress, Kuzco stops it, etc. Or Kuzco learns to be a better person. I think Kuzco is bothered by constant complaints and questions. He's a spoiled brat and it bothers me. I don't think it's worth five minutes of your time, much less than half an hour.
