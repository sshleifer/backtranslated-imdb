** They could be considered some mild spoilers, but not more than in the review of another movie of this movie. I knew that nothing could live in the sheer brilliance of the original "Carrie," which was more of a film about social criticism than it was about setting up a gym on fire. Carrie White was a "victim" that was symbolized, and her story expressed the helplessness that a truly exploited person must feel. Whoever invented the "Rachel" character for "The Rage" must have omitted the subtleties of "Carrie." "For the audience to truly share the victim's anger, it must be a likable character - a real outcast who is more of a victim of circumstances than his own vices. Rachel is too uncomfortable to tell any kind of emotional depth and connection of Sissa Spacek" Carrie. it looks and behaves like it should be right next to the "attractive and popular brigade" ending in torches, just as others have a soul that is just as spoiled, while Carrie was totally innocent. There is no satisfaction with looking at pretty kids - not even the boys of "home improvement." And it is so unnecessarily bloody! There was no bloodshed in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And there is one person, especially that this movie should not have the audacity to kill ... but I will not say who it is. If you saw the original "Carrie", it is a kind of character that dies unfairly. <br /> <br /> At least the DID will establish a connection with Carrie accordingly, as explained. But that, and a tattoo on the arm that was done pretty nicely, is just about the one thing this movie did for it. one of the most compelling films ever made. Rating: 1 out of 10. I didn't wait too much, but I was still very disappointed. Unsympathetic character, a series of irritated pop-cultural links thrown for no good reason, and the ending scene that pales in comparison to "Carrie "'s tombstone shock.
