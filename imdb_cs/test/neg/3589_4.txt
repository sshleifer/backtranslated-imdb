I know, it's a movie. But when it comes to plotting real life (on any thing), it should be as faithful as possible. I'm sorry, but "El Misterio Galíndez" is not as accurate as it seems. Nor is the Dominican Republic represented as it is. In fact, I was shocked to find out that instead of filming for Santo Domingo, Cuba was actually Cuba. And quite incredibly, movies with Cuban themes (Havana, The Lost City, Bitter Sugar, The Godfather part II) were filmed in Santo Domingo! What happened here? Why did they shoot a movie in Cuba instead of D.R. Spanish dialogues with a Cuban accent are terrible! These are not Dominicans! At historical level, Galíndez would never be hanged. He could also have been shot, headless, or died of inhuman torture he was receiving. Then he threw his body into the Caribbean Sea. But Trujillo would never drive death by strangulation. His sick mind wouldn't allow it. <br /> <br /> Acting is not delivered as expected. Harvey Keitel seems to be waiting for a paycheck. I prefer the main actress in "Deep Blue Sea". The rest of the cast would be excellent in some Cuban film, and the same applies to the chosen shooting location. I suggest "La fiesta del chivo" (Goat Feast), from bestseller author Mario Vargas Llosa, director of his cousin Luis Llosa. It's a bit more realistic with Dominican history. The character of Trujillo is very well illustrated and the Galindez incident is very briefly processed in this film.
