I'm great at playing, writing and directing, but not famous. My friends and I often rent bad movies, just for fun and laughter, but when we went to the local Family Video and found a movie called Biker Zombies from Detroit, we knew it would be the worst movie ever and was! Biker Zombies From Detroit has no script! They can say they have one, but they are liars! It was a four-minute scene of two men who learned about the woman and sexuality, and you could say it was improvised. And if they're going to improvise, it should be at least decent, but it wasn't, and you could tell the two actors how they spoke up the lines and said things that didn't even make sense. To give you an idea of ​​how awful and retarded this movie is, here's the start: the girl throws the guy away, hits her face and beats her, then rapes her. Then we see the zombies who attack and both become zombies. This is the beginning of the movie! Not to mention the leading zombie voice over it carries through the film, trying to be sinister and provocative thinking, but sound like Marylin Manson with the conniption fit. Worst movie ever. Bottom line, people. But watch if you like scriptless movies, no graph, bad gameplay, bad editing, bad music and more than 100 words used in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you manage to hit the video stores, my future films will be won by Oscars.
