I just wish it was a grade lower than F to make it possible! I have awarded it 1 in tally vote. I am rating it not even as a regular movie, but as a T&A movie, and it's the worst, lamest, crappiest and most horrible movie I've seen. that there is no nudity for T&A connisuer.it is about a male cheerleader and the viewer is ready to sit in many painful scenes from him making cheers.avoid this piece of waste at all costs! This is the worst of a teen movie in the 80s.
