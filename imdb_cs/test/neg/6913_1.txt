God why? I'm horrified by the utter inability of this delicious blather nonsense. Well, like this movie from the lower moat of a poor line of forties in Hollywood, nothing in this door hit the horror - created on three sets - makes a lot of sense ... except for the horror of dr. Markoff (jerkoff?), Who yearns uncontrollably for some plonic piano - a player's daughter who has big melons and a hairdoo flouncy. It's just awful ... and even has a gorilla and a big boy for unnecessary further distractions. More Elephantine than Elephant Man, and it's only for 62 minutes!. MONSTER MAKER is the kind of film child in 2005 who just howls in disbelief and wondered what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth, which made them sweet movie cocos that are today. You must have been there. In 1944, or whenever the hell of this crazy drivel turned out to be an impressive 13 year old in a magnificent 3000 velvet palaces with velvet film on a wet day. Somehow. It was made for no reason, botchville crapshooter movie scammers PRC Pictures during the war years escaped German refugees who knew who to make the film because they got out of Europe as the Nazis advanced to the UFA studios ... a monster in this movie, like a mad scientist is actually a Nazi nightmare.
