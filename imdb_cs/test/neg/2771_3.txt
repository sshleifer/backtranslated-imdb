Apparently it was quite a low budget production, but the cast was pretty decent, the basic assumption had a promise, and something more could be done with it, but the screenplay wasn't so big that the plot is disjointed and seems almost random to Times and dialogues are stilted and terrible. In principle, a girl's father gets into the hands of fellow gangsters and later becomes a thief and wants to avenge his death, and then goes to mob protection. rocket involving corrupt politics. Alan Ladd gets top billing but actually plays a very small role. I have to say that in my archaic class B, I thought it was somewhat amusing. hokiness, but it's really tricky and pathetic.
