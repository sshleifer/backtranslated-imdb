This is the stupidest movie ever made. The story is ridiculous. His wife and child think he is insane. Then no. Then it turned out to be and I think they knew it all the time. There's a dog named Ned who is causing some trouble and I think it's all his fault ... as is Jim Carey. God just knows why Virginia Madsen took this role ... that's a career. I think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 years old. And that's up to 23. Or maybe it's for 8 and 10 years, which also adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for really stupid 23 years. Or maybe really stupid 32 years because it's 23 in the opposite direction. Or maybe 46 years would have enjoyed it because half of it is 23. I think searching for things on the internet about 23 would be more fun than this movie if you didn't want to see a comedy.
