The story is: a group of turn-of-the-century actors, along with producers and theater owners, have very complicated relationships. The resident playwright wrote a psychological drama. He wants to get a good production on the podium, but he can't convince the paritical reviewer to come back to produce, and give a positive review. If his production doesn't continue, then the band will go to Doll House, which Ibsen recently wrote. There are many different relationships between the principles; none of them is interesting. However, engaging characters leads to a second shot of the resident playwrght. This film is a pure excuse for the director and his friends to meet and make a film. Stories are incoherent to anyone who is not a friend of one of the stars. The only reason I haven't left the theater after about half an hour is that at the end of my line a fat lady is resting on a meal after eating.
