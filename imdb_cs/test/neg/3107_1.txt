Don't let this movie be rented. Finally, I bought a "previously viewed" tape for $ 4.00. That was close to the rental price, so I could buy it. I'll fire it when I'm done. The film, played by Lowe, is a music video with several lines of dialogue, slow footage and poorly edited editing. I thought I'd see the mindless movement I wanted to see, and I didn't get it. This movie is a workout in slow motion footage, no script, close-up, horrible edited, and poorly developed land. I can't believe it actually ends in a scene in which they think viewers are interested in characters. We still don't know who they are at the end of the movie. Believe the humbug, stay away.
