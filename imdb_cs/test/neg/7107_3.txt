The movie is very fast, bizarre and varied, it's like Mad Max on the speed of offal paints and makeup. Also very Cartoonish as it said; here and there a drawn sequence appears. The plot is also very irritated, but I believe it was too much. The thing that really freaks me out in this movie is characters that are painfully irritating, especially Rebecca, played by Lori Petty, is really annoying (I believe it's the most enjoyable creature I've ever seen). The editing is also annoying, very stylized MTV. Another thing missing in Tank Girl is an exciting adventure. Nor is humor much fun. But he has some nice visuals. However, many people love this movie, most of them are women, and it is not strange at all because this movie is about the girl. is a real film movie and the best example of a film of hate / love.
