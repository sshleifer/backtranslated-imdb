This movie was Flippin the Terrible .... I wanted those hours of my life back. For God's sake, away from this scary movie, crumb at all costs. Its not worth mentioning the name, but the ratings on this movie are quite generous for throwing up a scum movie like this. And where do I start? Stupid A ** children in the movie ..... Zero land or story? ... garden-variety school / frat boy-esquire scene towel slapped? Or very badly acted, teen anxiety innuendo? $$$ # @% @! My God, NEVER quit! ..... I remember I'd rather kiss the cinema floor, then sit down again. What do you expect? Most people with brain power search reviews will not target the audience here at all- so GO BACK Pirates 2 again, or Jet Lee either, -If your debate for yourself. Look, this film will cost you your soul, money, energy, and brain cells. WARNING.
