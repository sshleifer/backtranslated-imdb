This short theme is a remake of the 1942 Three Stoogs "What is Matador?", About the Boy's Expedition to Mexico and Their Adventure in Bullfighting. Although the original short film was made during the Stooges high season, it's not so unforgettable and I believe it's one of the more average films with Curly Howard. Sappy Bullfighters "is just pathetically awful, like all the other shorts with Joe Besser." Moe and Larry were never supposed to hire Besser because his rough, almost feminine figure was completely wrong for the Stoogs violent comedy. His 16 films with Moe and Larry meant nadir for the team, and those shorts are awkward to watch. This short film was released in 1959 and was the swan song of the team with Columbia. Maybe Besser was a nice boy, but he was just as bad as the third stooge. I will not review any other Besser shorts because I would just give the same horribly negative testimonial over and over again. Do a big favor and don't look at it. Instead, try catching "In the Sweet Pie and Pie" or "Hoi Polloi".
