In 1995, director Barry Sonnenfeld directed a film that ended with many of the best list criticisms when print publications were printed in entertainment publications. The film was Get Shorty and it gave the lead star John Travolta his second big hit in as many years after Pulp Fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi lenses. The film is based on Elmore Leonard's novel, focusing on the wise guy Chili Palmer (Travolta) and his attempts to break into the film industry. For one I was completely captured by the different characters and the sharp original dialogue. So much that when I heard that it would be a continuation, I seemed to give up my usual trembling when the studio was trying to redress what was a good idea ten years later. The sequel, also based on the novel Leonard, is this time directed by F. Gary Gray, who is an Italian Job in 2003 was one of the years of highest grossing films. A pair that now extends the cast to include Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, The Cedric Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn and James Woods, and you have all the prerequisites for continuing to use one of the most exciting characters of the 1990s. . This time we got up when Chili (Travolta) leaves the film business after being disappointed in himself and in the industry for participating in the creation of his successful first film. With a small portion of his friend, Tommy Athens (Woods) and the misfortune of his death, Chili decides to look at the lucrative and dangerous music industry. This first tour leads to the famous Viper club, where Chili meets singing Linda Moon (Christina Milian), who as a trio of coaches can win melodies like Whitney Houston (that is, Whitney before Bobby Brown brought home small packs of sugar) . Linda has a deal with Raji (Vaughn) who, with her overly obvious gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock), plans to ensure Linda fulfills the last five years of her contract, though that means Chili on the ice. So with Linda's future in balance, Chili weaves an interesting site that will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer (Cedric), a Russian crowd, police, lead singer Aerosmith Steven Tyler, and a lot of angry weapons. pointing. Woo-Whee! It sounds interesting. So why wasn't it? Be Cool is trying too hard, well, being cool. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, has no heart and no soul. Be Cool feels as if he was directed by Saturday Night Live because there are single scenes or parodies that don't fuse around the film. Take, for example, the scene where Travolta and Thurman first dance from Pulp Fiction because Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene is forced to end on the floor. Instead, it is connected between two other useless chapters that do nothing to push the story forward with some real move. Aerosmith's concert and The Rock trip to the shoe store are also a first-class example of individual moments that do not consist of film. But these are not the only problems with continuing - which could probably be renamed to product placement with a number of 2-ways and Pepsi diets that seem to look more at you than Chili's serious look. The story contains almost every stereotype that can be imagined, and each has enough time to become somewhat offensive or embarrassing. Whether it is a gangster or a gay escort who has a Sylvester Stallon stone film poster on the wall, there are no characters on the top that we have seen many times before and in much better movies. With the magic of everything that happened from the first movie, we end up with a worse product that is the second movie in the last six months (Ocean 13 is the other), which has packed a lot of stars on the marquee to end up as a movie that no actor would lead to open bankruptcy. Be Cool was a great disappointment. I wanted it to be Get Shorty from the new millennium and I ended up with a movie where the outtakes had to be gas, but the experience left me stinking.
