I'm sorry, guys, everyone who thought this movie could be something great, I'm afraid you'd be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The standard that the movie wanted to set is completely destroyed by a very simple chart. So simple that the movie doesn't evolve to the end. I asked myself if the plot is about action, but about the main character (played by Mickey Rourke), but I found this character to be inconsistent - either he's a professional killer or some guilty brother guilt. But they are not going together, because the child he is trying to lead represents him in dangerous situations where no professional killer can stand. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a good-looking actor now, but he played his character a little unnaturally. I did not believe his acting, it seemed that the director was trying to pull out a personality he could not provide. And he didn't have to, because his less crazy behavior was pretty scary. The only thing that was great was Diane Lane. If not her, I'd give this movie 1 star. Finally, I expected to see some well-played film and some interesting chart. And I totally fired it with high expectations.
