Leonard Rossiter and Frances de la Tour carry this film, not without a fight, because the script was apparently hastily paved with old episodes. When it came out, it had to be a real disappointment, because it's also on the bus ticket budget. Attempts to move it from home - which is unpleasantly unrecognizable, bad work all around - with picnic, fantasy sequences, rugby and boxing match at the local gym just don't work. Most of them are just a character-light setting for a lonely not-particularly good gag. This means that the interplay of Rossiter and de la Tour (and anyone with him) is mostly cheerful; they even manage to make siphon siphon work, but you can see a match with recycling literally unrecognized scenario that changes the action halfway. Don Warrington has very little to do except 'be black', and due to the random script hacks Christopher Strauli changes the character at least twice. Finally, as he often did in the TV series (though you may not remember - read the scripts), Eric Chappell will allow you to end the time that ends. Were they cynics, or just too desperate to be in film business? Rossiter and de la Tour are always funny, but as a movie it's a horrible postscript to the kindly mentioned TV series. RIP.
