John Wayne is undoubtedly one of the most popular and popular actors of all time. His career lasted over forty years, and within that time he played in films such as "Angel and Badman", "Green Berets", "Sands of Iwo Jima", "Rio Bravo", "North to Alaska", and " Undefeated ". <br /> <br /> The film mentioned above are welcome as some of his best, unlike this 1934 effort" Randy Rides Alone ", which was largely forgotten as time is gone, which it is not surprising, it is an unforgettable, besides its very short running time of only 53 minutes. As they look around, the posse comes and finds Randy there and arrests him, accusing him of being a member of the gang and asking where his gang is, he's imprisoned in prison, Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned a saloon and was murdered by she's in jail to see Randy clarify he's one of the gang members (hiding in a secret room when she was shooting). Sally doesn't believe Randy is a murderer, and he doesn't recognize him, so when he's out there, he sends him the keys and Randy escapes. When Randy runs away from the sheriff and his position, he comes across a gang shelter in a cave responsible for murder. Randy wants to clarify his name and also bring the gang to justice. "Randy Rides Alone" can be a fun movie to watch, especially if you're a John Wayne fan. But at the same time it has too many flaws that cannot be ignored. The movie is also extremely old as you would expect; We have a horrible camera that does anyone who moves in super-fast motion, and dialogue is terrible. Neither the performance is great and Wayne's character is very wooden and along with the rest of the cast they look like wooden puppets led by someone (in this case, Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser is at the helm and doing a good job, but the story is thin. One cannot help but feel that about ten minutes are missing at the beginning of the movie because Randy is coming out of nowhere in the lounge and wants to meet someone. Explaining why Randy was there later, which turns out to be something like he is a P.I who was sent to investigate the claim that someone is trying to take over the city. To be honest, I didn't take it, most of the time I was hoping the movie would end. But as I said, this movie wasn't quite awful. I enjoyed some of it and sometimes it was quite fun. But it really isn't a great movie, and it's not really worth watching or watching down. Overall, "Randy Rides Alone" is incredibly old and is tiring Western with very little redemption features. It can be fun, but overall it's not a great movie and it's definitely one of Wayne's weaker trips.
