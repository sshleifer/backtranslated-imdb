I am a longtime fan of the original film (Bella Martha / Mostly Martha). I miss the slow pace, the build of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods, and movement through dialogue. I don't think the story itself is enough. Martha / Kate is more separated and Mario / Nick is not a clown. In most cases, things that make one scene great in the original do not work in its copy. Small changes deprive him of tension. My opinion is that you should go and see the original. It is worth the subtitles annoyance.
