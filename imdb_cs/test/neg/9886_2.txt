Blood and chocolate is nothing like a book. The story has changed completely and the one who chose the cast needed to read the book. The first girl is not an Aden's introvert. Vivian was the one who chased Aden. Her mother was to survive and be Gabriel's. Astrid was the one who made all the murders with Ralf, former Vivian. Gabriel is not old. He is old. And Aden didn't finally get Vivian, Gabriel did. The title comes from Vivian, where kisses from Aden (sweet chocolate) and Gabriela (excellent as blood) are compared. She collected blood because she had promised more and more understanding. This reminds me that Gabriel is not against the people in the film. They just avoid intimacy because they hurt him in the past. A really book is sooooooo much better than a movie. But if you want to see running, dating assembly and lots of jumping. Then it's a movie to see.
