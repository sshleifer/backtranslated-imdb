He must not be mistaken as a vehicle that is very popular, Samuel L. Jackson SNAKES ON THE PLAN; SNAKES ON TRAIN is a low budget, has no actors (talk about), but some pretty decent effects. Attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) does not want to marry her husband with the choice of someonelse; so it is put under a powerful Mayan curse that has snakes hatched inside her body, slowly devouring from the inside out. Her only hope of survival is a shaman who lives across the border in Texas. Time is coming; and she is put on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. Previously long snakes leave her wreck body and grow fast. The passengers on board the train are now trapped and will soon be for snakes. The final sequence is undoubtedly the best of this 91-minute film. Actor credits are also: Alby Castro, Al Galvez and Giovanni Bejarno.
