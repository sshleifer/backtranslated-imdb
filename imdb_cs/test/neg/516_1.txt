You have to see this movie, it's a big note in the history of the movie. When this film was made, the American film industry reached the bottom of the suction. Watch this movie, laugh and apologize for losing the last 2 hours of your life. That's the worst I've seen and even worse overhead. Demons laugh as if they were taken from a clown circus and if the guys who did "Scary Movie" want to parody superhero movies, they have to take the script from this movie and make a remake called Black Scorpion III: The Really Really Bad Movies who, in some way, will lure manufacturing companies into continuing suicide.
