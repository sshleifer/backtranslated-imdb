I was unlucky to watch the BBC last night, I expect to be the only spectator. Something was wrong with the film from the very beginning, after a few minutes of tracking I was able to find out what it was. FILM BAD! It's not bad in a good way, like Wolfpack or Seagal movie plain old awkward bad. Why was it in the movie? I saw a few episodes of the TV series and I thought it was fine, but I only saw the reps because they did. I've spent most of the film trying to figure out what the story was and I wasn't wiser to the end. It seems to me that at some point I remember the character, maybe Farina mentions that Mod Squad can get to places where regular cops can't. "Place" turns out to be a "club", one of the hardest places to go, maybe it was a student night? I lost track of the plot at this point, or maybe there was no land, and the movie was just chopped from various remnants of other TV series remakes. Was it an action comedy? I don't remember any laughter. Overall, this film lacked a real scene that steals the power of someone like Seymour Hoffman as evil. Ribisi would have someone with him to bounce back.
