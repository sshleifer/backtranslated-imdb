That wasn't a good movie !! Why do people say that? There is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires !!! Why? Why are vampires there? Where do they come from? What the hell ?! There are all these "super human" vampires, but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate all of them. Fast too. It's not like it's a long battle scene with lots of fighting. There were only three guys from the bar who killed these vampires as a fat man who kills twinkies! Another thing you know is Clooney and the silly girl Cheech saves and leaves the homeless in the middle of Mexico. End of the story. Literally. Oh and the strip strip club was an Aztec temple that is funny because it would have to be southern Mexico, not a border. Why are people lying and telling people it's a good movie? Don't let this movie rent, buy or even watch in a friend's house. You will wish you had your life back.
