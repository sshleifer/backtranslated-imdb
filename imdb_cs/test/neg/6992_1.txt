Someone likes to see a really bad movie. You watch it, you laugh and you forget about it in the next half hour. But this is not one of those. It's the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a moment. I'd like to see someone taking responsibility for Dante - it's the really dumbest villain you can think of: leather pants that speak a voice and have a laugh like 50 years old Dracula. How can someone come with this guy? And the hero ... "Dragon" or whatever ... my cereal box has a better acting ability than he (maybe all of them) is incredible. But the worst are the battle scenes in which you might think there might be something in it. They are so weak, it's beyond any description. There is no shame, I just can't believe how this studio allowed any studio. But I'm thrilled it was. Watching this is a pleasure of yourself. You only see it if you're in a film looking for pain, and in that case, it's a sure winner.
