When a hard-working entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club, he starts fighting among the members and eventually buys him from Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and turns him into an amusement park / golf course where everyone can join. This is by no means a good movie, but sometimes it's a little fun. Almost all comedy is a cheap slapstick and bad jokes besides Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of its biggest roles as Ty Webb for the second time and it plays great. He's not just the funniest character in the movie, he's the only funny character in the movie. Even Dan Akroyd does not bring humor to this film, which seeks to be a great sequel to the classic comedy, but falls into rubble with others who are on Comedy Central. The film could be better if Ty Webb (Chase) had a bigger role but instead he was reduced to a smaller character and the star became Jackie Mason (who?) They had had brought back all the cast and made the sequel the right way! This is a perfect example of what to do when you are continuing a great movie. Overall, Caddyshack II is a funny but big mistake. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie.
