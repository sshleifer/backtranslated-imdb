In New York, in the mornings near Christmas, the father and mother of a high class go to their BMW to a private school to see their daughter's play. Then they go shopping and later return to their luxury apartment in Manhattan. At night they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood where they are preparing drugs for distribution. On Christmas Eve, when she buys a Christmas present for her daughter, her father is kidnapped and his wife desperately tries to get a high amount of money to pay the ransom required. "R Xmas" is a false movie by Abel Ferrara. Leading characters have no names, are anonymous, and perhaps it is his intention to say that in the neighboring family's breasts in your building you may be drug dealers; or that drug traffickers may also have families and be loving persons; or that there are many dirty cops, probably worse than criminals; Or is it a simple excuse for crime? It does not matter! But this humanization of criminals is a terrible message, and I really didn't like this movie. For example, in Brazil, many drug dealers and criminals help their communities because of the absence of a state in poor areas and slums, but this does not make them a citizen model. In this film, we see today a loving family of a higher class that provides medicine as a means of life, but the destruction of members of other families is not proven in the story and it is impossible to feel sympathy for all characters. Finally I wished everyone was dead. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Ganges to Gueta" ("Ganges of the Ghetto")
