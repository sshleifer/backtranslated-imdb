Not from "8 Heads in Duffel Bag" and "How High" previews <br /> <br /> I laughed so little in what filmmakers thought it would be hysterical. Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is dismissed as a 4-F <br /> <br /> army, and decides to use his money to raise his own army - about half a dozen. He then embarks on a Nazi commander in <br /> <br /> Italy, and finally tries to kill Hitler. This is a description of a fragile graph. <br /> <br /> This movie is as fun as a heart attack. This movie makes "Hogan's <br /> <br /> heroes" look like Shakespeare. If money men "The <br /> Producers" really wanted to lose their money, they should have <br /> <br /> shown this movie. I can't emphasize how bad this thing is. Lewis's direction consists of two different cameras that shoot <br /> <br /> from two different angles, then adjust together. This <br /> <br /> TV direction sitcom, but here's the obvious attempt to cheat the audience. Most of its <br /> <br /> scenes end in the frame as if it gave the viewer the chance to double <br /> <br /> in the stitch before moving to the next tired setup. I spent most of the <br /> <br /> movie doubled in abdominal agony, accompanied by <br /> <br /> heavy bloating, over this thing. Lewis, director and producer producer, filming the movie in 1943, but does no attempt to use period costumes or sets. Everyone who wears the latest style <br /> <br /> and has the latest interior design ... for the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The support cast is lost when Lewis shuts down on his patented tangents, > <br /> which last as long as the large operations and are just as painful as the <br /> <br /> watch. When Lewis becomes a Nazi commander, he spends the last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs for performance <br /> <br />. At the beginning you're trying to bring the final embarrassing shot to Lewis and his friends to try <br /> <br /> to build one on Japanese. They wear buck teeth, squint their <br /> <br /> eyes, and speak in a "funny" accent. This can be one of the most <br /> <br /> unexpectedly racist events from internment camps. I've been <br /> <br /> slack jawed on what Lewis did over the whole thing, but that <br /> <br /> over me. Watch that Kaye Ballard is a very tasteless scene where she tries to try and commit suicide over and over again. George Stari "Star Trek" has two small scenes, then wisely <br /> <br /> drops out of the picture. It has less laughter than the last Mel Brooks <br /> <br /> three movies together. There is nothing sadder than watching a formerly respected comedian who so badly damaged the project that you are ashamed of them. Jim Carrey learned that with "The <br /> Majestic", but Jerry Lewis still appears on TV once in <br /> <br /> while pulling the same indecent schtick. I feel sorry for him. <br /> <br /> "Which way to the front?" is cheap, dissatisfied, offensive and stupid. I feel bad for everyone involved and everyone who has to endure it. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it. Although rating is (G), it includes some physical violence, some weapons, violence, and some adult situations.
