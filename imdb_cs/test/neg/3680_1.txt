If they had zero out of 10, I would have given it. Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of taking money from the public. I don't know how movies like this have released Video or Pay Channel. I'm disappointed with Vincent Gallo. Val Kilmer was in it for about 8 minutes, so I can't get to him. Only the one who introduced him as a star in it. It's like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no land except Gallo searching and finding your friend in the catacombs. Why were they looking for the gates of hell known only to the director. They should keep this film in Moscow and burn it to fire to keep all the nights homeless. There is nothing about this movie that all other reviewers have written. I wish I forgot about the movie that hurts my brain.
