When I first saw this movie, I didn't know its name. I realized he had a Chevy Chase with the same name he had in Caddyshack, so I had the idea that it was Caddyshack 2. At the end of the movie, when I found out it was Caddyshack 2, I was disappointed. They could have done it better. Dan Akroyd I thought it was wrong. The whole story was bad. Call this movie under a different title, but don't say Caddyshack 2. You give that great movie a bad name. Jackie Mason's daughter when I first saw him look like his wife. How old is this girl? Oh, God. How about making this movie a bit believable. I thought Chevy Chase was good.
