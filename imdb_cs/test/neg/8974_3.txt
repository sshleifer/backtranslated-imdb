I had an idle time before I went to work, looked at my DVD collection "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" and picked the most poignant title in the package: Zis Boom Bah starring Grace Hayes forgotten. "Classic" is probably an operative word because most of the titles I have never heard of and I suspect they are all in public ownership. Incidentally, this film also plays his son Peter Linda and his wife Mary Healy (who I just found out is New Orleans native of the state I live in, Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as the owner of the malt house and Huntz Hall. from East Side Kids, like Peter's friend. A story about a mother who is trying to transform her rich, carefree son into a responsible, unaware of who she is, is for birds, and doesn't have many fun scenes, even though I liked Peter's celebrities and his dance with Hall. in tension. And songs and dances are fun in themselves. But Rubin is everywhere with his confusion of the American folk language of that time, and almost everything that concerns him has no sense at all (though I liked his fun dance). Given that it was only 61 minutes that I was sure of playing on the lower-half of the double function law, I'll be charitable and give this 3 for a few fun bits that I have been enjoying.
