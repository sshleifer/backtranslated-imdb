So I give him one star for true quality, but I'd give her eight and a half for complete pleasure. An incredibly strange hybrid of sexual comedy and vigilante thriller, "Young Warriors" is just the kind of bad movie you usually hope to find when you push around the video, but so rarely. It starts with about half an hour of hack hi-jinx, sex jokes and juvenile shenanigans (including olives in a martini joke that must be seen not to be believed). The main character's younger sister gets a gang raped by a lot of swarthy bikers (an unspeakable scene that keeps me from giving it 10 for fun - rape isn't fun!), And the main character gets the rest of her sex crazy frat brothers to help trying to clean up the city, find responsible cyclists and kill someone who would be a little criminal to hit the road. It's a cheerful, uninterrupted pastime, in addition to the unpleasant rape scene itself, and is essential to viewing all the serious bad movie fan. Trust me - in these things I took the time and this is one of the best. The most interesting are the beautiful library visit, the great flashing shootout in a modest bar (with a guy who took off his impressive foot), a couple of decent actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine), a couple of familiar faces (Lynda Day George, Queen yelling Linnea Quigley) and a couple of relatives of famous people (brother Muck Chuck Norris, member of Van Patten James). He even has one of those big "What have we become?" The type of morality lesson end, even when the point of turnover comes when the Vigilante Fratboys gun down a couple of children rob the toy gun shop. I've always wondered why it was a catalyst that thought about a hero; After all, whether they were children and not destroying criminals, and whether they had a real weapon or not, in fact they were still robbing the store, so if I can say it, it was just another job that was for our vigilante frat boys, right? Wonderful things. I highly recommend, just don't blame when you like it.
