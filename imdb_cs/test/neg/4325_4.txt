If at all possible, try to see all five Universal "Mummies" in order, not so much for continuity between movies, but for a very obvious lack. It goes without saying that the original classic of Karl Karl "Mummy" should not be mentioned in the same breath as the so-called "Continuation", all of which look like camp or cult. This time it turned out that the mummified remains of Princess Ananka came to the United States. Once again, when your eyes deceive you, the Kharis mummy did not die for the second time in "Mom's Tomb," but lives and seeks out her lost love for Princess Ananka using the rhetorical nine sheets of tana cooked during the full moon cycle. To complete the mythology, the Kharis needs a caretaker, who is full of the rebel John Carradine as Yousef Bey, in charge of Andoheb George Zucco, the high priest of the Arcane. Kharis and Ananka will return to their final resting place in the hills of Arkan, Egypt. But as we have seen before, being charged with the duty of a high priest is a certain bet that ends in failure, while Carradin's character falls into the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsouri (Ramsay Ames). It is shocking to see Yousef Bey and the band band PO'ed that it is a blow over the beautiful Amina. This is me - in "Tomb" and "Curse", Lon Chaney Mummy with a helpless limp arm that is helplessly folded over his chest. When she meets frostbitten Amina, she picks it up in both hands without any problems; when he puts it on his right hand, he returns to his crippled position. The end of the movie is most remarkable - a monster gets a girl! But it is a short victory, because the mother and his kidnapped bride are subject to a swampy grave, the ancient Egyptian curse meets - "The fate of those who give up the will of ancient gods will be cruel and violent death".
