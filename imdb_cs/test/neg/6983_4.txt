Yeah, I know his character was supposed to be a drunk, and maybe he just acted goofy. But something tells this critic that Mr. Pleasence really drinks a lot and was drunk during his movie scenes. Basically, everything he says is indistinct and often incomprehensible. Or maybe they were just bad production values ​​... hard to say. In any case, The Race for the Yankee Zephyr is a movie that just doesn't work. It is also a shame because the film has an amazing opening and a generally interesting plot. Ultimately, the production values ​​are too low and the action is too low for this New Zealand delivery experience. The story deals with an American war plane that is filled with gold, money, and medals that fall into a lake in New Zealand during World War II. The plane remains lost for about forty years or so long as it somehow washes the shore and the drunkard (Pleasence) literally hits it. Initially, it collects all the purple heart medals and tries to sell in the city, actually getting $ 75 a piece for them! Little does he know that once he sells them, the local jeweler gets on the phone and tries to track down the plane. Before you blink, the rich magpie (Peppard) and his followers bring all the attention to the city, trying to force the old boy to give up the plane because they know there's more to him than just medals. . An old drunk business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then set off to try to get lucky before bad people reach him. The result is simply not as fun as you would expect it to be. Acting is somewhat awful, except Pleasence. George Peppard is trying to make some (I think) Australian accent, but that's hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren isn't too bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He basically makes Michael Pare's best impression on his worst day. And it says something. Hopefully he made enough money for this film to fix the front teeth that looked a little twisted. I don't remember having them straighten up when he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast is quite dissatisfied. Probably mostly locals who have never done anything else. The biggest problem for me was the lack of action for most of the film and the lack of danger. The rogues are too nice and cracked to be taken seriously. And frankly, there are no helicopters in the movie that look like you on the DVD. And none of the ships in the film have their teeth painted on them. But the film has its strengths. The beginning, which starts as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story, was a nice touch. Brian May's score is a bit too much like Mad Max 2, but it included a nice little march that plays for Pleasence in some scenes. It sounds the same as the one in the Great Escape! There are some neat pieces of a helicopter and a great boat chase that apparently killed three men's sensations during filming. The landscape, despite its grainy appearance, is still quite beautiful. Most of the things you'll remember are drunken antiquity by Donald Pleasence. He was almost enough to save this film. Nearly. 4 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Hound.
