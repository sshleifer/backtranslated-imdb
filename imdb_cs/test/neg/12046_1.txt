I went to see this movie in the theater and paid the money that it would be at least slightly fun. The only thing I enjoyed was when Robin Williams crashed into the car at the bottom of the hill and ended when he was killed. Glenn Close was uncomfortable and apparently didn't look old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garpova should take her children to the Ministry of Children and Families. Robin Williams and his glazed donut look benign goodies are too sweet and charming for me. He has two roles he can play: A funny man or a sad, tragic, good-hearted victim. See Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam and all his so-called "dramatic" roles. It's always the same performance. Put them together in one long mini series. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Remember Fatal Attraction? Would you have an affair with her on the worst day and if you were single? Did you feel any sparks between her and Michael Douglas? Have you ever seen a Glenn Close warm-up screen? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. It was back on the day he was playing serial killers and bad guys, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny. Garp is made for all those people who love to see movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claims to be beautiful and deep.
