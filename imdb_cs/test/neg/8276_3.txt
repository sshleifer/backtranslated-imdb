The title of this summary summarizes how I feel about this movie. I can't imagine what an audience would be, if not for a hard fan of the 80s slasher movies, who just have to see - everything - from that time. Otherwise, don't waste your time. The story is similar to most films of its type: something terrible will become one of the characters in the opening scene that inspires a bloodthirsty killer. Go for a murderous rampage. I was there, done it. The truth is, none of these 80 slasheres were known for their originality, so I don't see why the film should be cut short. But where the film fails, it's in its tension and murder. I've seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the eighties that had much lower budgets than this. This one just doesn't create any real tension. The director throws some nice camera angles and some semi-professional director's touches back and forth, but they do not mean anything unless you are afraid. Gore is pretty tame as well, so anyone who follows these things with the intention of seeing some cool eighties makeup effects will unfortunately be disappointed. The film handles clunk together rather dully. Honestly, the key component of almost any slasher is tight stimulation - you have to keep things moving fast and keep the killing pieces organized at regular intervals because, let's face it, we don't follow these things for great characterization and stellar charts. But stimulation, whether for script or editor, is disabled. The murders are spread out at odd intervals, leaving us with some long winds (no doubt it meant building a "character") that only serves to give you birth and to pray for the next kill (which, as I said, is usually not that good done). <br /> <br /> As far as the killer is concerned, don't expect anything original or remotely scary. He (or she?) Wearing a running suit, a fencing mask and his (or her?) Primary weapon is a sword. I bet the writer just thought about the idea that he came up with an original, "cool" murder weapon, but the idea is just as impractical and stupid. There is also no great emphasis on the "whodunnit" nature of the movie as if they either forgot or did not care to put some red effects into the mix to throw us away. I have the feeling that the people who have been trying to do something decent and respectable, and sometimes it shows that their intentions were probably a little more true when it comes to producing quality movies, unlike countless other scouts from the era. the attempt is largely unsuccessful, but there is quite a good performance (at least for this type of film), there is an attempt at characterization, but none of it ultimately means anything at all, so ... what is waste, all that to do it is to fit into the plot and make the murderous sequences feel like they can't come soon. Finally, if you're really in these places, the old 80s slashers, by all means, look at it if you just say you saw it. or anything. What we have here is a very mildly entertaining movie slasher that leaves no real impression.
