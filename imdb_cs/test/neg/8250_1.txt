So many fans, so little to show. I know, I know these words will find me in a big minority. A lot of people really liked to do goodwill. But please, really great movie making, not even close, and let's blame where it belongs ... in writing. Now I know they won the Oscar and the boy did it look good on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is a ABC after school special with a lot of curse in it, and a slightly larger budget. <br /> <br /> What this movie shows is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take the dung, feed it to you, and convince you that you were eating. And that's exactly what the studio did with the movie. They made so high a faluttine buzz around her that people believed and wanted to believe so much - that they saw brilliance where no one was. Now I know that some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a terribly bad movie, I like to compare it with more in the middle of the movies on the road, and with some big movie Made for TV (though HBO movies are not HBO films unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It's just a nice, small movie, with some good performances, Robin Williams wasn't good at it, they just gave him Oscar because it was itching do it for a while. And, of course, the Miramax public relations machine provided Ben and Matt with their screenplay Oscar ... but one person came ... there are better movies out there that GWH.
