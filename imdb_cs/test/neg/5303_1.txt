This movie was embarrassed. Ulma Thurman looked as if she had some illness, and John Travolta looked as if he were going to sleep. I expected it to be the so-called sequel that Shorty would receive, not a half-baked remake of exactly the same movie (except that some characters have different names and clothes). I feel like I was ripped off and Hollywood deceived me again to see another terrible sequel (I also suffered through Alien Vs. Predator). <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has my voice for the worst movie of 2005!
