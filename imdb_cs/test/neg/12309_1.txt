I saw some bad things in my time. A half-dead cow trying to get high mud from her waist; head for collision between two cars; a thousand plates breaking on the kitchen floor; human beings living like animals. But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as a cat in a hat. This film is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than the Vllad Impaler, worse than people who put kittens in microwaves. It's the most disturbing movie of all time, easy. I thought it was a joke, some complicated joke and that Mike Myers was maybe a tall cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something. I shudder
