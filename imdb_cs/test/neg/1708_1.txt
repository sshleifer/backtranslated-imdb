As an independent filmmaker, I'm at least trying to make a decent film. This piece ____ was out of low budget. It was shot on video and not 24P mini-DV at least. The look and feel of it was just baaaad. I met the director a few years ago at the ShowBiz Expo in LA and talked about the film-making for dummies he compiled. I thought this little video would be something, but I think I was wrong. He could bring the value up a little by shooting a 16mm movie instead of the horrible video. The story was stupid, as did acting and a false green screen and sound and nine yards. I had a choice tonight and rented a movie and made a bad choice. Damn !!!!! I bought JoyRide, which was a damn movie. Perhaps the director should read real film books about filmmaking and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget. Perhaps he should learn from the masters who did, the Night of the Living Dead and the Evil Dead and Chain saw the massacre. just to name a few of the best low budget hits. This is one video that should have been dead. I can't call it a movie because it didn't use a movie.
