I am an infant, honestly I cannot understand how anyone could allow such a scenario, throw anyone in the film, let alone direct it. The fact that I am writing this review feels like an insult on my fingers, this movie should be thrown into a trash can rather than be reviewed. I am disappointed with Flex Alexander for even thinking about taking the BIGGEST EXAMPLE FOR SCRIPT, let alone how I consider this role. FOR GOD! I think I insulted the word "essay" ... uh yeah. What you know, the less you said about this mindlessness, the better. You were warned, no one warned me that I had to experience terror myself. KEEP AT YOUR OWN RISK.
