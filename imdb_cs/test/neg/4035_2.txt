That was a very unsatisfactory film. I would definitely call it the worst movie ever. Acting and writing were bad. And the jokes weren't funny. I don't see why this piece of crap was even made on earth. I'm not a picky man and I can enjoy stupid things, but that's just too stupid and just awful. <br /> <br /> Avoid this pathetic waste at all costs!
