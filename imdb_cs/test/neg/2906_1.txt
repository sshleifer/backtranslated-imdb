This is by far the worst movie ever made. I have no doubt. I have seen such crap as Manos, the Space Revolt, and what not, and I can honestly tell you that it does not hold the candle in the Scientific Fool. Science Crazed has no obscure plot. Something about a guy who makes a woman pregnant over a Turkish baster, and a baby born * hours later is fully grown and ready to kill. Of course, he is a newborn, he takes about an hour to kill people. The director continues to shoot and lasts about fifteen minutes before an unpleasant death occurs. There is a dialogue page for the entire movie, however, the dialogue comes about a minute after it is spoken. <br /> <br /> Sample Scene: A monster is walking down the hall. We know this because there are about ten minutes of looping feet of his feet. Between the loops we are treated by two women. Repeat ad nauseum for about 20 minutes. When a monster appears, no one moves, and everyone looks like a deer in the spotlight because the monster takes another 10 minutes to get to them to kill them. According to the level of acting you would guess that people are already dead. <br /> <br /> I know my description doesn't seem too bad, but believe me, I can't fully describe the pain that science is crazy. Stay away and boycott all the video stores that carry it. :) <br /> <br />
