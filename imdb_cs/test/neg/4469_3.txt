(very serious spoilers) This movie was a huge disappointment. There are so many problems I don't know where to start. So, I'll talk about what's good about the movie. The cast was great. Steve Martin brings a really funny middle-aged performance, a high-class, fit white guy. queen latifah plays great, beautiful, urban, black gal. and eugene lions, playing well alone. add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - they all played their games really well. And if you watch these guys for 1.75 hours, it costs you $ 8, then you won't be disappointed. but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes. First, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes that offend everyone. All white people are upset fanatics. all blacks are ebonics ghetto-speakers. Blacks are hip, cool, with him and the poor. white are nerds, tough and rich. (Except the eugene dose, he is clearly taken with the queen of the latifa and "speaks lingo" - so the latifa nicknames him "madman". so - if you are a white man and you love black women and you know street slang you have to be a madman). the film is dotted with overt racial insults towards black members, and in turn, whites are portrayed as moroni and boobs. Putting the racing card aside, lets take a look at the main mistake in the movie: destroy the character of the latify. she comes to Martin's home under false pretense, but she likes Martin anyway. to be wrongly accused of robbery, Martin seizes her case. 3/4 way through the film we find that the latifa is a jail character. so our sympathy comes out of the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot. the film looms from the scene to the latifa scene, which appears at some point where it should be "no", that it is (like a country club or martin's house) and martin is trying to hide it. it is a running gag. then in the final minutes of the film they decide to finally deal with the latify claim that she was wrongly accused of bank robbery. Martin goes under cover as Homeboy Extract (Let's Take It, Unusable) The confession of latifa is a former friend, and everyone lives happily to the end. <br /> <br /> Finally (but there is much more wrong with this movie) This movie seems to be a hodge-podge of clips from other movies. the assumption is clearly borrowed from another movie "Martin House-Sitter". where goldie hawn comes to life with martin and shakes his rigid middle class life. martin and latifa meet online - ala "youve got mail". the whole "bizarre nanny corrects the life of a rich man" goes as far as "sound of music" and "mary poppins". <br /> <br /> I wouldn't see this movie again for free.
