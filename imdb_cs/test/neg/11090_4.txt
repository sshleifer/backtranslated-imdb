Julie Delpy plays in this scary film about a sadistic relationship between father and daughter in France in the 14th century. The film seeks to break the romantic knightly image of a heroic medieval knight by showing a grim picture of a period defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. The film opens with a child, François, growing up in the shadow of a century-old war, said his father to keep his mother safe and wait for his return. François takes steps when he finds his mother with a lover in bed. François murders him in the name of defending his father. Just like a father as a son, François grows up and leaves his family to get into the same war. This setting is somewhat an explanation for the events that will come, because on the way home we have already noticed that there is something wrong with François. The war didn't do well with him, he changed. Béatrice de Cortemart (Delpy) is waiting for her beloved father to return from capturing English. She is pure heart and she was left to take care of the property while her father was gone. In the absence of her father, Béatrice has to deal with financial difficulties, which strengthens Béatrice's hope that her father will return to save her. After returning, however, he notices that he has lost his will to enjoy life, and tortures and humiliates everything around him, even his own daughter. From this point on, the film depicts the various ways François worries his family. Starting with the humiliating own son and ending with the rape of his own daughter Béatrice. Setting a movie in the Middle Ages to alleviate the blow as the viewer can say that these kinds of violent acts took place in difficult times. And indeed, many Incest films, such as Tim Roth's "The War Zone (1999)", which are present, were more shocking because of that. Delpy appears in this movie in several bold nude scenes. She seems to be angelic and beautiful. When I saw some animal torture scenes, I was angry. I believe, and it's not confirmed that some birds have been killed to make this movie that really upsets me. The quality of the film decreases when real violence is used for animals. I hope this movie will be released again without the cruel scenes. These scenes do not contribute much to the film's story. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is too long. The script is problematic. Before the war, we will not reach François and Béatrice, but we will not get an answer as to why he has become so extreme. I should pass this film, but I have to mention a few scenes worth watching this movie: <br /> <br /> * The scenes of a young child who is able to murder in cold blood are really shocking. I first saw it on "City of God (2002)". Here, François, kills his mother's lover while his father goes to war. Great scene and very graphics. The shots of Béatrice, which her father raped when she was pregnant, were really shocking and interesting. A rape scene where Delpy burns rags and cleans. He asks his brother to kick her in the stomach with the hope that the abortion will last. The brother humiliates the scenes where the father releases his son's head for food - humiliates him and then complains about the war. Later he donned his son with ladies' tablecloths. The film won César (French Oscar) for Best Costume Design, I agree, the costumes here really make the film authentic for a given period of time. The location of the film is Château de Puivert, a true 12th century castle and historical monument, located in Aude, south-central France. Beautiful castle and mountain views will really help you fit into the period of this movie. The film has also been nominated for 3 more Caesar prizes, but they have all been pulled into the very successful French film "Au revoir, les enfants" ("Goodbye, Children", 1998). Published as "Beatrice" in New York, March 1987. Only in France, to be held in November 2007. Followed at YES3 on May 3, 2007 at 5:45 pm at work.
