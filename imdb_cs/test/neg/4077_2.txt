I mean, I went to this movie with my expectations too high. I thought it would be fun because it is a continuation of Bruce Almighty that was really funny and it's Steve Carell, who is a great comedy actor, but a kid, that was fun. The film is advertised as a sequel, but it really has nothing to do with the original, because the only people who repeat their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, but Steve's character is totally different, he's no longer a jerk, who was in the first one here is a nice guy. The story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny. All the actors involved (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a very miserable portrait) have talent, but none of them seem to use it and it looks like it's just for money in the movie. Now the conspiracy is obviously shaped after Noah's story, but there are so many bad things with him, I don't know where to start. I think a big problem is that in every round Evan thinks he's crazy despite all the things that happen to him, a huge white bear is growing in two days, getting help from animals around the world, building a giant arch in a few weeks , in real life people wouldn't have been ridiculed for this boy, they would say it was a new Noah. Also special effects are good, but what the hell is the biggest movie flood ever made in Evan Almighty? They really had to waste so much special effects as filling this crappy movie. Jim Carrey seems to be a clever man because he has stayed out of the three worst sequels ever made. Mask, Dumb and Dumbered and now Evan Almighty. This was a huge disappointment and Tom Shyadac should be ashamed of himself.
