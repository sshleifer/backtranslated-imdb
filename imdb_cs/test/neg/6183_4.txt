I read all the posts on this confused semi-noir and I am confused about what is very cruel in the harsh light of 2007 when it seems to be a very sloppy product for the production of a late RKO assembly line. All this endless documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with central conflict and just fall for the run. The editing is downright careless: the scenes just end and are followed by other scenes that have nothing to do with what preceded them. The Dialogue bears traces of Odet's trails: high-flow metaphors that could never have come from the limitations of these people. But what is really surprising is how terribly redesigned the triangle is from all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she growled wildly and twisted and sprawled wildly - an undisciplined performance that has several levels below. Douglas, who was exaggerated to be nice, then goes on a murderous rampage and is like hammy like Ryan, growling and screaming most naturally. The less interesting second pair at least provides a recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is, according to today's standards, a little Neanderthal, is nevertheless smooth and convincing, such as Stanwyck's (much younger, one supposed) brother, and Marilyn Monroe, as his girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. On Monterey's windswept coastline (and all that Monterey shots, though very irrelevant, is interesting as a documentary about what the city looked like), amid all overheated hysteria, these two are islands of common sense. Last Point and Spoiler: Maybe the Breen Office ordered, but does anyone believe the happy ending in a second? Stanwyck may temporarily return to an obedient wifey, but I give the marriage a month.
