Totally brain dead action agent made in the Philippines. This is one of the Philippine films that have tried to pass on themselves as American films on the international market. After a rather boring start, the film begins and never fails. It's actually a rip-off of the worst movies Chuck Norris ever did: an American prisoner in Vietnam is brainwashed by the Soviets who implanted a microchip in his brain so he is programmed to kill the Pope, then the US President. One of his old comrades (played by B-film stalwart Max Thayer) is sent to stop him. Absolutely ridiculous action scenes, vile performances (Nick Nicholson's performance as an evil Soviet commander is a must see!) And an unlikely plot is one of the holiest action shots ever made available to the general public.
