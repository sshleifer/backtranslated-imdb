Well, the Cannes artyphartyrates liked this movie, but I'm not scared. If you like the type of movie where the shots persist for so long that you wonder if the actor fell asleep or the cameraman went for lunch, then that might be for you. A large part is similar to this with short stays in the realm of inconvenience. I did not consider it shocking or disturbing, as some other reviewers - just a little disgusting and meaningless. The only reason I haven't given this one star is that acting is commendable and the movie is pretty well shot. However, the land has nothing to recommend. Much of the film shows only a grumpy woman who teaches or listens to the piano, which may appeal to some people. But in order not to think it's harmless, get ready for some snippets of pornography and sexual violence to wake you up with bad mouthfeel. Not recommended.
