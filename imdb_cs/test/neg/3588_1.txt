The only reason for the existence of FC De Kampioenen is local popularity. This caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years (and still counts). He deals with an amateur football team with an emphasis on "amateur". Each story deals with the same subject: some misunderstanding that takes ridiculous (and predictable) proportions to eventually resolve. The show has been running for more than 15 years and production has probably not. change winning team. Which means the show has had minor changes over the years (except for a few actors who have been replaced (almost all left alone instead of being shown a show). Humor has not changed a bit over the years and has been outdated when it first aired. I think you have to be Flemish to achieve this, and for over 60 years, this old-fashioned TV show.
