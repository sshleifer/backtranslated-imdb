The Mystery Science Theater 3000 would not be able to bring any redeeming quality to the performance of this "gem". This one is like a kitschy pirate copy of the 80s porn you could buy on VHS from the 42nd St. before Disney bought all smash and closed them all down. But wait - all sex scenes have been cut out. I urge someone to find a worse movie. This film could replace water eating as a humane interrogation method. No, I'll take it back - I'd rather enjoy the water. The only credit this movie could make is that it would be the worst movie ever made.
