Mmmm, previous summary says: "If you like aliens and predators you like this movie" I couldn't disagree more, this movie doesn't take any respect for its serious line and lowered two of the best loved sci fi sources to something more than just a teen horror slasher movie, it has none of the tension or foreboding present in previous aliens or predator movies and there is no recognizable leading character, i really didn't care about any of the characters and i positively wanted to see the stereotypical cast die early as possible in hopeful the hope that something better would replace them is really a need for super human incompetence, so that two of the most fearsome creatures ever invented positively cannot make an engaging exciting movie, just watch it if you want to see how to do it NO.
