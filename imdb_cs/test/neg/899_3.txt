I didn't care about that. It might have been useful if they had rid of the comedy / grotesque and focused on the dramatic / philosophical aspects of the script. <br /> <br /> The more the movie went on, the less I liked the protagonist / mailman. He has interesting things to do, but he's also hypocritical, insecure jerk. <br /> <br /> 3/10
