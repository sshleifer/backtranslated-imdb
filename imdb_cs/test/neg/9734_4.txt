Oh no. Movies like this are really bothering me. If this film is to be close to the truth, then I suppose Rommel knew Hitler before the Second World War. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler has changed. I can't imagine Rommel not knowing anything about Hitler's government policies, so Rommel must share some guilt for the German atrocities. With this in mind, I have a problem with the film that makes Rommel's life tragic at the end. Has he decided and we have to feel bad for him? I can't do it. Also, I cannot buy the theory that if more competent generals were able to fight the war, the Allies would have more trouble winning. If more competent people were in charge, the First World War may never have begun. From the point of view of watching the film, the film moves from place to place, and most of the time it appears to be a historic special with great actors playing historical roles. Leo G. Carroll has a couple of good scenes with James Mason and I liked the fact that they all spoke English without ridiculous accents. But otherwise it is not very important.
