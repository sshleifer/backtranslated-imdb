This movie was terrible ... It had nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a scythe, none of which appeared in this film. The beginning was a tangle of random scenes, most of which had nothing to do with the film, except that something like that shows that man is psychic ... but not too good ... <br /> <br /> After the first 10 minutes of the movie, the watch is only male in character. for his daughters. This is unclear when daughters meet two girls who died a year ago. But that's its scope. And why would I ask this movie was rated R? There were two drops of blood and four cursed words. And how did it get on the video store on Earth? This film was badly acted, badly filmed, poorly written, and totally executed altogether.
