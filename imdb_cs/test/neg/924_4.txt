When they announced this movie for TNT, I was excited. One of my favorite stories was Travesty from Donald Westlake's "Enough". After watching it, I wasn't so excited. I recently had the opportunity to watch it a second time with my aunt and again I was disappointed (she too didn't like the book and never read it). In this film, they managed to confuse all the magic of the book and turn it into a dim mash. The great part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him in other movies, but he played (Terry / Carey) Thorpe as a stuttering, incompetent yutz. In the book, Thorpe takes a lot of valium on his nerves, but remains outwardly collected almost all the time that is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also omitted a large part of the story (other than a 2 second look at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 killings for the police. This is important not only because it is funny, but because it helps to establish a relationship between Fred and Thorpe. Fred's betrayal at the end isn't nearly as impressive as it doesn't seem so close. They become quite good friends in the book, especially on Fred's side, which is all the more ironic that he is the one who arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a little from casting, I love Adam Arkin, but he wasn't cheerful, happy to be a lively positive kind of detective, the character traits Fred has, which is obvious to him not to deal with evidence and so more shocking . Patricia and Edgarson were close enough to the book and James Cromwell was great, though he didn't look like Martin Balsam. The whole scene of a boring boat house, which was completely added to the film, was much less interesting than Edgarson's police find after Thorpe transported him to Seattle and blamed death from the crowd. Kit was fine even though she was mostly rewritten and it would be nice to see her die when she was a little annoyed. I do not mind that changes in books can make movies, I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would be nice if some of the changes in this movie were more fun or smarter than duller.
