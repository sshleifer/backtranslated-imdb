As a massive fan of three TV series, I was very interested in the fact that LoG is moving on the big screen. However, in my sincere moments, I had doubts about the likely success of the concept and whether the writers would be able to maintain a high level of wit, comedy and horror that filled the original series. Unfortunately, my concerns were not unfounded and the film was a huge disappointment. I'm trying to understand other comments on this site. Obviously, people have a right to their opinions, but the guys I've been looking at agree with me and fans are just as big as me. Acting lacked conviction, but it is so good that although not the best, it is still highly observable. The main problem was the plot - and the script. There were a few laughs, but not enough, a few moments of disgust, but not enough. The worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after leaving the cinema. So rarely did I feel so totally unspspired by the film and so unmotivated to discuss it with others. I write this comment as a warning to other League fans - get a wide range of opinions on this movie before we see it. If you love the League, you may be able to see that their movement to the cinema has not been organized. Unless you can convince yourself of this, you will have a faintly glamorous genius in your mind who is an example of a TV series. LoG at the cinema? Like a log. (or small brown fish).
