By the time this movie was released in 1996, director Mark Lester has made tight, sharp little B action pictures for over 20 years. He was responsible for the great "Truck Stop Women" from the 1970s and several other small gems; Unfortunately, he is also responsible for this bagpipe. It's a shame to see a talented - and still smoking - Theresa Russell is wasting again, but he's still the best actor in this picture. Eric Roberts appears for a while, doing his thing Eric Roberts and then disappearing, which is not an unwelcome event in the picture with Eric Roberts in it. Actually, Frank Stallone is not bad, which should give you an idea of ​​how pathetic this picture is. As mentioned by other reviewers, the action scenes - which is why this image comes first - are almost completely illogical and unrealistic, except that they are somewhat awkward. Other than some "vintage" clothes and a few old cars, there's no sense that for the 1930s, the era in which this movie is set. The sidebar script with irritating gaps in logic and low historical accuracy - this is not a document, of course, but filmmakers could have at least CLASS for little authenticity - and the performances that move from grade B to school level have pushed this cheap little sister to 4:00 am on Sunday at HBO where I saw it.
