Was Vanessa Redgrave with mogadon during the filming? It was like reading from autocue. I saw more life in a wooden spoon. Or maybe it was part of the character? whatever, it was very annoying, I still wanted to shake the screen to hurry. I read the book a long time ago and I didn't like it much, except that Septim's descent into madness was very good - but I don't think Rupert Graves showed it very well; The connection between his life and Clarissa is not well done, but I believe that trying to show them to the victim's soldiers to allow people like Clarissa to continue their lives. The film is very biting and has no real unity with it. He hated it.
