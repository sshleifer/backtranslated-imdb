This is one of those star comedies that could be a) hysterical, or b) they want you to go to the dentist instead. Unfortunately, one night in McCool is classic "b". Goldie Hawn has recently commented on "City and Country" that this is a big problem in Hollywood that is starting to hire actors and put together a deal. before completing the script. You have to imagine that not only did they enter this picture without a full script, but they also broke it daily. Maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of the studio who say, "It's a script, stupid." This is also one of those movies where you feel sorry for the actors most of the way. They work on their butts and try to make it all hysterical, but they know that most of them will not be accompanied by abdominal laughter, but the sounds of crickets that you can hear in the silent theater. Is it an incredible disaster? Not entirely. There are some smiles along the way, mostly due to the actors' efforts. I would probably leave the theatrical thinking, "Eh. It was all right." So why undeniably a hostile tone in my review? Termination. If, as noted, the rest of the movie is just a setting for the end, then it lacks effect. I really wish I could talk about it specifically, but I hate people who give too much (even in a warning). Just say that once you see John Goodman behind Paul Reiser (nothing here is gone. It's in the trailer), get out of the theater and go think: 'Uh. "The rest of the movie is on and creatively bankrupt. And you will be horrified that in reality people will laugh at this mess. If you loved" Something About Mary "or" Meet the Parents " then don't bother to see this movie.
