Dark reality is a film that is somewhat dilapidated. While the storyline and story are good, there is a little too much unnecessary nudity. Although I feel that the film was technically well done, acting was false, it was too much for me to watch. Basically, IT says there are a lot of missing people who will never be found and may be tortured by sick whacks. I feel that some information about prisoners and their reasons for being so ill would help some. It comes as a snuff film, just made for violent content. If you want to see women who are beaten, tortured and killed, then it is for you. If you are looking for a little liter and more expressive and justified, skip this one.
