Oh, Zive. It is not another chick where men would be all pigs, and women will get even for having suffered. The only difference is that there is every pig in the film or a brain drain. I hated this movie for the moral question of why it is right to send a man to jail for a murder he didn't commit. It is more immoral than its abuse and anger. This film shows all the situation ethics of bad writing. I saw it on the CBC "Best of Britain" series. If it's the best of Britain, it's no wonder the British film industry is in trouble. The only clear spot in this movie was David Tennant, who plays his character so ugly that I probably spit on another person who talks with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield is trying to play the victim, but eventually ends up as naughty as David Tennant. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> There are parents in the Brain Porridge category who don't see anything wrong with the obvious psychotic Brendan. English policemen are brought out to be incompetent, unable to issue tickets. The British police force should sue the filmmaker for defamation. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the electricity you need to watch to launch your DVD.
