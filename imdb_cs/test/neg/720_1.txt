It was an interesting adaptation of William Shakespeare's last known solo play, but in my humble opinion, terrible. Jarman tries to change the characters of the characters to the start. It gives Miranda the feeling that he's been crazy for insanity on the island for so long, Prospero is no different on his side - a mixture of madness and self-pity on his side. I can't imagine Shakespeare thinking that his characters are something like Jarman portrays them. The appearance of Kaliban is perhaps the only thing he was right about, but then I had the impression that Caliban was a tortured, distorted monster, but it turns out to be a crazy, northerner who is constantly chewing, not like I imagined him. Ferdinand makes a short look, naked most of the time and silence. In fact, until I stopped watching this terrible adaptation, there were so many lines out of the game. If anything, I think Jarman tried to rewrite Shakespeare and include his own scenes most of the time. In the first part, so much text is cut that it's not a Shakespearean game, but a load of 70 melodramatic, nonsensical garbage. Trying to interpret this game more realistically at the end, but this game has never been realistic, and it was nothing like it was displaying the text.
