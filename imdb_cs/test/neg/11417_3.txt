Simply put, this was a pompous piece of dog poop. Too stage and everyone is absolutely melodramatic queen of drama at any moment. After a while I was beginning to wish that every character in the film was not as tense anal retentive. And this film has another of those that have recently been bothering. to fashion and they shouldn't have: all the scenes are in a kind of scrubbed, blue-gray. Hmmm, the last time I checked, the candles and torches are quite able to give a fairly wide range of colors. In fact, the light they emit tends to be more in the warm, yellow-yellow spectrum. So where does all the blue-gray gray light come from? <br /> <br /> This movie has fantastic kits and glitz cgi fx, but it's still dreck. It is a pathetic junk that is being published for today's moviegoers who are easily stolen by pathetic junk. I enjoy the vampires and werewolves as a plot plot device, but this was total hacking. Universal Studios' 1941 "The Wolfman" is infinitely superior, although its fx is quite primitive compared to what could be done today. <br /> <br /> I've done this franchise. The first movie was reasonably decent. The second is still a little fun. But I couldn't even finish this all the way to the end because it was so boring.
