This movie was cheesy and it was more than that. It was about the guy who gets a curse on him and turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was for the title. He got married before the guy turns into a gorilla. I was a little upset because she wasn't a gorilla bride: now he's the gorilla's wife. She should have married him when he was a gorilla, and the title would make more sense. They are all in the middle of the jungle and they all want to leave. It's not just a B movie, it's more like a Z movie. Oh, he's not cursed yet.
