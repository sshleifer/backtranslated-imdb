I like the work of Stephen Kings and the book was great, but I was very disappointed when I bought the movie on DVD. This was one of the worst B-movies I've ever seen. They seem to have had a tight schedule, and they only took one shot on each scene, even though it was wrong. And where did they find the actors.
