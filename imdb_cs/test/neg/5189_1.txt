About 20 minutes into this lame apology for the movie, I realized that reminded me of one of those annoying people at work who are always saying that they really lame jokes or do very rude things because they think it's funny and trying to entertain everyone. This movie is billed as playing Traci Lords, it's not such a bad actress, but its lines aren't funny and it's not a star <br /> <br /> The actor is some of the worst I've ever seen , except the Lords, the girl who plays Casey, and maybe the Colonel, who seems odd. I can't imagine why a former military colonel wanted to start with SNOWBOARDING ACADEMY. Are there also those that exist? The budget would be better spent coaxing these women into doing a feature porn feature. "Freddy Got Fingered" currently has a score of 3.5, "Frostbite" has 2.7. I'm confused these two movies are within 1.0 of each other, FGF's "Godfather" compared to this garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
