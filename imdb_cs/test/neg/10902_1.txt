It seems that in the eyes of some - these days there are not enough horror movies involving young people chased through the desert by a mysterious bloodthirsty lunatic in a truck. All we have so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man. REST STOP may be the worst. It's about a girl and her friend who leaves her life behind and starts together in California. On the way, she stops on a dirty toilet, so the young lady can be relieved, but when she comes back she finds out her boyfriend and his car are gone. From there he learns that the perpetrator is the man who directs the yellow van who is watching and terrorizing it while hiding in the toilets. This film is so unoriginal that it is boring. Acting is uncomfortable, gore is mild and the killer whose identity is not revealed throughout the movie is something that is unforgettable. Terrible - terrible movie ...
