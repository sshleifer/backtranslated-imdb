After reading so many shining reports of "It's All My Days", I went out and bought them for Christmas. I'm afraid it's a waste of money. I was looking forward to something in the same league as 'Brideshead Revisited' and a few other great British TV productions, but it's definitely not among them. The characters are too good to be true, entangled in a very predictable plot, and with the coolest and charming scenario I have heard in years. Yes, it has its moments, but it is very thin on the ground. The leading actor is interesting, mainly due to his mysterious resemblance to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian in 'Brideshead'), just dark. His unquestionable talent, however, is wasted on a character who is unbearably self-confident and priggish. His prickliness is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the Somme during WW1. He makes early episodes, centered around his nervous state, better than he plays angular pure, socialist do-good later. Women are absolutely incredible. His first wife is annoyingly splitting and chirping, girlfriend, perfect sophisticated slut and last lady hodge-podge political bosh. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other masters named Hobarth, forgetting the actor's name. The high-minded script story is typical of Andrew Davies, a screenwriter, in his early years, and becomes tedious within the first two episodes (this mini-series is 11 episodes long!). From episode 4 I just wanted to get through the damn thing. Music is just as tedious, limited to one melodic piano melody and a chant sung by boys during credits. No costs were spared on setting up a location that gives some visual relief to the otherwise unbearable viewing experience. I like stories of this kind, as a rule, and I'm very disappointed with the maudlin nature of this series. If you want to watch something riveting about WW1 and its after-effects, there are many other much finer vehicles to rent or buy. One that comes to mind is the 'Unknown Soldier' ​​of 1998. The characters in this Masterpiece Theater presentation are real and fascinating and move, unlike the two-dimensional puppets in 'To Servem Them All My Days'. As for films about boys' schools, stick to "Goodbye Mr Chips" or "Tom Brown's Schooldays". <br /> <br /> I know this is contrary to the general favorable view of this mini-series, but I strongly recommend that you change your mind twice before earning $ 80.00 on Acorn Media for their 4 DVD set, of which 2 the discs on my set had insurmountable frost and skipping problems.
