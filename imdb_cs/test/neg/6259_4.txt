Like CURSE OF KOMODO was for the feature film genre, Jim Wynorski CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a straightforward parody of slasher movies such as the SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. Psycho, who has escaped from his padded cell, (... was sent to loony, by killing eleven people), works across the mountainous landscape of Bobcat County attacking anyone within its reach. A cheerleader car, their teacher, two instrument hands and a driver are on their way to competition when their car runs out of fuel, and is expected to have to go back. Fortunately, the group will find a cabin ahead, but will fall prey to the killer who attacks every victim. Free psycho in the county could not kill one girl because she was in a cheerleader locker room while he was elsewhere, which means that one of them is the culprit. Meanwhile, the county sheriff and his deputy are watching where their psycho is, while trying to find a place where the cheerleading team is missing. Shooting cheap on video, Wynorski does what he can, with a limited budget he has to find clever ways to kill off-screen characters without the luxury of effective effects. In other words, a lot of watermelons were stabbed, the sound effect allowed us to know that certain victims who had turned black into their darkness with their gloved hands died wildly. Wynorski includes a scene from the SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE series about Brinke Stevens Linda, who is being watched by a drill killer (... the killer and Linda both injured the dead, but I think Wynorski wanted to join this movie, though somewhat wrong) .. still it was nice to see her, though it was glorified portraits. Tamie Sheffield, as well as Mrs. Hendrick, a female student in trouble, has a long long bathing scene in the shower that soaps naked body and fake breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are a little unconvincing because their apparently at the age of twenty. Aging soft-core porn stars Samantha Philips (.. as a police officer who is attacked by a psychopath looking) and Nikki Fritz (.. a tourist who is bothered by running across a dangerous bridge) surprisingly do not have to pull down. Wynorski veterinarians Bill Langlois Monroe (.. as Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle (.. as a detective who helps Murdock in his case) contribute to the partial search for John Colton McPherson's serial killer. Interestingly, McPherson's story serves as McGuffan because the film's meat is actually dedicated to a group of cheerleaders and their dangerous situation. I'm not sure if the slasher fans will accept this film because it takes too long for the killers to burst into flames and when they finally enter the picture, the violence is not strong enough or shocking to satisfy.
