There is one big mistake for a movie that has won so much recognition and appreciated this spinoff on "Rosemarys Baby". It starts with Andrew / Adrian no matter what his name is, because he's so confused he doesn't know who's gone from cult to his mother and is soon kidnapped by a strange lady who cares for him as if he's his mother. Acting is terrible when Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible when he burst into his face, never grinning and Dukes of Hazard's clothing looked more like a drunk than Satan's son. In fact, it is all he does is drink and fall carefreely when he tries to capture his past and the last memory of his mother who went on a bus that screams at him. He finds a friend who seems to be an angel but is quickly killed and electrically controlled in a hillarious scene that looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew gets self-esteem, and a cult with first-part members tests him to see if he really is the Son of Satan. His stupid self fails the test and gets out of alter glittering with myme makeup and jumps on stage nightclub and dancing like a clown on crack !!! This scene is unforgettable and worth the watch. The end is terrible and somewhat predictable given how stupid he is in the whole movie. Do not look at this piece of trash or lose respect for the first part.
