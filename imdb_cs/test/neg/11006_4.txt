Director John Madden, from Shakespeare at Love Fame, gives us another pretty bad movie in Ethan Frome. The plot centers around a new reverend coming to Starkfield, where he teaches the story of Ethan Frome, a sick wife who is a local maimed man, and a one-time romantic slave with a maid. This film, edited by Richard Nelson of the Pulitzer Prize-Edwards Wharton novel, is not interesting in the least because of the extremely weak script and the wrong direction that transforms the scenes that should be laughing. However, there are other aspects besides the movie that works - cinematography is fine, Rachel Portman contributes a beautiful score, and while nobody is in their best position, Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan are well working their roles. Overall, however, Ethan Frome is worth only marginally and is forgotten.
