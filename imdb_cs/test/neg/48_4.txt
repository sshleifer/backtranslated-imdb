It's Saturday, it rains, and I think every movie should have at least one comment ... so I watched "Doctor of Crime's Courage" until the end. It is a mysterious murder with a typical cast of characters and a few usual suspects - each with its own motive for crime. The story begins suddenly and the viewer is thrown into a conspiracy without character development or storytelling. I think it's not too surprising for Movie B of this period. There are also some moments that look and feel like it's pre-WWII, but maybe it's because of the writer's background in radio shows. "Doctor of Crime" is a sleuth who happens to be visiting California for some R&R from his psychiatric practice on the East Coast. He merges with a secretary secretary friend with whom he is implied, was together for one or more previous mystery solutions to capers. The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (AKA Dr. Watson), and also occasionally lightens things with a bit of comic relief (sort). There is also a somewhat simple, but not quite humiliating police captain, which at times is annoyed by the interference of the sleuth. And then there are the mysterious Bragg, brother and sister who are dance artists in the nightclub. Dance is a kind of interpretive dance that has become one of those moments that has been felt for more than 30 years. Though it is a California story, Bragg seems to live in the castle! <br /> <br /> There was one element that could amuse me a little, but I wouldn't reveal anything more than that I always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered, rather than known in advance. (Although I can think of many, many B movies that could be evaluated above and it's hard to say that watching this time is well spent) I haven't seen any more movies from the "Crime Doctor" series, so I can't make any comparisons.
