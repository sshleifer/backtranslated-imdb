This film provides a movie example of the word worthless. It's terrible, you can forget about plotting or decent playing because it's not there. And with the rejection of any respectable story or acting, or even feature being mildy scary then there is usually only one plus left for a horror movie. Appeal to those who like soft core porn. This film doesn't even have it. Women show a bit of skin, but not like the Xena show. In addition to the main star, which is not particularly attractive and has a few poor, and I think bad sex scenes. In short, if you like good movies, you are not interested in this film; if you like cheese, you cannot rent this movie; , you can't do better than avoid this movie.
