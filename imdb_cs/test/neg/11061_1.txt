If you're a little masochistic and want to waste your time, you should try. I was wasting a lot of time looking at it, so I'm not going to waste any more on why it's so awful. Be warned !!! I see I have to fill 10 or more lines. Here we go: every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget movie of scary monsters underground, which hopefully proves to be a hit. Cavern is one of them. I had no great expectations about this, but acting is so bad and production so poor that I was seriously thinking about a refund. Phewww ... one more line about useless film ... Oh, I'm done.
