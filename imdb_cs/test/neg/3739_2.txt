I like John's work as a singer, but the film was boring and "not worth seeing". I thought he did "ok" work when he acted on his part. When he says, "your affair with ol" a man, his star, I laughed a little on his face movements ... or his lack. I recommend a movie if you like John's music, but not like a video on Saturday night. <br /> <br /> If you like his music, then the video has a little music from him, but not much. So so ... at best
