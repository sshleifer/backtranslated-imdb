The selection of cocky, boring and racist "Cimarrons" is the worst choice for the best picture in the history of the Oscar. He was badly behaving (especially by the forgotten Richard Dix, whose performance as self-centered and irresponsible Yancey Cravat is one of the most narcissistic in the history of screenings) and walked in, the film is now really shocking because of the racist tendency to its one black character, which is introduced By being shown to sleep in a chandelier. Other comments by IMDb reviewers have rejected the attitude of this character as being just dated, but many of the movies that appeared during this period did NOT DO NOT MEET BLACKS like sneaking, lazy mental deficits the way this monoton is very happy; so this argument is at least weak. Whether you consider this humiliating characteristic to be a shocking bad taste for anyone, at any time or just forgiven the ignorance of a less educated era, it is very painful to watch the 21st century eyes. It might not depend on whether the movie was too long as it is. He voted for Best Academy Oscar at the 1930/31 Academy when such durable classics as "City Lights", "The Public Enemy", "Dracula", "The Dawn Patrol" and "The Blue Angel" have not been nominated, "Cimarron" is By far the worst choice to join the Oscar Pantheon.
