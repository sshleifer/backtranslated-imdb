SOUND THUNDER. One of the greatest stories he has ever written. One of the most famous Grand Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a great story. But what a reversible movie! In Bradbury's sci-fi short story, a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to return in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule One is: Stay on the way, a floating metal walkway that provides no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During the hunt, the man steps out of the way and inadvertently crushes the butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present - the world, they know, has changed drastically. Although there are paradoxes in any time travel story, Bradbury's story was a quick jugular stroke, a parable of the ripple effect. The sound of thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most republished science of fiction story of all times), and exemplified by Chaos theory, Darwinism and butterfly effect (which would be only created in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's story, the miracle of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed, in turn overshadowed by the deadly danger to the existence of humanity itself. While in the movie, SOUND THUNDER (directed by Unequal Peter) Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO, the bad actor's clutch goes through the time portal over and over to try to correct his mistakes, like the excrement version BACK TO THE FUTURE. The film has nothing to do with Bradbury's mighty story, except for the initial shock of a prehistoric traveler. Serious Freedoms Marry with Bradbury's Story - Baboon Reptiles, Plants Overlapping Concrete in Chicago, Time Waves Rippling City, CGI Insectoids - For which Bradbury should sue pants and underpants and butts from movies. New writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should set up Big Balls Agency because they think they could actually add elements to Ray Bradbury's story to improve it. How do these guys go straight with such big balls? Ben Kingsley is the owner of Time Safari, with a hairpiece so bad that it looks like a hairpiece, Edward Burns is his leading hunter, Travis and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough, in BRAVEHEART) is the best breast scientist. I can't possibly relate to hundreds of thousands of countless stupidities and Asinian pieces of dialogue, but here's just one that David Oyelowo talks about as a "scientist": it refers to the Pleiades of the cluster, "Seven Sisters, they look like stars, don't they? But each of them is an entire galaxy. " No, idiotic scientist, they are, uh, stars. The three sages who rewritten Bradbury's story forgot that they knew nothing about physics or astronomy. Or writing. The best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's chest straining against her disheveled one-size-too-small blouse. <br /> <br /> - Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's film Mania).
