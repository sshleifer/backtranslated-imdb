There are so many logical mistakes in this show that it's hardly worth saying. 1) Mystic Gohan is nonexistent 2) Uub is as strong as MAJIN BUU, but it plays absolutely no role in the show, somehow it is easily overwhelmed by every bad guy 3) The whole idea of ​​Super Saiyan 4 is retarded and it's scary to lose to the super 17 (which is the worst idea for a DB villain EVER) 4) Super Saiyan 4 Goku is not a Super 17 match, but the untransformed Goku with the movement he learned in a movie that shouldn't happen, kills him 5) Vegeta is absolutely useless 6 ) No other character than Goku has any impact on the outcome of the battles 7) The series ends with a ghost bomb ... come 8) Goka invincible? absorbs dragonballs? lame 9) Gotenks? ... even better Goten ??? Kmeny ??? they both suck 10) Super Saiyan 4 includes a magic transformation into adult 11) Goku is a child 12) Goku is a child 13) No super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) No imagination with Gogeta animation 15) Gogeta absolutely useless 16) Great Bang Kamehameha is the biggest wasteland in anime history (it's not really logical, but I'm going away to the tangent) 17) The shortest character ever fights <br /> <br /> I could go longer if I didn't suppress most of the memories associated with this show. If I get enough money, I'm going to fund the remake of this series.
