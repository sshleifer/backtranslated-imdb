Thunderball and There are never two of the biggest treasures missing and never a surprising farce from the Empire Strikes Back hero Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to have stolen the show when Bond's mission in the middle of an expanding plot turns into a Hollywood wedding (sometimes when Basinger comes). What about Klaus Kinski? I still think Larga is doing casting, or, as is clear from both movies, breaks the story. The worst of all is the attempt to release the aging and very furry Connery as a sex symbol that really was in the sixties. The 1980s were mostly barren for Bondy, although For Your Eyes Only is a great title. Occasionally, when I need to waste time during the holidays by watching this film in the often intertwined Bond festivals, I think the best attribute of the film is its score, and I'm not soft. "Jazz" 80s.
