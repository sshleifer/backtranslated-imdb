Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war effort from within. At first it's hard to figure out, because when we know these guys are up to something, their mode of operation isn't very clear. I won't spoil it, but end up in amazing. Our hero committed a series of murders. A police force who doesn't know what's going on. What a coincidence that all victims seem to come and go from the same house. There are comments like: "A true patriot would do it or not." Obviously, the suspicion is mostly that the world doesn't know a spy or subversive if it jumps and bites them. I was also surprised when I saw Clayton Moore (Lone Ranger) in a romantic role. I never realized he did anything but sit on a horse. Of course, it's the perpetrators of criminals because they think they're immune from a list of killer guests. Anyway, Bela is something good and bad guy. The best scene in the movie is over, but I won't spoil it. As a curiosity and period piece it may be fun to watch some people.
