I'm sorry, you know why. I feel like watching this movie. I went to the theater with my friends to see this movie, and I still didn't give him the satisfaction of watching him in full (I left about 20 minutes ... I hope this will unfortunately be at least comfortable for a while.) Most movies now, even the wrong ones ... when I look at them, there may be a small part in the movie that makes me feel a little happy because it is an unpredictable joke or a good line ... this movie on the other hand felt uncomfortable and all the time I'm angry with myself, especially because I was wasting money on it. It was badly written, poorly directed, poorly filmed, and definitely wrong ... please <br /> <br /> for the sake of humanity, you don't see this movie, even if your person who wants to say he saw every movie ... just no ...
