The only people I would recommend to this film are blind and deaf, though I'm sure the sadomasochist would get out of it. This film had nothing; no acting, horrible music, horrible scripture - just the power to suck no happiness from your soul. Maybe you are now asking why or even how I managed to sit for an hour and a half of total instability, and it is a frankly difficult concept for me. First, I had to pace up and down as the movie progressed as I found it very hard to get comfortable. Secondly, I only did it without getting rid of my own arm to have something to beat me by death when I phoned friends for moral support when the storyline became particularly slow. The problem was that I became a pride when I finished it after thirty minutes, and that was a fatal mistake in my case. Normally I like movies to leave you with something to the end, but all this has done ..... Don't watch this movie for your common sense.
