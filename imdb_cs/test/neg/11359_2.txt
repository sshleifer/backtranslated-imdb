This movie is really bad, trying to create a scientific explanation for zombies always ends up taking away the credibility of the movie's history. There are so many things I could mention about a movie that I could almost write a book about how much film sucks. For example, there were about 50 people on the plane who killed as 100 and still came, apparently "virus" giving liver complications because they all had yellow eyes, so the virus caused people to roar like lions or something, and the virus didn't. it only regenerates the tissue because it also gives superhuman strength, not to mention that this virus will spoil people's hair. It is also important to note that if you shoot someone with a gun (probably only on planes), this person is thrown back into the air. Remember that if you escort a prisoner on a plane and you lose it, always look in the drawers and the closets of the bottle size, you never know where those bastards will hide. And if you happen to land a zombie-filled plane against the mountain and survive (all the time) after watching dozens of people who are killed, leave the plane, watch the sunrise and joke about the flight's dating attendance. :)
