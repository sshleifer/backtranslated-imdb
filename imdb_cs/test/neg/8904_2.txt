This movie has its heart in the right place, but unfortunately it's not much of a movie. It is rather a documentary film under the cover of narration. Bamako is basically a novelty op-ed piece to put on celluloid. However, your average well-explored op-ed piece is much more convincing and concise than anything that is mentioned here. The creator seeks to convey to the viewer the difficulty of African life, especially the country of Mali, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, G8 and the World Bank, using a false court against the above. The film is scattered for another 10 minutes, a half-hearted attempt at a narrative plot, and a bizarre Hollywood-style western-style shootout where the director seems to be pleased with his own cleverness (that is, Godard's frequent comparison). Of course, as the film begins, what and who is on the test is never explained, but as we know, the French refuse to spoon their audience. There are many passionate arguments, but they are often long-lasting, delivered in a piercing monotonous style (one that easily tunes after a while) and very specific. The last point is the most frustrating of all because there is a very well justified concrete case that should be raised against the institutions that are in the process. Unfortunately, all we get in 2 hours is that the IMF and the G8 are bad oppressors and should forgive the Third World debt. We only get occasional advice on the specific reasons why organizations are guilty at court, but they are never a clear case. False court arguments and images of the surrounding village make the suffering of these African people clear, but one wonders why we have to sit for 2 hours when a much more accurate picture could be drawn in the 20-minute Newsweek article. , or Bill Moyers episode. Finally, there is something very important about this issue, it is simply not presented very well, or very clearly, in this opulent, forgiving work.
