Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he's trying to do with this movie. If my good day turned into a night of disturbing memories before I think he succeeded. I know that there have been great questions in this film like who we are, what we are here is truly God. All the big questions, but I don't think it's funny when you have questions along such a tragedy. I'm just about showing real life, but come on. It is never funny when a woman is raped, someone kills himself (and family and friends who find the body) and people die of inexplicable and unnecessary reasons. The only good thing about this movie was his location was filmed. There are plenty of beautiful places. I'm not a film student, nor what I admit, I don't know much about what I admit, but I know that when I leave the theater with a sense of disgust, it wasn't a movie I would recommend to everyone.
