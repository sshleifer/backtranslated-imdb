I watched the last thread with an open mind. I'm sorry it's still bad. First, the movie is too noisy and you can't hear what people are saying. Accents are particularly bad Richard Masur. What makes a French chick in this movie ??? Wrong at worst. Walken's makeup is special. Harvard's scene is useless and not needed. Kristoferson's character is unlikely and I wanted him to be killed and left. Meanwhile, the character of Walken kills too early and easily (through makeup). The settlers are all stupid. GET ORGANIZED gives you a lot of hicks, people come to kill !!!!! John Hurts character provides some humor, but that's all. I have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap. The only good thing is that she destroyed the director's career and killed United Artists. After all these years, there is still bullshit.
