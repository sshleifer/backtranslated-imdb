Nor did I read the book on which the film was based, nor the letters between Vita and Violet. If I came to this movie with any expectations, it might be that the Bloomsbury group (including other Virginia Woolfs that were part of the Nicolsons) would be portrayed. It wasn't, but that wasn't a problem for me. I am thinking about how the people behind this film managed, in my opinion, so uninteresting and repetitive, and most of the characters are flat, despite the great material and very good actors. The script isn't just good enough. I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor - too many pointless sexual scenes (but only between women, while there is nothing explicit about Harold's many love affairs), too many pointless scenes in general, too little background information on characters. It seems to be special with regard to the quality of production - it seems to be a really ambitious work on the surface, but of course the script has the greatest weight and that is where this film fails. Vity's relationship with Harold attacked me as unconvincing, though they both act really well, especially her. The way they declared their unconditional love to each other in a sad way, I thought, simply, unconvincingly. It makes much more sense that it should happen through letters, as tmmvds points out that I would also like to know where the nicknames - Russian * and Mar - come from - why is someone called Vita with the nickname Mar? It could be small things, but it depends on us to contribute to a bigger picture. <br /> <br /> * I watched the movie with English subtitles and where it probably should have said Mitya, instead said Medea. That could explain to some extent my frustration with the nicknames - I couldn't understand why Vita should be Greek, while purple was Russian!
