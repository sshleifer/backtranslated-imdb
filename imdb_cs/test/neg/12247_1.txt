This movie would be a big piece of history if it were actually a real movie about Kennedy's assassination. It's too many mistakes in this movie to point out. It's a Kennedy assassination movie, but many important facts have been changed. Scenes are missing, and many scenes, after the president's limo goes through the sign, do not fit in. Both Kennedys move significantly slower than the other four people in front of them. The next time you watch this movie look for things that do not add up, such as Texas Gov and his, along with the SS men ahead, lunge forward, but you can see that the limousine is not stopping or slowing down, in fact, is accelerating. This film is clearly an attempt to cover up.
