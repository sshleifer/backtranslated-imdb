This is one of many US attempts to rebuild an old classic British TV show that is more famous than this. From what I can't see none of you mentioned or acknowledged that you knew there was a TV series "50's of the Sixties" called "Secret Agent Man". Phantom, etc.) A man who was tapped to become James' first, but he refused, because McGoohan was a very pious man and considered James Bond's bed to be hopping and violent ways to be against his values. This show was done in black and white, and it's a shame for those who haven't seen it, you miss a lot. Mr. McGoohan's character played in the "Secret Agent Man" on behalf of Drake, and after finishing off the show, he continued to the very popular TV series "The Prisoner". The character he played in "The Prisoner" was the character of an agent whose identity is not revealed, is kidnapped and transported to an island where he does not know where he is or who he is responsible for his kidnapping. What he knows is that his captors want to know the reasons for his resignation from the British secret service, and on this island people don't have names, but they are numbered and a Patricks number is assigned a number that is "6." the prisoner was in fact the same character he played in a secret agent man but McGoohan himself denied this. Ofourse there is an unmistakable famous song theme that the original secret agent man spawned. and the 60s pop musician and from what I've read some of you are actually thinking that the song comes from this version of the show.You're very bad at it.It was Johnny and comes from the original TV series, so let me help outline For those of you who complained about the name of the show that is stupid, well in England, it was actually called "Danger Man" and in the US it was retitled "Secret Agent Man" The supposedly stupid name of the show did well when it was first aired. <br /> <br /> Awarded that this contemporary show has little to do with the original, no such main character as Drake in this, and I think they did everything for this version to show their version of "The Secret Agent of Man". However, it uses a revised version of the original theme song, so it tells you that this show was really intended as a reworked, albeit lower version of the original series.
