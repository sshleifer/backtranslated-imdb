This film is a waste of talented people and a Hollywood budget. It seemed to me that everyone in the movie paid a favor by being in it because they are all in place and wasting talent in this terrible pile of film. It is a plot plot that is only pathetic, unrealistic and not so much fun or interesting. The only thing I was interested in was many big names in a movie that appeared for no apparent reason and that had no gaming or good lines to contribute to the film's mess. I expected to have some good things, because all these people were fine in other films. But it never went through. This film should be imprisoned as a punishment, but it would be cruel and unusual. You'll be shocked to see so many recognizable faces that go around such a horrible pathetic flat-line scenario and terribly bad behavior. This film reminded me of another complete loss of time with a lot of recognizable faces of BIG TROUBLE (2002), which also came from a readable scale on the suck-meter.
