Once again I fell for it, in my roots I desire a fun and bloody horror movie, even a vampire. While it's stupid, as long as I get fun in the mix, I'm a happy caravan, it doesn't take much. So I saw "Bled" on Hollywood Video cover and I was so curious about what it was, it looked a little interesting, so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? Not only did this film not fulfill the satisfaction I needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity, but I was tired. This movie has kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it's really not! I'm so close that I can go back to the store and beg for money, because it's one of the few times I actually turned off the movie. The artist meets a vampire, I mean, I don't know, I'm still trying to figure out what the hell was, but his name was Reinfield, so I suppose it's a cockroach that likes to scare people? I think not. Anyway, he thinks the artist has a certain light for darkness, so he gives her a cure to go to an alternative fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? I think not. So her friends are excited and decide to try the medicine too. So, after they decide to try the cure, things get weird, fantasies are real, I think I don't know, and the vampire is now going to be going to be a big tits girl in a scandalized outfit dressed. I think not. But a few girls really end up vampires? I think I don't know. Sorry for all "I dunno", this is perhaps one of the worst reviews I will write, but that's because this movie was just awful, boring, and confusing. I love to see that they want to be the actors you can tell the waiters are looking for the "big break". Not too clever to have fallen into a horror clich√©, sometimes it works, and sometimes it is not, in which case they should actually read the script. Since the movie, appearance, feeling, acting, all about this movie was just bad, I really recommend that you just go through the movie if you see it in the video store. Perhaps it was an interesting film with a different dimension to it, but why did they choose this director to display his "creativity" if he had any? That was a bad movie, just stay away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
