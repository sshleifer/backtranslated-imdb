This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain community as single men in 17th century Brazil. The story is interesting and informative. But this film - like a movie - is terrible. The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It is an Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. Battle scenes are fought to cheesy pop rhythm sounds best left to disco or bad cops dramas. It is true that the lyrics are folk-ish stories about the heroism of slaves. Special effects are absurd. Rather than invoking the mysticism of African religion and atavistic conviction, they only make the film look cheap. They are absolutely unbelievable and I don't just think of verisimility. Life in the Palmares community could not be as it is shown in the movie. For this society, as shown in the film, is a one-part kibbutz, one-part Afro-pop festival. Moreover, it is almost embarrassing to watch the director play the clichés of blacks as talented singers and dancers who just want to be happy. She portrays everyday life as a series of dance parties in which liberated slaves paint themselves in bright colors and swirl into pop-pop pop-ups. On the other hand, they have an abundance of beautiful foods, but the viewer hardly sees any work being done. The king is recovering against private property in a broken and cliché. When a man complains that people are taking vegetables that he has grown for many months, the king says, "What comes from the earth belongs to everyone, because the earth does not belong to anyone." If they need food, they have the right Take yours. "<br /> <br /> I'm glad I learned about this episode in history, but I'm sure the film with such low production levels and trading in such worn-out stereotypes would probably not be today.
