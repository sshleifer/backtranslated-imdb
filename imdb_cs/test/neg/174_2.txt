I hear people compare this film to Bok. As this comparison has been done, I will never guess because this film was by no means comparable to the Sideway. These 2 movies were as different as Star Wars and Thornbirds. All they had in common was that they both had wine as an object. Although the interviews in this document were partly interesting, they were destroyed by the very worst camera. experiment. I've never seen worse work with the camera in my life and compare it to a home video accidentally taken by 5-year-olds. I just give these two stars ONLY for interesting conversations with French wine types and for how American winemakers are corrupt and corrupt (aren't they all proud and corrupt?) This is NEGATIVE 10) for pitiful, horrible, terrible, terrible, VERTIGO-INDUCING, 5-year-old-to-better camera mess.
