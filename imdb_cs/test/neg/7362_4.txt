Look ... I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were times when my heart beat faster when the hair on my neck began to float as muscles began to contract, but like tape jokes, I had no real action, no decision and no money I missed. my wallet. Jaume BalaguerÃ³ and Miguel Tejada-Flores probably do not know the correct horror film recipe and as such have used the method of an old amateur cook who has thrown everything into the pot. Br /> <br /> This movie is really The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville and Hellraiser all in one. Amazing, I know, but true. All tastes are there, you can taste each one, just don't mix well. I will not go down to the list of all the things that are wrong with this movie; In short, good cinematography, average acting performance, worse dialogue. <br /> <br /> The real problem with stealing from so many movie charts and their combination into one movie, in addition to the resulting confusion, is that if you have multiple CAN charts running at once, you can't have multiple endings. And what does Jaume do when he encounters this problem? Like the English 101 freshman, you're ending your ellipse story, "Small car disappeared in the dark and ..... END" Oooh, scary. Not really. And very anticlimactic. The end left me confused and disappointed; almost empty. Take $ 10, go rent The Shining, Poltergeist and Hellraiser .. frighten your pants off, have fun and remember that Darkness existed at all. <br /> <br /> -BJamin
