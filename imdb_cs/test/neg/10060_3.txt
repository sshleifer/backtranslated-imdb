This movie is on my list of the worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it's hard to understand what's going on or why the characters are doing. All films have to have internal logic and this film just doesn't have it - the story doesn't make any sense. To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick, a crime is losing his talent in this movie. Faye Dunaway is happy because she plays a victim and kills early in the movie. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland has to be an amazing actor because he is good at looking good despite poor leadership and bad writing; his performance is believable and he can keep himself in the nature despite everything. If Dame Agatha Christie was alive, she would have died laughing! The movie is so bad!
