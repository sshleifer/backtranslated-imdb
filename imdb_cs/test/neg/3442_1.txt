Tim Taylor is a rude drug addict. He is a coward and a child and has absolutely no redemption qualities as an actor or person. The only movie with him in that which is pleasing is the "Galaxy Quest" and just because his character - bragged-out actor from the former hit TV show - was so close to real life for him. The rest of the cast is just as bad. I hate mother and actress who played her to Patricia Richardson, sucks! There is always a cliché, a stupid woman who is fat and likes opera and cares only for her children, while in real life she declares family values ​​and divorces after twins. And the children's actors were as interesting as the root channel.
