Schieder supplies a partially credible part as President of the United States with politically correct Maria Conchita Alonzo as Vice President. The movie just stinks. with so many conspiratorial holes it is a miracle they got to stick to the film he was filming. This movie, which has been included in HBO's schedule, is not worth seeing. 10 minutes to ask why it was written. 40 minutes into it you wonder why you're watching it. Save the effort and watch the re-run Hee Haw or something. Anything is better than this clunker.
