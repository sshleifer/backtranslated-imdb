This is the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I have ever seen. That completely fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing stupid plots and reducing 12 works on ... 3 or 4, I think. This makes absolutely unnecessary things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy pathways that question writers who have ever read myths such as changing birds to harps, sphinx lions, Delphi seers to Tiresias, and bulls to pedantic Proteus Aspects, never seen outside of Sam's fun series, concerning his first marriage, to a woman with a co-opted name of one of the Furies so it sounds appropriate to the season. <br /> <br I could accept a lot, but also completely failed in purely film standards; the most painful is the dialogue, the lead, pseudo-Shakespeare tripe. It is a bad re-interpretation of myths, which makes a sad attempt at the kind of postmodern revisionism that Crichton's "13. warrior "as far as the Beowulf legend is concerned, still containing strictly mythological elements such as clear disturbance from the gods and magical super power. A sad, sad failure of a fun experience that I am sure many of the quality actors are deeply sorry about.
