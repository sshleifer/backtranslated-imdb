How sad it is when the movie is as gorgeous as "Jurassic Park" slowly nosedive into hackneyed and average territory throughout its franchise. The latest sequel, Jurassic Park III, has brought no thoughts of character, story, or largely script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action that is neither exciting nor very interesting to watch. Dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of CGI progress, it only gives you a greater feeling that the film was drawn on the summer to rely solely on its name. The introduction of pterodactyl is not a great film. <br /> <br /> Read "Shrek" again. <br /> <br />
