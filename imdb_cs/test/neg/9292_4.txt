You may be interested to know that BARRICADE has been declared a failure by the study and a year before the popularity of ALICE FAYE has reached such a high level that the studio decided to release this film despite the fact that it was never completed. At the box office, it was modest. Faye refers to the murder during his nightclub in New York - and this scene was actually in the script and it was the way the movie was supposed to start. . Instead, it is completely missing and what could be an exciting sequence (including a complete Faye track number) has never been filmed. However, the rest of the story is largely intact and made the release of the film possible at runtime 71 minutes. The tired looking WARNER BAXTER is too old to be believable as Faye's romantic interest and is only a perfunctory as a reporter. The audience today would be offended by the portrayal of Chinese using broken English phrases like "I like I do noisy". Key Luke is one of the Chinese loyalists, but he plays his part in an inconspicuous, straightforward way. Arthur Treacher is all but invisible and yet gets a fourth bill on the screen to adjust the story changes. Originally, Joseph Schildkraut had a part in the film, but his part was eventually released out. <br /> <br /> A mishmash movie that will only be fun for Alice Faye's most deadly fans, who will be able to see her in a dramatic role - albeit weak. Charles Winninger is absolutely useless as a kind man who runs an American consulate. Despite all the weaknesses, there are several scenes with narrow leaks that are effectively played, and Black Freund's black and white photos.
