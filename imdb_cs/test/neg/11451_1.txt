*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There is not much to say about this early talkie era. (I hesitate to call "Cimarron" "movie" because I feel the word is too esoteric.) But that can be said ... mainly talking to him. Take, for example, the overuse of portraying Indians as a bad people. In one scene, a little boy from the main character of the film - a groundbreaking and overly ambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper shop - is just out of his father's office. Indian man kneeling in front of child. "Hi," says the boy in a very polite manner. The Indian gives him a feather, gets up and leaves. Yancy Cravat, Jr. "Mom! Mom!" screaming and holding an indian gift. "Look what the Indian gave me!" <br /> <br /> "How many times do I have to tell you!" he clicks on the boy. "You never talk to the dirty Indians!" Yancy Yates, Sr. (Richard Dix) meets a man who speaks with a forked tongue. At the beginning of the story, he seems to have a plan to give a family a better life. Soon, however, we find out that he is not very big than a man who is a perfectly good moral-minded person. His slave child, Isaiah (Eugene Jackson) is one of the narratives of this. At his first trek to Sunday morning service - one <br /> <br /> Tie is strange to give a sermon - Isaiah is trying to come, dressed like a Tie, long tail suit, holster, gun and everything. The tie tells him to go home. "Ya" doesn't want me to go with you church? "Isaiah says with cod. <br /> <br />" No! "Cravat corrects him and pats him on the shoulder. I want you to stay and watch the house. And if someone comes ... shoot him dead!

(Newsletters and posters, yes - but no newspapers.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps the weirdest of all, though: it's in a small town in <br /> <br /> Kansas. Yet, for some reason or another, Yancy Cravat is dead-set to <br /> <br /> call his paper "Oklahoma Wig-Wam." Really good Westerns have always been very little and far between - the only exceptions are Clint Eastwood's so-called "spaghetti westerns" late '60s to early' 70s. Western cliche, on the other hand, are a dime. <br /> <br /> If you like the clich√© of Westerns, "Cimarron" will be proud of you - but like me ... that made me embarrassed. <br /> <br />
