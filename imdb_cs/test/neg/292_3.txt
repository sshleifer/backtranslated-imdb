Recap: Simon leads a small team of special agents specializing in finding and recovering missing people against all possible chances. Their last mission is about their friend's granddaughter. She seems to have been caught in a network of a particularly cruel criminal, and everyone who was looking for her disappeared. Librarians are now in the case. Notes: This is pure Action B, through and through. The key phrase for this is the unlimited offer. There is an unlimited supply of ammunition, they do not have to reload once. There is an unlimited supply of bad guys, so the heroes have something to shoot at. There is an unlimited supply of breasts, many of them plain, in a futile (and as always unsuccessful) attempt to disperse from a hole plot. And there is an unlimited offer of bad acting (it's almost like the performance of Erika Eleniak in this, what about it?), And actors who are not interested in more than a pay slip (and why shouldn't that seem?). And as in most B-action movies, there is an unlimited range of bad shootings. However, they seem almost ridiculous. I think I saw more realistic shootings when I played cowboys as a kid. But then I wasn't expecting too much, how could I get from the action movie The Librarians? And in fact, it brings what can be expected. 90 minutes more or less bad action with some scenes to connect dots between them. But I'm not sure I can call it amusing, but my interest hasn't been long. <br /> <br /> 3/10
