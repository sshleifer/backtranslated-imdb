Uhhh ... did they even have writers for that? Maybe I'm picky, but I like a little dialogue with my movies. And as far as slasher films are concerned, the source of character development is enough. Unfortunately, The Prey does not even provide ?? And if you think I'm hyperbolic, you'll have to see it yourself. Scene after scene we just get the actors standing around, looking bleak and embarrassed, abandoned by any sense of scenario. In addition to calling names when they separate in the forest (natch), the only cases where these people say something significant when one character explains the constellation Orion (clearly plagiarized from Funk & Wagnalls; scintillating slasher fares, no ?) and another rehashs old campfire story that doesn't even have anything to do with conspiracy (wait, what is a conspiracy?) At other times, prey actually has yellow to film its character with a boom mic just far enough so we can't exactly hear what they say. So we get whole scenes where the actors murmur! Intentionally! I really saw more dialogues in silent film. It is as if the filmmakers sat in a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga in the heyday of the fifties and one looked at the other and said, "Hey, I have a really sweet idea for a bloody decapitation gag all around him." Being Righteous, The Prey probably had a writer on board, and somebody had to write the scene sequence and mark the diaries, but I am absolutely convinced that this film had no editor at all. pauses, boring tableaux and zero sense of stimulation all over The filmmakers have nothing but "film" to film, thus filling the runtime with exhausting taxonomies of flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teenagers Slicing and dicing, these animals are filmed in straightforward daylight in a totally dedicated fashion and without attempting atmospheric photography. I'm pretty sure it's all nature show footage? All that is missing is a stuffy narrative from some National Geographic alderman. Another exciting shots that have been kindly spared from the floor of the cutting room room: a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches, and another scene in which a support character unfolds for a banjo what feels like a full minute and a half! In a minute and a half! That's a lot of banjoing to commit to starting celluloid, let alone put it in the final cut of the movie! Way, guys! Briefness and clarity are the real victims of this defeat. It is true that in the last 25 minutes the film has been shooting quite a lot of steam (comparatively), which largely accumulates the massacre and where Rip-off Béla Bartók is "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta" "Slices Into Vaudeville the Great Jackie Coogan makes a fun look like tubby, bumbly park ranger (this was his last role if you can trust). And there are some nice bloody moments, including bursting the sprayed neck and the abovementioned decapitation. The make-up used for the killer (Carel Struycken, aka "Lurch" from Addams Family) is also very effective and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Plus, if you like a crazy, straight-outta-left-end field, you need to check out how to wrap this puppy up. You make a spit, I promise. As a rule, I love movies that are at this level of impolite, but the first three quarters of The Prey are so infinitely boring that pretty much spoil the rest. Overall, this is a very problematic issue, although it is not all bad, it should only be seen in weakened slasherists. Why do we do it ourselves?
