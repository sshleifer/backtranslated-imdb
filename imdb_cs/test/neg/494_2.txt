I don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll clich√©s that are not used in this movie. Ouffcourz, rock enroll life are just sexual drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you. Tell the stupid young boys. The filmmakers seemed to have read too many Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue stories. I have seen the daily life of a regular rock band attentively, and there is nothing to do with reality in this movie. If you are successful enough, your life is a tour tour. That means you're mostly on the bus and trying to sleep. Just SPI. Because you have to be fresh, sober and clean in the evening. After living you have a little time to fulfill your excitement. Then you have some fun time. But it's not a luxury or a dream. Artistically, this film was zero. Silly characters and idiotic dialogues. The end of the movie was funny - the main character left the heavy metal band and created a grunge band! Yeah, that's moral. Real 90s.
