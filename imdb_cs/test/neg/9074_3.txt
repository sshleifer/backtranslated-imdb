It's been a long time since I was in the art-house theater and I went to see the Douches Froides because it got such great reviews in the newspaper. <br /> <br /> In this movie, it has no head or tail, but only a portion in time about the life of the three main characters. When it started, I already knew it would be a long time, but sometimes it might be better, in this case not. There is no real character development or connection between players. You start in the middle of a situation, there is a girlfriend and then there is a person to be friends with to fulfill his sporting ambitions, but the way they are together is quite strange because they are "just together" so it seems. And suddenly they have sex with each other, at least one. The feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is barely perceptible and indeed everything I could think of during the movie was "when will they have sex again?". And when you think it is really crazy. Because it basically means there's nothing worth looking at, but three juveniles at it, and for me at least, it's a very crappy movie, stay away from it and save money (my? 7.50 is useless) , there are better art-house movies than this. I give three stars for acting, one for each.
