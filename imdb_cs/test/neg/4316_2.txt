About spoiler warning? It's not "can contain" it - contains - contains spoilers. Readers pay attention. Well, first I need to know that I'm not an actor. They only work with what is given to them. The problem was the script. It was awful. Nothing at all was believable. Sure, if you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker, there will be a bad mistake here and there to get you into a terribly awful situation that is worthy of the movie. But these girls made a stupid decision after a stupid decision. The only girl who was smart enough to try to call the police was the girl who was added at the end because she had already killed her and hit another with the car. Speaking of beating her by car ... why the hell was she trying to overtake the truck before running like a normal man? Also, whoever wrote the screenplay honest with God believes the cops will not investigate the door covered with blood? Frankly, it wasn't even tense. The only tension I felt was the frustration at how the girls were late. Well, this bragging went further than I wanted for such a bad movie, so I won't bother to touch the end except that it's unrealistic and lame.
