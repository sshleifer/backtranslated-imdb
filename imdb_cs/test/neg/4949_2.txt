I just watched a court case marathon on court television. The episode was identical to the plot of this film, right down to the incest mystery and the affair-with-sister subplot. I don't remember any Based on a real story statement, but the MOW case is written everywhere. Obviously the chronicles of the actual killing of Ruby Morris by her husband Earl, sentenced to 25 years of life for her murder. Going to just show you the truth can be alien than fiction because I thought the Lifetime conspiracy was created and more than "stretch" in terms of credibility. I'm with other posters who said acting was bad. However, I didn't notice it with all the players. She was really the main character, the daughter whose performance was bad.
