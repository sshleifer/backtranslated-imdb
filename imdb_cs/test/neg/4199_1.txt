No, just not. That's all we have to say. Summary: A random man is in a cornfield. For some reason I'm not sure, but it's his duty to run inside. Next big thriller? Five-year-old could make a better film just filming an ant, or even just growing grass. Seriously ..... <br /> <br /> You can't say he has bad behavior because there is no playing. You can't say he has bad writing because he has no writing. You can't say he has bad cinematography because there is no cinematography. You can't say it's a bad movie because it CAN'T FILM! If you don't believe me, go see. Don't say I've ever warned you .....
