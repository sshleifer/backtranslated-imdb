Here's a few paragraphs from the essay I wrote for the TBOR University. "The Book of Revelation is an erotic thriller about sex, power, and a talented dancer who tries to regain his sense of self after All three women who violate him have strong marks on their bodies. one has a huge native mark on the buttocks, the other has a butterfly tattoo on the lower stomach, and the ring leader wears a small circle, so he lives in his new life in search of these brands and finds them in these intimate places that everyone does a sensible person who needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery, has sex with them for an hour and ten minutes, and you feel he has almost every woman in Melbourne. <br /> <br /> The movie is a huge piece of splendid Celluloid, It's Like Grandiloquence Drops From Everybody The only point of the film is the ultimate peak of Kok Kinos giving the scene the same energy and power as its debut feature film, Head On. films funded by government agencies take the film seriously, the screenplay and its design seem to be more than gifts and unfortunately for talented thespians, their brilliant performances (especially Tom Long as a broken protagonist) are stuck within the pompous wan to the fest.
