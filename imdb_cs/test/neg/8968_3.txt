Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking - and the local people are considered a witch. Kate is working too hard and trying to convince us that she's an ass (her name is Trigger Hicks!), But you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentional comic scenario. The constantly smiling Robert Young plays a master who works on the construction of a mountain dam, which becomes Trigger's first step ... but unfortunately he is married! No amount of white magic can revive this formula based on the game and bring R.K.O to the screen. with too wide bloom. It is ungodly and just unknowable. * 1/2 from ****
