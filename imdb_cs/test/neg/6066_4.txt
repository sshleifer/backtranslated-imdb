I'm the only one who has seen and remember Amadeus. Every scene in "copying" has its counterpart in Milos Forman, Amadeus - from galloping carriages accompanied by crazy strings, to the entrance of Anne through the dark corridor, a man with a key, to the dialogue of the conclusion with Anna at Beethoven's feet la Salieri in front of dying Mozart. No one else remembers the dialogue in this script: Salieri "Time?" , Mozart "Common Time". ..... "Let's start with strings ..." and so "copy". Remember that Cynthia Nixon leaned against the door frames, tears falling over her freckled face - the same scene, just replacing it with Beethoven's nephew. Even scatological humor (fart jokes) are the same. We even have a cardinal followed by a plate of sweet biscuits that remembers Salieri in the banquet hall. Doesn't anyone else remember? !!!! And the scene where Anna calls to God "Why did you give me this gift?" ... Salieri said the same thing! And besides all that, we have a juvenile scenario with an introductory exposure that is similar to the character identities found in the children's story. "I'm Mr. Beethoven. I'm a composer ...." Apart from having to oppose the technical ... artistic comparison that is not developed at all - presumably because it has no significance, especially with regard to Beethove, who was a technical master. <br /> <br /> There's only one great scene - ninth game. First, the music that brings you to tears itself. But then there is a very erotic interaction between Anna, a copier that holds time and Beethoven's conducting, which overcomes the most exaggerated sexual intimacy. So intense, it's almost embarrassing. But please - the rest of the movie - Where is the collective memory of the world? You've seen it all before ... and better!
