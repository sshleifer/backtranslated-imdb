I'll start with this: I love horror movies, not even the worst storyline or stupid horrible action will spoil the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and tension present. Second; This is the worst movie of all time. It even beats Mean Guns, and assault killer tomatoes. And for paying tribute to it. However, involuntary humor was only humorous until half the film passed, after which everything was so sad. To my great surprise, reviews that were somewhat divided; and you who rated this piece of C-movie-crap from 7 and above; I know JOKING! GOOD!! HA HA HA! Because if there is any reason in the world and we have only a small piece of the same idea of ​​what quality it is; You can't be real. <br /> <br /> All that is worth mentioning about the content has been quite well summarized, so I will leave it. MINOR SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> But the scene where a masked guy with a rubber mask pulls a woman back and forth across a dog station for ten minutes, with such a terrible musical score and dialogue developing the mind between the two, it really does for me.
