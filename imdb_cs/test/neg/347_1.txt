I watched this movie just because I was under the impression of acting like a kitschy horror movie. Look at the line saying, "They are men who turned in! And worse ... they're still alive!" Isn't that a horrible horror for you? And then the title itself - "Screamers". What a perfectly suitable horror title, I thought! Unfortunately, I wasn't aware that the real title was, correctly translated, "Fishermen's Island." So, for about an hour to watch, I realized that it wasn't a nasty horror at all - that was an ugly "adventurous" story about slimy fish from Atlantis. "Men turned in"? No. There was nothing like that. I was grossly disappointed. Damn, misleading brands! I want the 81 minutes of my life back!
