Wow! That James Purefoy looks exactly like Thomas Jane! This is the deepest thought I took after seeing somewhat awkward George and The Dragon. For fantasy comedy, the story was very boring and unspectacular effects. The problem was not acting. James Purefoy is a good knight and his various side kicks are not bad characters. I even thought Patrick Swayze was also a good idea in this role. Piper Perabo also had a nice potential. I even liked the boy. But the story and all that is happening, and the way it happens, was just "eh". Uninteresting. Compared to another recent fantasy comedy, Ella Enchanted, which was actually funny, this movie comes terribly short. I'm sorry for the decent actors who were in this yawning cause for grief. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10.
