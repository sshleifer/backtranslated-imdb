One hundred and seventy-five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money you can spend on the biggest summer blockbuster. Even Michael Bay didn't have a budget that was big for Transformers, just as Universal Pictures spent so much money that Evan Almighty was a mystery. They certainly didn't spend it on the scene because the film is not so much a classic comedy as Christian flag waving and a bar of one or two silent laughs, most likely you will spend time thinking where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to do it in a certain the moment his star profile began to rise, in a decidedly average movie. Continuing Jim Carrey's comedy Bruce Almighty, this film is seen by former support character Evan Baxter (Carrell), who rises up the ladder to the main player slot. The story opens with a departure from the newsstand to become a public official and move to Washington with his wife and three sons (a slightly strange primary school moppet, lively middle schoolboy and a lousy teenager). But Evan's attempt to change the world through politics gets the key in the works when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an ark. In other words, it's an update to the old Genesis story, with Evan fighting cynicism and naysayers building a huge ship. Unfortunately, while the assumption is reasonably promising, it unfortunately does not provide much laughter. There's some fun to start with when Evan's straightforward MP tries to juggle public service demands with unwelcome packages of animals that follow him and a beard that resists all shaving attempts, but as soon as he receives his divine mission, the film takes nosedive. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it turns into movie news. Evan is beginning to preach with alarming regularity, and Morgan Freeman is constantly turning to the offer of kind wisdom. However, without Evan's resistance, the only trace of comedy remains in the form of several animal excrement jokes and the role of John Michael Higgin as Evan is an irritable true man. Higgins can show the same rich comic potential he had previously done in Arrested Development, but his enthusiasm cannot save a sinking vessel, especially when he sees that Carrell has all his impressive improvisation skills on the back burner. In some ways, it is somewhat similar to the Passion of Christ, but unlike Mel Gibson, who encouraged everyone to believe in God through the lease of blood and guilt, Evan Almighty tries a more subtle approach. The film simply tells us that we should have faith in God because it has faith in us. Unfortunately, this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as it is passionate. Carrell is on autopilot, jokes don't exist, and Wanda Sykes tries to become the most enjoyable person on the planet. It could be sweet, but someone threw $ 175,000,000 overboard.
