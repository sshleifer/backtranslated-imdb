I barely managed to view the entire movie ... Only after about 85min of the movie is 110min, the trip to Mars begins, and then there were 5 minutes left to close. These 85 long minutes were very boring and the film didn't contribute. When he finally reaches Mars, it's not a much better plot. It could all be set in a much shorter run time and nothing would be missed. What I can't understand is a piece of trivia that says that thanks to the film, newborns have children called "Aelita" ... has 3 breasts ??? The only interesting thing here is the set and costumes for the scenes from Mars. This is an interesting experiment in constructivism, as well as the "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" was for Expressionism, five years earlier. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4/10 for great looking design ...
