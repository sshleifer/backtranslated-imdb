I am impressed by the main comments on this movie for surfing on OK. It really comes from the "California Dreamin" school of barnyard on beach antics and is not really credible. The idea that a chief child learns to ride aboard so well in a concrete wave pool that beats real surfers in their real ocean play is just stupid. In Australia, where most urban teenagers are surfing, this movie has laughed at the audience who took it all out with sea salt. Made in the 80s, but with a heart in the 60s, it's fun to watch and look good, but it's not a classic class at all. Neither did the actors survive. We are serious about LIQUID BRIDGE or RIDE THE WILD SURF or BEACH BLANKET BINGO. Oz stars like Occy and BIG Wednesday's hero Gerry Lopez are ready to add a head nod of recognition to our farm boy's bravery wave, but it just made the crowd in the cinema boast. It is for 10 years who do not question much. It's not even in GODS HANDS and it was stupid too.
