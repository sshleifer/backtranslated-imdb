André Roussin was a specialist in what the French call "Theater de Boulevard": playing where you will find the eternal triangle: man / woman / (man or woman) lover. Many of his plays gave Elvire Popesco some of her best parts on stage. ... and the great actress was the main reason to look at them, because Roussin isn't Sacha Guitry, who would be a long shot. The French audience remembers "Au Theater Ce Soir". <br /> <br /> Still with me? Roussin's games were not filmed. And this is quite an average material, even though the screenwriters call Lewis Carroll to rescue them. As Stewart Granger and David Niven and Ava Gardner is a feast for the eyes. because he's a rough, predictable - but native (Bola-Bola) hit is ridiculous - a tie around Menage à Trois on a desert island where Granger would be some Robinson, Niven, his Friday and Gardner's girl on Friday.
