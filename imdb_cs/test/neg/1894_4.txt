Yes, this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles. In Toronto, it is the next 1980s, which concerns the danger of an urban jungle where the police are afraid to go, and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. The Wild Things myth, a wild young man who has raised a bag after his parents murdered a dirty cop (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, a local criminal (Robert Davi), comes into this mix. Shuffle local do-gooders (Sean Hewitt priest and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan), and you have a recipe for some somewhat ill-considered action sequences. Davi is a standout among the cast, and cameraman Rene Verzier does a pretty good job. Otherwise, it is a somewhat lumpen action pic that will not satisfy action fans and will leave Sayles' admirers.
