To get started, I didn't bother to see The Grudge. The previews of the movie didn't make me, they didn't scare me and tease me. But when a group of friends asked me to look at The Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a little curious about how this movie would be. I went mainly for my friends. Not even 5 minutes into this movie I realized I had dropped $ 7.50. Playing from get-go is terrible. Schoolgirls initially look as if they never did their whole life. Then he takes over the film chart. I'll tell you, I couldn't stop laughing the whole movie. It's so stupid. I'm sure they didn't try to frighten it. They don't do anything to jump out. This shows the children, then shows that they "attack". This builds on that it's not an "all-of-a-sudden" thing. And even in the middle of the movie, the core of the movie, acting is still terrible. It leaves so much time between dialogs to add one's own comments. This movie is frankly one of the funniest "horror" movies I've ever seen. Poorly written, terrible acting, terrible script, terrible "unable to act" and terrible concept. The film tones and changes situations more than you can count on. Finally, each part takes place and then joins at the end of the film. I would never pay to see this movie. I wouldn't even watch him for a purse, for free. This movie is a joke. Please DO NOT USE THIS FILM !!
