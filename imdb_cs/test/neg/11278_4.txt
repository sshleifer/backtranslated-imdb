For this movie, based off the TV show, and a serious final. I thought it was a lousy way to end serious. 'M * A * S * H ​​Goodbye, Farewell and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. If you really didn't love the series (like me) skip this movie. I was a faithful fan of the Ještě Stevens show, but the conspiracy was too imaginative, and Dave Coulier, man, the guy hasn 't done anything good ... well, sometimes. They shouldn't use Tim Meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good for the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pure cheese. I'd give it 4.5 / 10
