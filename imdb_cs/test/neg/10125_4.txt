I enjoyed the prequels and found a relationship between Tucker and Chan. However, RH3 has been re-hashed of the first two without spell or humor. I think I once laughed - and that was during NG. Tucker was extremely uncomfortable in this film, and his character apparently had no other purpose than anything that could be irritated. Chan is always nice, but he looked tired in this movie. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who was the villain who was the girl, (SPOILER ALERT) who was the good guy who was a bad guy, etc. I hope to see more movies from Tucker and Chan in their separate efforts but not in no continuation of Rush Hour. It's just too tired. I recommend renting but not buying.
