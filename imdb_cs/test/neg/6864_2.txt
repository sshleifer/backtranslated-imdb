This film was a waste of celluloid on which it was printed. It's a catastrophic scene, just like a little heavy wreck. Watching this state is like trying to explain the meaning of life. The main plot is that the character played by Steve Guttenberg is an animal that he should not gamble because it would violate his parole. The children he befriended refuse to play with him for a while because he plays. But a few minutes later, after winning the championship, they save a lot of their hiding place. And where did they get the money? GAMBLING !!! Add it to the scary scenes at the funeral home (why exactly are the BEDROOMS in the funeral home?) And unnecessary peripheral character
