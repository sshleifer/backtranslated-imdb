As a young girl, beautiful Joan Woodbury (as Rita Adams) was alone, after her father's "stool pigeon" was shot. As a young woman, Mrs. Woodbury finds herself trying to keep her job because her murdered father's former convicted status makes Woodbury a bad business risk. Woodbury Rooms Understanding Singer Linda Ware (as Donna Andrews), who advises Woodbury to get in touch with old orphan friends John Archer (as Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (as Mickey Roman). But none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of the scams that imprison her in prison. On release, Woodbury decides to give the male mafia run for their money? Re-titled "Gangs, Inc." is, of course, a weak, cheap mobster melodrama. Still, it's a lot of fun to watch Woodbury work with inferior material. It convincingly plays the innocently growing more sophisticated "Rita"; and fits a bit like a blond hooker. Woodbury has to be added to the list of sadly unused Hollywood actresses from the past. "Paper Bullets" also features early Alan Ladd (as Jimmy Kelly aka Bill Dugan). Mrs. Ware, who sang "Apple for Teacher" with Bing Crosby, sings a few numbers from the fair. But most of all it's Woodbury's show. **** Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
