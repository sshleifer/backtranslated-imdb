Royal Rumble 1988 bored me pretty damn well. The rumbling itself is quite unpredictable, filled with mediators and the winner, who actually had no point in winning, and why Vs The Islanders was the main stallion on Earth. half of the crowd left. Jessie Ventura sounded nervous, over half the thing, and you can tell when he mentions that he finds the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura don't have Gorilla and Jessie chemistry. Ricky Steamboat Vs Ravishing Rick Rude. Strongly unsatisfactory struggle, with too many rest holds, and too much slow pace, sink this. When he rises like a fool in the last 5 minutes, he's too little, too late. Steamboat wins DQ. Next is up Dino Bravo is trying to set a new bench press record, with Ventura watching him. Terrible segment, no fun value, what ever. Ventura isn't enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admitted that it was boring. The dispute or not, I wasted time on this crap. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> WWF Women's Brand Championships. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 3 falls. Glamor Girls | C | Jimmy Hart. Vs Jumping Bomb Angels. This is the best night match, not me joking!. Very exciting stuff for a women's match, and you're going to be hard to find things so well, now days. The Jumping Bomb Angels were over and the crowd went to the monkeys for their win title. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Signing a contract between Hulk Hogan and Andre Giant. Hogan gets a decent pop, but there's a couple of striking boo for him, probably because he's in Canada. He pulled a little too much for my taste, but it was necessary for the storyline. It's a point across, and it had a few effective moments, but many times, I kept saying "Keep it up". Both sign, and Andre slams Hogan's head on the table, and pushes the table at him. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match. Very weak Royal Rumble, probably due to unpleasant stimulation and real lack of star power. I think Vince tried water with this, and it turned out. Ventura doesn't seem to be interested, and I don't blame him. The Crowd clearly wanted Roberts to win, DDT shouted almost every 5 minutes he was there, and while Duggan got a good pop, I don't believe he was the winner they wanted and where did he do his career? Nowhere. Bret's first Royal Rumble and made an impressive performance. It wasn't terrible, but it was pretty bland, and it wasn't enough to show, given what it was show based. 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Hogan has an interview with Craig DeGeorge. Standard conversation with the Hulkster, but not with the same craziness and outrageous remarks that he usually pulls. 2/5 <br /> <br /> Ted and Andre question. Andre says he will deliver the championship to Mr. Dibiase. Short but effective. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> 2 of 3 waterfalls. Ostrovers Vs The Young Stallions. The crowd is totally dead for this, and half of them are bolted on leaving. It is quite boring and has no business in the main event. Jessie and Vince seem to be bored, and they argue about other things while the match is in progress. Islanders win due to Roma injuries. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. I think it's historically important, but there's nothing here to see. That was just the starting point for the big things that could come for The Royal Rumble, and although you can see the potential here, there's nothing here to see from your journey. I usually recommend everything once for Die Hard Wrestling fans, and since it's the first Royal Rumble event, I suppose I have it too, but I'm getting ready for a boring time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
