Is this film as bad as a claim? In my opinion, yes. I did not want to comment when I noticed that some remarks were made, from "horrible" to almost not so bad ... ". But I can't resist. <br /> <br /> What you will do with a movie that has a DVD on it. the phrase "the real story" of Ma BArker and her boys ... "and the standard" any resemblance to real persons ... "disclaimer of credit? I am not naive, but in this case it is a nice relevant observation regarding this film. Several comments click on the show, they are awful, Roberts, Russell, Milano and Stallone have something like 315 movies and TV shows among themselves. tastes and sometimes unintentionally witty, storylines seem to be nothing but the smallest minimum required to create specific scenes of violence and melodrama together. <br /> <br /> The direction and writing on the screen must be faulty: Giggling Amyrillis after seeing the violent mood of Ma Barker and ending with "Take The Girl!" Alyssa's acting abilities ... some screenwriter wrote the line or reaction and / or the director shot it down l and said, "OK, that's good enough, no not ed it retake it, it's trusted ..." One note: I pick up my copy for $ 1.99 or $ 2.99 at the discount bin food store; the running time is shown as 91 minutes, and I note that the running time is shown on the IMDb as 95 minutes. I don't know what I miss 4 minutes, but I admit that if these 4 minutes had the right kind of person in the right condition, my rating could rise to 3 or 4 out of 10. As I saw 1/10 is what I have to vote for.
