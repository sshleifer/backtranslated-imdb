Let me first say that I really like this movie. For the most part, actors and actresses looked their parts, and quite well in their roles, but the film lacked any real plot. It seemed so shrouded in the seeming "madness" that no interesting story ever shone. Also, working with the camera was often negligent, trying to work with the camera, and failed miserably. Most of the time, the shots wanted to look cool ended up being confusing. Maybe something was lost in the translation, but some characters were just ... stupid. Crazy handsome boy who sniffs people like a dog? Uhhhhhhh. OK. Overall, fat stink 1/10. It's not worth your time.
