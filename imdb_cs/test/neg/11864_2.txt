This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I barely stayed awake. Acting and plotting was terrible. I like B-movies, but this movie has nothing to make me laugh or think. OK, there were two or three funny moments at the beginning, so I have to give this movie 2 out of 10. If you really want to watch, watch the first 10 minutes. Then you will have more and more disappointed while the movie is running.
