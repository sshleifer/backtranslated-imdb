I saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and late night 80-sitcoms on television one night at 2am. I have to say I didn't expect much and I didn't get much. Though Rose McGowan is hot, her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast were not at least Oscars. This movie has its ups and downs and has a nice couple of twists at the end, but in all honesty it was terrible. Not even the classic film slasher. No blow, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Just a bad deal. I would give it 3 out of 10.
