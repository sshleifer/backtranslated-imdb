The story of saying goodbye to the king is interesting. American "deserter" (I thought he and his 3 comrades were just trying to escape in the Philippines because their desperate raft to Borneo isn't your classic deserting). But before they come ashore when the Japanese are discovered. Nolte's character (sergeant) has only a moment before he walks alone on the beach and has not noticed. And incredibly no one noticed his footprints in the sand that would lead the Japanese to him. But Nolte is taken into the hands of the tribe headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribe. So he's out of war. Then the British commandos appear and want the tribe to help them fight the Japanese. Nolte's constant hamming cancels an interesting story. Instead of acting like a former soldier returning to war, now with a warrior tribe under his command, Nolte acts as if he were resurrected by a tribe. He speaks as if English were almost a foreign language, rarely using contractions. He makes extensive gestures when he speaks, and acts as he is one with nature, as if he was raised in the jungle. There is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the British to communicate with Nolte and the tribe. But Nolte's character is never believable. It always seems as if it is excessive. He needed to be a little more of an American soldier and much less a tribe. As it is, he meets, not as a king of the king, but as a fool who forgot who he really is. However, this is not the intention of the film, because the script admires and trusts the British commandos. There is never any indication that the British thought his behavior was strange. He is simply seen by the British as a defacto leader of the tribe. So it seems that Nolte's character is not in line with what is happening in the film. Another actor could do a great job with this role, pass his lines credibly and make them an excellent movie. But Nolte destroys the film by crushing every scene and doesn't seem to understand what his character is. <br /> <br /> What kind of waste.
