I bought this movie from e-bay as part of a lot of about twenty horror movies, all about the dollar per piece. When I looked at it, my first impression was that it was probably from the late 1980s. Later I started to think - Linkin Park posters on the wall and everything else seemed to suggest that I was dealing with a newer movie. He realized that the film had become an unbearable suffering. The last 3 minutes were the longest in film history - the film refused to end. Is there a genre like "horror for children"? In this case, it's definitely a movie. If they are perverse parents who want to introduce their descendants of horror, I suggest that it be ideal for children aged 6-8. All I really liked was Greg Cipes, who was too good an actor for such a kind of nostalgic retro bottom double account.
