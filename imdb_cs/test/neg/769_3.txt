Stupid is right: Tom and Jerry reach their goal of continuous flight to Africa, but then fear mixing with the natives. They put on "blackface", crash aircraft, try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean, and then survive the wild animals as soon as they get on the ground <br /> <br /> After reading a few reviews before seeing it I knew I should expect. They were just these two guys who made their Amos and Andy / Stepin 'Fetchit impressions. Attacking Blacks? Of course, but that's for you in the 1930s. Some of their lines were funny, some silly. The main mistake I had with this cartoon was the sound because it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying. Overall, it's a curiosity, but don't let racism stop. At least he gives you an idea of ​​how times have changed ... for the better.
