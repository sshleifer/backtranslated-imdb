What game is over: Kasparov and the Machine are best trying to immerse themselves in Garry Kasparov's psyche during the Deep Blue competition of IBM. You see him getting more and more paranoid and falling apart because in the second game Deep Blue he took a step that seemed too human for his biased view of chess computers. Kasparov then thought, and still, that IBM cheated. Game Over seems to be impartial, but it's clear that the director thinks IBM cheated. However, there is no real evidence to support the cheating claim, merely the information that IBM's security around the computer room was because IBM actually had the grandmasters hidden in it, overwriting the computer on certain key occasions and Kasparov's claim that the computer wasn't playing the computer usually does two in one place. In Game Two, Kasparov played a game that was designed to trick your computer, trying to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would be a pawn, resulting in a computer eventual loss. Deep Blue did not take the bait and Kasparov was so tousled because the computer seemed to play like a man who didn't even see him playing Deep Blue for a draw and ended up resigning. The game scared him so much that he couldn't recover, and after playing games 3,4 and 5 for a draw he lost the game 6 terribly. The question of whether or not IBM cheated everything goes down to the only move in game two where Deep Blue has taken a step that any person would have done, but which until then tripped computers. Joel Benjamin, chess grandmaster of the IBM programming team, explained in the document that they know that chess computers have always been buried in this situation and then spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue so that it does not make the mistake of other computers. If you believe Benjamin's claim, then the case is clear, IBM didn't cheat. Unfortunately, the director quickly moved on, never mentioning IBM's explanation for the rest of the film, preferring to shoot between shots of fake 19th-century chess, Turk, and Deep Blue, suggesting that Deep Blue was really human-controlled. As someone with an understanding of programming, IBM's explanation makes perfect sense - if you knew what you were doing, it wouldn't be terribly difficult to embed code in the code so that if the conditions were met then it would be so - in other words, say computer what to do when a situation like the one Kasparov created in game 2. This is not cheating, it's a good chess computer programming job. Finally, it is very clear that the director thinks IBM cheated, and repeated comments about IBM shares grew 15%. the day Deep Blue won, suggested that IBM cheated to draw its share price (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue with Enron). However, there is plenty of outward opinion, both in chess and computer science communities that Deep Blue has earned righteous and square and that Kasparov has lost because he just could not get over his gaze on computers as "silly machines" and got a psyched out machine that didn't seem so stupid. I wish the director let us see an alternative view. <br /> <br />
