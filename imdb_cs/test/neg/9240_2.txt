I just watched it yesterday and wanted to read more comments, but I found some high marks. <br /> <br /> WHAT WHAT? That was probably the worst Asian horror I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * There were just so many basic problems with the story. A lot of Asian horrors have a twist of ghosts trying to help but just looking scary (with remarkable exceptions: ring and Ju-on). That's the case, except they're not scary. A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale is not scary at all. The "monk" character directly explains everything as a perfectly natural cycle of life; there is nothing terrifying there. But the woman just doesn't get it, she'd rather kill herself and her baby and let this bad spirit reincarnate. My friend and I just laughed when she jumped out of the building twice, and the ghost waited for the other to tell her why she was watching her. This information would be nice to know before it starts jumping, but anything. <br /> <br /> * I said I did something like a few parts in the middle. First he goes by taxi with a ghost (spirits ride taxis?), Who has a lot of other hair that is inexplicably scary. Right after the bus stop, well, you have to see how pretty it went wrong. <br /> <br /> All in all this movie is a total bomb, I gave it an extra point just for these two scenes above. It is a poor Asian horror movie that can make ghosts fly to female women almost beautifully while trying to frighten you with the same images.
