The whole line-up of this fancy Disney movie (ad-exec gets his teenage daughter horse because "he wants more than anything else in the world") is just an excuse to take a spectacular show at the end of the shooting. All the other ingredients (an advertising campaign for the stomach pill, Kurt Russell as a potential friend of a young man, Lloyd Bochner as a potential opponent for Dean Jones over Diane Baker's affections) are postponed near the end to show the horse. More than half of the picture is padded and worse: it's adorable and uncomfortable. The kid is a ninny-kind who cries on the couch with his dog in his arms, and as usual gets her way. * of ****
