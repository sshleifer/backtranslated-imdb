I recently picked up all three Robocop movies in one box, rather cheaply, and the only reason I did it was for the special release of the first one. I saw Robocop 2 earlier, but not for 17 years, the year it came out. I never followed him because I still remember being disappointed when I found out how horrible it was. It's a complete mess, with all the signs of restless production with so many parcels. It also has a very uneven tone and it's also one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't mind a little violence, the first was incredibly violent, but this is just ugly. Also, SFX is terrible for 1990, say hello to stop motion. Also with drugs, the curse of a kid as a villain is just a little too much. At least Peter Weller had common sense that he wouldn't come back for the next. The only positive thing I can say for this movie is that it has a few nice gags, like thank you for not smoking, and a kids baseball team that robs an electric shop. Quote a child who plays a villain "That sucks"
