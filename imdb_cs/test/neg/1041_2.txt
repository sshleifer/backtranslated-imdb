I mistakenly thought it was a 70's film about a bed that eats people, which sounded interesting. It's not so. I want to say interesting, let alone a person eating a bed. I suppose Stuart Gordon gave this name in the same spirit that Lloyd Kaufman puts "Tromo" on anything that was shot by a video camera to build a franchise library. There is little to say about this opus than the running time of less than 90 minutes. It is, of course, a bed that is being chased by the spirit of man, or something that once killed a woman with a wig and long artificial lashes. Along The Way We Get ** Five Minutes Opening Credit Sequence (Is It For "Lawrence Of Arabia" Even So Long?) ** Killer With Marylin Manson Contacts Who Kills Using The Same Techniques As Troll In "Cat's Eye" Hutchence may have employed ** a preview of what Emilio Estevez will soon look like and act as a ** soft core porn even Cinemax would pass ** manbutt and one topless scene ** wacky (or is it "whack" -ee?) unintentionally hilarious hammer hits and remnants of strawberry cake (well, it looked like this on me) ** and rudimentary surprise ends apros pos nothing nothing. It's like a screenwriter even fell asleep on "Deathbed" before finalizing the last draft. It's not scary, it's not sexy, it's a hi-def video shot and doesn't look bad, but it doesn't look good, acting is just good enough not to be bad enough to be fun, and so everything else. Nobody would ever see or hear it if it wasn't on a disc with another film, a modern "double feature". I wasn't looking at his parts, so maybe I missed something. But for some reason I doubt it. Rating: PASS
