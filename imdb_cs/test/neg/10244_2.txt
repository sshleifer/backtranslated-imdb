I'm not a movie snob. I liked a lot of movies that critics hate and I hated movies that critics love. But I have to agree with the critics - "Galaxina" is simply non-standard. It is clear that it is a comedy, it has only a few scattered laughs. "Galaxina" has a bad photograph; has bad special effects; he has some pretty bad behavior; and production values ​​... well, kits could also be made of cardboard. "Galaxina" tells the story of a spacecraft whose crew is looking for a magical object called "Blue Star". After a long voyage (and some unconvincing space battles), the crew arrives at their destination, a wild western extraterrestrial world There's a painfully unreal scene of cantina (clearly designed to be the spoof of the famous "Star Wars" scene), chases involving cyclists in space and the final escape. <br /> <br /> The struggle tries, but can't breathe life into Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber have done a better job in other movies James James Hinton is a pretty good spacecraft member Later Dorothy Stratten plays as a title robot, and while she looks great, her role doesn't give her much chance to act. You can catch this movie to see Dorothy Stratten, but if you're looking for a good movie, you'll probably want to skip it.
