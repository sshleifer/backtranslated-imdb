An ugly, heartless Hollywood crap that expects nothing but ugliness and heartlessness from its audience. Scenes WITHOUT Spacey reveal how truly terrible it really is. But the scenes with Spacey are just so fun that you hang out to the end. Yes, he could play this role in sleep, but it does so well, it's such a joy to watch, so believable and amazingly monstrous. Enjoy it for its performance, but don't expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great movie about the evil of modern Hollywood, check out "The Player" by Robert Altman. This sad little potboiler is not remotely in the same league.
