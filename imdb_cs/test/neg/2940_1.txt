Stay the hell away from this ... No, I'm really serious - I know you think it's fun, campground, cheesy Hong Kong style B movie. I did it, but believe me not. The only thing exactly about this description would be the words Hong Kong, and then it would only be used in a strictly geographic sense. Yes, Donnie Yen is a director together. Jackie Chan has a portrait. Ekin Cheng's guy from Storm Riders plays the lead role. He has vampires. It should be good - or at least fun, charming and wrapped up. Once again - it's not. I could break away why this movie sucks - I could take it apart, hack it on tiny, shaking pieces. But where to start? There's so much to hate ... <br /> <br /> To make it easier and to make this hateful event credible, let me say I'm usually a big fan of Hog Kong. Harder drama stuff as well as more lighthearted action and / or comedy. Really good movies as well as really cheesy ones. I can sit for hours of bad subtitling, jokes enough lame to make the first graders roll with their eyes. I can handle lovers like chaste and celibacy as a nun convention, and that the average film visitor can beat his metaphorical fingers against his way between action sequences. Also, Hong Kong or any other origin - I love it when the movie goes from being just bad enough to be good. But it - Arrgh! It's just horrible, STUPID, incapable of waste. So far from fun or charming it's actually painful. So derived from the action that makes the Bergman movie look like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> Why?! Why lose such an opportunity?! That could be so fun!
