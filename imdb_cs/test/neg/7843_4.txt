This movie had to be well at the box office to give Gator the budget he deserved. This movie had no budget, it needed to rewrite the script and a better ending. There are flashes of brilliance in this film. The ship passes through the scene, Burt drove the middle machine and chatted with his parents. You can say Burt is a Southern, not an actor. This film shows what Gator, Burt's best film would be. Too bad this movie didn't have the same funds and it was done on Rush. 4/10
