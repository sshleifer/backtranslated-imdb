I don't like this movie for a lot of reasons - BIG BORING! It was interesting how they thought the future would look like in this, but it really bored me. There was almost nothing. Although the classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The visuals were very creative. Whenever this movie appears on TV, I feel the need to change the station immediately. Not because it's a bad movie, just because I know what I'm worth when I watch it - complete and complete boredom. It's a movie I saw when I was young, but I never got into the science fiction stuff because it just wasn't real. Like this movie - very unrealistic. I've never understood half the film.
