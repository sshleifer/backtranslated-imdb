SPOILERS, ATTENTION! Flashdance is, in my opinion, an honest movie. Some things confuse me (for example, Jeanie asks Alex how long it took to get her dancing, Alex replies, "About 25 years," doesn't Alex be 18?) And some things fascinate me (I LOVED spins! ). But overall I was intrigued. I wasn't even born when this movie was made. I really haven't experienced the 1980s (I was born in '85) and I wonder: sometimes Alex would just run a little bit on the spot, or he could come in handy, not dance, just hit things, throw her Head back and forth she waved her hands - was it then considered "dance"? If it was, I'm not sure I did. Fluctuations, turns, fluid movements were great, but some of them - my neighbor's toddler could do better! If Alex were a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day? Had she not gone to work for almost a week, wouldn't she have been released? Living in the warehouse - I almost see it, but not quite. He doesn't seem to be a welder, owns a warehouse house and tries to get into ballet. None of this makes any sense. I shouldn't be too thoughtful about my own background, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too female to see her as a welder, I don't know. But one way or another, they could choose a better actress. The actors were fine. I even liked romance. You decide for yourself. But mine is once rented, I don't see it again - it's not worth it.
