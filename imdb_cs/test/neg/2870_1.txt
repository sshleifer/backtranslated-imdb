Something like Bam Marger, so I was curious. But watching domestic production with someone who is with friends and family, with a decent camera and a healthy guy, just isn't a good movie making. <br /> <br /> Writing, direction, playing and editing is nonsensical at best. But I sat over half. And why? This film gives perfect examples of what not to do, it is the student's dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process. Fill it into film school curriculum throughout the joint! <br /> <br /> So than! Now I know that Jackass is for real - because you're not looking to win an Oscar, buddy :)
