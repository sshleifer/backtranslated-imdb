Aliens lose a giant monster named Zarkorr, then send a hologram that looks like your average stupid teenage girl who tells postman Tommy Ward (Rhys Pugh, in the only movie you've ever seen) who was chosen to fight. Even if he loses the plant goes doom, so he goes off fighting the Zarkorr Invader! This movie is bad, very bad. So bad that you need negative numbers, just make it rattan. Horribly written, poorly directed, so far below the Power Rangers, what's happening at the top of the wooden play you've just puffed up a horde of lumberjacks to get out of where it is and cut it off! And don't get me to start the song theme at the end. People who have created this S $ @ # flagship palette should not be loud near the camera or movie. Zarkorr is a great looking monster that should be a million times better in the movie than this one. Do your favor and don't see this movie, it's 80 minutes of life. The actors who are never working on it again. <br /> <br /> 3/10
