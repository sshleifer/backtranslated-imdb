Actually, the Son of Mask laughed me several times ... mostly because of the funny jokes that made Bugse Bunny and Roadrunner so fun. CGI is very impressive and is widely used in this film. Garfield, for example, is not the place to par for CGI, but I would have given it the same voice. Everyone knows the story ... which wasn't so bad for KIDS. Yes, it's the KIDS movie ... and that's why it should be treated. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role. His attempts to act "crazy" are not very good and the overall action is bad. <br /> <br /> All the others are not too bad. Basically my 2 and 5 year olds watched the whole thing without complaining. At least I could sit it. There is no way this movie would be the worst of the ** shock ** ** of 1999 <br /> <br /> 4/10 for CGI and a few laughs.
