It seems to me that I disagree with many people. But I really didn't find this movie as scintillating as the reviews I read pronounced. This was undoubtedly a moving story, and the background of the section provided room for the epic. but the movie was released. especially for neons who have seen 'gadar'. in spite of the leadership that plays the sunny deol and the constant songs, I must say that gadar is the best of both. the story is virtually the same. The section failed to create any depth in its characters as well as scenes that were supposed to impact. over Christine's accent and a small image that was not easy to work by itself. the characters didn't seem too real. not that I criticized the actions of some of the leaders. it just didn't work. the atmosphere was well developed, but the film was basically missing. not that I died a hard rambo fan, but some cud action saw the film over, or some character development. It looked like a rush to the goal. and the end just added dissatisfaction to the viewer. nonetheles, I must say that it was at least a good effort on the seemingly unknown territory by the director. And if U didn't see the gadar, then the mites, just like that.
