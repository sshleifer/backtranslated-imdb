I love documentaries. She is one of my favorite genres of film. Before I saw this movie, I didn't see the one I didn't like. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for this film is great. The execution is well done. There were times when I laughed and smiled. However, as the film went about more boring and irritating it happened. It could have been something strange if the subject was not so unintelligible, childish, awkward, putz. I appreciate his passion for film, but I stopped whining. If you have little money, maybe you shouldn't have as many children or spend so much money on alcohol. Maybe you should go to a film school or at least a high school. Perhaps you should live life and gain perspective and experience that could contribute to your vision. There are so many people out there with stories that are interesting, funny and poignant. To see this guy chosen over any of them, there's nothing less than crass. If you want to make a filmmaker's documentary, why not make a film about a film from China or Iran, a filmmaker with REAL issues? Two last questions: <br /> <br /> Who will take a small child to see the Apocalypse now? How many times did this guy say "man"?
