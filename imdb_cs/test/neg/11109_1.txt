This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted to distract from doing this movie. Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks of the Land of the Lost and the Creature of the Black Lagoon. In addition, they should use someone who was a little smaller because the Chupacabra legend is much smaller. Overall, however, the film was so bad that it was funny. Why couldn't bullets and electric shocks stop Chupacabra, but the captain's kick-boxer does OK? Watch if you're sick at home or feel down and need a good laugh.
