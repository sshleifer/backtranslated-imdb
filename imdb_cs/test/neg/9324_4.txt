I thought the Dominion was a lousy attempt to continue the story's success. The original film was a story of evil, and how it can penetrate our lives. Schrader's version is missing in evil. Viewers do not get a huge sense of horror, fear or even premonition. Harlin's version offers evil evil, shows violations of the sanctity of the Church and builds a compelling story that is credible, given the background of Father Merrin. Schrader's story leaves the viewer exactly what happened. The Dominion does not invoke viewer emotions to empathize with Father Merrin, and lets the viewer wonder why he was primarily concerned. Everyone who is interested in seeing the sequel that lives up to the original, see Exorcist: The Beginning.
