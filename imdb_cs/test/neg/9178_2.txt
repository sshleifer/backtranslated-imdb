Fred "The Hammer" Williamson adds another cheaply made film. Maybe he set a new standard for himself. Look at the painfully obvious special effects of a mortar cannon that is visible on the street during the chase scene. You just don't see it once, you see it several times. Locate the focused image in one scene and the camera operator will try to correct it as the scene starts. Watch it with a group of people and create your own Mystery Science Theater!
