I chose this DVD to 3.99 to video rogers to make enough points to get a better movie for free. I never actually planned to watch it, but it started to push my curiosity and finally decided to play it in a DVD player. The effects in this movie are terrible and cheap. Some of the dialogues in this movie sound like it was written by a 12-year-old boy's oath. Acting is in some parts really kitschy and "action" scenes are absolutely ridiculous. You will laugh at some parts, which was positive for me because I enjoyed it. The thing is that a girl is wearing a curse that causes her to throw up snakes, so some shamans have to get her to Los Angeles, there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs and a few other people who aren't important to the plot Not that there really is a plot on all. \ tDon't expect anything from this movie and not listen to the cover, there are 100 passengers and 3,000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes. As for the DVD, there is a trailer that is almost as ridiculous as a movie, a reel that is just one shot from one actor trying to say a train, and the deleted scenes are really pointless if they weren't. It's not good enough to stay in this movie, it must be bad enough. There is also a really bad performance featurette that really doesn't show much at all except that people involved in this movie were kind of idiots. I can not recommend it if you do not want a really bad movie that you can laugh with friends. I give him 2 cat cats out of 5.
