Hitchcock is a great director. Ironically, his films usually lose time to watch. I admire Hitchcoka on a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> First positives. Hitchcock invented the term probe. A curious eye that can hold or seek information. It is not a completely new visual grammar, but a revolution. Second, Hitchcock perfectly finished the thriller and chased the movie. He has an economic style and always thinks of the audience. It gives them regular excitement, regular shocks of humor and regular shocks. In short, he anticipates the basic needs of the audience and plays them like a violin. Unfortunately, the basic needs of the human being are mostly silly. Food, sex, excitement and a little bit of comedy. Hithcock takes care of all these needs on the screen, with the exception of food, which, judging by its size, took off the screen. It's just this panding for an audience that wraps most of its movies. The second disadvantage is that most of Hitchcock's camera work and visual grammar are now commonplace. What keeps his films trackable is the simple economy of his stories, the intelligence of his camera work and his skill in creating tense actions. So on "Saboteur". This is a light rowing in the veins of "The 39 Steps." Jumps from sequence to sequence until he completes a typical Hitchcock final act. At the emotional level, there is no relationship between leaders at the same level as Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in "39 steps." So the whole story lacks a certain amount of energy. And the new scenes bring us closer to the end because it is not clear whether it is a hook to escape the hero from the police, from the villains or his actions to stop the conspiracy sabotage. handcuffs frees itself using the automobile fan belt etc. (Why not just drive away in the car? Certainly handcuffs aren't so restrictive? Is able to swim in them, after all!) <Br/> <br /> 40s, I suggest you watch a "foreign correspondent." They are both silly pursuit movies with a catchy final, but "Foreign Correspondent" uses a large number of umbrellas and here graylings, something Spielberg tends to break in "Minority Report". <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 pieces. In addition, there is nothing to sink your teeth.
