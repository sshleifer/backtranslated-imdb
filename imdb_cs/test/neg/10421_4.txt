What's wrong with the French? First, they (apparently) like Jerry Lewis much more than the US. Second, they seem to like Edgar Allan Poe's work more than just what someone else does. It must be a "Beaudelaire" effect. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong ... I'm a Poe fan myself. But this trilogy manages to make three of Poe's below average stories into ... well, I'm not sure what they're made of. "Toby Dammit" is a fine film by Fellini, but it has nothing to do with Poe's story, at least in terms of topic. It's nice at first viewing. Terence Stamp has a good job with an interesting role. However, he has nothing to do with Poe or the spirits of the dead. <br /> <br /> "Metzergenstein" is a big mess. How did Vadim's films be made? It's just horrible ... not even at the level of amateur film schools. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try skipping and saving time. "William Wilson" is actually a segment that is most loyal to work. It doesn't have much style, although it includes the weirdest snowball fight, I think I've ever seen the movie. (Looks like boys are throwing tissues, or maybe handkerchiefs that have been wound up in balls.) <br /> <br /> My advice is to skip "Metzergenstein", watch "William Wilson" and then if you're a Fellini fan (I'm not ), keep "Toby Dammit" when you cook dinner or make a snack.
