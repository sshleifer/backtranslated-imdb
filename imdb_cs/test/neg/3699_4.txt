This is a fair movie, good for one-time watching. The plot itself is pretty well done for an image of this kind, which is a pleasant surprise, as well as acting that, although a bit of a hammy, is better than normal for these types of movies. <br /> <br /> 'Special' effects are merry - translucent giant and extraordinarily styrofoam / paper mass that steadily ripples on the wire. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look at kitschy fun once. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
