About five years ago, my friend and I went to a video rental shop to see. My friend saw Space Truckers on the shelf, so we got it. Once we got home and started to watch, we realized what that piece was! Beer can float in space? The guy who laid out in the toilet? A guy with a mechanical bird trying to wake a woman by saying, "Whiz, whiz!"? WTF !!! The stupidest, stupidest, most underrated, terribly throne-like garbage I've ever been exposed to. My friend and I still refer to him as the worst movie we've ever seen. Only one other film has approached its madness (and it would be a silly Jackie Chan movie, "Medalion"). If your eyes see this piece of waste on the shelf in the video store, proceed as follows: 1. Remove it from the shelf and place it on the ground. 2. Press on it for at least 30 seconds. 3. Continue ignition in a closed building (bathroom stand). 4. Finally, take it immediately to your local hazardous waste facility for proper handling. <br /> <br /> STAY FROM "OPERATORS" !!!!!!!!
