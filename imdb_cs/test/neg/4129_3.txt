"Three" is a serious silent movie of shipwreck. Masquerad as a psychological thriller, it's closest relative is monumentally better "Dead Calm" (also featuring Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" provided well drawn characters to the root in the form of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman's sad parents attempting to re-define their relationship on ocean sailing. They end up being terrorized Zane is admiring the psycho-killer. It provided a sharp, increasingly upbeat tension, a frightening sense of claustrophobia in the open seas as the cat and mouse of the game of life and death developed. <br /> <br /> "Three" suffers from poorly drawn characterization (the audience does not care what happens to any of them), silly and unnecessary voodoo plot equipment, total lack of tension or excitement and some pounding, hammy performances from the main players. Especially Zane goes the way through the top of the irritated way. He was terrible, wired and ugly with almost controlled sexual violence in "dead peace". Here it is bombastic, grumpy slimy and crumbled. And where does he get a seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how does his lighter remain for more than a year full of juice? Mrs. Brook is very picturesque, stunningly beautiful, but both her chest and the back at the back seem to be wildly infested with some sort of lifeboat pump. However, they behave successfully with greater abilities and beliefs than others. A dramatic actress, in the purest sense, is not. Whoever plays voodoo-hexed Manuel, the third part of this excused triangle, could be replaced by a piece of driftwood - no one noticed. In fact, according to his total lack of ability to bring about dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in casting bets (excuse). Extra sides: The scenery is nice and cinematography (above and below water) is trustworthy. I guess it had a very limited (if any) theatrical release, or it went straight to the rental and retail DVD. The reason is that it's not very good. If you want something good on these lines, you get "Dead Peace". It was made by people who knew something about cinema.
