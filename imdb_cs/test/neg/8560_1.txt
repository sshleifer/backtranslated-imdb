I can't even describe it. It's the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm a nice boy when I call it a movie). Just another big budget-to-someone-who-not-to-do-think-power. It's not scary either. It's nasty when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then come ... "thing" to trick movie fans. I think big producers do everything they want. Just buy a big producer, hot chicks (though horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clich√©s and cook it in a week or so. get "The Nun". And I thought Bad Boys 2 was terrible !!!!
