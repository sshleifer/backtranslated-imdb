The story begins in a little girl's house that will have a birthday party, and both the mother and the father seem to be calm and reserved. They continue to give their daughter their presence, which is both of them, and that it gave me a humorous impression when the faces on both parents face when they gave their child this gift, it was almost like "I hope she likes it" ! There is a killing in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart, (Julia Kerbridge), "Reaper", 2000, gets engaged in the case because of family ties. Julia is working hard to become a doctor, and this murder is damaging her entire life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney), "Top View", 03 is a neighbor in the same apartment that lives like Julia, and finally goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways. This is not a bad movie, but there is definitely nothing to go crazy if you don't like the location in Canada and good looking Catherine Mary Stewart, a native of Canada.
