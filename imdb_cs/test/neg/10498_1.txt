I couldn't take ten minutes on this horrible movie. At the age of DV cameras, they appear to have been taken on VHS without any color correction or microphone. As a film director myself know that these are obstacles in making movies and even keeping those things in mind, I am overwhelmed with movies can be made wrong. The only praise I can offer is that this movie got distributed because I saw much better movies still looking for a modest home or international release. I guess the box is what sells it ... it has a good box art, but it all goes down the hill. <br /> <br /> Side note: The director seems to have 11 friends because nobody on this planet would give this movie "10".
