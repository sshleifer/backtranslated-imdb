Creating comedy is like walking a pretty thin solid rope. Either works or not. Grandma is one of those movies that don't work. It may have some very funny parts, but for most it is just a terribly unreal comedy from the usual supporting characters in Adam Sandler's movies (sans Sandler himself, he's just a producer). Alex (Allen Covert) is a game tester. He is 35 years old and is the best tester and player in his workplace that is otherwise filled with children. He ends up getting his apartment and his things taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turns out, his roommate just spent rent money on Philip's hookers and not paying the landlord). Desperate, he moves with his grandmother, Lilly (Doris Roberts all loves Raymond) and her two roommates. This is the basic storyline of the movie, thrown with subplots about a hot new girl named Samantha (Linda Cardelli, unrecognizable from her days like Velma in Scooby Doo) trying to get testers to complete the new game as fast as it is Possible, robot-like game creating miracle JP (Joel Moore) who works with Alex and wears many of the same clothes as Neo in The Matrix, and of course all kinds of sexual and drug jokes. That is all. The problem with the film, besides the fact that there is a real conflict in the film and is resolved in the last fifteen minutes of the movie, is that it just isn't funny. It's totally boring boring, and only slightly funny. Nothing happens at all. No emotions, no real sense of direction and a full ton of intense swearing. You may find yourself laughing at some funny jokes that the actors say, but otherwise sitting in complete boredom wishing you wouldn't bother with the movie. As this film became green and as Fox thought he could make money, he would always be a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> This is no fun value. In fact, none of the actors really do perform well, just act like idiots for the camera and hope for the best. Stoner comedy was done before several times, and on occasion, actually works (Harold and Kumar go to the White Castle and Dazed and Confused to come to mind). Here's just to make the movie even less fun than it is already. Random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts does not really mean that the film is any better. Apart from a few funny one-liners, this movie should be out of the box. It's not very funny, the whole plot is stupid, it's boring, and it just makes for a horrible movie. Avoid it as a plague. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
