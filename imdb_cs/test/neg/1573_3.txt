Bette Midler is the best thing about this movie. It's a great second to the 1962 original with Natalie Wood as Gypsy. The songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was great, and in most costumes she looked better than Cynthia Gibb. Only the one who did not see the original would think it was a good movie. There were not enough changes between the ugly duckling and the beautiful girl. When Natalie Wood was a Gypsy, she was only so beautiful when she first got into a gown with her gloves to perform in a burlesque show. When her hair is down and magically it's all beautifully finished and looks so elegant, it's an important aspect of the movie because it's also the first time a Gypsy is considered to be something special and could be a star. , not just a bad substitute for her sister. And the scenes where they are slowly becoming more famous were rushed. It was an important part of the movie and beat it. It is important to show that it becomes more comfortable with the future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original. It was huge to watch it unfold in this movie. I was totally disappointed and if I wasn't for Bette Midler, I'd turn off the movie.
