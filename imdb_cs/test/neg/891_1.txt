I am also House Party Fan ... House Party I am my favorite movie of all time. House Party 4 is a shame for all HP and Kid n Play ... It was supposed to be part of the series really .. there was nothing about a guy n playing in this movie or any of the other veterans .. yeah baby n game was probably too old to be Throw House Party Movie b / c his kind of focused on teens .. but baby n play could have at least a portrait look ... you can tell how it was good b / c it didn't even go to the movies. Immature was at House Party 3, so it made sense to continue heritage ... but they should have the right to represent ... they should have left it on House Party 3. I'm 27 years old and I've been watching House since I was 11 years old when I came out in 1990 (16 years ago), I have been a fan ever since. When I first saw House Party 4, I was happy about what it really thinks ... There was nothing known about this movie compared to the previous 3 movies. I thought it was Ferris Bueller black days.
