I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie as bad as this one. Terrible gameplay, all over the plot plot, terrible special effects. There are some 'so bad his good' moments here, but not enough to keep interest. The woman who plays Tracey looks disgusting. There are some pretty disturbing scenes with the dwarf that will allow you to feel so slightly violated. On the plus side, the scene operations are pretty fun for special effects like car chase, where one car is "trying us out of the way" without actually contacting. Guess the budget didn't stretch on trashing cars. Oh and what looks like a postcard of the Taj Mahal is shown every time they are cut into a fictitious foreign country.
