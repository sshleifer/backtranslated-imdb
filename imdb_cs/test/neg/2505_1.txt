First, I refuse to even think about this work Music Video ... I consider it a short film that uses excerpts from the song "Thriller" in its soundtrack. For me, the music video must be longer than the song itself and the song must play the full length of the video. Calling this music video is like calling The Great Gatsby Poem. Besides ... let's face it ... "thriller" is boring 14 minutes, including the extremely old werewolf transformation, the mindless poem Vincent Price (just because VP recites, doesn't mean it's not lame) and the least threatening zombie, I've ever seen. Sure, it was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but remember, it also happened at the same time A-Team was a # 1 show on TV, so you can't give too much credit to that one ... the last point about the impact of this movie on the media about music videos ... what exactly added to the equation that "Billie Jean" and "Beat It" haven't added yet? From what I can say, only the practice of stopping a song for some dialogue or a surplus dance scene has added ... so you could say that this video really made Puffy an inspiration to create more annoying music videos. Not exactly my definition great
