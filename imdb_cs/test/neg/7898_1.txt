Hmph. The Soul Airplane was supposed to be a "black comedic" spoof of the well-known Airplane. This film is a black comedy that is on the worst. Stereotypes can be funny and many times. But in this picture it's disgusting. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything gross that people associate with "urban" culture today. The look of Tom Arnold in this movie is this film saving mercy if it ever had it. DL Hughley would never accept the script. Kevin Hart makes a poor leading character here ... his performance in this movie will probably be annoying to many. The Mana method and Snoop's appearance were by far the worst. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't pay this movie ...
