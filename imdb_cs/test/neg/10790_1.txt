This film, though well shot and acting well, was terrible. I felt like I was looking at a car accident - I was definitely watching, but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely incoherent, and the end was abysmal. Although, it suited the tone of the movie, I was hoping to improve something on this film. I still do not understand what recollections of rabies and child depict at the beginning of the film. Fifteen minutes of land he didn't really do. It's really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasting on such a terrible, terrible story. There's not much to say about this movie. Save time and watch c-span. It will be more uplifting.
