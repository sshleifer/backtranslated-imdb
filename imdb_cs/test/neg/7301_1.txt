I knew that when this title was included in the "B-grade" video of friends, I don't want to see a quality movie. Despite the warning I was still surprised at how bad this movie was. It was fortunate that there was a lot of us to share the pain with us ... The film is trying to tell the story of a dark future where Hawk (the Mad Maxa type) sets out to rescue a lady in need. In fact, the plot is a thin, hidden apology for producers to promote their own philosophies about life (watch the final credits, and "these people are not really rejecting responsibility at the end for real laughter)." The film is often lacking direction, and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever. What's worse is editing this movie. The movie repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think it was an attempt to imitate things like Jean Claude Van-Damme, a combat sequence, but if it does, it will fail completely. The film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character moving his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's what happens in that repeated scene). I give this movie my worst movie I've ever seen. I doubt it will be finished soon.
