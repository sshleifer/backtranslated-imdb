I really hope that the creators of these "movies" have read these reviews to know that people just don't want their movies. They are just rubbish and embarrassment of the horror killer genre. It doesn't matter if it was better than the first because they're both terrible. I'm surprised they didn't learn from the first movie. Stop it immediately! Watch out for horror, spectators, DONT CLOCK, RENT OR SEARCH FOR BOXES "URBAN" HORROR FILMS, AND DO NOT BUY EVERYONE !!!
