The title, though singular, will undoubtedly resemble real horror fans of the immortal classic Tod Browning about the circus lunatics unit and how they have been misunderstood by the outside world. However, I can assure you that this "thing" has absolutely nothing to do with "Freaks" or even the art of professional filming in general. This film was recommended to me, allegedly because it is a crude, disturbing and provoking idea despite the low production budgets. Yeah, right ?? The one who recommended it to me can now consider myself my personal enemy! The low budget factor is correct, but it sums it up. "Freak" is terribly slow, poorly made, and every character that is introduced is absolutely unbearable? Two siblings on their way to a new life encounter a deformed mental patient who has escaped from a transport cart to another hospital and returns to a house where he killed his mother at the age of 9. but instead, Tyler Sharpe decided to make it a boring and pointless family drama. Attempts to lead an actress' to look emotionally ravaged are quite laughter and the overall lack of tension and action can hardly be blamed for a limited budget. Total failure!
