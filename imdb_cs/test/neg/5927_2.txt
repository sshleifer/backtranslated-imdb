Yes, Lifetime has the habit of making male species look stupid. And this soap opera is not kidding when they're doing Perry King, a reputed doctor, unable to see the evil that surrounds him. It gives doctors confidence, huh? How can anyone not see what's going on? Is it stupid? And the evil woman, like a horse, bypasses the killing of a whole family without a trace. How does she get all the drugs? This is not explained. How does she act as a hospital secretary without a commission? I think the director, Don FauntLeRoy, asks us to believe it. No. I screamed at the screen at the king's stupidity, right in front of my face. If the woman was so attractive, maybe she might have. But it is not. Shannon Sturges is the perfect wife and I tell you she has a horse face. I wouldn't cross her street, but our perfect husband does and quickly. After everyone in the cast falls out, I was not satisfied with the arrival of the penence that was given to our villagers. She deserved more than she got. William Moses plays a brother doctor who unfortunately knows the result from day one. Pleasure to see at least one pretty face in this clinker. Lesley Anne Down. She gives the film 2 only the relief to see someone attract in this mess. Perry King deserved his destiny. That's a jerk.
