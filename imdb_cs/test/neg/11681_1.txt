I rented a copy of Netflix - a big mistake. The DVD version entitled "One-Armed Swordsmen" was made by freaks who thought that combat sequences would be valued better embedded all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the stories remained in separate chapters that you can choose from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Do not rent or buy. Not that there was something wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. Just as I wished to see Wang Yu in his lead after all these years, this is a complete waste of time. I had dishwashers that made a better film than this.

Another special feature of this production is that there are no significant women characters. If you can find a copy of Shaw Brothers' original swordsman One-Armed Swordman, which explains why he has only one hand and why he uses a broken sword, go to it.
