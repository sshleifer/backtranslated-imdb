Bad movie! Bad! Go stand in a basket of discounts. Carrot Top should stick to low-lighted comedy clubs. It's a movie like this that old Jerry Lewis movies look like Shakespeare and John Agar as John Barrymore. Coutney Thorne-Smith (great talent) is totally useless. Its purpose seems mainly to look nice and forgotten. The only fun stuff about the movie is to see Raquel Welch doing the Alexis Carrington type role, and Estelle Harris as the harridan of the landlady. The only way I can imagine someone who thought it would be a good idea to make this (outside sophomoric) movie was if the producers of the fourth year of the child could choose the script. Well, maybe his third grader. What this film really needs must be rubbed into the creators of its creators.
