I recently became a big fan of Patton Oswald. I think he's the most beautiful comedian who is aged. He is refreshing and fearless in his routines, leading to a number of topics from how much Bush sucks up the sloppy 70s of Robert Evans. I am a longtime fan of Maria Bamford and her innocent / schizophrenic routine. At any time, she can effortlessly switch her naturally high voice to one that is clipped and throat, I can't help but giggle. I liked Brian Posehn long before I knew he was on "Just Shoot Me," and there is something so incredibly funny about his aging personality. All three of these talented, unique comedians headline "The Comedians of Comedy", a Netflix documentary about their US tour. They really deserve to be stars and this tour gave them the recognition they deserve so much. I thought not, I'd love to see this movie ... <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. Instead of three comics, each of which acquires its own routine segments, "comedy comics" fit into meandering and boring documentary scenes that contain no humor, no glance, nothing real. I think there are a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines in a total of 109 minutes. What a rip-off! Come on, is anyone really interested in seeing our stars joking in their RV? Where is the humor to see Posehn in the arcade and the comics store? Does anyone have random dinner scenes especially funny? If this movie could not show our comics how they would do, at least what life was on their way. It's not even about it. The worst of all is that comics never seem to be really fun. Oswalt admits how bored he is when he talks to the radio, Posehn shyly admits how much he sucks to see his home, and Bamford improvises every time the camera shows her, and her humor is only sporadic. Sheesh, these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional, wonderfully crafted humor, which is a refreshing change of pace from the carefree fun of mainstream comics like Dane Cook. Instead, we have to sit in everyday life on the road in an inferior film whose quality can easily be overcome by any student film. If you can find any of the Oswalt, Posehn, or Bamford performances on DVD, in all ways. Their talent should be a joy when I look.
