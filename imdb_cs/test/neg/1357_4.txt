I'm sorry, but I can't even partially agree with some comments on this terrible piece ... <br /> <br /> English is not my native language because I'm a German citizen, so don't blame me for inappropriate grammatical structures or something * gg I can't understand why this movie got such a high rating? 6.3 ??? Are you kidding me? This movie has no meaning at all, nor a seemingly good acting performance ... <br /> <br /> When I looked at the comments on The Da Vinci Code, which I - I think - almost the same rating, I should have slammed my head on the table because I watched Schneider 00 directly after Sakrileg, and my God, among them there are worlds. while evaluating this crime filming with 6.3 and naming Helge as a genius. Of course he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of your opinion is the fact that German is not your native language and you simply ignore it - or rather you will not notice a bunch of crap called sentences. OK, I have to admit that some scenes are funny, but it's too much for my countryman.)
