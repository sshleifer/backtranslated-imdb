Every time I think about this movie, I feel physically ill. If you want to read such a great book and later find out it's a movie, it was a great feeling. Years later, I imagine my joy in switching sci-fi channels and finding out that it starts in just 5 minutes !!! Up go titles and then uggg. If only a few things changed. Everything has changed. Numerous characters are removed completely new garbage is added. The main character has shrunk and aged 30 years and his girlfriend is now his mother! Even the dog is reduced to sub-lassie abilities. It's a really frightening cinema in the worst case. I'd rather remove my own nails with pliers than sit in another terrible sight, and urge someone to look at it - please, no. If you own a copy of burn now, right now and think how better your life would be this celluloid insult never happened.
