This series does not represent the British view of the revolutionary war, as well as the anti-American view of it. The basic theme of the series is that the silent majority of colonists enjoyed British rule; that the founding fathers were manipulative bullying whose sole purpose was to draw Britain into a violent civil war; that American supporters of the revolution and militia were racist, violent criminals, raided. The intention of the author, Richard Holmes, is clearly for the viewer to extrapolate these characteristics in a straight line from the 1775 American population to today. For example, in the "The Shot Heard Around the World" episode, Holmes dug the obscure press of the Boston Massacre, claiming that Crispus Attucks, a black man and the first man killed in the Revolution, was deliberately "bulged". says that portraying Attucks as a black man would be a bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause, and Holmes never reveals how he knows, and there is more, Holmes goes to some length to work in a single, unfounded, cruel act: the desecration of a British soldier's body. American Militia with Viet Cong and Mujahaden - Regardless of the differences in the goals of these groups, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> This series was reportedly made in response to "Patriot" by Mel Gibson. feels the need to respond to Mel Gibson on any subject, instead of presenting a British look, Holmes seems to have really wanted to give a sensational, anti-American view, and in this process became Rog erem Corman historians - strictly third degree.
