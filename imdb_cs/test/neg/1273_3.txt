Yes, I was unlucky to watch this movie when I was younger in a friend's house because his mother was a teacher and wanted to project the film to see if there were any inappropriate scenes that the parent might object to. I think this was in clear but also in unreal jokes and a strange scene where he looked like Ernest to a girl. So yes, Ernest is thrown into prison because of what he looked like, and he continues to try to escape, and there's another thing like being magnetized in one place, shooting electricity and in a very painful watching final. There are a few jokes, but nothing to mention except a soap carved weapon ... I think it's the only scene I or my friend's mother laughed out loud. This and the camp are just two of Ernest's movies I've ever seen, and I'm not watching other movies from what I saw in them. Ernest was good at small batches, but the movie is a lot, even though it's as short as this one. Though movies have made money, mainly because everything you need is Varney and the place and theme and you have your movie.
