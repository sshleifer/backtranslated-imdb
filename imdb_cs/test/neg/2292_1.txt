This movie is TERRIBLE! It provokes disgust and laughter, but it fails. Apparently the director has no sense of tidal club comedy, and the actors are like nothing I've ever seen - lacking both the talent of acting and the comedy atmosphere. Even their attempt at English concussion is really sad, and actually the real special Swedish accent, in which the incoherent dialogue is spoken, is probably the most comic and pleasurable thing about this film. Even the whore is terrible and unconvincing. If you want a comedy, I would suggest that you turn to classic fare, like a bad dead series or even a dead brain if you have to. We all enjoy the bloody good laugh, but that's ridiculous!
