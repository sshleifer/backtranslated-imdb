TART is the worst movie I've ever seen this year, which includes both Affleck / J.Lo GIGLI bomb and Rob Zombie borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I don't know if it's a fair comparison when I saw that TART was made two years earlier and probably has half the budget than the low budget 1000 CORPSES. Regardless, all three films suffer from the same drawbacks: horrible scenario, horrible gameplay, terrible direction. *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don't think there's anything wrong) TART is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids. Most of them are housed in premium apartments along the hyper-expensive Park Avenue in New York, thanks to the finances of their neglected parents. The film demonstrates the aimless life of one of the students (Cat) by throwing out his only true friend (as a frivolous person he was) in pursuit of "good life" with the crowd. This, of course, leads to sex, drugs and music that is considerably worse than rock & roll. Everything is over-dramatized in a way that films are usually bad. The cat's first sexual experience leads to being tramped, and her new circle of friends is ostracized; her first drug encounter led to her being nearly thrown into the trash bin after her groups believed she was dead by overdose. No news with heavy hands, he said sarcastically. This is mainly what he "saw 100 times" a conspiracy. Other minor, and even less interesting, conspiracy details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from everyone else, a wild child who lives on edge (and eventually falls one night at EAST Hamptons), an anti-Semitic British cat, who ends her close friendship with Cat the moment she discovers that Cat has a Jewish father, and a cat tense relationship with her single mother who unsuccessfully tries to get a cat to appreciate the privileged life she has. A thief turns out to be an irreversible life. The "Wild Child" is played as a tinted version of one of Hilton's sisters. The British girl disappears from the film after the break-up. The mother / daughter relationship is considered totally insignificant until the final scene of the film, where she and her mother, who is harassed, have reconciliation. * Yawning * <br /> <br /> *** THE END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> About the cast and crew .... Dominique Swain came to the scene with his strong role as a preteen seducer in 1997's highly traceable LOLITA and FACE / OFF. Her performances were so strong that she got a few "lists" at the time. At that time she was 17 and I hope they will not be the best part of her career. If he takes a few other roles, like the one he has in TART, it can be very good. I saw Bijou Phillips in only one other movie (BULLY) and I swear that in this movie I will be almost identical to the one she gave here. I'm not sure if she's not able to make different shows, or if it was just a coincidence, her roles in two were so very similar. I think the first is true. I feel that this woman has very little talent in acting. Here's an actress tapped to portray the downward sister Hilton. That she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with, and remains a friend, with the real-life Hilton sisters. Basically, he plays his own version in this movie and does a damn bad job. As for writer / director Christina Wayne ... I don't know anything about her except TART was her first, and just, film project to date. With such a first effort, it is no wonder that her show business career was short.
