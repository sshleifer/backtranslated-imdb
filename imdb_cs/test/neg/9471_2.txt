This movie was definitely on the boring side. The game was decent and the movie looks nice, the soundtrack is sure to be a fan of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that the film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use the song in her titles, which was BLATANT RIPOFF Paul Simon "You Can Call Me Al" - except that it ever. Isn't there anything hypocritical? My favorite was the scene in which he was the main kid, where he imitated the game show host. 10 lines? Do I have to write ten lines about this movie to be included? What is ripoff, I don't think it's too fair for people to write more than they want!
