Well, let me start by saying that I love the original RS for 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to be invented. The computer did not tell you every step of your mission, you could roam and explore. This is the first thing wrong with RL, everything you do is under the timesheet and controlled by other people. Shouldn't you, as a leader, tell people how to handle every mission? Speaking of missions, why are they breaking down the original trilogy with a completely crafted crap? Does not matter. I've been waiting for this game when I heard it allows you to fly over the asteroid field from Empire Strikes Back. I think everyone who is a movie fan wants to do it. They'll give it to you. It's the stupidest level in the game. You start by flying over an asteroid field with chasing after you, and your goal is to get further into the field when making links. You have to kill them all to get ahead. Hey, remember how much Han killed when he was in the field? None, everyone had poor pilot skills compared to him. I just wanted to be able to avoid the asteroids when they came to me, but instead I have to use my automatic weapons to kill the bonds behind me. everything is slow over your flying. Everything except A-Wing, probably the fastest and most suitable ship in the entire fleet. But yeah, didn't Han say the Falcon was? Anyway ... <br /> <br /> You'll finally get to the Battle of Endor. Here is the final level, you get to destroy the star of death, every first instinct is to choose the Falcon and to be the leader. But of course you get there and you have to do stupid preselected strategies such as finding (not to mention deciphering the difference between) bombers. It is not possible in falcons, when you have noticed one group, the frigate will be destroyed. The only way to go through this section is to choose the A-Wing. After this you have to attack the star destroyers and this is a real silly chore. This game gives you the feeling that you are the only one who defends the rebel alliance. <br /> <br /> When you get frustratingly through this "fun" fight, you get to the death star. And here, you can think 'yay! I have to destroy the Death Star and again, just like in the Asteroid Field, you have to do some tedious thing as the approaching tunnels of impending doom approach. Your job is to protect the ship from you, remember that from the return of the Jedi? It's so moronic, because when you choose a falcon, you die because you won't be maneuverable enough, but if you choose an x-wing, you have to keep locking and unlocking the s-foil. So it's the choice to either kill the bad guys or try to catch up with Lando, who doesn't seem to know how to maneuver. So dying in the process. <br /> <br /> Bonus levels aren't even worthwhile because each level is more and more frustrating. I feel the way I did when I saw new three movies, angry and needing to kill something. Luck for me, Smash Bros. Melee exists. <br /> <br /> I hope they come up with something better with the Wii and have the original levels of the full-capacity trilogy. I'll sell this game the first chance I get.
