What cruelty. I'm not one who wants total verisimility from the movie, but the plot and the "Zoe Killing" script are so insignificant that I find myself flickering through the whole (mercifully short) ninety minutes of the movie. Readers of these reviews will now come to conspiracy: Zoe, the calling girl who falls in love with the American safecracker Zed, is also an employee at the bank that Zed will help rob a high stakes Bastille day robbery. Br /> <br /> The film loses the film's credibility from the start. Zed's and Zoe's night of magic is very prosaic, and Zoe's claims that she has experienced an orgasm of life would seem to reflect the screenwriting persistent teenage fantasies more than any current chemistry on the screen. Zed's total indifference, when his friend Eric throws Zoe out of the hotel room, hardly sets the stage for their later strong attachment. In two actions, Eric's group of bohemians - losers, resulting in a marginal life of petty crime - get ready for your big night robbery in the city. Roger Avara's main goal seems to be to prove that he knows something about drugs. The secondary thread involves believing us (by endless repetition) that Eric is really, really happy to see his old friend Zeda again. I really like it. Erik's devil-perhaps-care, over-top-pomp and affection for Zed is not even remotely believable - look, for example, for his false bemusement when discovering a dead cat in his apartment building. The development of the characters that will accompany us with the rest of the film is an idea. Skin is a disaster - understandable because the plan is ridiculous and criminals are complete amateurs. This is where Avary continues to pay tribute to his idol Quentin Tarantino by showing he may be more violent than violent. In fact, it is just boring than boring. A special protective cover is hidden inside the main vault to build the excitement. That was boring in video games, and that's boring now. Zoe is taken hostage during a robbery, but despite our expectations of playing a key role, she just sits quite. Or more precisely, Avary won't do anything to her. He literally makes a living in the last five minutes, breaks the hostage situation and saves grateful, but he still hasn't prevented Zeda from suffering the consequences of his crime. Why she doesn't mind his involvement in the crime - or why he'll be damned at all - is impossible to say. After all, she had no chance to see that she was a little more decent than the rest of the gang. <br /> <br /> This is a fake dialogue throughout the dialogue. Much of it is in French. As a native speaker, I can confirm that she does not ring or remotely. Eric's sweet-sweet discourse, quickly alternating with a hard-brag to brag, is meant to be uplifting and frightening at the turn, but instead is just grating. Meanwhile, his scared nomadic accomplices are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric is shot in a ridiculous example of excessive power, we can all exhale with relief: just as the bank hostages will soon be freed from this miserable suffering.
