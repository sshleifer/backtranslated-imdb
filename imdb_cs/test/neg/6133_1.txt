Okay, first of all, I suppose that only a group of friends with a limited budget did it. With that in mind, it should not be compared to the features of a blockbuster and my rating would be higher. But still ... <br /> <br /> After giving him a chance, she still violated some of the basic rules of making the movie so much that the viewer and the amateur director crouched in me. A LOT. You mean: Blair witch in the car, but REALLY boring. Think: You left your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded it lost in the park at night. per hour, then your friends look at it. <br /> <br /> The scariest part (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT ... IF SPOILING IS POSSIBLE HERE) was a one-way image back and maybe you think you'll have to watch it again. SCARY. The Silliness Party, this is a pretty good idea for low-budget lets-go-make-a-movie-tonight movie. But the concept goes a gentle line between being really good and really bad, and let's say it wasn't really good. There were just too many parts where nothing happened. At first I thought it was the director's plan - you were supposed to be lulled into a sense of security and then frightening things started. But not. I tried to find good things about it (and I had a lot of time to think), and I said the music was fine. And I have to give the women's credit manager to stand around and look really awful for a long time. But that's it. Actors playing "infected" people seemed to be making fun of zombie movies. Or they got their motivation from Bug wearing an Edgar suit from the "MIB". Chances are, if for some strange reason you watch this movie, it's on DVD or Tivo, so you can fast forward any time when you wait for something to happen. I hate being so critical to something, but I have also seen a lot of similar movies and nothing has ever been so painful. If only half an hour had been cut off and some terrifying things added, it could be decent. Maybe it's the director's cut ...
