Talk about false advertising! I wasted an hour and twenty-five minutes as I watched that piece of crap and there was no leisure suit, not a single platform, no pointed toe point, not a single disco ball. I watched it on Saturday night and ended up with a terrible fever, but it had nothing to do with music. Seriously, with or without John Travolta, he licked this movie. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene you will ask the question: "Where does the rope come from and will you please hang me?" From his untamed prejudice against the driving abilities of Pennsylvania Dutch, to the shameless support of seemingly eternal capacities of laptops by Alienware laptops, to cheap horror effects raised directly from Japanese cinema, this is the worst film to hit theaters from The Grudge.
