Do the following: Get a copy of this movie and a friend. Bet a friend $ 10 that can't sit this whole movie. They cannot divert their gaze or be distracted by anything. Now watch your friend. Win or lose, get $ 10 for fun. It won't hurt me when people see a movie and quickly give it 1 out of 10, or summarize their thoughts with "it sucks." (And when they asked him, "Why?", He says, "Just because." Arrgh.) That's why this film exists. It's the only goal to say, "Here's the horrible movie! TAK IS 1 OF 10!" This movie is absolutely awful. The recent trend of movie parodies has forced them to become increasingly formulaic, this film lacks in every single aspect. Its not funny. It's not fun. And for some parodies it's totally inaccurate! Terrible dealings. Unfunny dialog. An unwitting story. Terrible "special effects". One INANE gag after another. And to make matters worse, there is no gratuitous nudity worth it. This film skips the idiot, stumbles over the stupid, and lands at first sight on moron. Even I, who loves a good "check your brain at the door" movie, found myself physically upset to watch it. This movie isn't even a "Hard Ticket to Hawaii" so horrible - it's bad ... It's just bad. NOTE: I actually asked a friend to watch it as described above. Not only could he not do it all the way, but he had headaches and needed a few minutes after he felt a little sick. A true story. <br /> <br /> I couldn't emphasize this rating anymore ... 1 out of 10!
