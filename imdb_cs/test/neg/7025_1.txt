Until 1970, Lucille Ball was one big comedy. She was such a perfect clown that I wished Bob and her people could see her in the "Facts of Life" because she could do a dry term. as well as a grotesque .. <br /> <br /> Yeah, Lucille Ball was beautiful. . . Until "Mame" <br /> <br /> Trying to see Lucille Ball in "Mame" is physically impossible because there is so much vaseline on already filtered lenses that you need Windex to see Lucille Ball in some scenes. So even if you see Lucille Ball in "Mame", you can't see Lucille Ball in "Mame". This is a blessing. This is probably the most beautiful thing I can say about "Mame", a movie movie musical game (it could continue, but it started with a totally funny book called "Aunt Mame"). Giving it a bad rap is like hitting a sponge. So it doesn't matter that music is more than sung. Most of the songs weren't so much. There is no difference in the first three. "It's today," "Open a new window" and "We need a little Christmas" are all the same songs. Celene Dion should make an album with them, they're so big and boring. The killer ballad "if he went into my life today" needs a confident gorgeous voice (Edyie Gorme won a Grammy for doing it in 1967) that poor Lucille ball wasn't supposed to own when she made this movie. (True, Elaine Stritch can't even carry a tune in the bucket, but at least Stritch can translate the song.) <br /> <br /> If you still feel that your life will not be complete if you see the movie "Mame", notice how in it dances, but whenever Lucy / Mame starts to do something other than funny shuffle, the camera cuts off and returns to the right when the number is over and the star with the dancers presents. Again, it's just as good. Jane Connell had to play the role of pathetic Agnes Gooch after Lucille Ball shot Madeline Kahn to ensure that no comic originality increased the star. Connell is a theatrical performer who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, is unable to curtail her performance for movies, so joining Lucille Ball embarrassed, though for various reasons. Rich Dresses are Theadora Van Runkle (Van Wrinkle?) and they provide color missing in all but one cast. Bea Arthur as actress Vera Charles, best friend Mame, ignores everyone and makes her own fun thing. If she was just in multiple scenes. She is too old for her role, but at least she didn't.
