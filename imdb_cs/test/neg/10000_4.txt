This is an example of why most action movies are the same. Generic and boring, nothing really worth watching here. A complete waste of the then-scant Ice-T and Ice Cube talents, who have proven many times that they are able to act and act well. Don't bother with this, go to New Jack City, Ricochet or watch the New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for the Ice Cube and check out the real deal. Awful clich√© of the Ice-T dialog box makes this movie a grate at the teeth and I'm still wondering what the hell Bill Paxton did in this movie? And why the hell is he always playing exactly the same character? From Aliens onward, every movie I saw with Bill Paxton played exactly the same excitement and at least in Aliens his character died, which made her somewhat pleased ... <br /> <br /> is a second-rate action basket. There are countless better movies you want to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch Judgment Night, which is virtually a carbon copy, but it has a better performance and better scenario. All it took to watch was a decent hand at the camera - cinematography was almost refreshing, which is close to getting the horrible movie to come - but not quite. 4/10.
