I can't believe how bad this "movie" is. To begin with, the film deals with the legend of Big Foot and a group of people who have a close encounter with the creature. The assumption is interesting and having Lance Henriksen in the cast (ALIENS) gave "The Untold" a promising outlook. Unfortunately, it's as interesting as it goes. It looks like a direct DVD release ... or so I think. This is basically a production-free worst-case thing (with constant "fading to black" between each scene !!!) I've seen in my life and acting that will make you cringe. Why Lance Henriksen chose it is perfectly flawless. And the film takes allusions from any other genre film, from "Blair Witch Project" (video scene) and "Predator", to "Alive". This is allegedly based on real events, but the only truth here is just how BAD the film is. Usually I'm not a tough critic and believe me I was trying to enjoy this basket, but not at the end. Do yourself a favor and avoid this DVD. I'll try to mention it slightly: This film is PURE Waste and it made me take a gun and shoot my neighbors ... or ask BLOCKBUSTER for a refund !!! And Lance, shame on you! 1 * of 10 *
