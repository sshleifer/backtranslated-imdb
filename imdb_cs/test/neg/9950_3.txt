Mad Monster Begins in Dr. Labs Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco), by refining his discovery of how to transform a human being into a vicious wolf like a monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject who becomes his miserable servant Peter. (Glenn Strange), apparently planning to give the serum to the War Department to use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! However, the first things Dr. Dr. Cameron has his sights, will have some sweet revenge on people who refused his experiments, forced him to resign and subjugated him to public ridicule. Dr. Cameron puts his plan into practice and uses his monstrous creature to murder Professor Blain (Robert Strange), in the unfortunate turn of events Dr. Cameron is unable to control the beast and is spotted by local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden) who spreads the news as a fire, in another unfortunate coincidence the reporter named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) gets the wind of the story and begins to investigate, he begins to suspect Dr. Cameron and Because Gregory Goes Out with His Daughter Lenora (Ann Nagel)) Has Plenty of Sniffing Opportunities Around ... Directed by Sam Newfield is a really low budget stuff from the 40s, even worse It's a boring, unoriginal low budget case. Fred Myton's script draws an extremely thin premise for nearly 77 minutes, which is too long, there is no diversity in the story and it is basically the same. The character is a dull cliché, a mad scientist who is making senseless experiments that create a monster, a fragile pretty daughter, a reporter who plays a hero and happens to be both investigating the mysterious deaths he says crazy scientist is responsible for & he is romantically involved with his daughter, a silly servant, a stupid idiot police and stereotypical shotguns who have been farmers who are always charged with drunkenness. This was probably a cliché in 1942! Film plods, along with a relatively slow pace and director Newfield, will never manage to maintain or create much in excitement or atmosphere, which is a bad thing. Technically the film is not great, apparently the budget was a tiny & crazy monster itself looks lame reminiscent of an old homeless wino who has not shaved for weeks & had a few plastic jokes shop fangs placed in his mouth. Black and white cinematography is basic and static as most movies from this period, while the good laboratory of Dr. Catherine. Cameron consists of a couch and a table with some excused pieces of scientific instruments on top. Acting is stiff and wooden with Petro looking to be on drugs throughout the movie, Zucco as a mad scientist doesn't convince & is forgotten. Mad Monster is a pretty lame horror movie, there is very little to be entertained, even though I have passed it to the end of a single session at least once, which when I think about it is a bit of a success in itself!
