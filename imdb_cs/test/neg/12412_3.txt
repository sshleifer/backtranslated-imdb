Another movie with motorcycles, hell angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as a no-so cool car driver. This film does not rely on the story, but on a lot of drinking, smoking and a lot of moronic acts. Steve's portrayal of a dying cat during a serenade "I love what I know," vomited for hours. Cat Linda (yyyy) is playing with everyone! Fats did the best playing because he only grunts and makes sounds. I also dare to try to find out what Banjo says. "You're kidding." This is people's screenwriter. I liked the end. What a better place to climax than a beacon! You have to see it to hate it. DIE Jeter, DIE !!!
