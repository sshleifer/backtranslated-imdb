Some amateur comes out with a tired action movie. this is just so bad, I don't think I even need to comment on the storyline, acting, script, working with the camera. because it has no !! If putting a muscle guy in a cool leather jacket walking in a slow mo and throw in a funky rap song is the main ingredient of making a great action movie, then sayonara action movie !!
