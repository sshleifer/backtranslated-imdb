This is the first movie I watched from Italian Ed Wood, Demofilo Fidani aka Miles Deem. The above title was redundantly added later because there is another similarly named 1961 movie starring Richard Basehart, who was Hammer of the films 'Michael Carreras' one and just stabbed the Western; the original Italian title was originally translated as HER NAME, which was SAM WALBASH, but HIM AMEN? Although it was actually WALLACH in the Italian version, which, of course, implies homage to the Hollywood actor Eli! Although it is certainly not undetected bad, examples of clumsiness and impolite are so abundant that I often burst into howling laughter: a terrible number would be irresistible to the French chanteuse; absolutely irrelevant bar-room argument; actors make somersault while shooting; an old villager doing an improvised dance routine; inefficient use (actually abuse) of slow motion; and, easily most absurd, see Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate playing two shooters (sporting their own actors' names!) hired by a villain to kill the cover character and then never appear in the rest of the movie at all! ! Leading actor Robert Woods is just ineffective whispering Amena over the bodies of his victims. Supporting actress Simonella Vitelli (actually the daughter of the director!), How wicked is wide, is quite a spectator, but unfortunately, he won't do much in the movie? despite the change of heart to the end. The main musical theme is actually pretty good, but the title song is pretty miserable in itself.
