The governor was by far a very pitiful film. I do not use this word freely because honestly there was a bad excuse for the film. Have I finished watching this feature with just one word in my mind? "why"? Frankly, you could use this question at the end of every scene in this movie and it would seem to suit you. There were so many irregularities that led to insufficient development (both in the story and in the characters), which ultimately led to a very confusing film with actors who went through the moves instead of explaining. Scenes would appear without anticipation, understanding or driving to the end. It was like looking at several different thoughts that were thrown together without any distinction. The actors set up moving events that didn't seem to suit their nature or were actually solved. That was my biggest problem with this movie. The complete and complete lack of structure of this film has brought all the stains of the foundations that have fallen apart, resulting in a true "ripple effect" for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Let me further explain this lack of consistency throughout the film. I would compare this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it. It made no sense, no logic behind it. Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this act. The line of her character was drawn very fuzzy and almost transparent. She would have been doing things like talking about sex with her sisters all the time, but she still seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time. In this film, he has his first moment of passion and there is no pain or excitement. It is not enough, and that does not seem to correspond to the original conversation we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister. Is she a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants his invention to fulfill all rights? It was confusing and totally random. It is not clear to anyone else that her teaching methods do not exist. Anyone in their right mind could see that she hadn't taught Cavendish's daughter anything. The sudden and clumsy relationship that happens between the driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers almost laughed out loud. I thought I might have discovered some magic in this movie, as Rhys-Meyers literally "poofed" the scene and suddenly caused some unnecessary drama. He felt that the director (or writer) was wondering that the original story was not going anywhere, so by adding this random character we could be a little shot (or confused by smaller film enthusiasts). Well, that didn't fool me, I saw that it was almost a "cut-and-paste" character that was used to reinforce a weakened story. Don't let me start at the end, which had no connection with the rest of the story. Again, using the "cut-and-paste" method, the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story, and that was the only solution they could get. Is it sad when actors are forced to do things out of character? but I think this is the name of the game in Hollywood. Repair until it is completely broken or at least saved. The rest of the story was a reckless dribble. Maybe there were a handful of nice cinematographic moments in which you saw that there was a single source of creativity that attempted to culminate with some bars of a decent period musical, but nothing to write about Grandma. A more family structure with some stronger introductions could reinforce this film a little more, but as I said earlier, by leaving open scenes that lie just around the film, you will experience cracks in your foundation. What may seem like a rugged story will eventually wear out, and at the end of the film, I felt that the house was falling apart. Wilkinson plays his normal self in this movie while the driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had too (I will have to visit a doctor after these images have been burned into the eyes - eeewwww). She was also wearing the same dress every day. That was disgusting and I felt it on TV. Sex and dirty clothes. Now it's a great movie for you! There seemed to be some potential here, but instead it was just waste. Nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to be the highest. Overall, it could have been a decent movie that combined powerful science and love themes together, but instead it was merely pitiful. I cannot emphasize enough the worrying fact that the characters went through the movements without any preliminary explanation. I do not need the film moments that have been given to me as a child, but something that should be done to build a foundation. Just remember the oatmeal with the zebra analogue I used. If you were as confused as I was, then you will completely understand the film The Governess while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal? then maybe the movie for you! <br /> <br /> Level: * outside *****
