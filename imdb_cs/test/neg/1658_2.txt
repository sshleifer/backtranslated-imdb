Aimless teens on a summer break in a small Ohio town can't find any meaningful ways to fill their time. Some consider driving to Chicago; others are willing to drink and intimidate their peers. In a random act, alcohol-driven arrogance predators roughen the homeless and steal a strange book. The manuscript text turned out to contain archaic spells designed to summon demonic powers. Night or two later, one of them reads a spell and is obsessed with it. He turns to the evil murderer and starts quietly looting his former peers. "Demon Summer" is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. The production values ​​are low, but the creators were smart enough not to be ambitious. Little special props or shooting ranges were needed. Acting is particularly weak and there is practically nothing original in the script. The positive thing is that special makeup effects are surprisingly good for low budget film standards. Despite this, gore is minimal. Make-up effects aside, there is little to go for this film, even for die-hard gore-hounds. Not recommended.
