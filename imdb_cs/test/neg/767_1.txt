While credited as Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not a cat-and-mouse team, but the earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off pose is to go to Africa and disguise themselves in a stereotyped burnt cork makeup to try to mix. While dialect humor is mostly lame, there is a short musical sequence involving "black skeletons" that was fun. But I have to ask, how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup, even after being thrown into the water several times? One of the many records created by Van Beuren Corporation for the distribution of RKO radio images before RKO made a deal with Disney. Just worth seeing if you are an animation enthusiast or interested in how certain ethnic groups were stereotyped as a fun way back when.
