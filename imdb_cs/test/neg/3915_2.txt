I've never heard of the movie before I caught it last night. I hope you never got a movie because it would be an insult to the silver screen and movie visitors. Should it be serious, should it be funny? Why blatantly basic conspiracy? Does anyone really care? ... <br /> <br /> Terrible movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
