I had a terrible misfortune that I had to see this "b-video" in its entirety. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is - saves your time and money !!! This must be the worst b-movie of all time, it shouldn't be called b-movie, more like a f-movie! Because it fails in all the aspects that make a good movie: the story is not at all interesting, all the actors are paper-thin and not believable at all, it has a bad direction and the action sequences are so fake that it's almost funny. ..... almost. <br /> <br /> The film is packed with lots of lousy disposable foils that no decent person could find in the least fun. This film should be aimed at men, but all women in it are completely uninteresting, especially the old wrinkled thing that is coming to an end. They try to look sexy in those weird, horrible costumes and fail miserably !!! Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will keep you laughing, but it's too painful to watch !!
