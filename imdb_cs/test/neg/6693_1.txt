We could not wait to see this show from all the rave reviews. We love crazy humor and creative material, especially from Australia and New Zealand. I admit that it may not be a fair rating because we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we couldn't bear another misery - it was definitely the worst and most enjoyable 15 minutes we ever had to watch a TV show - that was like 15 hours. Songs can be (slightly) interesting in themselves, but embedded for infinite 3 minutes each in the middle of the story scene just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> We're trying to clear the memory now. If you want some wonderful humor in this beautiful and engaging movie, check out "The Dish."
