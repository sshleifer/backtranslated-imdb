From weeks and weeks of promotion for this, ABC's "One" was to be "the real world" meets "American Idol". We should have watched these singers perform, compete and see how they live in the house. Drama! Tension! <br /> <br /> Where do you start this atrocity? Let's start with "judges" who were known as "music experts" in this program. "Experts" mean they have expertise. At least Andre Harrell had a family tree. He was in charge of Motown Records for a while. Two more ... eh. Uncle Kate Hudson, who could be labeled Mr. Weird Beard. He dyed his face hair with three distinctly different fluorescent colors. I wonder how terribly he would be with the black light! And Paula Abdul likes to do something I didn't think could happen: she was even more gushing and cloning than Paula! She then over corrected and became harshly critical after the first episode. The "critic" fare they offered was a real joke and insult, not only in the process of finding the best singer, but also for the audience, which is now quite subtle, many times on Fox. There was a host there. George Stroumboulopoulos wasn't Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was just as bland. In fact, he sucked out how much energy the program was, dry. It was the second biggest secret of the show as he got to work. <br /> <br /> The first was how they chose 11 competitors for this program? It was literally a talent-free talent show. OK. Maybe it's exaggerated. And all artists must be relatively close in their ability, because if they weren't, it wouldn't be a competition. If only one person were "good", there would be no "tension". So I think they all had to be comparable. But they all had some * chops! In addition, judges ran the "Singing Academy," so the program was part of "Fame," as well. It is clear that these artists desperately needed these lessons. But you need some talented people to learn talented talent. And that was definitely not what happened here. It seemed to be a cast of the show, the priority was on "homelife" elements, because all the players were very attractive to be able to watch them. parts, how badly vocalized. But the filmed segments in their house were so sliced ​​and sliced ​​that you couldn't get into the stories that were beginning to happen, so the show didn't even capture events. So badly figured out how it all was, "The One" had an incredible, incredible, deadly design flaw built into the results that made him absolutely laugh. , as well as "AI". But after the audience was revealed, the three bottom racers were forced to sing the last song. "Music Professionals", based on this performance, chose one person out of three to save the following week. And then, the contestants who were safe could vote for who they wanted to keep from the other two, and send the remaining contestant home. <br /> <br /> The design flaw was that the competitors had the last word. If you were in a music contest and wanted to get as far as possible on the road, could you vote for a better singer, or would you try to get rid of your toughest opponent? Every first viewer of CBS "Survivor" could reply! And that's exactly what happened in the program. The person with better potential was lost and the contestants voted back "the one" who had no talent at all! In addition, a competitor who was just rescued from the bottom by "experts" was also allowed to vote against the other two! It was a total farce! Maybe if they let the contestants vote first, at least "experts" would save the better two ends. But that just confirms how this show is not ready to broadcast, how dissatisfied the whole process was to be and how wrong the manufacturers were in trying.
