This piece of crap is not worth critical evaluation, so I will write some information for those who do not know the background of this movie. First it is not the first Saudi film, they used the wrong information for commercial purposes (lied!). Secondly, they did it for money, not for anything else, so they chose a jerk (Hesham) who won the Star Academy (like Big Brother), it's a popular show and Hesham is popular, but stupid, cheesy and unpretentious then chose the famous Kuwaiti actor Mohammed Al Sairafi (also stupid and unreal), but he is popular (the number of times I use the word "popular", then send me an email to get your prize, however ..) has a popular show and actress Mais Jordan Hamdan, which appeared in the POPular CBM comics (indecent), so it's famous * PoPular! Then they chose several Saudi actors for ... blah blah blah. The funniest thing is the director! It's Canadian with the Palestinian Root (I believe the film's identity is the identity of its director) .. wait! The canvas play was written by an Egyptian screenwriter (very horrible!) With the help of a Lebanese critic (known as a critic, but actually a money collector!). This group of multiple races (slave money) knows nothing about Saudi culture that it does not represent, but when we know who is behind this garbage, all our questions will be relieved! Waleed bin Talaal is a Saudi prince and (BUSINESSMAN) who does not care about Saudi culture or Saudi people who do not live in Saudi Arabia (even if they live, live in their own world, the world is far away) far from the real world of human world so she knows nothing or does not care about anything except the infinite wealth. <br /> <br /> * Not a Saudi movie (not a movie). /> Screw them all. Beep from 10!
