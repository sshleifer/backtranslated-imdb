Seriously, if you want to see a horror clich√©, you have to see it. It contains all the "frightening parts where nothing happens", "the type of nerd that is not actually killed", "boy and girl come together and survive", "face old child fear" etc. I wanted to see this movie because I thought the video game mix and the movie would work. I guess I was wrong. Which makes the film bearable? It's just 1hur17min, so if you're bored, it might be a good idea, even if I was bored. Why don't you see it at all? Frankie Munitz aka Malcolm is just annoying as nerd. I could have fired this guy, and it's so sad he didn't die sooner and he even gets back. You see something else!
