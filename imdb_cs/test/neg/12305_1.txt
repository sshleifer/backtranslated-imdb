Most movies that I can easily sit, even though I don't like the movie in particular. I'm the kind of person who knows great movies, even though I don't like this genre. This is the first movie I couldn't watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. Acting is fine (Myers is good as a cat, it's just that he's really uncomfortable). Silly songs that sang cats were boring and monotonous, even for children in the audience. The plot goes on and on, and viewers have to suffer from a bad dialogue. "Funny" parental notes are disgusting, not funny (I remember some horrible comments about garden hoes that are compared to the type of person people call "ho"). Even though the movie is really short, it seems like FOREVER. Don't waste your time. I know little children who hated this movie. If kids can't stand it, I don't know how adults can. I would like to radiate more about this film, but I do not feel that it is wasting my time writing this review. I HAD NOT TO! So, in summary, you don't have to spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! Check out the GOOD movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars - the lowest review I've ever made.
