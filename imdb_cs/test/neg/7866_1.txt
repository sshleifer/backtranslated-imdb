If this film is to be rated on a scale of 1 to 10, a new rating system needs to be created, as it should not qualify. The storyline of the film (if you can call it) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), a former agent who is targeting the brother of the man he killed while he was still working for the US. If it sounds like an interesting scenario, please don't be fooled because this movie doesn't bring what its action thematic story suggests. Comedian Chris Rock once said that when a person sees an actor who does a bad movie that makes one want to send an actor $ 50, given that the actor must be desperate for money to do so poorly work. After watching this movie, you can send Stephen Baldwin $ 100. Baldwin seems to have made no effort in his role in the film. In the film, Baldwin is forced to run the entire city of Los Angeles in order to protect his "honeycomb" (wife) from being murdered by a male brother he had previously killed. However, throughout the picture, Baldwin seems to be barely able to tear off the light run. His performance succeeds in subtracting any tension that the film might represent. <br /> <br /> If you are a type of person who likes watching very bad movies and laughing with their shortcomings, this movie is for you. However, if you are looking for a well done action thriller, it would be best to look elsewhere than rent this movie.
