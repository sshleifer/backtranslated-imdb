Performance is better than the rating I gave to this job, simply because I do not support a film that shows every child or person with mental disabilities how to get, cook and apply narcotics to their bodies. This is a disgusting film that makes no sense in the world, but enchant and try to legitimize a narcotic lifestyle. They carry convincing performance, which contributes to my disgust. What do these people THINK?! I couldn't enjoy such a movie. It's enough for someone who has never done drugs to think about it, and those who have and redeemed themselves, consider reversing. I'm surprised that it doesn't mean that every clean junkie who sees it falls off the car. There's nothing good about this "movie", which is more than getting to the dock. drama. This is the epitome of what is wrong with Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Absolutely disgusting. <br /> <br /> Rated 1.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> Fiend:.
