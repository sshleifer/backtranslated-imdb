*** SPOILERS *** Hot and sexy Linda Blair as Witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset by her friend and rival witch across the city of Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia, with her husband Hal, Edward Albert, gets to work for Giger & Greengrass, where she deserves Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who happens to be married to Erika, her magic on Hal. Lose control of your car and end up almost killing yourself. Larry learned about Eric's attempt at his best friend Larry's life has a violent struggle with her causing Eric to fall off the balcony to her death. It's when Larry returns to his former wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things really start to warm up, emotionally and sexually. Evil Amelia is trying to get Erika's dead ghost to take over Carol's body and ultimately murder Larry, who is responsible for her husband's injury to Hal, who has permanently limited him to a wheelchair. Not much of the story, but lots of cheese and soft-core action with the poor Larry, who has manipulated Amelia due to the resurrection of Erika, who wants to kill him the first chance he turns her on. Amelia is a little frightened of not knowing who she is and who is not a threat to her. Amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks, to first lose him in a bloody raid on the house, then his mind by being accused by the police of being a murderer, and eventually being a life by blowing him up . Ameila herself. As he tried to enter Reynolds' house, under her control, like a madman who was trying to murder her and the maimed Hal. Larry Parks looked and acted so strangely that you felt like he went to the "Charmed Ones" and ended up casting his role as Stan. Without the help or benefit of the script, he improvised his way and then slowly realized how terribly bad the movie was. Stan, who was killed early in the film, was a big plus for him because he didn't have to suffer, just like those of us who watched the entire brain and the numb film. It turns out to you as well as for the creator of "The Witches" that all these shenanigan on screen must come up with some hopeful and successful conclusion and the trick end is put to the end of the film. The end is probably the best thing except Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-endowed woman that can be said about the film.
