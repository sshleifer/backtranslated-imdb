The subtle young cast is unnecessary in this empty, mawkish, manipulative film that tries to be a combination of both cute comedy and sharp drama. The story moves so slowly that 90 minutes seems endless because the characters do nothing but mop and emotions. The dialogue is filled with imminent clich√©s and attempts at happiness-cookie on pseudophilia. The film, whose aim is to be a moving and deep look at life and love, becomes mere pretentious. The only real weight is the burden that a talented cast is forced to carry the best. But never worry - they are held by puppet strings of inventive conspiracy.
