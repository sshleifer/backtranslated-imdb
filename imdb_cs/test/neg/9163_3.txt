When I finally got to see this movie lately, it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance ... yet another Hollywood CG / live-action rehash established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or unforgettable. Designed in every possible way to address very young children and very immature adults, making heavy use of comedic devices such as Farts, Poo-Eating and Size Theodore Butt. This film would bother me much less if it wasn't so obvious for Chipmunks. Even their characters, which I found, have been made worse for this film. While in the past each of them had a very different personality, they all behaved like immature, clever children with ADD and were constantly bouncing off the walls. I was particularly worried when I saw Simon so depicted ... It's supposed to be a clever, serious nerd who acts like a "straight man" to Alvin's mad adversaries. But here's almost a carbon copy of Alvin. One joke in the movie even means that Simon only * thinks he's smart, but he's not really ... and frankly, if I had never heard of Chipmunks before I saw this movie, I'd agree. In my opinion, this film is just another clear cash grab, and I'm more than a little sorry that it was even made. The fact that it's a "kid" movie apologizes to its shortcomings ... To excuse a stupid movie that degrades classic franchise just because it's for kids is offensive to children, and every boy deserves something more intelligent than this movie.
