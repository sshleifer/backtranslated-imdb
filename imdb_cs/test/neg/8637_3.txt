When George Sluizer was told he could run the American version of "Het Gouden Ei" / "Spoorloos" (outside Holland, this movie also has the name "Vanishing"), he was told it would only pass if the end was changed - he was told that the "American audience" would not approve the original end. Of course, the original ending is much better and without it the film loses its influence. Given that I put it in the trivia section, I will not give the original ending and the note spoiler-free. If you want to know the original end, check out "Spoorloos" or read the book. This film is the absolute waste and the first film Kiefer Sutherland I don't like. Watch the original Dutch film, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.
