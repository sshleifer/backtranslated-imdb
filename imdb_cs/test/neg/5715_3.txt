It's nice to see that Julie Andrews is exploring a straightforward dramatic role - something she hasn't done in a while - but her character Judith (wise not trying to pass her as "Judy") has old refined behavior and tomboyish yore hairstyle, and Andrews enjoys' adult-up 'as any other actress would interpret frigid. It is a surprisingly insignificant drama that takes place in Barbados and includes Omar Sharif (not the liveliest leader in the neighborhood - not even in 1974!) Hoping that Andrews will become a spy while slowly taking her to the proverbial bedroom. An unmistakable trip has some camp value: James Bond-like credits at the beginning are cheesy hoot. As for Julie: she is calm and contemplative, but it doesn't mean much to the audience or the film. Blake Edwards walked on scary things like a funeral. * of ****
