First: The recent campaign of this film is a huge scam. Judging by the envelope, you think it was some kind of scandalous movie about Kylie playing a character having sex, taking drugs and anything. That's just a cheap market system. He is hardly in it and does nothing of it. Marketing is incredible and I'm surprised that filmmakers have no objections. The film itself was a huge disappointment for me. It was like Sunset Beach episode, directed by teenage Quentin Tarantino. And this is not meant to be a compliment. I think the film's weakness is primarily a story. It seems not about anything. Just about the cool teenagers who stumble on life on the edge. The characters themselves have a personality, but the film does not use its potential. As has been said, there is no story of any substance. Looks like he's too expanding on a cool dialogue and looks like MTV's color ad. He definitely has the feeling. Still, I think some people might enjoy it, but I'd say there's much better movies here.
