I like a good Western movie, but it was more of a game on stage or an act at a local street carnival show. I could only keep it 38 minutes in the hope that it would improve, but it was just worse and I had to end it. Each of the actors gave the lines as if reading directly from the script or cards. There were too many predictability of lines and actions not as if the natural occurrence or conversation. Rachel Kimsey's wig was obvious. Actresses playing Native American sisters could play non-native parts and should have. The Native American Wardrobe could be better and a little more authentic. If I decide to watch with friends in the future, I will do it, not with the expectation of watching a good West, but with the expectation of watching amateur comedy film production.
