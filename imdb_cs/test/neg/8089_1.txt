Here's a spoiler: A small piece of you dies at the end of the movie. You spend the rest of your life unnecessarily searching for the missing piece, but it's gone, it's gone. You will walk through the streets at night, staring at the windows of your neighbors as they sit down for dinner. Friends and family will try to determine exactly when you have become dead. You will answer their questions and concerns with a blank look and some mumblings about a runaway testicle. When the AMC inevitably makes the Tomcats "movie of the month," a series of mysterious murders will be held in your city. The next morning you wake up on the kitchen floor with a faint brain drain in your mouth. Then you crawl into the living room and on the couch. You are staring at the wall, moisten a little, and then start laughing maniacally. Because once your dead inside, Jake Busey in Tango is actually pretty damn funny.
