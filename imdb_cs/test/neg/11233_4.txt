This film is full of sentiment, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me, and irrelevant material. Why, for example, introduce Rachel? She has nothing to do with the film, except to allow her "Follow Me" to run wild and hit Dorinda's fence. It must be one of those stupid sequences among many in the movie. Next is at the end when the plane (it was B-26 or A-26? - both signs are used in the movie) is left with props swirling and without wedges in place. This of course serves a conspiracy, but to reveal that it would be a dreaded spoiler. As it is, the plane would start controlling the taxi. The ending (again, avoiding spoilers) requires too much talk - like the start of sound movies in the 1930s with all those closing speeches. Here Dreyfuss is just fooling on and on. The end also includes another radical violation of the aircraft protocol and a few unlikely / impossible options that I will not describe. What a dull and incoherent effort!
