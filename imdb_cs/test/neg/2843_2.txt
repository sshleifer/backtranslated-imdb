At first I thought this was to be somewhat of a comedy / horror when I saw the body in the bath with the lady who just stood there screaming again and again, but as the film went on, it happens more and more. . The story was stupid when the man got upset that real estate prices had risen, so now the dicides would call the radio psyciatrist and angry his fury because he had nothing better to do. Then the law gets involved and desperately tries to make us feel they're really caring who's calling and going out of the way to watch this guy. One suspect after another is charged. This movie is a horrible and slow moving love scene of Adrian B. and her husband are boring and make me just a fast forward. Avoid it!
