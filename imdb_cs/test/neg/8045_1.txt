The COC had its moments. I enjoyed the action sequence, but I despised the script and the plot. I hate the movie so much, I'll just write about the stupidest part. First, the plot never happens. Second, the Chinese President's disgust was unsolicited. That would never happen. Finally, dialogue. Employing non-Chinese actors to play Chinese roles is understandable, but writing a dialogue for them that is completely off is stupid! For those of you who understood the Chinese in the movie, you know what I mean.
