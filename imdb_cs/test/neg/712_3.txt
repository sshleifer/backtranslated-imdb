Released at a time when Duvivier went from strength to strength again. "Black Jack", which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary "Au Royaume des Cieux" and the dazzling stunning "Sous Le Ciel de Paris", is a tangle that Duvivier himself hates, which is not surprising. There is almost nothing to write about this dud.We can notice that: <br /> <br /> 1.Orson Welles uses to admire Duvivier. This may explain why Wellesian actors were featured in Duvivier's movies: Joseph Cotten in " Lydia "(1941) and Agnes Moorehead absolutely useless here. I enjoyed Moorehead's performance for the first time: On the other hand, Welles borrowed his Desdemon (Suzanne Cloutier) from Duvivier's "Au Royaume des Cieux" for his "Othello". 2. In each Duvivier movie there is one or two valuable sequences and this is no exception: searching in caves where Duvivier's sense of mysterious works miracles (for a short while), then persecution when Dalio catches in th Touch fishnets.Duvivier can be felt in the unfortunate end too. As for the rest, as my dear pen pal writes reign, it's a black joke.
