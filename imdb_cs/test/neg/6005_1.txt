OK. At first I wanted to check if this movie has an average rating below or equal to -1. But 5.9. This is more sick than any of the murderers -, -. This brought me to the curiosity of what people wrote here ... which eventually made me create an account to put my 2 cents of truth into this "well of illusion". Give this movie the same sentences as Seven? All they have in common is that they show different scenes of crimes. It is. And "The Best Thriller of 1999!" ? have you watched the movie? Or some other film in your life at all? 1999 is not a year that people remember RESURRECTION ... what about real movies like 8mm, eyes closed, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (They are actually more "thriller" than it can ever be ..). The Resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to the Second of 1999. <br /> <br /> You really can't be serious. I watched the movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by her friend. "Great movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... that I haven't seen yet? Hmm .. <br /> <br /> Well, first look at Covers: OK, nothing special. At second glance, you don't have to have supernatural powers to be aware that they just mirrored Lambert's head, trimmed his nose, and let alone do it, then made an impressive negative pattern on her to get a picture of murderers at COVER. You might even think that they had some apprentice eating gallon marshmallows just to notice that spooky (booooh! -.-) mouth. He turned around and the plot begins .. "It rains in Chicago ... blabber blabber". Let's go, a six-year-old could make the passage exciting. Now with this great excitement of the movies an amazing presentation. Because it can't be so bad, it's still Christopher Lambert. My assumption was wrong. WIth "proved wrong" I think it was brutally executed by a deadly mixture of the worst imaginable acting ever known to mankind (every actor, but the peaks are "I can do 1-Liners!" Police Chief, Prudhommes Wife __ actually a better detective than Prudhomme, when he recombines several incidents with yet absurd help in the case of !!!! -.- __ and .. yes .. Prudhomme himself) represented a squadron of inhuman false feelings, logical errors in 1 minute-cycle, light-years conclusions that I think represent an insult to any thinking human being and last but not least to a cameraman who apparently was a hyperventilation kangaroo. Well, and if you don't want to close the brain completely (these aren't the spaces to watch it), then you should know who's who and what's after 30 minutes, simply because you know any scene after the first. It is exciting. Exciting because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future. Point: This is the worst movie I remember. Trust me, I've seen many horrible movies that somehow have been at least just bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. But resurrection is the best example of how to fail in every aspect. It was so bad that when I was shocked by my unimaginably low quality in e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, I laughed more often than in any recent comedy, simply because I was fascinated by the crew's audacity to publish such a-great film strip. The good thing for Lambert was in the Highlander: Endgame a year later, so he can be forgiven. ; ^ About <br /> <br /> In any case, I recommend watching this film of the University of Economics. Finally, we talked to him: ^ D. I guarantee you that after full resurrection monitoring (be brave, you can do it!) You will worship the level of action in every day soap. Or just go watch the highlander again ... that's what I'm going to do.
