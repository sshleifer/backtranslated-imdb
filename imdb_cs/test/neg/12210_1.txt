While killing time on Saturday morning, "Looking for Lola" came to HBO. I decided to give it, even though the description of the movie looked pretty bad. It was even worse than I could imagine. The film was incredibly incredible and there was absolutely no screen chemistry among the main actors I found almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (the leading actor) in scenes where he jumps to a luxury restaurant and where Lola (the leading actress) allows him to use his boss's house to fool his parents to think he is rich, it was almost as bad as he. "dreaming" about people around him makes macarena (that was HORRIBLE!) and two actors fall in love. I wanted to change the channel, but I tried to give him every chance to become a cute love story with a few laughs. He never did. In fact, it was so bad that I decided to finish it, so I can say that I was watching one of the worst films ever made in its entirety instead of being criticized for "not giving him a fair chance". The last scene where Lola was trying to dance was the climax of the film. She comes late after getting married (even the scene where Mike tells the priest to hurry and then just strikes the papers off claiming it's done was in line with the credibility of this movie), and then somehow "convinces" the judges look at it. Both male judges are already postponed as late. But after watching her passport around the stage (all right, dancing well, but not very impressive), everyone joins Lola and Mike's families, other dancers who were there, and * coughs * even the judges. Bad, terrible, terrible. It was so bad that I had to write a review. Watch at your own risk.
