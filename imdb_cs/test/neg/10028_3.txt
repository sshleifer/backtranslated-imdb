Foolish tourists go camping in Utah just to hit a murderous, disfigured gypsy. The prey is a nice run of a mill slasher movie that usually suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim's characters are too familiar with idiotic teens, which means they don't really care about them, just wonder when they die! Not to mention that he has too many cheesy moments and is filled with endless, unnecessary shots of nature. However it has a few moments of interest for slasher fans, an occasional touch of a spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by Don Peake. Yet it is as usual for movies with a dead caravan. There are much better films in this vein, but especially The Prey can be sufficiently observable for fans with a hard slasher. Although it might be more rewarding to watch Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983). <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
