Horror movies are a curious thing, sometimes they come across a formula that works very well, sometimes trying to bravely tell a dignified story despite time and budget problems, sometimes so bad they're actually a little fun ... and sometimes they are " The Cavern ". A good horror / tense movie should contain doubts that assure you that you should be interested in characters and their motivation to actually have some kind of reaction when they die. However, Cavern decides instead of introducing elements that initially work only to be negated by his own vague narrative. <br /> <br /> All characters are absolutely forgotten and any real story that could make them all remotely remarkable is smoothed out within 30 seconds of a monologue, which makes it impossible to do anything more than laugh because the characters are selected almost randomly and on more than one occasion in the least frightening way. <br /> <br /> (To make the scene a little bit spoiled, one sacrifice is taken during a complete power outage that might be a little scary if the sound effect indicated that its killing didn't resemble mixing the pot with too strong macaroni and cheese The camera that works makes me think that the director has seen too many Nine Inch Nails videos and the end that, in order to be shocking, serves almost no purpose, but harasses and confuses the viewer and you have an almost unnoticeable horror movie that won't succeed on any I'll be honest with you if you want a claustrophobic cave horror movie to watch "Descent", and I feel weird that I didn't say enjoy the movie.
