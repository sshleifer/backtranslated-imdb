This film would like to be a shocking, cerebral and intense film that has passed many others in its genre, but it is not. At best it is confusing and absurd. When twists and turns were finally revealed, instead of saying, "Oh, I get it!" I mumbled something "Well ... whatever." In my opinion, when the film reveals the main plot, it should not use a flashback sequence to prove that it has made some advice to allow the viewer to recognize the truth itself. But this movie has a flashback; and here's the kicker: flashing back to scenes that weren't even in the movie! The characters were stereotypical, unsympathetic and totally ridiculous. I feel that the "steamy" love scenes between romantic clues have been the most impractical and unclear what I've ever seen in a movie that wasn't porn. It seems the director went on shocking and eccentric with love scenes, but they were really just stupid. And don't always start me on lousy accents and low-end sets. I think the movie was in New Orleans, but in addition to the aforementioned accents and a few shots in the city, it could be a movie in Anytown, USA. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: don't bother!
