If you're looking for a good summer feeling, Dark Harvest 2 can be just your ticket. The production values ​​of this film are extremely high (it looks like they were filmed with Sony Handicam and edited with iMovie), especially sound effects - they sound directly from the "Spooky Halloween Sounds" CD! The scarecrow from the cover, even if it does not appear in the film and otherwise has no meaning, is frighteningly realistic! From the beginning to the end, you will watch as you aim your daughters aimlessly through the word play for MAIZE! At the top of the movie, you'll see, well ... you'll have to look at yourself. What I'm really trying to say here is that they don't come within 1,000 yards of this movie. I rented it because I thought it would be a camp kind of "Troll 2" funny, but it's not like that. I cried after I watched this movie because I realized I was spending money on it (and I found $ 4 I spent on renting it). Actually, I fell asleep for 20 minutes and I still knew what was going on.
