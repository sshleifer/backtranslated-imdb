My wife noticed this movie on the alley in the local video store. It looked like a science fiction film from the cover, but after turning over my wife, she saw Rebecca St. James in the movie, she realized it was a Christian film, and suggested we watch him. We are conservative evangelicals, but we also know that "Christian" films have a bad reputation in the mainstream. But we decided to go through it. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were a few things I liked about the movie. The musical score - which was largely organized - was quite good. The movie was also pretty good considering that it was a lower budget movie. Unfortunately, any virtue in this production has been lost in a regrettable scenario. The film begins with an interesting premise - UFO abduction - but in the middle of this element, the theatrical story penetrates wildly into the evangelistic crusade led by the two main characters of the film ... which then pass wildly into the Rapture treatise. At least Frank Peretti-inspired "Visiting" (which was himself a deeply flawed film) had an ending that tied together the film premise. "Unknown" ends nowhere near the place where it started, which is a huge drop. <br /> <br /> About acting? Support play ranges from decent to terrible. (Rebecca St. James plays a little role and is passable.) On their part, several of the main characters are well equipped. Sadly, their talents are wasted on characters who are so one-dimensional in their personalities that they are incredible. "Protagonists" are different than; You know it's bad when two Christian viewers find the loudest Christian figure in the film to be the most annoying. Final remark on the evangelistic tone of this film, which will be more interesting to Christians than non-Christian readers. In a word, it's awkward. Other Christian films such as Carmen's "Champion" and Peretti's "The Hangman's Curse" managed to convey a truly uncompromising portrait of the Christian faith without sounding preaching or repressive. This film, on the other hand, is a hammer that feels so cumbersome and lacks the tact that a non-Christian would hardly take it seriously. I believe his heart is in The Right Place movie and I appreciate the effort to make a good Christian film. Unfortunately, it's not one of them. If your church is looking for a screening of a good Christian film, consider "Mercy Streets", the aforementioned "The Champion", or (if you are Pentecostal), the provocative "The Apostle" of Robert Duvalle. <br /> <br /> As for "Unknown?" Rent it if necessary, but project it before you show it to a non-Christian or larger audience.
