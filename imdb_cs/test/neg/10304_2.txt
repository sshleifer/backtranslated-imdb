Fox is pretty lame. Cancels bad shows. It's bizarre that they cancel a well-written program like "Arrested Development" and still keep this show and "war at home." I feel that Fox loved the "Married with Children" color barrier, but now it's just ridiculous. "The Loop" is a pointless and boring watch and their sharp jokes just fit. You have to bring jokes to work to work. "Family Guy" and "The Simpons" work because there is a constant flow of jokes. Fox needs to pull his head out of the rectal cavities and let his relatives write this average trio. I mean, if you want to invest money in making something fun, make it fun. Also stop using "no-named" actors. It's great to have up-and-comers, but you need to dock a show with a famous celebrity. Duh, Fox.
