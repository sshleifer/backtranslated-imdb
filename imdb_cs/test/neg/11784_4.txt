Irwin Allen has built all his talents for this: he is a co-screenwriter, producer and director of this cartoonish "epic" about atomic submarines and his efforts to reduce the ring of radiation circling on Earth. Despite the eclectic cast, the potentially exciting story cannot take off. Various players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are excitingly mixed and provide a color cast, but this sg-sg-sg-fi is pretty cheesy. Good for a few stray laughs, but Allen apparently didn't know the difference between strong, solid adventure and nonsense. Later popular TV series. ** of ****
