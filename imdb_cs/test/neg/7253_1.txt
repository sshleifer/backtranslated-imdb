I'm afraid I can't imagine it. It's a really horrible and extremely boring movie. In some ways, it resembles early science sci-fi, when each set was fired on a Hollywood back from what lay around. From a tiny and unconvincing set (snipers appear to be about ten feet away), apparently from plaster, actors who are apparently made of plaster with "fun" stereotypes painted above, to a strangely warm pool in a frozen cave, to survival cast unharmed when mid artillery grenades burst a few meters away on open ground, and finally a terrible font that reads as a training manual more than a movie .... I really can't say how boring it is. Not even the opportunity to see if young James Dean survived was enough to watch me for more than an hour. This is really one that needs to be avoided for all costs.
