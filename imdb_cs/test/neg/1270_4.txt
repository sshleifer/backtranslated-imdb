Spiderman was one of the first comics to initiate changes in the genre: despite being a very well-made superhero comic, this is the first series to give the main character a real psychological depth, a complex moral problem, a round, and social and political issues. in other words: Spiderman was the age of comics. This TV series lacks all these components. It's just a straightforward good purchase / bad TV series suffering from obvious budget constraints that make the action scene a bit exciting. Spiderman nylon straps are about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in Star Trek. Nicholas Hammond is too old at the time. I think he was well at the age of thirty when Spider, the man at that time, was really a teenager. For some incomprehensible reason, writers have also changed names and erased important characters from the comic book, which again resulted in tensions that basically disappear.
