This movie is the last drop in the list of movies I've seen this week, which has pushed me to the edge and forced me to join the IMDb and expand the public's warning. It was totally awful. The film was stretched and painfully boring. Sound, effects, and even image quality seemed to come from Willow (1988) or perhaps Conan the Barbarian (1982). The battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This "biggest film rebuilding of the medieval battle ever held on the British Isles" made me angry. There was no coherent formation at all, just a few boys with spears and horses running through them. Douglas shots, especially in the last battle, were just terrible, as were most of the games in the movie.
