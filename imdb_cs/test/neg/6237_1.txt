What the hell was the purpose of this boring movie? at the beginning it looked interesting enough, but it fell quickly on the face. his supposed to be based on a true story but for shouting out loud there is no more screenwriters left in Hollywood? man iv'e saw these guys in the best movies ever made. the great actor is also slipping; maybe their hard or just losing their senses. The dialogue was long and severely difficult, especially at home with the family. I wonder if the actors thought they had a hit here? perhaps ... uh ... and Oscar?
