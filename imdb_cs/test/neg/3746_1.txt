I left the cinema when I suffered this film after 30 minutes. I left two friends who were fastened with a large bold block to hold the rest. Once the opening sequence of the movie unfolded, I felt something was wrong, and it wasn't long before I stopped. I myself hid under the seat, crouching in embarrassment. I'm not the one who goes from movies in any way, because they usually have some redeeming function, but this one suffered from a catalog of bad direction, bad play (bar 'Bruno' character and impeccable Jean Rochefort - according to my friends), terrible adjustments and meaning), terrible soundtracks and image correlations that seemed to make the art of placing poor calmness of music through picture and scene at the wrong time. The worst crime was its total unpredictability and incredibility (the result of these atrocities). Why was it so horrible? I don't want to waste more time explaining. I would say go and see it myself, but I do not want to fill the cash registers of this project more than necessary. The screening had one redeeming function: My friend rolled over rows of seats in silhouette with an umbrella hooked over his arm as he tried to cope - more pathos, tensions and fun in those few moments than in 125 minutes. this sadly desperate effort.
