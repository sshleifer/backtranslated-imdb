I will not repeat what so many others have said about this film; I'll try to add a few new points. Coolio-as-vampire bit is a nod to the fans who are familiar with his turn on the song Blondie "No Exit" in which he takes on the role of rapping a vampire (it actually acts as a musical concept and is actually a great song). Casper Van Dien is no worse than Brad Pitt and is actually nicer. And what does anyone have to go to Brad Pitt for other than eye candy? Here, even if it's badly filmed (check out the "Starship Troopers" site). And of course, Udo Kier, after playing Dracula in Morrissey / Warhol, has a little more than a portrait. Enjoy it if you can.
