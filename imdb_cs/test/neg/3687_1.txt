I've never made any comments on IMDb here, but as I saw this movie, I can't be calm. I just set my account here just because of this horrible movie. in two words, this film is PURE CRAP. the movie doesn't make any sense! Nothing makes any sense in this movie. Watching this movie was a pain. I don't understand why Val Kilmer agreed to do this movie. He plays a small role as a gang leader, says a few words and he is there for a total of 5 minutes. I bought this DVD only because of the name of Val Kilmer on the box and interesting photos on the cover. <br /> <br /> As stated in another review, Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back !!! The title of the film itself has brought the notion of rating everyone should give: ZERO
