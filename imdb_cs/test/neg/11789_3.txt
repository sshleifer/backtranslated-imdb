I really wanted to like this movie. Great cast ?? Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic "Forbidden Planet", Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a music-inclined sailor (is a submarine guy and sailor?), Even Peter Lorre as a shark-favored scientist. Maybe he's a good guy, but I was having trouble getting up. Lorre was heavily underestimated. I think it was red herring like Pidgeon? You expect it to go nuts and try to throw a hero or his gal into a shark tank. No such luck. By the way, why is there a shark tank on the submarine? This is typical of the film's lack of ambition. They explain why Lorre goes shark back and forth (because we see it), but we just expect to accept the fact that shark is on this subspecies for this reason. "Research?" Yeah, scientists always do research things that they understand? Of course, if he hadn't been a shark to kill the evil psychologist's wife (Joan Fontaine)? I'm sorry, but even children's films in the 1950s are able to be less predictable and sincerely idiotic (not to mention the exploitative ones). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first 10 or 15 minutes. Great theme song sung by Frankie Avalon. Pidgeon leads Floyd Barber (actually Howard McNear, I'm sorry Howie loved ya in "Blue Hawaii") and Joan Fontaine on a guided tour, carefully skips the room with the huge "WARNING" sign on the door, past Peter Lorre with the aforementioned sharks and then we see a full-screen shot of Eden shaking her wallet at Avalon's passionate horn! The film continues quickly. There is no real explanation for the fire that threatens the Earth, so there is a significant lack of dramatic tension and no villain who could boot. Instead, Pidgeon's character is made into an unconvincing red sequence vaguely defining Ahab (I think "The Caine Mutiny" was still fresh in people's minds), and Fontaine's character suddenly changes evil for no reason at the end. I suppose the reason is that it's a surprise for the audience. And it's kind of surprising, since the only negative thing she did is talk badly about Captain's mental health and there's no reason she would be self-assured after it turned out to be a villain. Very bad and unconvincing. Whoever was a pessimistic bible matrix was better? at least his character made sense. So what else could be wrong? Endless, endless diving footage. I have never understood the appeal of this kind of thing. The giant octopus is attacking the ship for a minute, so there's a monster for the theatrical trailer. Perhaps some people have fooled people into thinking that it will be a fantasy adventure film, instead of a half-burning thrilling film about military scientists who are never wrong. Yes ?? Perhaps the worst of all, it's barely a fantasy movie a much less sci-fi movie. It never did anything for my imagination, because the whole premise was nothing more than another catastrophe / apocalypse, and these characters never experienced any feelings of miracles or discoveries. I'm with Irwin Allen. I never liked his later movies, but this made me pretend to be Jules Verne when it's just another exercise in escalating disasters. The whole movie is just waiting for us to see which character is likely to become evil and die. He has always hired an actor / actress with a charming and personality screen persona to play these roles and this is the only element of "surprise" that can be found because there is no logic of these characters as well. What is a pathetic loss of time for these actors. George Pala's films are a hundred times better (the only one who was lame was "Atlantis", which, not by chance, was the most Allen-esquire), full of miracles and excitement and ??? Think about it! ?? ideas! Other than a few effect scenes and Barbara Eden, in my opinion, there is nothing that should happen. I think it's good fun for those who are in disastrous movies, but I think they're hollow and boring movie genres.
