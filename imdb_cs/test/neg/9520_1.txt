What is commonplace! Duncan Roy's film is seemingly autobiographical, but there is no flash of emotional truth in this chaotic, ill-acting, and woefully amateur fiasco. In a way, you have to admire the balls of a man who, through grim determination and a very generous benefactor, manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - from a maltreated, working-class boy to a criminal English lord. However, the tone is either so self-pity or so arc that it is impossible to deal with either the character or the plot. The raw material is potentially a great thing, but Roy seems to be unable to tease the kind of story that you should grab your throat and then move you to tears. And it is a mystery why a projection was sometimes performed as a triptych of images - probably because a single image would be too boring. It's also interesting to see so many otherwise good actors - Bill Nighy, Diana Quick, Lindsay Coulson.
