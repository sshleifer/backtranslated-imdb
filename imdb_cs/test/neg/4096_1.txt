I didn't expect any good for this film's abomination. I found out Steve Carell was annoying, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there's no reason why it should be a sequel. This movie was even lower than my expectations, though I had none. Does anyone remember Disney Noah with Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty has ripped him out too many ways to keep the film justified. In fact, Evan Almighty had such a similar drawing as Noah, with the exception of a few technical aspects, it was nothing but a copy of a much better film that was actually FUNNY. Another thing that someone got sick of Wanda Sykes' stupid, indecent, superfluous, one-liners that were literally in every single scene? It was totally ridiculous and the film was getting more and more downloaded. Despite the fact that I basically saw a movie ten years earlier (Noah), Evan Almighty must be the most predictable movie I've ever seen. I came across the movie from start to finish in the first five minutes and finally realized it was Noah left and right. Finally, if you are a little sure if you want to see Evan Almighty, and you're sick of Jonah Hill, who plays the same role in every movie he is in, he liked Bruce Almighty and you don't want to see a predictable, dry, unreal movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey, then please don't see this piece of waste.
