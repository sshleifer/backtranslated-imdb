I give this nonsense 2 instead of 1 because there is a worse show called Haunted Homes. But this child and his friends are being investigated as total idiots. They believe that there are ghosts of how they get, and if they ever find rational explanations behind experience, they must be kicked by drugs and scream in confessions. But besides, the whole show format is incredibly annoying. While many of them seem to be written, college-educated children who make up cast barely speak English, but still insist on trying to use "big" words that they clearly don't understand. And Chief Investigator Ryan is a ridiculously confident voice message to just let me throw a TV through the window. (and all the time stoned). In short, this group makes guys from TAPS to Ghost Hunters as scientists from MIT!
