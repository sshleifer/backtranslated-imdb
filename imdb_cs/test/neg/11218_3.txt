There are actually some good reasons why one should take the risk of being totally crazy by watching this show. Breasts are nice, though some of them aren't so real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on the screen is also a very relaxing experience because it is the perfect place to make it easy and not to worry too much about having a rubber shark eat you. It is always good to remember that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not God, but God. It's not so much about his acting skills because they're none, but his chest does a lot of talking. Also in this series there is no KITT, which is good because Mr. Hasselhoff said in an interview that he always thought KITT was gay. Of course, it might look like an idiot, but given the recent statements he made, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone. In short, this is a kind of show that's totally harmless to people. It gives us a lot of attention and a lot of laughter, which is something that many deliberately humorous shows don't really give us. I must say, it's no wonder Borat fell in love with Pamela Anderson. I enjoy watching the show. No, it's not a great show, actually it's pretty awful, but I like it. It's basically like a B-movie stretched out for ten years.
