Filmed in Senegal, based on Carmen's book Prosper Merimee, this film does not achieve the mere resemblance of a story that has become famous as opera and other films. > <br /> Mrs. Gai as Karmen title is very good to look at. Her fiery dance stinks the screen, just like her movie scene at the beginning of the movie. This is Karmen, whose goal is to please all the sexes but the real Carmen. No! We would like to see Mrs. Gai in other films where her talent is better than here.
