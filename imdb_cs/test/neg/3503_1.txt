I'm impressed that someone likes this movie. I never came out of movies, but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster. white characters are holy and Asian characters are virtually non-existent and worthless to the story. They exist only as surprise objects. other races are much better. twists and turns were ridiculous and predictable. but if you read it, you already know it. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can't even make multicultural movies. do yourself a favor and watch a much more sincere participation in racial relations, Harold and Kumar go to the White Castle!
