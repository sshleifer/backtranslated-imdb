Silly Disney about a college student who accidentally finds a potion that makes things invisible. It's not a bad idea and some special effects are pretty good. However, the script is very bad ... all the flop jokes and acting is crappy. Everyone is trying to be funny and not. A real boring, stupid Disney movie. But it was fun to see Kurt Russell so young.
