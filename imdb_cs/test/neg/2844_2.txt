This was a very short episode that appeared in one of the "Night Gallery" shows in 1971. The episode was played by Sue Lyon (Lolita's film of fame) and Joseph Campanella, who play sitter and vampire respectively. A vampire hires a babysitter to watch his baby (who seems to be a werewolf or a monster) while he goes out for blood at night. Babysitting is absolutely to forget the appearance of a vampire when he first sees him, and when he sees that he has no reflection in the mirror, he has an odd collection of books in his eye on the occult, and when he sees two and two together, he hears strange sounds while the vampire goes talking to the baby. He realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought was originally. He pulls out the door, the vampire comes out and the confused episode ends. I don't know what purpose it was supposed to make such a shortened episode that only lasted 5 minutes. They should simply extend the previous episode by the same 5 minutes and skip this one. Full unnecessary effort.
