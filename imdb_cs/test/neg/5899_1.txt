This film left me so. The tag line was something like "The Girl's Sexual Awakening Story". You can only imagine how disappointed I was. I was seventeen at the time and I married my girlfriend to see it. I thought we'd see a sexy movie that would leave your girlfriend a fight. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I think we just weren't prepared for a deep and meaningful film that required a sophistication that we just didn't have at the time. I'm not so sure I have it now, and long ago I said goodbye to this particular girlfriend (a pity really ... my first love). We left the cinema in the middle of the movie, my friend, who was supposed to know better, stayed on the whole thing. I still have the desired result with my girlfriend, the film didn't help much. It would be interesting to see it again, so that I can make more informed criticism, even though I feel that experience has left me alive.
