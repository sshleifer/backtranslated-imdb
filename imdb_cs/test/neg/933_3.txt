I watched his start on Friday, mid-day, while I was working at my computer at home, relaxing after a hard week and cleaning up some files and responding to some communications. I was interrupted a couple of times, so I had problems with all the details straight away (though it is hardly the work of Hitchcock's proportions, where the detail over the off-kilter story is missing). So during the commercial reading, just read the previous comment here (by "mgconlan-1") and you can largely agree with its details. <br /> <br /> Not quite in the movie category, it's so amazing it's "good" fascinating, but I'd like to grab a tape when it's running again (rather than seeing it as aired) so I can move forward as needed and see the parts that I missed this for the first time. Give her "3 *" because of the attraction of four primary characters.
