The greedy land baron in the small western town of Prairie City wants all ranchers from their country to use intimidation and arson tactics to get them empty; The city seems to be up in oil, and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he is cut by a baron hired cannon. The farmer's sailor's son will come soon, slowly realizing what's wrong and trying to gather the rest of the population to fight. Another story of injustice in the West, with everyone under the thumb of a villain (who naturally holds all the cards). Derivative and sometimes uncomfortable to watch, with a long wait until our stack hero finally gets his pleasure. Sterling Hayden's absolute Swedish accent is a big deal, even if it shortens a strong, sympathetic presence on the screen and it is worthwhile watching the picture. Director Joseph H. Lewis portrays most of the scenes as rigidly as the television western, and Gerald Fried's bug-hard result doesn't help, though Ray Rennahan's rich black-and-white cinematography is excellent. Independent production released through United Artists, the film has a bizarre start (starting with shots from the finals, followed by shots from the center of the movie), yet it has some needling force that will surely get the viewer on Hayden's side. ** of ****
