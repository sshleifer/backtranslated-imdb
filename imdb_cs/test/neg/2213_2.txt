It's amazing to think that this movie came out just one year before Star Wars, but it seems to be a million years behind it in sophistication and special effects. In fact, artistic direction and scenography (a nice Victorian spaceship) are not bad; It is a monster costumes that are most laughing, reminiscent of a "guy in a rubber suit" monsters from the TV show LOST IN SPACE. The evil cave-man make-up reminded me of some of the aliens of ancient repetition of TWILIGHT ZONE. The screenplay is set and outside of the comical relief of Peter Cushing, acting is also unfortunate. This film is only recommended if you really enjoy the bad kitsch SF. And music ... yikes! The terrible 70s are experimenting with synthesizers that don't match the time frame of the movie and sound like someone wandering with Minimoog and a 2-way tape machine.
