Jove, what a rude disaster! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games such as fighting, constant and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive "music" that run on confused victims, big "surprises" (which tend to be like "revelation" as headlines of the National Explorer). Add some delicate camera movements that pretend to be stylish and creative, and you have impressed the crowds. The undeserved popularity of this film strongly suggests that a very low level of pop subculture has been achieved not only in recent decades, but also in the impotent audience's dominant taste. (For a far deeper insight into human suffering under mental illness, without "Oldboy's vulgar excesses, I recommend an older Dutch / French film," disappearing.) Well, don't believe in this movie is nothing good. It really is. (V) The famous scene in which the hero (he is really a "hero", a drunk father who sleeps with his daughter and then tries to get forgetfulness rather than redemption?) She eats a live octopus that benefits from the live presence of the best. actor throughout cast: octopus alone. It is a pity that the poor beast that was eaten could not survive its only act to gain another worthless diploma for the "best actor" at the Cannes festival. Which festival, by the way, between Moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless, somewhat exotic strangeness, has become a vapid and ridiculous festival. <br /> <br /> Transit Sic gloria mundi!
