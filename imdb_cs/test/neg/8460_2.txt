If it was nominated for the screenwriting award of the professional WGA screenwriters association, then it's time to hang up a text editor. Surprisingly ignorant of writing, directing, production, at every level, even for television film. No clich√© in this bad movie. What did they think? Does anyone really believe that children are so stupid that they look at it?
