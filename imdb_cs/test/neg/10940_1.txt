My friend & I rented this movie and we didn't know what was going on in the first 5 minutes. It was like it should be in the first 15 minutes. It was a horrible movie, my little brother could have been a better actor than some in the movie and the plot (if you can call it) was full of holes. I would never recommend this movie to my worst enemy, but someone I really like.
