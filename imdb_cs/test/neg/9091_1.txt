I was rather disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me INSTANT Tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 minutes of the movie. It was fresh, innovative and just ..... different. I prefer to enjoy a movie that is on my face, and I push all those buttons. Tetsuo only did it where he could have a few movies for me. <br /> <br /> For those of us who enjoy the breath of fresh air, those who appreciate the styles that make indie movies are worth it, Testuo II will probably be a debate. If your looking for that visceral "HYPER-KINETIC" feel of the first movie, skip this because it has all been stripped off. Tetsuo II is for some special reason, just a typical Hollywood-style action style. I was quite confused. However, it is still worth it in my opinion for all die-hard Tsukamoto fan.
