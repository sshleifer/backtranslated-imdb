Luchino Visconti has been and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (director of this affair) allows a stronger voice to be Helmut Berger! How can it be? What a missed opportunity! We start from this suffering, knowing that what made Master great and more about things that should not be taken care of at all. Beautiful paintings include Visconti's world, embarrassing conversations with similar Berger and Zeffirelli's small little worlds, Adam Low. Must be avoided!
