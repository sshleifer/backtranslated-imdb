I generally love this type of movie. But this time I wanted to kick the screen. Because I can't do that, I'll complain about it. That was absolutely stupid. Things that happen to dead children are very cold, but living people are absolute idiots. I am a grown man, big enough to defend myself well. However, I wouldn't do half the things a girl does in this movie. Also, the mother in this film is reckless with her children, to the point of neglect. I wish I hadn't been so angry with her and her actions because I would have enjoyed it. What number it was, take my advice and quickly forward everything you see it to the end. Also, someone else is sick of watching movies that are filmed so dark. It is not yet possible to see what is being filmed. As viewers, we are unable to do on-screen activities. So why the hell can't we have night vision?
