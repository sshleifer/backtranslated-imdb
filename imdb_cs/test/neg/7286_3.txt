Hi. I watched the first part when it came out, and I don't remember leaving a bad impression on me like this. First, animation is jerky, wooden, unworked, lacking in naturality - I understand that the drawing style should be some sort of "Atlantic" kind, but it could be done with the usual Disney subtlety ... see " Tarzan "to see what I mean. If I didn't see the DISNEY logo at the beginning, I'd never say it was a Disney movie. Secondly, the plot was more like a PC game style, like a good old assignment. Not that it was wrong, but lacked a story that would connect the viewer with characters and their goals. At least it was unconvincing. The film was designed for children, but it was waaay childish at times. Third, music ... I'd say it was wrong, but it just fits into the whole scene with the graph and animation ... <br /> <br /> Overall, I think It was some kind of amusement, just a by-the-way kind of project of several apprentice apprentices, just to fill the number for Disney movies. I'm sorry to hear from myself, from a great Disney lover ...
