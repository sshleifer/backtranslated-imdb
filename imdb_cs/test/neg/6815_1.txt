Like another reviewer, I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I went with my father, who was the greatest lover and booster of classical music, but neither of us could build this movie. I wouldn't call it a movie. A better description may be the recording of several chamber concerts. As I recall, the camera never moved. I just sat on a tripod for each piece. The only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece, where the film was cut into trees waving in the wind or small ripples on the beach. I'm sure the director would rather use some big wave shots, but the best he found was a few centimeters tall at some nearby lake and again with a stationary camera. Really pathetic. I can't imagine how anyone could justify the rating of this movie over five. When we went out, my father and I were completely mystified about how to make such a bad movie. I don't know of any good movies about Bach. The world really needs it, but just because it doesn't exist, there's no reason to see this. Someone will do it once. In the meantime, just overestimate _Amadeus_.
