I really wanted to love this movie. I read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. The book is amazing. This movie is far from the book. The book is beautiful - this film is a terrible adaptation. Sara is honest, kind, strong in the book and NEVER does anything to get back. This is the point of the book! He acts like a "prince" regardless of circumstances. An important part of behavior as a princess is not to return the harshness. Be honest, no matter how you are treated. The book lasts a lot and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behavior after having witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to grudges and vengeance. Sara does what's right, just because she's right. Outside the bakery, he comes to a beggar who is poorer and hungry than her. He has half a dozen hot rolls. He's very hungry. He gives this wild girl who sits on the threshold of a bakery one bun. When she sees the girl being predatory, looking at her as she absorbs the bun, she gives her another. He continues to do 3 or 4 think - I don't remember how much. The baker is looking through the window. She is so moved by what she has witnessed, takes a girl with a beggar and picks her up as her own daughter. Other people are similarly influenced by Sara. And her father died in the book. The man next door is her father's father - looking for her. Her father did not lose his money - the man is thrilled to find Sarah; he takes her and Becky to his home and picks them up as his daughter. Of course, Sara has her full heritage. Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, he stays in the same job at school. But she is humiliated because Sara told her new guardian of the cruelty she received. Finally, Sara talks to Miss Minchin - Miss Minchin tries to minimize her treatment of Sara and Sarah with a steady stance, instructing Miss Minchin that she was cruel. There's no preparation for Miss Minchin. He continues his miserable existence. It doesn't matter - what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, Becky, is now for all intents and purposes, sister. The book is about love and honesty in the worst circumstances. It's about self-control and humility. It's a beautiful book. This film NEVER captures the real story and the message of the book. My wife was so disgusted that she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to end it. We were not rewarded. I can't think about the reason why a film should change this excellent book in the wrong direction. Maybe it was the effect of the gruesome script from Shirley Temple's book. I don't know - but this film is so far from the book in character and value that I don't recognize it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time - buy a book. It's unforgettable ... even for Dad!
