If you make a tense movie, it's so important that a "villain" is no more sympathetic than a "victim." And it fails miserably. It was so horrible and frustrating to watch that I was actually moved to record and comment. OK, so my husband is rich and polite. There are worse vices, and Cabana boy and woman show a lot. Her husband is a jerk because he disagreed with a boy who physically attacked a woman - a witch who had absolutely nothing to do with the BTW plot. Cabana boy threatens husband and repeatedly tries to seduce woman. Then she imposes on her - a woman who is so hot that she stops thinking about rape and starts to think she wants it. Uh huh. The misogynistic, inferior thoughts the director portrays are just rebellious. It's one thing when a subtle film like American Psycho deliberately tries to get into empathy with a villain, but at Survival Island I felt like watching a movie about Ted Bundy, but the director didn't make him hateful and instead he hated us. victims. What did he think ???
