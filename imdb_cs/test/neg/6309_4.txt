He saw it again last night and said bluntly, "Style instead of substance." We can already guess that Jerry Lee Lewis had to be much more than stated here. Jerry Lee Lewis's character in this film is not portrayed as a real human being for one minute over an hour and a half plus running time, but then all other characters are just one stroke of the pencil out of the total cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> Let's start. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin, Jimmy Swagart sneaking into a black jazz club and we see Jerry inspiring himself. It could be possible. We see two cousins ​​choose different ways in life (also possible). Then we cut Jerry Lee to play the piano as an adult (now playing Dennis Quaid) and it's exciting and a little scary. Cut to the scene where he first meets his second cousin Myrou. From then on, the whole thing turns into a recap of some of the events taking place in a style that fits the high-speed news disc. It's not that the movie isn't a bit fun and it's great to hear the new versions of the songs that Jerry Lee made. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also the reason why you should at least look at it, which is an indicator of his greater success in the coming years. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most distinctive in the film. He teases, sobs, chews gum and plays flirtatious, and that's about it. For a minute, there was no reason why Mrs. Lewis was the third to talk about wives, where are the first two? That is why it really cannot be classified as a bio-based but rather inaccurate newsletter. We see that Jerry got his first song on the radio, we see his second single in the top ten, we see his third go to them. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable fall. There is absolutely no basis in absolute terms. Close Another Minor Quarrel: The film takes place from '56 to '58 and Myra still says "I'm just 13" until the end.
