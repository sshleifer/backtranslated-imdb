Matthew Aldrich. This is a name that deserves a memory. This is an individual who fingers his keyboard and came up with one of the worst scripts of all time. Cliche. Predictable. Insult of public intelligence. <br /> <br /> Is he the only recipient of guilt? Of course not. Renny Harlin took this abysmal apology for the screenplay and made it a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris read it (or not) and decided to play it. Offending abounds. This is Denise Richards from the movie screenplay. There is not enough Razzies in space to properly recognize how truly this horrible writing is. In all loyalty, Samuel Jackson's profession is incredibly new and the way he is presented is very creative. , but at the end of the day it's just ornaments. Nice trimmings. <br /> <br /> Package the way you want - garbage writing is still garbage writing.
