This is the worst movie of all time, no doubt, and Schindler's list, actually had more laughter. That, not only, tells how rude this movie is and how big SL is, given that it is heartbreaking and contains 1 laughter. I wish I could meet "Yahoo Serious" to strangle him personally because of all the other, very, very bad movies he has ever been to. silly fruit. Don't get me wrong people (Mel Gibson) from Australia are great, they brought us Mad Max. It makes me very nauseous that people like this waste, (a review I read said it was, "very funny," scary, not). I personally will boycott this movie and launch an online petition to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious movies to make it so, and I emphasize it, so RETARDED. These are just my personal thoughts, there is no doubt that they are shared by everyone who has seen this film. Note: If you are forced to watch this movie, Watch Orange Style, call me to commit an euthanasia to you for free.
