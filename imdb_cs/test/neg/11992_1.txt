Mr. "Uwe Fail" strikes again, transforming the classic game into a cheap piece of crap. Bad behavior; Bad Direction; Terrible adjustment; Far-Cry was amazing, it was like a real FPS game, cool weapons and lots of points. In the movie we had nothing compared to the game .. Well we had something from "point and shoot" thing, but ... I don't know how to explain it, but if you've ever watched another "Uwe Fail" movie you'll understand. If you do not believe me, go to the "online petition" website and check with one user named "Stop Uwe Bowl". . <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
