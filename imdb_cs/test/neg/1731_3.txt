My summary is about the fact that this movie has 1479 votes - only 21 times to be 100 - 100 lowest rated movies on the website on the infamous IMDb Bottom list. With a lousy score of only 1.8, it would place the movie at approximately between 38 and 46 on the list - talk about a very dubious success !! My score 3 is not that bad - but it brings the film much closer to the dreaded list. When it comes to film, it's once a cute Aaron Carter - yet another finished and forgotten pop star of the 1990s. When he first came on the scene, he was a cute boy with some songs that appealed to preschoolers and tweeners on Radio Disney. His songs, looks and images were all meticulously arranged and created by marketing people and made a trick - which led to huge album sales. Unfortunately, in 2005, sales were in decline and Carter hit his unpleasant stage of life - something all the kids his age had to deal with in the end. To put it bluntly, he's no longer cute in this movie and is in a very difficult phase of life. I suppose he's a wonderful young man ... but in "Popstar" there's no heart that once was. Here, he is just a very normal ... death sentence for a child in his position as a "pop sensation". Interestingly, the movie has some other ex-teen heart-pulsating performances from the last few decades - including roles for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett - two boys who also know what it's like to disappear from reflector. Cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for herself, while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after fame was a bit of a joke. Hopefully Carter will be after Cassidy in the future, and so far, fortunately, he has managed to avoid negative publicity and court appearances by many ex-pop idols. I wasn't very excited about the film, but I really ran over it in this department. It is not his fault that he was plastered over radio and television during his early days until the mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Carter doesn't need to stretch - he plays a pop star. Despite making millions and being adored by girls, she doesn't have "everything". It's thick enough - mainly because it has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that his mother decides not to have him home anymore - which makes him go to public school. The problem is, however, that he's somewhat phobic about doing tests ... and it's difficult to do a class at school. He got the idea of ​​finding a clever girl who had to help at school, of course. She chooses cute but book Jane (Alana Austin) and pretends to like her in a sad attempt to make this program work. although it looks much like a show episode like "Brady Bunch" or Nickelodeon sit-com. Sure, it's predictable, and you know that the formula will mean that it will eventually learn to plot it and get hurt. And finally, she realizes that she is actually cared for by her and at the end of the film everything will be forgiven and they will be a real couple. But due to good conduct and competent leadership, it could be good for his teenage fans because predictability is not always bad. And as it turned out, this ISN'T exactly where the story went ... but it was so close. There are some good things I liked about the movie. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane's grandparents was very nice - their role was pretty sweet and it was good to see them again. The film also featured the 1970s television star Andrew Stevens - it was nice to see him again - even though his part hated me because he looks so great after all these years and I look a little after 45 years! He did a great job and it was nice to see him in the same movie as his mother (Stella). As for Carter, with his many previous experiences on television, he was, not surprisingly, quite good. While his relationship with Jane did not seem believable, he and Mrs. Austin gave it the best. The movie wasn't great, but they tried it and I think most of the film problems were in writing - with a better and less formal plot it could have worked much better. Plus the whole angle of "testophobia" seemed quite resourceful ... and somewhat insignificant. Who cares that a mega-millionaire star gets anxious about school tests? Overall, it is not a rotten film, as it would be a contemporary assessment, although there is not much to attract a wide audience. People who grew up loving Carter will probably enjoy the movie. Older people are likely to take less care, as are really young people who probably have not heard of it. For them, there is no nostalgia in the film. My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett gives Aaron advice. I felt like yelling "don't listen!" but not!
