Charlie (George "Norm" Wendt) and Rhonda ("Just Say" Julie Brown) are a pair of cheerful, murderous aliens who get stuck on Earth and hit a small western town. They become sheriff's deputies and issue a lethal form of justice to speedometers, murderers, and others while getting on the wrong side of some locals (under Wayne Grace). Meanwhile, their sexy extraterrestrial daughter (Anastasia Sakelaris) comes in modest / shiny clothing with her black human husband (Christopher M. Brown) to find them and television reporters and government agents turn up to fill the time. From what I can say, this is a deliberate attempt to cover all possible genres (comedy, sci-fi, horror, western ...) in one movie, and what's stupid, unfair clutter, despite the energetic action from two stars. The script is downright cruel.
