Although I'm a fan of shock and gore, I found this film disappointing to say at least. The effects and puppetry were impressive, yes, and the humor was timed, but ... something was missing. See that the first act of the film is shaped by the emergence of Jack Brooks' nuances, despite the fact that all we need to know about his aggression is given within minutes of the first cover cards. When it comes to narration and many flashbacks: useless. Stimulation during the second act was tiring. Most of them are focused on Freddy Krueger, then on vomiting, then on something else, then on his hands and saying something stupid or gross. All the time, schlock is intermittent with the short scenes of Jack discussing his anger problems with the therapist. (Certainly entertaining scenes in the movie - great dialogue is worth a lot of laughter.) Then, without warning, Jack decides to kill several monsters. And then it's over. All in all, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer, as a return to the 1980s horror movie, has a lot of potential, but it is useless and fits without conflict or appropriate solutions. Hopefully these questions will be resolved before Jack Brooks VII: Jack Goes to Hell or Jack vs. Ash goes into production.
