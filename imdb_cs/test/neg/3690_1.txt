Sit in the cellar with light for an hour and a half. This is probably the same as observing this underground search for the Devil's door. American researcher Owen (Vincent Gallo) travels to Moscow and collects a rescue team seeking his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzii), an archaeologist who disappeared into the catacombs under the capital of Russia. They will be shocked by the discovery of underground inhabitants thriving in the dense and dark complex system of caves and tunnels. Seekers come to the porter from Hell, Andrey (Val Kilmer), and make a deal to continue their business; only to succeed in being almost powerless when they realize they are among the dead. Also in cast: Joaquin de Almedia, Oksana Akinshina, Sage Stallone, Joss Ackland and Julio Perillan.
