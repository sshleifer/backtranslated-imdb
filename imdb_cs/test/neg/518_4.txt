"Submerged" is definitely NOT "the worst movie ever". It has its drawbacks, such as borrowed shots, crazy scenarios and non-existent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some good points. Acting is surprisingly good, there are a lot of familiar faces you probably know if you're a fan of b-movie like me. I was very pleased to have Brent Huff played one of the heroes, knowing him mainly for his 80th action movies, and I have to admit he's not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield and Tim Thomerson get some limited time on the screen, but they are believable in their parts. "Eye candy" in this Fred Olen Ray movie is Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both look very sexy and very average. Michael Bailey Smith adds background muscles like Navy SEAL. Unfortunately, the only member that (in my opinion) is completely out of place is Coolio. They are not at all, interviews as if they did not even read the script, and that they are a badge at the beginning of the film, they are shot as wimp an hour later. It's not a good choice. <br /> <br /> To sum up this movie - it's not such a bad choice for late night entertainment. If you can get through the special effects (so many weapons, so much fire, not a single shot to anyone), the awkward performance of Coolia and recycled shots from airport 77, you might like it.
