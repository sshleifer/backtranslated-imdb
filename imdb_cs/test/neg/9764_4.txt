Since MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that doesn't really have a solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set on a "remote Greek island", this is a very exciting Michael Caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who come to mind the game with a local wacko / mystery man Anthony Quinn and his friend Daffy Candice Bergen. Quinn, looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and a striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good, but Caine seems to be ready to explode. Bergen, although overwhelming, should not put on the British accent EVER. She's not very good at this type. Guy Green is fine, but if you don't have endless patience with the circular logic of the movie, you won't enjoy it. A real sour note is the casting of Anne Karina's sparkling in the utterly helpless role of Caine's girlfriend. After seeing her on WOMEN'S WOMAN'S WOMAN'S APART, her presence here is very unpleasant.
