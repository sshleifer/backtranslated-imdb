Although I enjoyed something like The SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA (1974), I knew I shouldn't expect too much from my even more pretended predecessor! Certainly the smallest of Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn on Audio Commentary for CREEPING FLESH [1973] even goes so far as to call him a nadir of the studio!), The film really flounders because of its utter unhip - and now embarrassedly dated - updating the myth (today's settings in fact rather, it is SATANIC RITES rather better ... ... even though it is true, it is still much more appropriate to like it as Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! Despite the fact that Christopher Lee penetrated into the film, he still unmistakably reminds the character as an undead vampire (though he seems very small and inexplicably limited to one setting); Similarly, Peter Cushing delivers his usual performance. The only other remarkable actress in the film is that given by Christopher Neame (son of Ronald) as Johnny Alucard (!) - even though it's just because it's incredibly shocking! Unfortunately, the two best-known female cast members (both horror) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - cannot stand above their physical qualities. Working with the camera is from Dick Bush (who shot BLOOD at SATAN'S CLAW [1971] and for Hammer when DINOSAURS DRIVED THE COUNTRY [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but perhaps best known for his longtime connection with Ken Russell) who manages some pleasant atmosphere all the time, especially in three key sequences: a coach ride on a (right Gothic) start; the Black Mass hysterical sequence, followed by Dracula's resuscitation; and the final confrontation between Lee and Cushing Van Helsing.
