Today I had a real desire for a sci-fi film so I decided to look at the Battlespace. Unfortunately, this was one of my biggest mistakes this year. I see that director, Neil Johnson, has directed more than 500 music videos, and I suggest he come back. Music videos are a very good form of entertainment, and not everyone can make it short by making movies. The worst part of this movie is probably a voice. And that says a lot because special effects are sometimes scary. The voice over didn't work in Blade Runner and it doesn't work here. The first lesson is spent watching the main character walking through the desert while her daughter tells the story. I think the story could make a great movie, but not like that. The second worst part is the effects. They're just bad and they don't connect with the rest of the picture at all, so you just don't believe in them. And absolutely all the pictures in the movie were filtered, not in a good way. The filtering used as the effect is good. 90 minutes, bad. <br /> <br /> And what is it with all the gadgets that are still talking and not closing!?!? If I used such technology, I would be angry. I just waited for the guns to sound, "I'm so sorry, but it seems I'm out of ammunition." No, stay away. This film is not worth the time.
