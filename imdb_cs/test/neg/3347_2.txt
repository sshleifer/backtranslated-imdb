I must, in light of enquia praise for this movie from viewers, assume again the role of turd in the punchbowl, as Lowell Weicker said, I scratch my head on the sheer number of commendations. "The African Queen" is not this. The period taste is amazing, yes. Acting is fine, but no actor no matter how big it can bring life to a seemingly endless stream of perfectly boring and insignificant parties and dinner conversation here, and I'm glad how much of it is taken from Joyce's text. Imagine spending an hour and a half like a fly on a wall at a Christmas dinner of an extremely interesting group of people (I don't know it's a family as one person suggested) when they had to listen to their secular table. and you have a basic experience with this movie. Nothing happens absolutely. And nothing important is said, but it is said to be infinitely long. As I said, the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me. Speaking of mysteries, you prefer rather than this.
