I'll start by saying there's no reason to watch this movie. I just sat down because I was trying to kill some time before I went to work. Basically it's your typical sophomoric "comedy" focused on a teenage set. There is nothing remarkable about this, except for the utter ridicule of the story, not to mention that there are conspiracy holes that are big enough to sail on the Carnival cruise ship. Obviously this is not supposed to be a realistic movie, it should be funny. Sadly, it usually fails in this number. I have to admit, I laughed a few times, but mainly in "holy sh * t, I can't believe how stupid this kind of trip is." <br /> <br /> If you never see this movie, nothing is missing.
