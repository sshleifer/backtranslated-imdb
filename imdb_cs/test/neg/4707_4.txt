I just watched Goliath waiting to order from my library. I remembered it vaguely years ago and wanted to watch it with my son. By the way, the film was less than 2 hours old and I thought it was much longer when I first saw it. In the back of the VHS box, it is stated that Goliath "empties a Nazi set whose secret can forever destroy the free world". Divers were reportedly on a hidden mission to get a demonic document. There was nothing to say about getting this document. It is also stated in the box that "the voracious boiler on the ship is powered by human blood." That would make it horror and there was nothing in the movie. I can't remember the details when I was watching TV years ago ... but could the back of the box really be true? Maybe the 3 hour movie revealed more details ??? Just wondering if anyone knows anything about it.
