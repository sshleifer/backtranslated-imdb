It's a little hard to believe that it comes from the same director HELLRAISER gave us. Where is style, premonition and magic? HELLRAISER is not a big horror movie, but at least something. NIGHTBREED is like a big ball of bad ideas made poorly. There is a problem with subtlety since opening: monsters are shown in the first frame! The opening dream sequence shows too long. Our hero doesn't show professional acting skills (but nobody expected this bastard genre). There are killings that one wish was more interesting. Then we have David Cronenberg. The man should never have been an actor. It fills the role of a horrible psychiatrist adequately, but what he was supposed to do was move behind the camera and save the disaster. Then we come to Midian, a haunted, fake cemetery with a fake gate. It is not a huge improvement at the Cemetery in PLAN 9 FROM THE EXTERNAL SPACE. It's worse when we meet creatures in it. There is nothing really wrong with the character design and makeup effects here (well ... except for a guy without a scalp, a guy with a pointed chin and forehead, and a fat guy with dark circles around his eyes), the problem is the way they act, and terrible dialogue that is given to them. Barker's photograph of the underground city is tired and this part of the story could have been done much better. Some may say what follows SPOILERS. After our hero dies and becomes a "nightmare", we wait to see what he turns to (we talk about things that fly and werewolves), but when the time comes to change, they thought their hero he's too handsome, a decent creature design. With a turn in the "Cronenberg" character, the story becomes less interesting until the battle of the madmen vs. the freaks. standards (which is simply wrong). Barker's mythology has failed here. There is no genius and little originality behind any of NIGHTBREED's. The picture could use a larger budget, a serious script, and a character design that won't let you say "oh ... oh, lame." What a shame. It's not scary, not cold or very dark, just weak.
