Finally a boring mysterious thriller that can sound pretty sound theoretically, but it plays very badly. The ridiculous scenario is full of (MINOR SPOILER) people who die and then return to life when the plot requires it, and the director doesn't seem to be able to handle any kind of energy and tension. The sequence that "explains" this species is the only memorable film in this tedious cinematography. (* 1/2)
