A nun is a vengeance where a very strict nun is killed by rebellious trailers and returns a few years later, even though adults now attend their old school. The story line is predictable in the grooves and is not surprising, as it slowly turns to the end. It's a movie screamer with a clear acting and a below average scenario and scenario. Much of the special effects are low and there is almost no credibility in the final battle. However, if you look around these there is some tension and acting jewelry. If you like senseless cookie cutter screamers, you will like it, otherwise you should go through.
