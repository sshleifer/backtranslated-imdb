Poor Jane Austen. This production dog does not make her fabulous tongue in the face of the novel any justice. Getting started on top ... badly adapted. The screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying - think about it, I don't know what she was trying to do, but it was enough to say that the brand was flying light years! A couple that, with all the exorbitant and terrible production values, is one adaptation that should never happen. It would be much better if they just put all the money they poured into this flop and donate it to a dignified charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. It is almost certain that you will enjoy a thousand times more than trying to sit in this unbearable production!
