Our Story: Two US Navy deep divers are looking for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the Philippine coast. Our proof: Extremely boring fun at its best, without a plot in sight. Jim Brown is completely unnecessary, assuming his help in making this war of the 70th War Turkey. Richard Jaeckel is in his usual form. Don Cornelius and Richard Pryor are among those who thank for their contributions! BOMBS AWAY !!!
