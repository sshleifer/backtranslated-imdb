Only three words are really necessary for this review: A piece of crap. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed watching a cartoon like a child, you'll find that this movie is a complete waste of time and money. The best on your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet on the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they use all names and phrases. Uniform dog name "Shoeshine" (in reference to the dog being "Shoeshine Boy" in the cartoon). They call Polly's love interest, but she's not Miss Sweet Polly Purebred. <br /> <br /> My wife and son have been dying to see it. They should drug me to see it. The original Underdog was voiced by Wally Cox, the ultimate nerd. This one is expressed by someone who has a "clever teenage assertion who knows more than all adults". It is horrible as a separate movie. It is even worse as a tribute to Underdog. It's not an honor. It's not a story telling. It's not a story update. It is purely an attempt to pay a well-known title and create merchandising. The next time I go to the store, I'm afraid I'll see the Underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothes, etc. McDonalds and Burger King seem to have fought for baby food. But the worst part of this movie is the soundtrack. COMPLETE THE SONG ON THE RAP INDIVIDUAL (read with silent "C" at the beginning)! Great, now, if we destroy anything, let's go all the way. <br /> <br /> I knew it was probably bad before I went. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local plexus and found out that they had opened it the first day and first appeared in their smallest auditorium (and one out of four without stadium seats). Even the theatricalists knew it would be waste! Save money on tickets and invest them better by going out and buying an original DVD series. It will be more fun and have better production values.
