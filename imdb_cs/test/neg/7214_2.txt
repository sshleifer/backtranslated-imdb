A man stops making sequels great movies. The original was a great movie that was over the top with matches, sex, and one of the best characters that adorned the screen in the 90s. The story is believable, as if it were your bars in the outcrops of the south that you would know. But here comes this piece of junk Roadhouse 2 Last Challenge. It only allows you to hope that they are reputable with the title and never create another Roadhouse again. He doesn't have the magic of the original characters, nor the story really believable. The story is more like an action like Steven Segal that even though Roadhouse 2 is movie B, it still doesn't click because some movie B action is still selling the movie no matter how cheesy it is. The only reason you can't buy this movie is that we finally find out that one question is from the original Roadhouse. Patrick Swayze Dalton's character is Dalton's name or surname? Well, I'll save you $ 4.00 per rental. Dalton is his first name as in Dalton Tanner. NEVER USE OTHER ROADHOUSE !!!!!!!!!!!
