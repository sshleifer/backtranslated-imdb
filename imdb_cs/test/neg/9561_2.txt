Not as bad as "Billy Bathgate" but close. Warren Beatty just couldn't believe it as Bugsy. Whenever he jumped, instead of shocking him, I found it embarrassing because it was so fake. Other actors also have no prize. Annette Bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women. As many have noticed, Joe Mantegna would have been better off if George Raft had considered him more credible. Only Harvey Keitel appeared unscathed, but then this guy can do these movies in his sleep. And Robert Beltran, with one line, steals one of the great Beatty, Bening scenes. With these movies, I'm never sure whether the director is focused on making gangsters look like normal businessmen, or if it just comes out this way. Either way, I don't like it. These guys were murderers, and no matter how much Las Vegas is obliged to Bugsy Siegl, I don't think the movie should be celebrated, especially one that has great studio support.
