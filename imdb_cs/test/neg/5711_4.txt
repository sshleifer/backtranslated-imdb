Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke play in this controversial wall street exec and art gallery staff who are joining and starting a very experimental sexual relationship. While the acting of Rourke and Basinger is all right, flim doesn't allow their characters to actually. Reportedly there was a lot of film left on the floor of the cutting room that sank deeper into the characters and the effects of the relationship on them - Basinger's nature is considering suicide - that would make the characters more involved for the viewer. Just as shiny, well-made, with MTV-style soft core voyeurism. 4 out of 10
