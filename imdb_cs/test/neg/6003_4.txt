If I didn't know anything better, I would think the Resurrection was done in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the crap sold as a movie in Hollywood. I do not understand why people like Christopher Lambert. He speaks as if he was reading the starting cards and turning into a fountain whenever he had to give emotions. It was the weakest aspect of the film. The other actors were fine, nothing terrible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to see where most of the budget went: special effects. The murders look quite professional, but they barely cope with the film's numbness. I wouldn't want to go so far as to say that Resurrection is a copy of Se7en, but it certainly has some resemblance to it. Centered on a modern-day crusade-based murderer, detectives investigating his work must rely on biblical passages and Christian history to kill the killer puzzle together. However, the resurrection is deprived of the clever story of Se7en, cinematography, playing ... well, all that is good. Instead, resurrection lies on the audience and uses the Scooby Doo method to surprise the secret. Finally, the resurrection was about as bad as I expected it to be. I almost feel bad about criticizing this movie because I knew it would be bad, but ... sue me.
