I would call this show horrible if it wasn't because it's in the same network as Arrested Development. Because it is on FOX and is refreshed when AD is canceled. It's totally out of the question how terrible this show is. But let me describe it. Take the exceptionally low Archie Bunker rate and let him pour out the humor that would be outdated if it were on Married with the kids. Then take the large plots from AD (the son has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and dumb's down so the idiots watching the sitcom understand them. If you watch it, I will have totally lost respect for you, just like your family. However, if you are a fan, you should love the new comedy FOX 'Til Death. It looks like real funny, top things. Married couples who don't come out ... brilliant.
