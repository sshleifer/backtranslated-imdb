I made a review for the director's fictional recreation about BTK. I also saw this movie and it was horrible. Please save money and time. This film was terrible and this director is unreal. I don't understand how he finances these films. They're terrible. I decided to make sure I checked who the writer, director and producer was, and if the director's name appeared, I wouldn't waste money. There is nothing worse than renting a movie on Friday night, making popcorn, and then realizing that you have been deceived by creative art on the front of the movie box. Keep away. So I think I should do some things to fill the lines? I've always checked the IMDb for reviews, but I don't think I will. It is ridiculous. I've been fixed too many times in my reviews. Lack of lines? You can cancel my account. Your site is a pain.
