The concept of this movie was pretty good. But some execution has failed on many parts. There are not a lot of horror movies to remember that used dolls looked so realistic. Especially when these dolls start blinking their eyes or moving their hands. With this assumption it was possible to do so much. There were lots of scenes where there was room for tension and tension. And I was really expecting to become scary things. But the movie has never been scary. One of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable. Actually, I thought they did it deliberately to surprise us with some wonderful twist. Unfortunately, this will not happen. Well, at least not as I hoped. The cast also failed to make everything believable. It would be nice if there were more backgrounds on the characters. Initially, when we introduce ourselves to the main character. She and other characters seem to be invited by an artist. However, it is also clear that they have no idea what they are invited to. This is, of course, part of the secret. But it seems unlikely. If I got an invitation without knowing what the deal was, I'd just not go. In addition, most characters are not really likeable with the end result that you never care about them. Another mistake is that the director deviates from the basic premise, which is quite scary and brings new elements that are never explained and not relevant to the "doll's secret". Overall, this film was a great disappointment for me. If you want to see a good horror movie with dolls, check out "Dead Silence"!
