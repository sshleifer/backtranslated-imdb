"Committed", as in Heather Graham, who were ordered to rescue their spouse, and then ordered the psychiatric ward not to do what: smart, clever use of words. One of those absurd lusty-to-be philosophical films in which narration is a series of oh-so wise observations that throw on poetry (90s chique club-poetry, better known as "chit-chique poetry") . It's so-no-sais-quoi ... He wrote / directed (or "missed") a woman (Lisa Krueger, whoever you are) is a nonsensical, lethargically driven road-movie full of new Age Spiritual Nonsense and the characters to be interesting but are only seen before or just plain boring. Latino in this film, as part of a poor urban minority, is typically celebrated in all their mystic-obsessed primitivism as "spiritually superior" people, which is "highlighting" this film's political accuracy. The whole matter is lifeless and ceases to be such that occasional good members appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). On the other hand, we have Casey Affleck, who is one of the best examples of why protectionism is at the same level as first-degree murder as a crime. I rarely saw a more apathetic "actor"; a thin, ugly fool who walks through his lines in a sleepy way, almost as if pursuing them in half-up quasi-dream, plus the faint voice, one of the weakest male voices I've ever heard in my life. (He had to go to the Tobey Maguire Lethargy School of Acting.) To throw this idiot into ANY, he talks about every movie, ie about every director or producer. That's why Lisa Krueger is a talented waste of space. We also got the Moron who had a leading role in MST3K-spoofed "Werewolf"; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. Look at his ridiculous accent and stupid speech.
