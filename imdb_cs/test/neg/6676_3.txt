Contrary to what one reviewer said, it is NOT Magnum Force's relief. On that one Lieutenant Hal Holbrook, he assembled his own small team of academic novices to send repeated offenders. In extreme justice, this operation has sanctions from higher LAPD values. How far the sanctioned methods are used is a question. This special investigation group seems to be a haven for LAPD misfits, those who have forgotten their first duty is protection and service. That's why Scott Glenn thinks Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective with more than his beef share in internal affairs, for excessive use of power, is perfect for the team. What should he send him out of Phillips? is the fact that he has a nice living relationship with a reporter, Chelsea Field. That certainly threw me into this movie, you think Lou would be the last one he would try to hire for his team. And what his team is is the death team. They focus on the offenders and follow them. Then it's a season open. Extreme justice has overcome it in an effort to make a point. It certainly wouldn't hurt to wait for a gang of bank robbers to complete the robbery and take them out. When Coffeyville citizens did with Daltons, no civilian was injured. Or wait for three rapists to finish the job before they move in. That's what they believed in here. And frankly, I couldn't buy it. A lot of good players are really wasted in this game.
