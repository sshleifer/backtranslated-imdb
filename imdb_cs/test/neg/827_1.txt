I have no idea why I followed Ali G Indahouse except that Salon thought he thought the crime was committed by not suggesting Sacha Baron Cohen for Emmy for his work at Da Ali G Show. It's a bet that I will never watch this show because there was nothing fun about the movie. Comedy? Torture was more similar. It was just the stupidest thing I watched. I confess that I was intrigued by Rhon Mitra. I didn't see her in anything. By the time I was watching, she wasn't at The Practice, so I think I'll have to check Boston Legal, one of these evenings to see how he's doing something worth watching.
