I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I remember the most frightening scene a great bird ate men helplessly hanging from parachutes out of the air. Horror. Terror. As a young guy leaving for these cheesy B movies on Saturday afternoon, I'm still tired of recipes for these movies that usually contained a hero, a beautiful woman who could be a professor's daughter and a happy decision when the monster finally died. I didn't care much about the romantic angle as a 12-year-old and predictable plot. I love them now for unintentional humor. But about a year later I saw Psycho when he came out and loved the star, Janet Leigh, being repulsed at the beginning of the movie. . I sat down and noticed the moment. Since screenwriters form a story to make it as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.
