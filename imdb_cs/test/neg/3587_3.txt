We saw a similar story: Married wife (plays Nastassja Kinski) is engaged in sex with a stranger (William Baldwin) and then wants to return to life with her husband and girl. When he returns home, he finds out that her husband has finally found a job. Everything seems clear. However, Kinski discovers that her husband's new boss is actually a stranger who still shows interest in her and seems to do something to get what he wants. What to do? Don't you say anything? I didn't like the movie. Although it was not just bad, he obviously lacked "something". Maybe she should focus more on what's going on inside Kinski's head. She doesn't say anything about the actors themselves (I think Baldwin was a good choice for the role of an obsessed boss), but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical, acting as you would see the characters who play in your daily TV movies. Finally, the end completely destroyed what might be an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film tried to look great, had a little shaky cameraman here and there, some photos, quick cuts and glamor, but at the end I think it fits better. The same goes for music. Otherwise, it didn't look so bad. Some might like it, but it wasn't my cup of tea. To be fair, I usually do not observe such thrillers. This one felt too long, even if it was only an hour and a half, I think it might work better as an hour episode in some TV series. There was no need for some scenes, especially the show scene. <br /> <br /> My advice: Try before you buy!
