When I first watched the Enterprise, as we all had no doubt about all the shows, I went into it with an open mind, enjoying half of Star Trek's past effort and not liking the other half. Business is short, but this "A Night In Sickbay" episode has seriously questioned me why I bothered myself on Monday night sci fi. Masking an Idea to Be One of Those 'And Day In The Life Episodes, in which we learn about what makes certain characters acting like humanoids, seemed to have forgotten that was to be a starship ship, not Ricardoes and Mertzes. The planet, especially the one whose people were previously insulted by the crew of the Enterprise (for eating in public), was not a place for a dog. As an animal lover, I'd never have taken one of my pets into an environment that has proven tense in the past. But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows, constantly depicting things that are sacred and offensive to other cultures, while tho they offer some insight into American religious fanatics. Foreigners were now offended when a dog urinated on a sacred tree, but aliens were quite able to take the dog to urinate as an insult. Strange how dog urination was not considered some form of worship. I wonder how he got from the show's writers. From here we are exposed to a captain who has misled his duties. While watching the episode, I found it very easy to forget that Bakula was to be the captain of the ship. He decided to sleep in a hospital and from there we get more inanities of behavior (sigh) that we shouldn't understand, and that makes us furrow an eyebrow. The doctor's non-chalantly clips long, furry toenails and feeds them to hungry animals in the cage. Ewwwwww! Then the white bat creatures run away. Oh, how does anyone sleep with everything that happens! Nail trimming for a loud call! I waited for something to feed on the vomiting to be presented. Then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with T'pol, and that maybe he was disguising these feelings with his interest in the dog. <br /> <br /> Endless waste. <br /> <br /> "Your dog is sick, so go have sex. And the captain, of course, had to apologize, and we humans had to consider his apology to be absolutely ridiculous because we were so (all smiling very sarcastically) anxiously! I saw a picture like this infinitely droned on TNG. Oddly enough, the only thing that was missing from this scary episode was the path that offered its smirks and downhome boyisms. with a stupid dog. Oh, the dog survived, so now go play fetch.
