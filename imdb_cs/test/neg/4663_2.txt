The deal was terrible. Special effects, exceptional, dominated the film. Writing was pathetic and dialogue was incredible. And the stupid little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was there. The worst offense of "Armageddon" was the total lack of scientific reality. "The asteroid has the size of Texas," says Billy Bob Thornton. Er, that's 800 miles wide! Nobody at NASA even sees an asteroid until a meteor shower breaks in New York? Suuuuure. NASA hires a drilling team to join the astronauts and train them in a week? Yeah, right. Someone will bring them a gun on the shuttle? Yeah, that's realistic. And Bruce Willis blows up an asteroid three seconds to spare him. How Disney-esque! <br /> <br /> How bad was this movie? I took the asteroid!
