This is one of those religious horror movies that never explain why "evil" forces are 10,000 times stronger than "good" forces. Here we have a satanic cult that can: 1) "tear out" people (like in "Star Trek"), 2) kill through small baby dolls, 3) convert soul from one body to another, 4) telepathically hypnotize from a greater distance and 5 ) cause drastic car accidents in which selected persons turn into spaghetti while others (children in this case survive unscathed). On the other hand, the power of "good" can: 1) sit helpless, 2) stand around clueless, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time doing nothing, 6) to read comics while people are beaten by dozens, and 7) to come too late to satanic rituals. <br /> <br /> In every religious horror movie I have to assume that the world of film is inhabited by God and Satan. it can't be 1,000,000 times stronger if the film doesn't have a world order reminiscent of the film Hell, in other words, where the priests were in this movie who knew something, the best thing a priest could do is argue that there are some witches about - nothing else - from reading all those books in his study, at first glance, this priest becomes a catatonic, then he laughs hysterically just to complete a great panic attack, so is it to be God's contribution to the fight against Satan? Every good religious horror film has the power of "good" equipped with some form of (more or less) supernatural power, or at least some concrete knowledge of how to fight "evil." In this sense, this film is quite idiotic. Just like casting Martin's crumb to play the highest priest! There is a very small threat or horror in observing the quirky Martin lead Satanic ritual. Didn't it have to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but couldn't they find someone less fun? Also why does the couple return to the city after their car is out of service? After their "friendly" meeting with the city people, no sensible person would return; they should go on. The explanation of a man to his girlfriend (and the viewer) is "who knows what's in this direction".
