This movie made me so angry! Here I mean here is a new horror, one w / sense of intelligence and then the movie begins. On scenery, on line delivery, on costumes, on false gore, do I have to go on? There are porn movies with a better dialogue than this. I understand the concept behind independent movies, but my goodness, it wasn't just indie it was the news of college books shot w / camcorders & cast are all friends and relatives. That's one movie that has been condemned since the beginning. Maybe if it were in 1982 instead of the new millennium, this movie could fly. But it seems to me that somebody around the neck of an albatross hung on a rock and fell at a constant rate.
