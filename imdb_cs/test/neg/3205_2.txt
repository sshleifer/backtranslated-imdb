This is a disgrace to the name of all the cute and laughing sagas. Why writers feel the need to make the film unbearable to follow all quality standards. Critters are cute and adorable as ever, but deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a killer child. They are not as scary, fearsome, some, what spine-funny and funny as they were shown in movies before. I once loved their porcupine footage, but now it's hidden as if it was considered repetitive and boring. And what about the murder and don't eat. I thought this movie would be fine, but everything was so bad. Why did Ug have to be evil and killed by what's known as Charlie. This movie annoys me. Shame! Shame! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
