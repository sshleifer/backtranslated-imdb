Warner Brothers' social responsibility in its most vulnerable attitude, with every five minutes of preaching, or so, as we are Americans, we do not escape problems, we face our responsibility. It also suggests that if you are willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from brightly deadly gangsters, you are un-American. Walter Huston, looking bored, is a frustrated DA, and the "average American family" includes such familiar faces as Sally Blane (looking much like her sister, Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore, as allegedly an adorable moppet. Both are regularly crowded with the Chic Sale frame, but only 47 then play the octogenic Civil War veteran, jump hard and "amused" to bump Prohibition Hooch and moralize how we're Americans, dag charge. His St. Vitus Dance old-coot performance is a tedious schtick; it is like Walter Brennan, who founded his entire career on it. William Wellman, like his former "Public Enemy," manages effectively and quickly, but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after a happy fadeout.
