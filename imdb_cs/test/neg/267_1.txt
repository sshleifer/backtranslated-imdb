What can I say about the twelve ocean? Who thought this would ever happen? A huge mess that gets lost halfway and can't go back. I found myself amazed at how bad it really was. Really! I have never seen the end properly because this film is simply unbearable. I am a huge fan first, but this is a lame excuse to continue. What was the purpose of the robbery if they returned the money? The movie is just boring and so drag that I can never sit over it. It's really bad. Stay so far, repeat, away from this movie. It's worthless.
