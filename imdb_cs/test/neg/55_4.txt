I thought maybe ... maybe it would be good. Early Re-Animator Appearance (Jeffery Combs); many honors to old horror movies; label Troma on the front? This movie could be a gem! I thought wrong. Frightmare is a boring, exaggerated, half-assisted tribute to horror movies. The story is old, young people who broke into the house, drunk, loved and manipulated things that should not be manipulated. Oft ?? the recycled film slasher film is used here, this time with the idea of ​​being a dead actor named Conrad Radzoff to do killing. In fact, the performance of Radzoff's actor Ferda Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. Makes snooty style Dracula style very well. But when it comes to kids, it's not that good, with only a minimal amount of Combs. <br /> <br /> The film lacks the fun value and offers only one great character and one or two scenes that can keep your attention. I do not recommend this movie if you are not desperate for something you are watching, and this is the only movie that has remained on the blockbuster.
