It is easy to say, soon in this film exactly what happens and who will die. It's about 4 women and a man on vacation. This was done during the end of the ultra Nazi 1970s, when blonde women were probably ultra American survivors and brunettes were all worthy of death. This film, like others of that time, disputes bring this and the viewer knows it. There is no secret or tension. People argue, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of that time, it's ridiculous. Five people go on two wild young characters and go nuts. Everyone is a nut, so the director and writer team can justify their Nazi propaganda. For some reason, this guy is attracted to the blonde he doesn't really look at and ignores the super hot looking brunette that every heterosexual man goes over. It should be noted that in the 1970s, films were intended to appeal to women and not men. Totally bullshit and utterly depressing.
