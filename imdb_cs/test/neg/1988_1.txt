The premise of this film is ugghhhh. The guy is married and yet everyone in this place seems to think, "Yeah, this is a funny, cute and good movie." What the hell?!?! What is funny about immature girls who have mercy on a married man with a new child? What's cute about cheating on his wife? What was wrong when they found some teenage boys to have sex before college? Noooo, that's not good enough, this guy has to be married, off-limit, off-the-market, that's what we have to have. Dumb-ass GIRLS! Then one of the girls decides he "loves" the guy. No, he just "loves" the way he feels. Two of the girls enjoy it, they think it's funny and none of them have any moral problems with what they do. It's just shameless, but yeah, that's all good with each of these websites. The dark-haired girl has the audacity to have her dad pick her up from the boys' house, under the horror of babysitting. Is it a morally disgusting movie and where is the woman? Poor woman working and paying bills while he screwing a nanny.
