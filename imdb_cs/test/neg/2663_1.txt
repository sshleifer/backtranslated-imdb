A friend gave me this movie because she liked it. I decided to finally watch it. It was sooooooo long. I waited for the tension to happen, but he never did. After the opening scenes, I waited for something to happen and never did. I stopped the movie and came back later. In fact, I forced myself to watch the rest, hoping it would be better. It was worse. I kept asking who these people are? Do they have feelings? are they just robots? I'm glad I didn't pay to see or pay. The end would be better if the Dutchman died of a gunshot wound. At least we should get some emotions from the audience. Or maybe not.
