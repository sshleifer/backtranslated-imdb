Terrible mish mash predictable story lines and to-bendingly poor released PC cliche ad nauseam (races work together, heroine is clever as pretty, guy sacrifice himself to save another life, father / daughter relationship etc etc). The film looks like something made for network television and should have been there. Even a talented Tommy Lee Jones can't save this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time on this film ruin since the Hollywood movies moved to Hollywood. These two stars are given solely to CGI people and people's PR skills. Get even one movie-goer to sit over it.
