See who the good guys are. Union. And who are evil, a rich man who steals choices and a spoiled son. The creator forces us to see good before evil. All characters hate bad guys, so when you watch a movie, it can help us hate the bad guys. This is the worst kind of movie making - manipulative and childish. The plot focuses on a cop who is between good and evil and stuck in this ugly movie. It's boring and meaningless. Keach's story is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, ran over to the handle, playing a guy nobody likes and who we shouldn't like. It takes a long time for this bore to take off and the title to take hold; then, when it takes off, it crashes a minute later. Boring. One of the worst movies ever made.
