The story of Macbeth was one of the most successful Shakespeare ever written. This may be due to some features that place it close to the slasher genre, murder, murder, kill, kill, gallons of blood, strained sexual relationship between major characters etc. More than this, the original game is very appealing to take into account the length (it's only half the size of Hamlet) and the focus on Macbeth, for which we are forced to look after his bloody nature. The game would prove to be ideal for setting up a movie. It is not that lengthy that it gives directors the opportunity to explore many levels, a good actor can play a role in his life, the film has a profound meaning in every historical period. Unfortunately, this was not the case with Macbeth. Polanski's version comes quite close, but insists on an excessive medieval period. Welles' film is too personal, with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism, 1990 or so the TV version is too shallow. This 2006 film is no exception. It's far from Shakespeare's film, but it's interesting to see the director understand the story and place it in contemporary life. No knights in shiny armor, but gangsters in shiny cars. Lots of drugs and trippy music replace the fear of the night in the original game. The idea of ​​Macbeth is so simple that you can take it and implant it in modern life. The worst part of the film are the lines. Most of the engaging scenes of the game, such as the dagger scene, are trimmed so much that they seem unnecessary. Replacing the gossip in the door with bells and horses with cars seems fun. If they wanted to make a film about power and temptation, they could easily do it without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems looser with a brain injury, not a brave warrior, brave and ambitious who wants so much that he is willing to kill and who finds himself in a network of fear and despair. The film does not make it clear what drives Lady Macbeth crazy, doesn't give a reason why some characters should fear Macbeth and his "terror" (because there is no hereditary ascension to the throne that has no throne and everything) and places Macbeth in an uncomfortable position because gang management is as far from kingship as this whole movie is far from Shakespeare. Finally, we have two layered thoughts that never come across as a film that is ultimately pointless.
