When Kristy Swanson attacks the culprits about what she's doing, she wants to go out. Unfortunately, Madsen is her direct superior in a company where "giving two weeks notice is not an option." As a teen killing vampire, Kristy did a very good job. The girl in the valley seemed to fit. But as a murderer on the run ... well, go Kristy. Run, go far! This movie is not a concept that was not done before, but it was done better! <br /> <br /> I didn't want to watch the rest of this movie, but I felt I should if I wanted to check this movie. I always liked Madsen and his character was a bit predictable, but this movie was definitely a waste of time to watch, so do ... no wonder it never got theatrical!
