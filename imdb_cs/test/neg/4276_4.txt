The whole exercise is useless. Why make a movie at all? Light is terrible, but the sound is just a joke. As a high school production. Anyone who has made a budget for this film should be stretched and arranged so that it can be created without the proper budget for the sound system with equipment suitable for recording. lack of microphone proximity. The economy should be implemented on any other area. All production is lifeless and only LAME with such amateur semi-average production. He lacks warmth, clarity and no design.
