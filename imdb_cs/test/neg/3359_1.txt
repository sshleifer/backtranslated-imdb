Talk about waste! I can't think of one good thing in this movie. The scenario was bad, the acting was terrible and its effects were not good. I can't believe the writer of this movie did Identity, everything in this movie made me can't finish. <br /> <br /> The front of the video box shows a showman with shark-like teeth and scary eyes. It looks like a scary villain, but just like the old saying "never judge a book by your cover", the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out. One part of the movie that the girl kills with salad tongs is terrible. This setting was pretty bad, as if they could set up the whole thing in Lapland, but not a tropical island instead. I took this film as a spoof, which I think it should be. The only thing that made me laugh in the wrong way was sticky. You can argue that I didn't see the first, but if I see this, I'd be safe if I didn't try. The biggest joke in this movie is the effects, snowballs looked like they were at home and the carrots were utterly embarrassed. If I had estimated that the budget of this film was about 8 to 9 pounds to fifty. The last-minute panic producer has to grab the actor on the street giving them a script telling them they have 6 minutes to practice these lines and shoot on the island. Finally, acting in the film was painful, as if the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them the way. Finally I give this movie: 0 stars out of 5
