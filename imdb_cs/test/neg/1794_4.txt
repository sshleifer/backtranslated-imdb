The heart of darkness was terrible. The novel was hard enough to understand, but when a manufacturing company decides to release a movie loosely based on it, then it just thwarts all up. Not only did those in charge decide to change certain characters and completely eliminate others, but acting was terrible and the overall impression I got from the movie was that it was a complete bagpipe. I was looking at the film in the hope that I could understand the novel a little better, but it totally threw me away. I think the movie was a waste of time, and I was disappointed when I saw Tim Roth in such an unsatisfactory movie, especially when he has amazing movies like Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs under the belt. Like very cool John Malkovich.
