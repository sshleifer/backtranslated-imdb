Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives at the Max Collector's Studio (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) to be Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, controls Jack and binds him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000 for each of them to protect him when negotiating "Spanish judges" antiques with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend who believes he's from Mars to create a backup team. However, Jack doubles the collector and then interests Jack, Jamie and Piece. Low Budget "Spanish Judges" is a movie with a sensible scenario with a terrible conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is amazingly beautiful, but together with the good actor Vincent D'Onofri, they are not able to save that stupid story. Furthermore, scenes that are unfortunately funny, do not work and are actually silly and not funny. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All for Money")
