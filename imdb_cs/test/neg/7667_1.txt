There is a special sky reserved for people who make the world laugh. Together with Chaplin, Stan and Olli, The Marx Bros and ..... (fill in your own favorite), there must be room for everyone who is associated with "Airport 80 - Concorde, Movie". In particular, Robert Wagner overcomes all the expectations that give a lifetime of comedy. I never thought he had it in him. The only way he could be more fun would be to wear a red nose and a rotating bow tie. British viewers recognize the fat of Cannon and Ball, who pretends to be a Russian athlete, a nice trick if he could pull him out, but he couldn't tragically. George Kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him to speak and move at the same time, and my good that triumphs! Brow wrinkled with the effort that utters a timeless dialogue, every word lovingly polished into Coward's form. Just once every twenty years Hollywood shows a movie like "Airport 80". All the years of hard work and struggle, sweat, tears, lessons with Lee Strasberg, living from suitcases, born in a suitcase, etc. show on them. I think I'm ready for my drugs now.
