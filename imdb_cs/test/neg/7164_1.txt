Films like this one make me angry simply because they don't deserve the funds that allow them to end up in my DVD player. This film is ambiguous in its cloak jacket and even more impenetrable in its casting choices (why is Ms. Song a romantic interest? Just wanted Asian women out there, or her unconvincingly wise character actually lending this "message" story to the film? A new look)? One has very little to come close to this film, and even less as the story unfolds. But good driving time, I realized that blunt casting is all that a casting agent can dig up, unconvincing character studies are the result of a writer's brain fart, and the story is amorphous and plagued by unintelligible references to sorrow capitalism, materialism and progress in the postmodern world. Towards the end of this film, just before I nodded and missed the last two minutes, I felt that "everything is green" is the result of "joining" in the film world - someone with very little talent knew someone with very little directing skills, knew someone who has absolutely no marketing sense (but a lot of one-time ego), and this boring and ineffective attempt at whim and humor jumped up with nonsense of conscience. And that's what's most insane - how many endlessly better scenarios were passed on to this almost unnoticeable trio? Skip this movie, and feel good about yourself for it.
