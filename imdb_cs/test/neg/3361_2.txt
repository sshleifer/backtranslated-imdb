Hi, I'm Derrick Cannon and welcome to the first Cannonite show. My movie for the week was debatable, what route, what movie, what excellent four star epic would I choose, guess what I decided to pull one eighty and go on the second trip, I decided to rethink the film so terribly that it was totally killed What could be a very unique concept. The film I'm going to see today is the revenge of Jack Frost on the snowman of the mutant murderer. The stars in this movie include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Manners Agent, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney as Colonel and Scott MacDonald as Snowman Killer Jack Frost. It's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that the incredibly funny Jack Frost (loved carrot scene) gave us, but it's even harder to believe it's exactly the same cast. The film was destroyed for me as soon as they reached the island and Captain Fun was introduced. What was the meaning of his character and how did he fit into the horror movie? The only reason I saw it was that they wanted to give us a character that was a total snowman killer. Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid than he did in the original, his gibberish about freezing being one of the strangest expressions I saw in the movie. But his wife was one of the few bright spots. He played his role as the main woman on the handle. It was the voice of reason in the film of pure idioc. The scene on which it appears to kill snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the film. Again, Ray MacDonald did a great job like Jack Frost despite what was given to him. If it weren't for such weak characters, he could be immortalized like Chucky, Freddy and Jason. Laughter if you have to, but when it comes to Jack Frost had the courage, he had humor, and most importantly, he had an undeniable vicious lane. This movie could have been a lot more, it could have been the sequel to the great series, instead of having all the plans to make Jack Frost the three have been canceled. This movie gets two out of ten for me, and it's lucky it even gets one.
