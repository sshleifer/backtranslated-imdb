First I am in the mid-40s. I've been watching horror movies since I was a kid, so I saw a lot of variety. IMO, it's not as bad as the crowds that gave this 1 or 2. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a low budget horror flick. The dialogue is bold and tolerable, sometimes. The basis of this movie is actually pretty good. For those of you who are old enough to remember or be lucky to see them on DVD. This is very similar to the 70's movie of the week. Just add blood and tiny gore, smaller T&A and swearing, without big names. That's because I'd rather watch it than Jason vs. Godzilla or anything else that is bullshit. This is not so good, EVIL DEAD was the LOW budget movie. At least give these guys recognition for the attempt. With the MIL budget it could be a pretty good movie. My score is trackable 4.
