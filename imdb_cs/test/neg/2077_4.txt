Carmen is a prostitute who lives seducing and stealing Spanish soldiers; At the moment, the femme fatale is undoubtedly the best. When one defends his charming attention, he decides to do everything to destroy him. Eventually, he finds himself on his website and will be forced to do all the things he has ever hated just because he is with Carmen. Despite the fact that Paz Vega is very beautiful, she doesn't seem to be a gypsy (like Carmen) and neither her acting nor Sbaraglia is good. The story is very boring and in most moments it is very absurd, while it wants to be true. The same way are scenarios and special effects, though they are not, but are not acceptable, and too much artificial for a historical film as it is. To summarize, boring and bad, with very absurd developments, it is much better to watch.
