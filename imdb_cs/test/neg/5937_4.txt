After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the main suspect is Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). The CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), who operates in the Middle East, is assigned to his superiors at Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to maintain a "safe house" in Amman supervised and associated with Jordan's Chief of Security. , Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger will not reveal the entire Operation Hani, and that will fail due to Ed's intervention. Meanwhile, Roger has feelings for local sister Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and is approaching the family. When Roger draws another scheme to catch Al-Saleem with the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) as bait to lure Al-Saleem, he threatens not only Sadiki's security, but also Aisha, who is kidnapped. After the execution of Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate with Aisha with the terrorists and is suggested to rescue his sister. "The Body of Lies" is a disappointment in the pyrotechnic tour of Europe and the Middle East despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonard DiCapri and Russell Crowe. An IMDb user review shows that there are many viewers who like this type of high-tech espionage, satellite, and all lack of respect for other nations' sovereignty in the name of oil, which has no time to think, but that's not my case. It's boring and absurd to see a fat Russell Crowe with a cell phone as a family man while his partner risks his life in a dangerous operation. The rich character of Leonardo DiCaprio is poorly developed and, in my opinion, this great actor is mistaken for a Middle East operative agent as a result of his biotype. But the film never explains its connection with the Middle East. Rescuing Roger Ferris alive is also very stupid and leaning. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Rede de Mentiras" ("Network of lies")
