Somewhere in the US, young Clair manipulates his friends Mic, Billy, and John, showing the letter Bob would send her, and the group cowardly beats Bob and Mic kills him with a piece of wood in the forest. Mic feels sadness and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy threaten him with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> I believe "The Wind" is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The terrible scenario is ridiculous and it is almost impossible to write a summary because there is no story or story, only sequences of disconnected scenes. Amateur direction and acting are incredibly poor and terrible. It is incredible how manufacturers invest money in such garbage, distributors issue this crap around the world and viewers like me buy this DVD. I waited until the last scene because I was wondering how bad the movie could be and I was amazed because it was worse than I could imagine in my lowest expectations. Finally, I wonder why the IMDb does not offer zero in the voting system because the garbage really deserves this vote. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Força Invisível" ("Invisible Force")
