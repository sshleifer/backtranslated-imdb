Why did I buy this movie on DVD?, Well a short answer would be: I really don't know. As for the longer version, it pretty much comes to the fact that I really love Tatyana Ali and she plays Alicia in this. Tatyana Ali now gives a really good effort in this movie? I have to say that it is one of the better ones, and she is formed so that she is rather a decent actress. I look forward to seeing her in action when better material is available. This movie was terrible - and my score is this: 1 star for not being the worst movie I've seen, 1 star for Tatyana Ali's performance, and 1 star for not thinking that they deserve only 2 stars, for which are worse movies. Rule I should keep rapping, not my favorite rapper, but at least they seem to like it - and if it's there, I'd like to see him not contaminate the acting scene. Ving Rhames: Ah man, Marcellus Wallace, what are you doing here - you were fine. Just because Michael Caine is a wildly brilliant actor who was as good in so many fearsome movies, you don't need to copy it to Ving. The rest of the semi-large names in the cast: It's okay, the invoices are paid and we all have to do things we don't have time for. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. It's so massively defective, it's hard to know where to start. It's more like a bunch of scenes thrown together, as the director said, "we have to say it, and we have to say". There is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising or inside it. The changes in the plot in the story were at least obvious, and it was therefore predictable what would happen all the time. One Word Summary: Reallynotgood
