A young man named Danny escaped from home and met a rogue named Bix, who agrees to watch Danny and watch him ... and his money. He ends up in a small town where Carrie meets - a shy, naive girl who works in her father's dining room. Bix starts to see Carrie, but he plans to leave soon (because he's a wanderer, you see? Not good! Do you understand?). Meanwhile, the city is creeping, Jesse (played by Jack Elam), still appears in the dining room and harasses Carrie. Danny still unintentionally lifts the whores to the left and right (because she has money on her? She has nearly a hundred dollars!) That Bix has to pursue constantly (there are many ambiguous homosexual overtones between Danny and Bix in this film). Eventually, Bix and Danny decide to leave the city, but the problems are a-brewing, due to Jesse creep. My review of the movie itself: a horrible, dated "Troubled Youth" movie from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> My MST3K Movie Review: I must say it's one of the best MST3K episodes ever. Riffing is dead all the time. With the exception of a somewhat negative ending, this film is an easy material for Joel and Bots, especially Danny's continuous footage Bix must save him. Host segments are also very good, especially with the "Train Song" segment. Hopefully Rhino will release this episode once.
