There were so many reasons why this movie could be great. I'll give you three. 1. Sienna Guillory. It is extremely hot in this movie and it was why I decided to watch it in the first place. 2. Tim Curry. Amazing evil man and I will always excite him in movies (even at home). 3. Jason Donovan. For all those Aussies and Poms there, this is a rare gift. Former neighbor with 80s heart-throb stars dressed in drag selling drugs. However, none of these things, nor the fact that the film is about drug / rave culture has managed to make this film remotely interesting. The screenplay was boring, ordinary performances, and despite the scenes with J.D and any scene with Sienna, I found everything about this movie quite passe. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
