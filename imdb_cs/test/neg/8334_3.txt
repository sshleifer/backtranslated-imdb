When the movie started, I felt like it was something special. Working with the camera and camera was undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could grow with them. The film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy. However, as the film went on, the plot never seemed to take off and just revolved around the scene. I wasn't able to understand the connection between stories. All I saw were the characters that sometimes ran into each other and the references to bottled ships. Without this connection, I remained with only a few remarkable stories. I was surprised that it was so good at Cannes
