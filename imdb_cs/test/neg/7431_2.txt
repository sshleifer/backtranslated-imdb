Robert Downey Jr. In the 17th century wig and dress, I was enough to shake, but I couldn't believe that a great actor like Sam Neill was really involved in this movie. The whole thing was incredible. I especially like Merivel's "cure" for madmen. Dancing ... and hey presto! everyone is happy and they are better! I don't think I liked the Merivel character very much. Watching the whole movie about his supposed transition from boss to big doctor was exhausting. Also, I'm not quite sure, but I didn't think the plague and the famous fire in London were taking place at the same time.
