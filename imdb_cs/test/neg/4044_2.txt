To own up to making such a horrible movie! Actually, I'm more embarrassed to have sat the whole thing. It looks like an old 80-year-old sci-fi movie with super-fake-looking "special effects", queer imagery and very cheesy dialogue. Maybe that's the way they wanted it to look, maybe they think it's cool to make movies in the 80s fashion as if they came back in style. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think the promised eye-candy will save the film, you're in for disappointment - so-called "babes" are manish and downright ugly. They can't act at all, I don't understand why they couldn't bring at least good looking chicks if they want girls without talent! But I think that when you do this stupid movie, you don't get too good a choice, hot chicks aren't just making it such a pitiful bullshit!
