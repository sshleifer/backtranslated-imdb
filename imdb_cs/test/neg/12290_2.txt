He saw it in the video store and I thought I'd try it. It sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good and the actor who played "Noel" was the most convincing, though he had no hard time in the movie. I find it really hard to give a bad rating to a movie, but this is one, a minute number that gets my book. As the film went on, I wanted it to improve, but without success. Asthetic, that was good. Sound and lighting was good, but playing in this movie killed me. It was like watching a serious show. I just said, "I can't believe they made this move like that." I paused several times from total disbelief that the negotiations were so bad. There's so much I want to say, but I'll say it, everything else, for the most part, was good, it was playing, like the last cut that really made this movie.
