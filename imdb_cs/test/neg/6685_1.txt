What a nasty cynical movie. This sad excuse for a dramatic urban view of what 20-year-olds are doing while crawling over Sydney's nightlife trough seems to be somehow linked to its target market. Made by an industry, nobody and friends who seemingly thought they could combine some slimy behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes, SAMPLE PEOPLE deservedly failed at the Australian box office. It is so offensive in its clich√© of displaying clear and easy goals that have been totally rejected by the intended audience itself. Anyway, and cruelly and without trying to offer young audiences the quality or resonance that might be attracted to marketing or casting SAMPLE PEOPLE, they could be interesting or even informative if it wasn't invented by its prospect of "what teens are trying to see the movie" . The character played by Ben Mendelsohn is particularly offensive and Kylie Minogue is again lost by poor material and novel filmmakers. It is as if the producers thought that the teenagers would watch all the nasty rubbish and just entangled scenes and characters that were shallow and less soul. They were very bad. A miniature movie from 1983 called GOING DOWN got the theme right and is an excellent antidote to this poison.
