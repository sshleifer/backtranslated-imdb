it is the best film that takes first place in the worst and useful films ever made in this poor country. really doesn't even know what the word cinema means and casting voices for movies, I really wonder how many P.P.P. or L.Bunuel saw. The score of this "faield experiment" reflects much u're a way to understand things and recognize a good / quality movie when u see it. We Romanian people have only one film and until today the status has not changed and the film is "Padurea Spanzuratilor". But I'm not wasting my time thinking about how many of you saw it. This is a movie that respects all the required qualities of MOVIE. More than 41 years have passed from scenario to frame and even to image quality / clarity. I recommend voters to look for better films and then vote. KuDos will see later.
