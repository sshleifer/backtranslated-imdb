It's getting really interesting - the story unfolds around the main character, who runs a "cleaning company" specializing in the cleaning of crime scenes. As a former cop, he finds himself in a special situation where one job is suddenly "lost". In addition, they will find some relation to the investigation of police corruption. His "Columbo Feeling" is justified, the deeper he gets into the background of the story. Good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play in a thrilling story with a few twists - but only in the last 25 minutes. (up to 7 out of 10 stars). SPOILER :::: Suddenly, the film loses its touch and at the end there is a totally unnecessary filming that includes a 14-year-old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and unjustifiable character development justice ... why not have Cutler to give up his friendship investigation? or have a daughter discover some facts? or ... many possible much better stories can be imagined ... really useless end!
