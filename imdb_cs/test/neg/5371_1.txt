This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course his false. But it's unpleasant to watch. I personally know that more creative films have influenced the mind that could "make" this seem real. The young man couldn't be more convincing. He reads everything he says. Do we really believe they believe what they're talking about? It's a lot of ways to show Blair-Witch. Fear is not a breed of what seems to be "cool" and computer generated. Neither of these proverbial lines creates "What was that? Did you hear that?" Also, there are real compelling psyches out there that don't just "want to be on the screen". Another DUH-factor is ... how do these manufacturers think we're going to buy, that paranormal activity becomes magically within 2-3 days (if we're lucky) to film. I do not think so. A 2 + week in one place would be more convincing. It is also disarming that they think that "NASA radar controls" and computers that show fantasy bs really scare us. And IE: Exorcism should not be staged as Exorcist. When will they get it right? Devil's property or other evil spirits affect people differently. They don't just growl and lower their voice, like Linda Blair, or fall around like Courtney Love on a drug seizure. As mentioned, better concentration on "psychic abilities" would greatly help this exhibition. We want to see and hear ALL that flash in front of them. It is not cut off to other bs stories. On the last note - Shooting Stars, they do not create interest when you have recently shown false UFO photos. I can re-emphasize the young dark-haired man who is organizing this show, he's absolutely wrong. Avoid this show. For fear: watch the old unsolved episodes of Mystery ... not new (the recreation did it oh-so bad). But that's for another blog.
