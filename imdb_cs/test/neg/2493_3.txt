I was watching TV years ago when I was sick (I don't know, I tend to be happier with my watching TV, when I'm sick, too much effort to use the remote control, I think). From what I remember, every aspect of the film - casting, acting, writing, directing, etc. - was, at best, poorly informed. I could forgive historical inaccuracies if this film made a sense of how it was to work at the Trinity; but not. There have been attempts to humanize scientists, but they have been inadequate and never transcended caricature. <br /> <br /> I didn't know much about the people involved in the Manhattan project at the time, but the views in the movie were so cartoonish that I became interested in real personality. And I did it. So I think this horrible movie has done a very small amount of good, after all. <br /> <br /> This is not a thorough overview, but FMLB does not deserve it or require it. You can enjoy it if you are a fan of bad movies.
