I took 14 years to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely terrible! This movie should be rated at least R. I'm not so strict with movies, but that was too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some kind of comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be rude, but this was a rough road. I sat there watching and reading (a title at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I couldn't believe how cruel it was. I couldn't believe it would be okay for 13 years to read and see this content. I don't understand how the rating system works.
