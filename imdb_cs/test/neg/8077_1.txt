This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story is a joke, the effects are terrible, cinematography doesn't match the tone of the film, dialogue is cheese and the actors do a good job when it is left. People do not do this in such situations. My question is: Who would finance such a crap? The film begins where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a firefighter doesn't protect them. Furthermore, we will join some cyclists in the forest who ride their bikes by bike. One guy falls and breaks his leg or something. The firefighter will help them to help them. Meanwhile, someone starts fire. Some more bicycles. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I lost my time. <br /> <br /> Don't play this movie.
