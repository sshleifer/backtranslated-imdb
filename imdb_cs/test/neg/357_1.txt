I just watched this movie on Bravo! and it was absolutely terrible. It has the storyline of Shannon Tweed's film without nudity. The space was interesting, winning a lottery in a remote area and people who have reasons to want money. The characters were rubbed as observations on human nature and greed. For a film called Class Warfare, it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and a predictable ending. This movie could do a lot better if there were more characters with motivation to get a ticket and was "who did it?" Acting wasn't fantastic, but it's hard to believe believable with such a horrible scenario. Lindsey McKeon is very cute and would like to see what she could do in better production with a better script. It's probably the only reason I was sitting around the movie. <br /> <br />
