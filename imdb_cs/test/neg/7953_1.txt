Maybe you have to be a former hippie to realize this, because in addition to some old fashion trends, music and dialogue, it really has nothing to do with it today. Four fun loving high school students enjoy the carefree days of painting naked models and riding motorcycles. They take acid in one scene and go to the zoo. On the screen, "Don't Feed the Animals" will light up and suddenly be in a cage, laughing and hanging on a chain swing (?!) The wicked artist (Larry Swanson) tells (in flashback) how his artistic career was almost destroyed due to a crippling hand disease. He sends out zombie followers dressed in black to kidnap people, then inject them with a serum that distorts their faces. He is trying to create some new form of abstract act (I guess here, details are a bit fuzzy, to put it mildly). Meanwhile, Jason (Ross Harris) sets off to save the day after his friend Scotty (Chris Martell) is killed and his girlfriend Janet (Eugenie Wingate) is kidnapped. I thought ZOMBIE LAKE zombie makeup was terrible, but wait until you see it! It's Douglas Hobart, the star of DEATH CURSE OF TART. A small role is played by Brad Grinter, director of Z-classic BLOOD FREAK, which is much, much more fun than this deadly boring turkey (aka NIGHTMARE HOUSE). <br /> <br /> Necessary Note: The 1984 The Regal video release includes a bad cast (for THE BRIDES WORE BLOOD) printed directly on the video label! <br /> <br /> Score: 1 of 10
