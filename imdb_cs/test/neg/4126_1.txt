This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I watch virtually every movie that is at night (either showtime, hbo, cinemax etc.). The "Three" AKA "Survivor Island" keeps you so tense that you can see the color hiding just to hurt you further. If you want to feel like you're wasting what looks like an eternity on the worst movie ever made, then watch it all. I had to shout at least 900 times from idiotic twists. If I had 4 hands, I'd give this movie 4 inches DOWN. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I believe that the only people who want this film are those who have a terrible morale.
