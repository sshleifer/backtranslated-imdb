With so many good movies released in 1995 (especially "Mortal Kombat" and "Seven"), unfortunately, there must have been some bombs as well, and this movie really falls into the second category with a boring, predictable plot and a miserable end. It seems that Antonio Banderas couldn't find a decent script from "Desperado", the only remarkable movie he did. Anyone with an eighth of the brain could tell who DeMornay's stalker was from the beginning. Her memories of her mother's death did nothing but confuse the paper story. Too bad Dennis Miller was wasted in this movie; this part resembles his enthusiastically similar role in "The Net". The tangled end shook my head because I did it all over the movie. In addition, any film that displays the cruelty of animals in any shape or form, no matter how fake it looks, automatically gets the thumbs down from me. <br /> <br /> If you want a long story short, if you want to enjoy a good thriller then avoid it at all costs. Never talk to strangers ... especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10
