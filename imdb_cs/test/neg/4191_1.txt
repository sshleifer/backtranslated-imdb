Only by adding it to a group of people who thought it was "incredible", I would mention the following without repeating the apparent FLAWS, which some of the other commentators clearly stated: "The movie" is filmed on video (what kind of camera I don't do) I know) but the cameraman had it on AUTOFOCUS (!) All the time, so any slight movement causes it to go in and out of focus. In many scenes, actors themselves out of their scenes. This shouting "Amateurs" alone. I also noticed that in the "center of the cornfield" you can hear the sound of a gasoline generator that lights up the lights ... loudly. Also what is with this single light source that follows (and many times 'leads' actors) when they go around. It looks like it is a novelty with a "camera" light that follows people around as a spotlight. There was no "credit" for lighting design / DP and I know why. "Movie makers" didn't see the need to have someone who knew what they were doing in this picture (note that I didn't say "movie"). So be prepared for the SINGLE glaring spotlight as the only source of "film lighting" for most of the movie. UGhhh !!! This is probably the technically most detailed production I've ever seen commercially. I bought this title because I like a bad movie theater. Usually it's so bad that you can laugh. It's so bad that it's unnoticeable. Plan Nine from Space is compared to this title "Citizen Kane".
