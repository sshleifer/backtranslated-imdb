The world's first official release of World Wrestling Entertainment is a pretty basic horror / slasher movie called "See No Evil", starring Kane, one of their great wrestlers, known for having intimidating presence, hard moves and one of the biggest. intricate backstories in a match. And don't pull any wounds here; While this film is being promoted as the greatest horror of all time (mostly WWE), it goes without saying that after seeing this film, I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time. "See No Evil" sees a lot of juvenile delinquents sent to the hotel to clean up. Of course, there is a monstrous murderer in this hotel (played by Kane) and we all know where it goes. Without going too far, this film has all the semblance and structure of a early 80s slasher that has not touched most of the clich√©, but without the fears that accompany these films. And this is the main problem with "See No Evil". He is attempting so many tricks that his predecessors in the genre assume are anticipating; Veteran Horror Fans easily recognize some of the tricks over time and even those who have seen just a few movies should tell what happens next. It's too general to be scary. The film's gory is no doubt, but it's just there to make it go. The dark atmosphere that appeared in the film initially gives the feeling of horror, but as you get to the end, in some way, it feels like it is on the ground and bothering you quickly. Fatal scenes don't look bloody and terrible, just as they laugh, though some of them are quite resourceful. And the performances in this film are also very bad, because the main characters aren't developed enough to take care when the axes finally reach. Some cannot even portray fear correctly; They just scream and cry in vain attempt to emote. So when they die, it only adds to the comedy because you don't care about them, you simply consider them to be the equivalent of the Starships Redshirts to the Kane monster. As for Kane, he just portrayed his film character as well as portraying his wrestling character, only he uses axes and hooks instead of hell and sulfur. There is no doubt in my mind that Kane can be a great part of the horror genre. It has the appearance and presence of it; he only needs a better material (specifically a script that is not written by someone who writes the match) to work with him. Now, despite what may seem like a cruel review, I really enjoyed the movie. It's one of those ridiculously bad movies you can't help but sit down and enjoy. My main gripe with film, again, is that it's just a workout in shooting gory kills and has no scary or shocking moments. I liked it, but I enjoyed it because it was easy for me to laugh at what had to be scary moments in the movie. If this happens because it should have been, the movie would have been rated higher. But not. This made her laugh because she is a B-movie and does not help that the director's previous experiences were porn movies and music videos; it's not that much of a complicated thing to drive directly. However, I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind a fun B-movie or a fun horror movie, I highly recommend "See No Evil". If you are a true enthusiast of this genre, I would wait until the DVD comes out before you check it out. Everyone else should probably look at something else.
