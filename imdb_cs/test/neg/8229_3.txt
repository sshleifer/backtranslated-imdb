It's not a very good movie, but it's just the best Troma Studios movie I've ever seen. Lloyd Kaufman - the "brain" behind Troma - does not concern a good plot or a mildly entertaining movie. His main concern is doing something bizarre. And his definition of bizarre times often reflects my definition of terrible cinematography. <br /> <br /> In this movie, we have a character called Luther - whose favorite pastime is not Baseball, but biting heads from chickens - receiving its release from lockout. The board considered him rehabilitated despite the fact that he wasn't talking - just acting like a chicken - and having a set of dental prostheses at his disposal. Of course, once Luther is liberated, it is about causing chaos, first at the grocery store and later at the farmhouse. VIOLENCE: Affordability (Lots of violence in this often tasteless Luther sinks their razor blades into a poor senior lady who waits at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing her mother and daughter on the farm). NUDITY: $$$$ (Stacy Haiduk adds a picture to the picture because former Lois Lane (I can't remember which Superman's edition was) gives us a shower scene, followed by a jump rope in her bed with her a friend - a guy who just doesn't do anymore, I have no chemistry with Mrs. Haiduk, extended footage of the shower scene in the DVD adds a little more to the viewer about Stacy, it's something. STORY: $ (Forgettaboutit !!!) The Whitey Styles screenplay can only be the worst ever written. ogue is something that a preschooler could write, and the actions he writes for his characters are absurd. It's like Styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgotten how people react in certain situations. ACTING: $$ (The film belongs to Edward Terry, who really does a decent job as a Geek.) He's pretty menacing in stupid fashion, Joan Roth as a mother doing a super job to support, but Haiduk and her boyfriend lack chemistry made their roles at a loss at best).
