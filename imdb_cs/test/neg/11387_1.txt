The first premise is stink ... the little boy likes to dress up girls' clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are lame and old, seen in dozens of fifties and sixties. The entire cast is useless. I bet people signed a contract to be in Shirley MacLaine. Please, would someone tell Shirley that she did her best comedy in TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA. Look at it ... if it's not Andy Griffith's repetition.
