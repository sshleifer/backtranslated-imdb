There is a reason why the world has forgotten these creatures: they are boring. This is Hammer Production, which means that the filmmaker should be hit by a hammer, several times if possible - and where it hurts most. Most people have put more ideas to make a dump than these idiots have put into making this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously now? The film begins with some cave-hunting antelope people. Antelopes have now evolved a lot since the pre-war times because they are actually attacking and killing people. After that, it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion models and even a couple of very old, gray-haired grandmothers and grandfathers. Apparently these old gejs had never heard of cavemen who were under 30; they refused to bow to the will of both logic and pre-historical records, so they remain alive. One of the cavemen is not bearded; it is clean. It's not as clean-shaven as Tarzan, the Lord of humanoid clean-shaven people who roam around the jungle since childhood and without a razor but around them. Followed by the obligatory destruction of an earthquake / molten lava sequence that causes many of our non-furry friends to meet their destruction. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake fashion models showed their breasts more. After that, they have to be shy or something because they covered the chests for a while (maybe they were covered with ashes, so I mistakenly thought they were covered). Other actions follow in the form of two fashionable sand models; Suppose the next best thing for female mud-wrestling. After much of the desert has been crossed, our black-haired tribe meets - how else could it be - a blond. Yawning. There are other stunning things to follow. There is that red-haired fashion-model who bothered to see a teen youth kill a hedge. There is also a scene of a woman dying at birth: those cave-fashion models are so fragile. Finally, we get to meet an even darker tribe that is mature and that is a bad tribe. One of them becomes a WWF champion after he actually beats (!) A huge bear-thing in a match match. 1,2,3 ... and it's done: the bear is defeated. We are also witnessing a jealous Caveman miraculously recovering from two major injuries: first he gets stabbed with a big spear in his thigh, but he walks away from it as if it were but a scratch. Then he throws himself out of the cliff — a big stone — with a blond cave cave, but leaves him as if thrown on a giant sofa. Finally, it is unclear whether he dies of falling off an even higher cliff or that voodoo doll. Oh yes, voodoo was used in pre-historic times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashion models. It's always important to learn from movies. The film's message is as bright as it is educational: cavemen like to fight for local power and love their fashion models. As if every self-confident cave man fought for such an excused leader.
