I bought it out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) perform in a 1995 film? With a miracle of unused film, shots that have been sitting on the shelf for about ten years! You can say that the movie track used to shoot their scenes does not match the movie used to shoot "Jack-O". Ed Wood's curse lives on. The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that it's exactly the kind of movie you would expect on both of your filmographies. The same is true for Scream Queens Linne Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. The setup is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and some kind of curse is issued when stupid, slappy teenagers disrupt the grave. The result: a massive killer with a scythe and a large plastic pumpkin on his head! He's going for a healthy Kelly family for revenge (and killing others who get in the way). Father opens Haunted Garage for neighboring boys. The son (Ryan Latshaw, the director's son) has one continuous, confused facial expression for all his scenes and one cheerfully poorly kept dramatic scene lying in the grave. At least it's a baby. Mother's eyes emerged from her head as she tries to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who turns out to explain things that seem to be trying to phonetically pronounce all her dialogue. So what are the actors' names? Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell are briefly on the TV screen (used to stuff time). Linnea plays a bigger role in babysitting and does exactly what he can do with him. Her enthusiastic performance helps a bit. There is also one out-of-nowhere laughter when an ultra-conservative couple watching Rush Limbaugh clone on TV bite it. A woman glides on a carpet and stabs a toaster with a knife. She is electrically hit, and the end result looks like a flaming Muppet. <br /> <br /> Everything and everything, nice fun stuff! I was bored!
