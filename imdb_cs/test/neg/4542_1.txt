Well, I like to watch bad horror B-movies because I think it's interesting to see the stupidity and inability of the creators to make a really good movie. (I've always compared these movies - for example, with some Spielberg works and again and again, and I don't get a huge difference in what I see). But people! "Chilling" is not funny and is not even "interesting". It's an EXTREMEL BORING horror movie, no matter what makes bad movies visible. There is no play, no script, no direction, no excitement and no blood. It's a senseless amateur movie. It's definitely the worst movie I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot of "worst movies" - believe me). I warned you !!! 1/10
