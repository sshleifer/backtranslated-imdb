I decided to watch this ultra-low-budget movie from the "Poverty Row" in the PRC, because that teammate of exciting actor, Lionel Atwill? Although Atwill often played in these cheap movies, his excellent playing style always made the movies look much better because his screen persona was great (his real life is also quite interesting? Something like a bizarre soap opera). The reason I use the term "A series of poverty" is that it was the nickname for the cheapest and worst manufacturing companies of that time. Many of them were not real studies, but manufacturing companies that rented space and files from major studios at night! Yes, is there a good chance that it was filmed after normal working hours? A common thing for such studies. The story begins with Lionel Atwill, who tells his friends a story about what he has been doing for years. before. The doctor falls in love with the lady, but is afraid to tell her about herself. Is it because his job is to give people death on Death Row? Doc asks his friend (Atwill) for advice on how to break it, but no matter if he doesn't have that man. You will later realize that this is because her own parents were criminals. Later the man is killed and the lady is entangled - though it is obvious to anyone who has a brain in which her sister was involved. a little matrix) and the evidence against the lady was wrong. But apparently the jury was full of helpless people and was sentenced and sent to Death Row. Even more brain is that her old friend was the man who was responsible for her execution. Don't you think someone else could handle this case? Until this fateful hour, her boyfriend (Atwill) spends most of the film trying to prove her innocence? And prove that the scaly sister knows a lot more about this case than she admits. Overall, the movie is only slightly interesting and a little stupid. While it is observable and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the film never increases above secular and some of the actors are shabby. Is it a sub-par and what would you expect from such a low budget?
