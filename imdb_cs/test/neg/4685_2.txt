The word "boring" throws too often when referring to exactly how bad a low budget horror may or may not be. I've seen many B-movies. Many terrible, terribly incapable B-movies. Some with a production value of several hundred dollars. Does clumsiness, miserable behavior, worse continuity, and embarrassing budgets really make an inactive movie? Some would undoubtedly do so. Most of them are probably the big fans of The Matrix. I hate big budget movies so I say no. It may sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes even overwhelming (Troll 2), but boredom will always be unnoticeable. garbage ... Yeah, anyway. This is one of the late British director Andy Milligan's many alternatives to sleeping pills. This one is based on Sweeney Todd ... Great. Milligan has a boring story and is still "butcher". Hey, that's funny, I said I'm sorry, but I'm still distracted. That's not easy. I'll make it easy for the second thought. No blow, no fears, no fun, just unlikely, annoying people with disparate conversations. it is bloodthirsty butchers. Yeah, and something about the barber killing people, or something about meat pies. I don't know, it's not important. For something a little bigger from Andy Milligan, there's always one other I've seen, The Rats Are Coming, The Werewolves Are Here. Yeah, you heard me. But how come we forgot about this guy Milligan, and pick up something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp. Whatever you decide, Bloodthirsty Butchers sucks, maybe even more than any other version of this already unprecedented story. And that, B-movie fans, really says something. 2/10
