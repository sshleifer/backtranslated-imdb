Although it's the first movie of a broken lizard, it's the last one I've seen. Having enjoyed the Super Troopers slightly, and managed to sit crap that is a dred and beerfest club, I was surprised to hear they had done an earlier movie. Now I didn't sit with high hopes, but I was hoping it would be a fun campus. My friend asked me to remember that they are younger (of course) and their first foray into the film. I did and I was still disappointed. If the actors and the comedy abilities of the guys are not taken, they were fine. The whole movie was tiring, clich√© and honestly boring. Some of the other actors in the film were very poor in playing. And Rugby didn't even look like rugby. Bad performance. They improved drastically with Super Troopers and dropped because. Hopefully they will return to the Super Troopers 2 form
