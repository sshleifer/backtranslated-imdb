This movie plays as a demented episode of VH1 "Where are they now" or "Beyond music". In the first half of the film (which depicts his "Days of Fame") Abbie Hoffman is inadvertently portrayed as a kind of delusion rock star. You know the kind; a proud lead singer, a handsome boy who has not written any music, has no idea, but gets all the fame for nothing and free chicks. As a result, it takes for granted, abuses it and eventually destroys it with itself. Hoffman's festive days ended suddenly when he was arrested for dealing with cocaine, skipped bail and went into hiding. The second part of the film deals with that time in hiding. In it, we see Hoffman as a pathetic crybaby who indefinitely blames everyone, but himself for his downfall. The times will go through him completely; and can never deal with it. How sad. END. End of credits and OH NO! We learned that Abbie Hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's not a picture that filmmakers intended for Hoffman to make this film. As Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt were involved, I am sure that this film was intended as a tribute to the life of a man who was after all an icon of the 1960s and a leftist anti-war movement. In this, they failed unsuccessfully. The film features Abbie Hoffman as a mindless cartoon. We never said what drives him. How did he get his views? How did he manage to capture the imagination of an entire generation? How did he organize such an extensive movement? Why did he engage in cocaine trading at the height of his fame? Why? Who knows, and because the filmmakers don't seem to care?
