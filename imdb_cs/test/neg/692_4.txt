* POSSIBLE AHEAD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I will only say what has not been said here (and I will continue this comment for the rest of WWF / WWE). <br /> <br /> If you have a female title match, at least do it with an interesting rather than a squash that will bring the current champion. Moolah probably couldn't handle the intense struggle, but they wanted to have a legend at WrestleMania. I thought murderous bees were unnecessary in WrestleManias, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after B. Brian Blair was gone and Jim Brunzell became a canvas. So I didn't realize for a while that they were a team with top tags, even top contenders. But I liked to see Bill Fralic in the royal battle. He really came to his own here, creating cocky character heel in pre-match conversation and even making elimination in the battle royal. Except Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene is the only professional sportsman from my generation with respect for the match (everyone remembers Dennis Rodman?). And what about the absurd Hart Foundation green stockings?
