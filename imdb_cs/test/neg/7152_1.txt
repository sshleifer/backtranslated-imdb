If this movie approaches you, consider it a threat. I was unhappy to see this movie in Tokyo. Being a Dutchman, I was surprised to find a Dutch film playing in a metropolis like Tokyo. I thought it must be special if the Dutch film did it to Japan. So I went there with friends and we happily told the theater that we were Dutch and that we were so curious about the film. As it turned out, this was one of the most infantile, stupid, stupid, worst acts, with the worst spoken English movie I saw in about 10 years, and I left the theater to avoid the staff because I'm almost responsible for this movie disasters. Sometimes you feel like you know what the director wanted: Lola Rennt, Trainspotting as a movie. Instead, it was more like MacGyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat as a score. But when I didn't feel too angry, the film was inadvertently quite cheerful once in a while, as Holland showed at its smallest.
