Don't be fooled by 'awards' and comment below. That's just 1 bad movie. The way George Katt played his character (soft gangster) is very unpleasant to watch. The interview in the opening scene is a dramatic expression. In the rest of the movie, the head seems to be somewhere else. His emotions disagree with things that happen in the film. Things he says as a voice don't add anything to the film. It just makes Zeus even more headless character with his head in the clouds. The story and the film were put together with a complete lack of imagination. All parts of the film were badly stolen by other modern directors. Hopefully Jon Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
