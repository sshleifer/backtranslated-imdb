No, no, no, no, no, no, no! This is not a movie, it's an excuse to show people dance. It's just not good. Even dance is slow and not as fun as the average 'Dirty Dancing', let alone any other good dance movie. Is it a love story? Is it a musical? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? It's not that this movie is a bit of everything, it's that this movie fails in everything it tries to be. The film proves to be even more absurd as the film progresses. Acting is terrible from all sides, the script is definitely trying to tell us something about the relationship, but it fails. WATCH FOR MOMENT - When Patrick Stewart enters the scene and you think the film can improve when it brightens the dull atmosphere. For a second.
