I am a fan of bad horror films of the fifties and sixties - movies so ridiculous and stupid that they are good for laughter. That's why it's natural that I chose this movie - especially since John Agar was virtually guaranteed to be with him. Sadly, even though it was a bad movie, it was the worst type of bad movie - boring out of faith and unfair. At least with the stupid and the worst bad movies you can laugh at horrible monsters and terrible direction and acting. You'll never see that much of the monsters (mainly because of the darkness of the press) and acting when it's bad is much less bad energy ... helpless and boring. The film begins with some young adults going to Satan's throat. Well, given the name of the place, it's not surprising when you later find out, chew to pieces! Duh ... don't go to Satan's Hollow! Well, there are reports of some kind of falling object from the sky, so what are the teens doing? Yeah, throw a dance party - a very, very, very slow dance party where kids almost dance in slow motion. So it depends on the sheriff (Agar) and his men to ensure that teens can dance in peace without fear of chewing. As for the monster, he's a guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask - a bit like a monster in ROBOT MONSTER. It's not entirely original and it's not exactly top technology. To make it worse, it makes sniffing sounds and moves very, very slowly - so slow that even the toughest teenager could easily overtake it! He's repeatedly killed outside of me. Overall, it's too boring, even if you're a fan of a crappy movie.
