This season the real oomf was missing, but when it comes to setting the stories to keep us in the mood again, Season 6 is without highlighting and spontaneity. This season lacked his usual Sopranos style, and if you're cut out of all the garbage that was filled in every episode this season, you probably would have 6 episodes worth the real stories. Side stories like Pauly's mom, is she or not? he was boring and had no other purpose than to further explore his character. I would like Bobby to express his anger more in Pauly in the carnival episode, but without success. And that's just it! These side stories had no real purpose and no finishing work. If they're going to turn off these stories in the next 6 episodes, I'd rather not watch it because it's really not worth seeing. and his final.
