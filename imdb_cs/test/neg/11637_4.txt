Do I enjoy science-fiction as well as another man? but what the hell was that? Apparently shot over just three days using the excess film stock left over from his previous movie, 'Nana (1926),' this Jean Renoir short is a stunning futuristic satire, made on a budget that couldn't be much more than zero. In 2028, after the Great War, Africa became the most civilized region on Earth, and what was formerly Europe was described as "Terres Inconnues". African explorer? played Johnny Huggins, a black man dressed as a white man, dressed as a black man when you follow me? he travels to the ruins of Paris in his spherical plane and lands outside the lair of Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then the director's wife) and her primate companion, perhaps the nicest monkey costume I've ever seen. Wild, as part of some bizarre ritual of sexual initiation, begins to show Charleston, the explorer of dance, who is happy to learn himself. It does not help the film that was Hessling, which was amazing the following year in Renoir's 'The Little Match Girl (1928),' is not much of a dancer, though extensive use of slow motion adds surrealism to the ceremony. Furthermore, I am quite shocked that Renoir would use his own wife as such a shameless sexual object? it is not surprising that you will only learn about their divorce three years later! On the plus side, I liked the general sci-fi concept behind the film, and the subtly satirical touch of the reversal of racial roles usually typical of such stories. However, why Renoir has decided to wear his black actor as a minstrel, he will remain a secret all the time. Silly, Rude and Absolutely Unreasonable 'Charleston Parade (1927)' is a film weirdness from one of the most respected directors of cinemas and is perhaps an effort he would like to forget. The DVD version came without a music soundtrack, but I compromised with a selection of pieces by Dmitry Shostakovich.
