SILVER CITY (2+ outta 5 stars) As a huge fan of John Sayles's work for many years, I feel safe with the worst movie he has ever made. This means that the film is not exactly as awful ... just uninspired. Sayles throws familiar elements from his previous films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, the sale of juvenile ideals), but he can't connect them in any new or meaningful way. Even the dialogue (usually Sayles' strength) is disappointing this time ... sounding cliché and forced in almost every scene. The movie looks and sounds like episodes from a TV series that didn't make it its third episode. There are tons of big stars on their hands ... and they're trying to make their bit parts come alive ... but there's no material this time. While filming the campaign instead, the governor-hopeful (poor and obvious George W-in stand-in) fishes a dead body from the lake. The investigator is hired to try to warn people who deliberately let it be discredited ... but they soon discover that there are deeper and darker (and more clichés) secrets to be discovered. Sayles made similar-themed movies so much better in the past ("Lone Star", "Matewan", "Return of Secaucus Seven", "Men with Arms"). It's a pity that he came too much in the well and came up with water. One good line, released by Richard Dreyfuss: "Danny, you're defeated. That was no doubt determined. So try and be good, all right?"
