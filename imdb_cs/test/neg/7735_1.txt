Impressive vision really, and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and those hypnotic Chinese violins too ... Let me think, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"? <br /> <br /> I like CTHD, with its simplicity and well-developed characters that have left you enough room to enjoy the vision without thinking about the importance of DEEEPAA. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Hero" is painfully demanding and challenging both visually and conceptually. Morale greater than life was terrible. Sacrifice your life, sacrifice your faith, sacrifice your love for your powerful nation to succeed ???? WTF ?? <br /> <br /> No, thanks. Ale hay, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud! <br /> <br /> Viva
