This movie was really bad. Really really bad. The scenes were like a parody and a special effect sucked a lot. And it was shot in 2003 !!! I think it was a great waste of time and money, and Michael Shanks just made me laugh with his "Shaggy from Scooby Doo" picture. Never waste time with this picture ... I really don't know what the director thought when he saw the last cut of this movie, but the fighting was so unreal that it hurts my eyes to look at them. The "latex women" warriors were like sheep who were screaming and looking scared as if they had no idea what to do on the scene ... I think that's a beautiful example of Bottom 100.
