Be warned by a line on the back of the box that promotes a story involving "through sex athletes". There is nothing to displace Carrie 2. The story is absurd, terrible, and the end is too predictable. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect a masterpiece, but I was expecting to have fun. I was not. The only way I could rationally watch this movie was because I was in a relative's house and waited for my car to be repaired. If it's not in the same situation, stay away from this movie.
