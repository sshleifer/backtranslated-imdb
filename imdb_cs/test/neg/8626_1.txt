I can't believe this movie has 6 IMDb stars. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen that wasn't the Mystery Science Theater 3000. The story is predictable. I couldn't take care of any of the characters. The dialogue is raw. For a few moments in the movie, I was actually sighed aloud (including the crazy neighbor Kiefer Southerland and the incredibly lame joke that the movie ends). Jeff Bridges' accent is goofy - I can't tell which country he should be from. It must be one of the least thrilling thrillers I've ever seen ... after Sandra Bullock's character disappears, nothing happens to move the story to 45 minutes. If I could, I'd give this movie a negative number of stars.
