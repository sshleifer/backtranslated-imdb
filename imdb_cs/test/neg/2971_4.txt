The silly comedy casts an embarrassed seemingly Ray Milland as a British World War II officer in Europe who ran away from the German border and worked with a gypsy woman with a starving man played by Marlene Dietrich. Slow-paced, overlong, and miscast: Leaders are too old for this kind of teenage feed, though Marlene shines in her solo moments. It took three screenwriters to adapt the book to Yoland Foldes on the screen, but this material had to look like it was 1947 - something that Ernst Lubitsch could break out in 1939. chemistry. ** of ****
