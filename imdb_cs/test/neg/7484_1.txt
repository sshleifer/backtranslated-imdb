It's not that often that I feel strong enough to write about a movie. But that was just the worst movie I've ever seen. The performances were, at best, ridiculous, in the worst case, there was no other word, terrible. A particularly leading woman who has random sexual arrivals must be seen and heard to be believed. Frankly, the conspiracy is meaningless, the scary dialogue and the characterization ... is nothing. I'm surprised it's not Alan Smithee's movie. I can't emphasize it strongly enough ... to avoid at all costs. This is not the worst of budgeting.
