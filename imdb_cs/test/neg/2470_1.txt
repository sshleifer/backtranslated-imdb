According to an article on http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the actors in the film, Carina Lau, was forced to appear in this film for free. She was a victim of the infamous kidnapping shortly before this film was made, and later photos of her in need were published in a magazine that has since been forced to close and its publisher sent to prison. The actress denies being attacked, but a movie appeared on the internet that allegedly showed her being raped. (The Hong Kong press, out of respect for it, mostly refused to report the incident, but Google produces several articles about it.)
