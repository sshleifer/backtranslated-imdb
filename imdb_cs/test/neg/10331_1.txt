Only noteworthy as the debut of future magnificent Hollywood star sand, Sandra Bullock, this ridiculous action film is so full of holes that one could easily suspect termites. The plot is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out. The production value stinks with cheese. In fact, the overall lack of production values ​​would be better ... at least the film might seem so harsh. ADR is extremely bad and ubiquitous in the film. It is questionable whether any track from the actual filming dialogue was used. Performance is largely terrible, though there are a few exceptions. In these exceptions, however, performances are undermined by the fact that the director apparently gave the actors the wrong direction and occasionally made them completely out of character. (ie passive to panic characters in the blink of an eye. Bad direction.) Constant "weapon sound effects" (loaded magazines, slides, etc.) are also exaggerated and more often than not. synchronize with on-screen actions. Add to this kitschy "Bad Guy" vocal distortion for the lead villain (especially so that you know it's a villain in this incomprehensible film disorder), and you have a recipe for disaster. The situation in the movie go far beyond the standard "suspension of infidelity" and become absolutely laughter. One leading character spends a large portion of the movie tied to a chair before deciding to use a butterfly knife tucked into a sock to free himself. So my questions are ... why didn't he do it before and why he even has a butterfly knife. Not been searched? RIGHT. This is one of hundreds of examples of utterly ridiculous situations that have somehow been filled into this 90 minute package. On the whole, "The Hangmen" plays as the excruciatingly bad R-rated TV movie of '80. years. If not for the subsequent success of Sandra Bullock, this would never be found on DVD. But he has, so my only advice is to avoid. Watching this movie can really damage your IQ.
