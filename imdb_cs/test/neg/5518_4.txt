This film, combined with recycled film footage, music and ideas, cannot really be called "good". But for me, when I watched it as a teenager, it was pretty fun. (I didn't even know that BATTLE was in front of the stars.) In retrospect, it has something nostalgic about the SF wave of the early 1980s and the special effects of that time. His fragile old-fashioned appearance and his naivety give a certain attraction. To enjoy this movie, I recommend focusing on the paternal relationship between Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. Besides, I liked the idea that many villains discover their heroic qualities after being reluctantly confronted with the challenge of taking care of the child.
