Direction and writing of the famous / infamous Edward D. Wood Jr., using a pseudonym (Daniel Davis), who plays the lead role of Glen / Glenda. It is an almost radical documentary on transvestism; The wood itself is a transvestite with a fetish for Angora sweaters. It seems that the mile of footage and incoherent Bela Lugosi is used to stretch this strange and awkward movie for 67 minutes. Police Inspector (Lyle Talbot) seeks enlightenment from psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) to better understand the emotional and dispositional solution of transvestites. Also in cast: Delores Fuller, "Tommy" Hanes, Captain DeZita and Wood's sister Evelyn. Note: Farrell also acts as a narrator. And Fuller later helped write the songs included in Elvis Presley's films BLUE HAWAII, KISSIN 'COUSINS & KID GALAHAD.
