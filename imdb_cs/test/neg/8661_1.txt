As a fan of almost any drama season, and to that great fan of Jane Austen, I was horrified by this adaptation. As a 1999 version of Mansfield Park fan, I constantly compared these two things, which was very short. He felt extremely rushed and very one-dimensional, so he quickly became bored. The relationships, especially Fanny and Edmund, seemed to be not very slight and, despite being placed in a beautiful location, have a small atmosphere. Despite the fact that she was looking forward to Jane Austen's season since Christmas, I turned it off after an hour and went to sleep. I'm going to be interested in following the Persuasion and Northanger Abbey adaptations, which I don't have any powerful version to see if they keep me that way.
