I saw this movie and I thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I get into intellectual romantic movies. This movie didn't move me. I felt like it was about an hour. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor who loses almost everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad and descending. If you like the tragedy, you like MIGHT. I thought it was too long, which means he has a lot of useless scenes, which leads to one hour of boredom. I wouldn't recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy, watch the Titanic.
