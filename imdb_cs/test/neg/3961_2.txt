Dog can act ... unfortunately no one else in the cast of this filthy childhood film can not. A stray but very clever dog plunges into the lives of two helpless children, which is much to the confusion of their bitter and cold father. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the evil widower forbids his children - who may or may not be mentally challenged - from playing with Benji. Neither children nor Benji listen. Soon children are kidnapped and Benji must help the police find them. It is only when the old man realizes that Benji is good, not bad. Tom Lester, whose only previous acting experience seems to be playing matte Eb on GREEN ACRES, plays one of the kidnappers. Unfortunately, Deborah Walley overreacted. Walley's previous triumphs include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and WoDful WILD BIKINI. She also played both Gidget and Tammy in the past and here attempts to exterminate her good girl's reputation by playing it bad! BENJI STAY ... it's a dog and this movie is a dog!
