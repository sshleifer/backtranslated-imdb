Terrible Scam: controversial film, winner Teddy in Berlin 2003, Mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. All actors recite (not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet, but it would end up with a dubious bet: it will remain in the superficiality of the two guys kissing and the guy whose lover is gone; it has no meaning: nothing to do with homo-sexuality presented in other films (eg Julian Schnabel's Night Falls Falls (2000)). The only thing that works technically is photography; Otherwise, the camera is put in strange angles (to be more of an artistic film) and the whole film runs in a black and white atmosphere. The film is so challenging that it botheres you. I mean, it's good to be tough when you have the talent for it. Or maybe it's such an art cinema that it's incomprehensible. Story slowly, slowly, slowly. For me, more forms than essences. Great Edition? It was good. Great direction? Don't think about it: the film is weak. It was an interesting project. It is a shame. It is a mistake. One star out of four.
