This film is based on Stephen King's novel, in which a mysterious new businessman, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow), offers every Castle Rock citizen the item he wishes most - but a big price is needed for these transactions. Local Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) is soon forced to deal with a number of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances. Stephen King's Below Average Movie: I See Why Some People Think It Was Boring. He does this without offering real fears and forcing the viewer to spend time (once more) with a lot of repulsive losers whose hate for himself is scary. I like the novel and I don't believe this clumsy movie does justice. There are too many unfortunate changes from book to screen. Von Sydow makes Gaunt too charming. We assume that we should be at the right time GAROVA Gaunt, who would not like him. I also hate me that Sheriff's primary representative (Ray McKinnon) is written and portrayed as such annoying Barney Fife. The star Ed Harris looks as if he is forced to do this image with his agent, but the professional he is, really sinks his teeth into his dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (as Pangborn's Polly love interest) and Amanda Plummer (in one of her standard mentally unbalanced roles) come closest to creating characters that are sympathetic. Yet it is also foul and reason. Although I will be brave if he did not feel a little hostile watching a lot of unlikable movie characters tear to pieces. The peak has some good explosions. Often I give movies a better rating than they probably deserve, but in this case I feel like I should be really honest and just say: 3/10.
