I'll give it to you: he tried it. He tried to do it well and even Luke Wilson got involved. Luke Wilson is good, but he can do it. She cannot deal with the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdeveloped. Running "gag" with a tyrant was asinin. He has never been funny and I'm tired of gagging really fast. And the barefoot boy was also a little weak. Hitchhiking to Florida? Yeah OK. The film sometimes felt like an average children's film with this underlined mantra: adult stupid, intelligent children. And the piece is tiring. But the only moments that were funny were the Wilson police cart, who was driving around when he lost his car. I loved the little cart, especially when Wilson turned on the sirens. But besides, nothing else is worth my time. "D-"
