Such pain! Pain in a shape that he promised in his central thought, but never fully recognized it, and continues to blow a lot of sand into his face. I wouldn't say this live video from South Africa / Canada / UK is terrible, but it's just too bland, predictable, and little to remember. It's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after watching. I tried to watch it last night, but I had to finish it in the morning because I couldn't open my eyes. Even then, I couldn't remember where I got, which again watched me from the beginning. The only thing that hit the chord was the sharp cinematography of Andreas Poulsson from the vast, cruel and terrifying places of the desert. A nice shiny chic creates a remarkable visual sense that can't save the film from this total empty feeling. Everything else is under steam and almost leaves. Like exposing the beast on the head. Huh. The computer-generated special effects of the sinister monster are tolerable, and there are some terribly flashes of stripped flesh and bones. But there is too little because there is no hidden fact that clich√© scripts want to think about a conflict of generic characters to build tension and insecurity. That would be okay if the bad scenario were more than just a basic, shallow fluff, because it never created any strong, lasting tension, but made it an uninteresting job. Leading characters are superficial and token support falls into the trash. It's your stereotypical bunch. The performances of Scott Bairstow and Warrick Grier are colorless and beautiful Rachel Shelley is trying, but she looks rather tired.
