I'm a huge fan of Doctor Who and I'm still, but I was very disappointed when I started watching this new series. Children under the age of 15, or better still 10 years old, will probably be the best, and maybe new fans who have not seen any of the original series, but as far as fans of the original series are concerned, they will find that this series Lack of much of the original series's magic so great that David Tennant forced me to appreciate how much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a 1st season doctor. I would recommend this series only to people who have not seen many of them. The original series, people who are under 15 years old, and EXTREMELY DIE HARD, who fans, everyone else is just laughing and murmuring the curse of the word about Russel T. Davies spoiled one of our favorite TV shows.
