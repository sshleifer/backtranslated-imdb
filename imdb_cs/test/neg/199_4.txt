He just stared at UbuWeb this early experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read it right, Orson Welles! Years before he gained the fame of "The War of the Worlds" and his feature debut Citizen Kane, Welles was 19 years old who just found his muse. In addition to Vance and Welles, there was another player, Virginia Nicholson, to become Orson's first wife. He plays a woman who is sitting on something hiding back and forth with the permission of an African American servant (Paul Edgerton on the black floor). During this time, a person (Welles) keeps her (repeating politely). I won't reveal any more, except how interesting the silent images were when they were constantly jumping. That doesn't mean it is good, but it was fascinating to watch the guitar score (Larry Morott) added in the 2005 press I watched. It is worth looking at Welles enthusiasts and anyone who has the taste of the avant-garde.
