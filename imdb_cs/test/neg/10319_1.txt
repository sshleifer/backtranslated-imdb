I watched 5% of this movie tonight and maybe you can tell me that I have to see the whole movie to understand, but frankly, I don't think so. <br /> <br /> What the hell is this movie movie? I saw a lot of people running around in the factory, shooting everything around them. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well .. <br /> <br /> 1) They shot around the place like it was a Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The whole place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparkled on metal surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No ricochet. Metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets, but apparently no one has been hit by a stray bullet. <br /> <br /> 3) Magical Bullets? In one scene, a bad guy stands in front of a good guy when another good guy jumps behind a bad guy and pours him with a full metal. You see the bullets leaving the chest exploding in bloody fog, but the good guy right in front of him doesn't hurt at all! 4) After a human being splashed across the wall, two good guys talk to each other about jokes and laugh and look like teenagers playing soft-guns. <br /> <br /> 5) Sound? At one point, good guys cut off the wire and turn off the alarm (who the hell cuts the wire just to trigger the alarm?). Mistress screams "Alarm in sector blah blah" and bad boss boss says "Okay .. this .. .. .. .. .. drill .. blah blah" in very, very amateur a little way. Ooh, we're being attacked by terrorists, this is not an exercise, but I will sound like I'm not bullshit. <br /> 6) Focus !! First, you see the coward being loaded onto the guns. For some reason, the same guy gets twice the same Uzi. Deja vu or loop of scenes? You literally see how every bad guy gets the same kind of weapon and locks and loads the same way. The gun dealer appears in the clip and the bad guy doesn't. XX locks and loads. When they started to open the fire, you should see the barrel. Boooring !! 7) Actors or dummies? One of the good guys supposedly throws a smoke grenade for some reason, and of course the bad guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they're smokey blind or something they can't see. Cough and moan as if it were Anthrax in a grenade. Then a semi-boss bad-guy arrives and he doesn't cough when he enters the smoke, just pulls away the other evil people and suddenly realizes that smoke is not the same as Anthrax. <br /> <br /> 8) B flick? I think yes! The guy who slid down the metal tube and grabbed Uzi in his right hand shot someone at eye level. I'd like to see a guy with one hand fire uzi, and I'd like to see him go by hand. Extra bloody gore mess in B swipe a little way. A small * jump * and a red hole with a torn shirt shows that this guy is dead. Although the first bullet hit his heart, a good guy who is a super-trained green beret still feels the urge to empty his clip into a dead guy. 9) One of these trained soldiers jumps out of his skin with a blank clip! How stupid can you be!? Always check your clip before facing an unknown number of enemies! 10) Boring scenes. Like a barrel of lightning scenes and lock and load scenes, the film is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in a seemingly empty building. Cut to action if you're going to F Blick, please. <br /> <br /> My two cents for this movie.
