It's scary! It's like someone gave the baby a defective video camera and $ 30 and told them to make a movie. Even then you would have a better and more professional movie than this. The story is so stupid that you can say there is none. I don't think the one who did it knew what to do at all - watching all the foreign art films throughout the day is not enough to become an immediate director. Acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and writing is just awful. The only scene I hated was the one that was in a caravan accident, but that just meant it was a little less awful than the rest of the movie. How do people get money for these things? I don't mind alternative films, but shouldn't they be big smoking piles of cow dung? If it wasn't an insult to the amateurs, I'd call the "amateur prize". That wouldn't be a good movie if you were drunk or drugged!
