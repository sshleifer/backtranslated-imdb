I bought this thing used in the "clearance bin" video game store. I wanted the guilt of what I warned to look too intense; I wanted a shock value. I wanted to feel guilty and wrong when I watched "forbidden movie". I was very disappointed. Cannibal Ferox doesn't work because it's so erratic and fake. Most of the time the camera won't show you "shocking" stings, chops, slicing - just see the consequences. (See breast crochet details in detail). Special effects are fine. Nothing that tells you about violence is real. "Cannibals" are apparently poor people from Central / South America who were dressed as jungle savages and said they were supposed to act. Obviously these people were all over the picture to get some money or food, or both. Again ... just not convincing. However, as everyone else has said, there is some real killing of animals. This is the extent of realism. For me, it was more shocking than any emptying, scalp cutting or castration, and even the death of animals was not at all like that - maybe just sad.
