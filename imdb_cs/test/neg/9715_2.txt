It's a pity Mike Meyers chose this for his dramatic debut. This film looks like it was assembled by a committee that could not decide whether it was a comedy, drama, suspense or science fiction. It's getting a little playful, then it gets dark quickly and then at the end, apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed, the whole family stands in the yard of laughter about something. It's totally weird and impossible to push together. Acting is extremely uneven, older professionals pay attention, and then younger and less experienced actors seem to be in high school. This film has shown me that it is harder to make a good film than is evident from the truly professional fare we see in the first and art house. That would be a good movie class for analysis. Fence, character, theme, consistency - in this movie are either wrong or missing.
