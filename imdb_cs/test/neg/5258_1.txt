I haven't seen such a horrible movie that long. I was hoping that at least Adam Sandler might be funny ... hopeless. It looks like a teenager has written a script, and that's a dad who pushed it so much that someone agreed to shoot him. (Movie) The world could be a better place, no matter what it is.
