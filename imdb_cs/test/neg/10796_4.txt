Especially because I am one of the people who have never seen MST3K chopped up this movie, I can't comment on it. However, I saw the original version of this movie on the Sci-Fi channel and thought it was as good as anything else on this channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their better offers. I noticed that I noticed the comments that people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a model of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to have just as a few things about this film and right. In my original cut, most sensible people think it would probably rate at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. Five is average for me and I think this movie is about the average for Sci Fi pic. Contrary to the above, I also noticed that reviewers who seem immature, boring and flip, and consequently look like bone heads from where I stand, are the same ones who This movie will find nothing good and basically it's a waste without a cause on MOSTLY when they saw it being chopped and fricasseed on MST3K. Or if they saw both cuts, they seemed to be greatly affected by MST3K viewing.
