Worse movie I've seen. Like other honest reviewers, it's just an excuse for getting naked birds with their juggs out. Don't be mistaken, naked women aren't a bad thing, but there's another film genre. Friends are paying attention. I sold it to my girlfriend as a classic round gang fest (due to review) to be greeted with each other scene full of naked women gyrating about the spot. Slap on chops for me. <br /> <br /> What makes me laugh most is all dogey bike dives that went into the movie were full of models with cosmetic work - what biker bars have these? They are usually slightly deer with tattoos and far saggier juggs! The effect is terrible, a lot of nonsense swearing and a complete waste of story time. Did anyone check Vinnie Jones' attempt at an American accent? It's as embarrassing as his football skills. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. The only reason you would watch this movie is if you're a young boy who doesn't have access to p @ rn and has a nickname from their parents' movie collection for a pair of pervy kicks!
