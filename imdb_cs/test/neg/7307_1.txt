A really big leap forward in the perfection of painful cinematography. All about this movie is bad. Negotiations (if they can be called), lighting, sound, script (if any), editing, directing, working with the camera, that's all terrible. There is no single element to do well. If I thought it was intentional, then I could give the movie some credit, but I can't believe people would go to do such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This film is worth buying and displaying the worst enemies.
