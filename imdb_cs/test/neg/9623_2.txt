When I enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in "The Dream Hunters") in the past, I thought Mirrormask was a sure thing and I was very disappointed. Beginning, live-action movie section was interesting enough. The relationships between the characters were believable and easy to empathize with, and I loved Helena's sets, costumes, and artwork. However, the following computer-generated scenes were unbearable. The dialogue was annoying and arrogant, the interaction between live actors and CGI scary. The events occurred for the weakest reasons, and most events seemed unnecessary to what existed. I was just looking at the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, so I'm not exactly an authority, but I strongly recommend that you keep none of this and stick to Gaiman's strong written work.
