For the first time when I saw it, it was when I was dating, and she thought it was an amazing movie. I'm not. The second time I saw it was on TV last night. It still sucks. As a love story he sucks. As Julia portrayed a street hooker, it is repulsive. For me, the librarian was a miniskirt and heel. She had no hard shell for her. She was not tortured, anxious, angry, hungry or anything else. Her character "HOOKER" was as bad as a comparison of cubic zirconia with a diamond. Two just don't fit, no matter how they look. The only cast that I felt worth watching was the two bitches of saleswomen that were great cast. They did a great job of hating them on the screen in seconds. They had a real definition, for smaller roles. OK, so the movie wasn't completely wasted ... two unconscious sellers saved the movie. Apart from the two sales women, the rest of the cast ... including the big names was just bullshit. Either one was an ass-kiss, or he had absolutely no reason to fill any dialogue in the film, except for the compliment of Julie Roberts or kissing his ass on Richard Gere. This was a movie about how to walk around in high heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people looking at you and the people who work at the gawk hotels look like they just have a baseball bat struck in face. While in fact women who are dressed up to nine in Beverly Hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree, but because they are not wearing gaudy Madonna looking for jewelry or patent shoes, they can look down on others who are doing . The hotel cast was terribly sad to watch, and anyone who had any real character had less than a minute of time on the screen. This is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even prostitutes who face rich customers on a daily basis with the hope that their lives work perfectly. The story is about July ia and Roberts is a PIMPED (yes PIMPED) multimillionaire in suit and limousine. She is still owned, she kept saying how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He is more controlling than a street pimp, but Disney / buena vista people massage him to facilitate swallowing. If Richard Gere was a black-toothed black man and AK- This film should be on his side instead of an attach√© case about how a woman must try to escape from the cruelty of prostitution. The same story, different characters will make a very different outlook. Oh yeah, change the white man to black or Asian or Spanish, let the land shop turn into a gun shop or narcotics, and the whole romantic comedy concept is discarded. As for me, Pretty Woman is still a waste, dressed with ribbons and bows. I like it 15 years ago when I didn't understand it and was led by Hollywood hype. I hate it now that I see around a nice decoration that is called "love". This film is not a romantic comedy. It's a story about how to control a woman if you have the resources and income to do it. This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, just like my TV screen. <br /> <br /> Do I hate it? Yes. Is it sucking? Yes I recommend it to you? NO ... well, maybe if I really hate you. <br /> <br /> Will this review be available? See you. Anyway, that's all.
