As in many past movies, you would think Hollywood would have learned it now, it's for a very unsatisfactory film, not to mention that the victim was alive first to pay the ransom. Maybe this film wants to recall these basic facts if it is to become one of us. Why a long walk in the woods and a man in town can walk through the forest without getting lost? Just an opportunity for some sentimental dialogue, which was meaningless at the end. I had to listen to some of the director's comments in the Special Features section, surprised by the great moves Redford had made in the past that he agreed to play in such a movie. The director's comments and reasons were weak. The best part of this movie was the scenery, you can't wait for the spring to come.
