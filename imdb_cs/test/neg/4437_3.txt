The best thing I can say about the "quintet" is that it's not as bad as I remembered being on my first browsing. But that doesn't mean it's good. This strange, sci-fi thriller isn't exactly like any other movie I've ever seen, which at least gives a new stamp. But it is a film border catastrophe and one of the worst Robert Altmans. It is clear on the DVD's special feature on "Quintet" that even Altman didn't know what the hell was. It is in some distant future when the world is at the time of the next ice age. The film was shot at the abandoned site of the Montreal Expo '67, and I must admit that it gives the film some interesting production design elements, even though most of them seem to be filmed in an ice shopping mall. Paul Newman, looking zonked, wasn't interested in anything that was happening around him, and Brigitte Fossey, playing drifters who wandered into this futuristic city and looking for Newman's brother. Soon Newman is captured in the deadly game "Quintet", which all bored residents play for lack of something better, and rules that are never clear to viewers. All we know is that the goal of the game is to kill all the others you play with and stay the only person alive. This gives these nihilist inhabitants their only excitement, because as one of them says in one point psychobabblish soliloquy, just by being close to death, one can appreciate being alive. The film is slow, ugly and actually unpleasant to watch for its inexorable darkness. It's almost as if Altman has deliberately set out to make a movie that no one wants to sit on. There are no characters - surely, the actors walk on the talking lines, but none of the lines really mean the power and impressive list of the Altman international actors that did not take place for this register. Only Bibi Andersson gives the closest thing to an unforgettable performance that could be seen in the film. Yet she still succeeds in creating an atmosphere, even if the atmosphere is pure, and it is strangely fascinating that observing a person who is slowly starving to death would be fascinating. Altman really hit the dry spell for nearly a decade of excellent movies. The "Quintet" followed closely on the heels of a cruel "wedding" and was followed in short order by the not so bad but mostly forgotten "Perfect Pair", which was "terrible" Health (which I never did). See because it's not available anywhere to see) and disastrous "Popeye". Thank God he bounced. <br /> <br /> Level: D-
