usually a film that starts badly remains poor in a monotonically descending pattern. This bad movie seemed better than it got into a steep dive. The action, apart from the male antagonist, was terrible. The storyline was basically set for the final main scene, which is probably good as a performance art, but it was useless in this movie. I don't know why this movie was made.
