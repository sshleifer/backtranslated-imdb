Clint Howard, the brother of more talented Ron, plays in this terribly horrible horror comedy about a mental case that gives kids ice cream and kills people. This film, which is trying to be a film that is "so bad that it's good" diversity, lacks this brand a good mile and instead has to be seen as "so bad it's ... well ... BAD" . Whether it is a constant cinema "shoes for shoes", a pillow stuffed with a "fat child", or a "horror" that brought me to sleep on a film, I don't know, all I know is that I hated the movie a guy who has a soft spot for B-horror movies). Paul Norman has decided to continue filming movies in the pornographic industry, both before and after his "mainstream" movie. A wise choice really as a terrible act, a pointless story and a ridiculous dialogue are much tastier when you see a porn star doing what it does. Funni enough enough Turkey has absolutely no nudity (another reason to avoid it) <br /> <br /> My class: D-
