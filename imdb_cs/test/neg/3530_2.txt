Let's see ... a handsome young stranger is new in town and walks on the local promenade. She meets a pretty girl, meets an unpleasant leader of a local club young vampire club, dares to follow them into this cave, gets into a conflict with a pretty girl, follows an epic fight ... it is not the Lost Boys, though it would be difficult to deal with it because I think that part of the carnival music is the same. (You have to pay license fees for taking a movie?) Even the end of this stinking bomb is faded from the Lost Boys. Makeup is under par, even for a low budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and exactly how much "Oh, I had this horrible experience" scenes of teen angst doing one movie needs? Humor is flat and stupid and, unfortunately, everything else is predictable. Yawning. The only horrible thing about this turkey is the promise of continuation, the idea that perhaps every distributor in the country will bet.
