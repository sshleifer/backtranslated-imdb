I was in this film next in filming in Dallas in July 1975. Some of the things you see today that you take for granted in the movie have been implemented in this movie. Film premise, costumes, special effects, acting. It was all over. It opened the door for films such as "Star Wars", "Terminator," "Matrix," and "X-Men" movies. Now people look at it and say, "This new special effects story doesn't add ..." She didn't have any computer graphics and such new movies these days. It had a story, a wonderful cast and a fucking director! The sites it was filmed as the Dallas World Trade Center, and Zale Building, and Ft. Worth water gardens were at the time the most modern and futuristic scenery in which to film. Director Michael Anderson was very creative and tried to show the perfect future that was flawed by human desires and fragility. It was my first film experience, the first of six films I was in. Watch it again and appreciate it more. This film was the foundation that set the standard for many of the great movies we enjoy now. My hand is flashing ... I have to run. Waiting Santuary ...
