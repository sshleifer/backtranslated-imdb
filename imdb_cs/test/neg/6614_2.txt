I saw it with great anxiety and my concern seemed to be well-founded. What was this film about? Knight? Season? Players? What? All the time it was everywhere. He had no tension (sorry, we all knew Bobby was going to curse and throw things), but Brian Denehy, a gentle actor, stumbles across the mail in anger and brings zero pressure. Cheaply shot, like MacGiver episode. The contrast of this major thanksgiving with the work of HBO made on the film Don King "Just in America" ​​show how to make sports biopics, warts and all. Notice that ESPN promoted hell and then never showed it again?
