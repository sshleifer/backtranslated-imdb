The idea of ​​the movie wasn't too bad: a horror movie shot in a corn maze on Halloween. The bad part of the work was the delicate camera work, ten million puddles and corn shots, and the guy took the maze for an hour and a half. I'm sorry, "corn." I picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where I live, and I thought it was a great movie idea. But considering everything, it seems that your average Joe might have the same idea and go much further with him. The fact that Bill Cowell acted wasn't too bad, I'd say it was pretty good. But his teammate's lack of talent did not help his efforts. Here is the hope that his next film will be easier to swallow.
