I was unhappy that I saw this movie in the house of friends. That's a waste of time. What a total and complete piece of bullshit this movie is! There is absolutely nothing funny about it, from the shower scene to the offensive and humiliating depiction of the Germans. There is no conspiracy, gagging, and in the end I personally wanted to beat John Leguizama with a wand. I thought John Woo movies were bad ..... this movie is officially the worst movie I've ever seen.
