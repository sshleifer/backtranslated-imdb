He saw the film at his premiere of Lawrence, Kansas. This tale of a group of dissatisfied highschoolers killing the ball queen competition was just terrible. This fails for many reasons - bad behavior, bad scenario, no clear point. But most of all it seemed as if the filmmakers were saying - "Hey, I have some money, so let's make a movie!" - without really thinking about it. Sorrowfully most indie movies that don't make it suffer just this mentality. They do not seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie ... or in this case a traceable movie. With this film, I am not ashamed to say that if I didn't know some of the crew, I'd go out. Simple.
