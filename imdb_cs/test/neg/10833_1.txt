Even the horrible 1 is a lot for this movie, everything that ended has made you cringe. I don't think it is possible to cram more clich√©s into one piece of mind that is insensitive to the film. The prison block H meets the Thunderbirds, hell even Virgil's expressions were more lifelike than his son. I haven't finished it yet and I'm here now ... Oh no, the cheesy clapping of the 3 actors and scenery that made the child with the premiere of Adobe. This is really the end of my "I started, so I'll watch" the stage. Oh joy, the credits came to save me. (and relax)
