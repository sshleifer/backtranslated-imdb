I saw cheesy kung fu combat movies. Living in Taiwan come to the scene of sitcoms in America. I have seen films that do themselves, but this film belongs to a sad category of martial movies that are taken seriously with hard actors, terrible props, and terrible music. I really felt sorry for the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad must be to be a composer who has to churn out bullshit like what I thought should be named "Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op. Horn "or Bold" Helicopter Flight ". Then the battle scenes ended and the credits rolled. They actually had me in tears. If "special effects" were not enough evidence that this is a low-budget budget, the fact that only two or three crew members, probably local residents, who are good for a very needed Phillipin economy, were probably only made to save money from This series of movies have ever done something. They rented equipment, despite the continuation of this film. That was pretty funny too. The thing that really went to me was not music (which half-expected me to see an animated Sargeant Slaughter from GI Joe), but the end ... I suppose it would be a spoiler if there was a conspiracy to go wrong when the American Ninja drops the girl into Jackson's arms and then takes off his mask, I wanted to see him jump off the roof and Jackson got the girl caught. I think it would be a perfect punchline for this movie joke.
