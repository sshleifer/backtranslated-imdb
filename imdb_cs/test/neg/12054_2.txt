What can I say. CO F ** K? There's really not much to say. The only way you want it is, if u like, like bad horror laughter. <br /> <br /> ACTING- VERY INCORRECT! Check out the last scene with the main actresses! Rip-off Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but the wrong way! Just awful! Gore- Really unbelievable. In one scene, they use one of those knives that have a cut piece that fits over part of the body, etc. Using this, with the addition of red ketchup, its supposed 2 look real, though it really isn't. br /> <br /> Fence-predictable 'kids get lost in the woods on a weekend camping' movie ripped off Friday the 13th. that someone would choose it as their costume. Of course, the director realized that all the good costumes were used in all the other horror camps outside. <br /> <br /> TOTAL- 3/10 * / ***** Keep away from CAMP BLOOD II That he did it as Lord of the Rings.
