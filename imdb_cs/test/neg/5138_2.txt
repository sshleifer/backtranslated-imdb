A forgotten pilot who never explains why Nostradamus is really important to plot this movie, but Rob Estes plays hunky cop who becomes Nostradamus for some reason and who fights with time-travel medieval monks running around arms and setting people to fire apocalypse. Yeah, there's also a sexy FBI agent who happens to be a pyschic and trying to get Rob to trust everything before it's too late. Too bad they couldn't predict a better plot. Yawning. <br /> <br />
