Hardly came the whole movie ... Acting is wrong, the dialogues are even worse. I felt that it was a bit like 4, but it was named as one of my favorite games. Even the sound. In certain parts of the movie, background music is so loud that I have to lower the volume. It would be great if it was a competition for who can spoil more. Oh and PS: I don't know what a "Uwe" guy is capable of creating ... I'm sure not. I think this film is bad just because it's a director. I checked the list of his work and this is his first (and probably last) creation I saw. <br /> <br /> over and over.
