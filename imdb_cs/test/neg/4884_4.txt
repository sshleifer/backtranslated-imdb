It is very interesting to find another reviewer who has exactly the same reaction to this movie as me: It was a hell of a lot better when I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> When I see it more than 30 years later, it's still fine, but I was only slightly interested. What seemed extremely fun at the time was just a little fun. Also, what amazed me as a 10-year-old became so stupid. For example, in one scene Trinity walks and shoots his revolver behind him and kills two men without looking at them. In fact, he didn't even bother to look and see if they were dead because he knew he'd hit the mark. Um, yeah, all right. Besides, a lot of dialogue sounds pretty wooden. I'm sorry but 35 years later, it really didn't fly that well. Although it has been a long time since I have seen that one anyway, probably a better Terrence Hill movie than this would be to be my name is no one.
