All I can say is that this film is made for the Lifetime Channel on TV, which means that no solid characters, no special style, weak playing of all kinds of suggested sex, but not breasts and tushs (because the boy who would catapulting the film into the depths of the sleaze wouldn't it be?) but a very simulated sex, okay, that's okay. <br /> <br /> When watching these movies, do I have to ask myself when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers grow up? I think these companies are actually over time. They really have no idea what the younger generation is in line with, and if they knew they would demand change. Many American television channels, such as these, appear to be largely a repetition of the same disinfected, diluted waste over and over again as a generic film assembly line. I think it works for them ... or at least it does. Yet you are unsure of the future. Don't be as dead as I am. Look for some real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Every channel that puts effort into your work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or can't show.
