This movie is so horrible that it's funny, not quite at Troll 2, but still fun. Acting is terrible, music is cruel and the story doesn't make a blind sense. The story revolves around a man dressed in a terrible grandmother costume killing a lot of people at a party. Deadly scenes are so poorly made that they are cheerful. One girl is stabbed repeatedly in her chest, but she does not cry, try or defend herself, nor escape. She is also able to stay standing despite repeated stabbing. Another deadly scene with the rope is also very cheerful. The idea doesn't seem to get into the plot. My grandmother seems to have moved magically from one area to another (for example, hiding under the leaves in the woods where the victim is standing, appearing in front of someone, even though behind them ten seconds earlier) a bad time (would you stop someone if you were persecuted by a murderous maniac) and the double twist at the end is absolutely ridiculous, it seems they just threw it just to confuse people. I would advise people to watch this movie if they love horrible horror movies like Troll 2, Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but don't look at it if you expect a horrible horror movie, you'll be disappointed
