It was so bad that I couldn't even reconsider. So I'll write a few sentences about what I've been witnessing, and it's up to you to decide. Captain Kirk, with toupee and tubby gut, is a rock climbing El Capitan Yosemete. Spock meets him on a floating skateboard hovercraft. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, catches his thumbs before Kirk hits the ground. Later, at night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy eat beans around the campfire. Spock likes beans. Then Kirk and McCoy sing "Row Row Row Your Boat" and want Spock to join the three-way harmony. Spock doesn't want to sing. And later that night they disagree. "But life is not just a dream, Captain." Should I move on? Well ... The renegade Vulcan, who happens to be Spock's half-brother, leads a rebellion on a sandy planet - a hostage. The company crew lands on the planet, and Uhura, who pushes fifty-five and weighs two hundred odd pounds, attracts natives with their bare feet. But they cannot deceive a brother who claims to find God. He kidnaps the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a large bearded revelation claiming to be God burns fire on Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Spock's sibling realizes it's not God — but it's really a form of self — or something — connected with revelation to destroy it and… sparks fly. After things become too complicated to explain to Klingons who resemble Lorenzo Lamas ... <br /> <br /> Three Amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - Return to Yosemite mention, Kirk wore a GO CLIMB AND ROCK T-shirt?). Spock is playing some funky Vulcan guitar, singing "Row Row Row Your Boat", this time all three of them roll together.
