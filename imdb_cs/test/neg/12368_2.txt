The movie was pretty bad. It's not so much a scenario problem. It's just that the movie is really boring when it comes to stimulation. It seems that the film slowly passes through the slow, painful speed. The San Franpsycho story is that there is a freelance killer who kills morally corrupt individuals (maybe I read too much but hey, that's my nature) after San Franpsycho kills a few people under the Golden Gate Bridge we introduced one of the main characters of the film: Joe Estevez (brother of Martin Sheen) as a police policeman named Bill Culp. Bill is currently trying to kill the murderer (he really doesn't have a name, he's just The Killer) and tries to force a local journalist named Rita to help him investigate, Bill is a stereotypical hard-threatened policeman and threatens Rita to her she plunged into jail for an obstacle to justice. Anyway, a few scenes go through, and suddenly Rita finds a psychopath letter (he's a cold bloody psychopath!) And she has a change of heart and tells Bill and his partner Joe and helps them investigate. The film tries to be a tense murderous thriller. It's like a Black Dahlia movie trying to be tense, but it's incredible. The film is trying to be serious, but it has scenes like that where The Killer masturbates (apparently a fan of gore porn, what with lines like: "ooh blood on her" or something like that) and Joe Estevez hitting the table to go: "Is it I admit he's giggling in the movie more than once, though I'm sure it's supposed to be a deadly serious movie. <br /> <br /> One of the positive points of the movie is the fact that I didn't pay to make it And it is sad because I saw something good in my movies after watching The Damned. Sure, the movie had its fair share of the defects, but it was nice. Unfortunately, San Franpsycho has nothing to do. that is a good script, it's not that big, but it could be interesting, instead of what you get, there's a murderous thriller that can't get excited or even vaguely pleasing deaths. which is sh "I've been watching a different movie, because about one hour I found out what's going to happen. The end didn't bother me a bit. I'd like to insult this wreck of the movie, but I don't think I'll be. The short story short of this film is a boring uninspired thriller (I use that term freely) that fails to have "Hitchcockian excitement" that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending, bland death, playing with all the wood board emotions and a respectable soundtrack. I'm sure others will try to defend it in the usual way: it was a low budget movie, they did the best they could with such a low budget, and all the other nonsense. But when we get to the point that it is very little, they could actually spend this budget, there were very few special effects, the soundtrack sounds like it could be recycled from Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned it's the same damn crew of the two movies. This movie really reminds me of a lot of another low budget that wasn't good, and it was called Mr. Jingles, the two of them are of the same quality, they can't bring anything close to enjoyment and they should quickly disappear into the unknown.
