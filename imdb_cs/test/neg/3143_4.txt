What was supposed to be the dramatic story of life on the Murray River seems to be a silly, crazy romance about an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with the Aussie flag) who falls into the first officer (John Waters) of the steamer. The first half of this four and a half hour mini-series shows some promise, but soon it becomes flat as it becomes predictable and thin. Some true dash and spark were needed in the plot to give the film some life. The early departure of Gus Mercuria did not help because his character seemed to be the only interesting one. <br /> <br /> Maybe a longer TV version is more deep because this video translation was definitely missing.
