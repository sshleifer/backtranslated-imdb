I was really looking forward to this movie, but unfortunately it wasn't expected. A good movie has viewers who identify / empathize / sympathize with the main actor. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to do with Samantha Morton. The plot seemed very incoherent and didn't go as it should. Keifer Sutherland A little bit more than just dressing up the windows and frightening me why he agreed to play what seemed to be a little part of it. Beautiful Scenery and Acting Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis were the only plus. <br /> <br /> Perhaps by being a kiwi I set the bar higher for locally made movies. Perhaps the change of director / allegedly hard work with the main player has taken my view. <br /> <br /> I may be trying to make excuses for a movie that could be great. Lots of maybes that still don't explain why this movie lacked something special. It could have been great, it wasn't.
