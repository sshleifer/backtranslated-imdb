This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that for 90 minutes of total torture I have probably watched my watch for about 70000 times! Lucy Bell is so taller than the bullshit, and for her, this low is pretty depressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in was hysterically laughing, but most of them were Greek or Italian, so I think this humor will probably laugh at them, but not me. All this movie does is that you are sick and watch all these slackers who apologize for their silly actions for 90 minutes. God, and I can never get 90 minutes back!
