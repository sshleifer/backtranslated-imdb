I am very surprised to see the good rating of this movie. I watched the film 9 years ago and I still remember how upset I was sitting in the cinema looking at this mess. I'm a big fan of John Boorman's work. I really like his movies. So I went to "Beyond Rangoon" with great expectations. But I felt like watching a stupid, cheap Chuck Norris jungle movie with all the action scenes cut out. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. I can't believe director John Boorman was so bad. I think Burmese people deserve better movies to illustrate their struggle.
