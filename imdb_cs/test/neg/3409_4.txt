First, just to say that I didn't get the edition I thought I would - I chose the Italian version via R2, but what really came out was the 1998 British version - claiming it was a special edition - I never knew there WAS and UK DVD releases - but promised biogs wasn't actually on the disc - just a few duff trailers. As with the movie itself - just like I was recovering from "Night TRain Murders," my second genital mutilation thriller will appear in the same month - this time in a (Italian) British school schoolgirl who is offended and teacher Fabio Testi - ( unhappily married, but nailing one of his students - becoming the main suspect. On the case is Detective Joachim Fuchsberger. I'm sorry I was less than fascinated. It was traceable, but more than just missing, and besides the aforementioned horrible nature of the crime, "surprise" killing Cristina Galbo, who was actually "spoiled" by the DVD cover told me about it - Grrrrrr !!!! and a surprising twist that threw "victims" into a new light - I thought it was a very routine. Though it did not deter me from the two "sequels". with Karin (Hannibal Brooks) Baal and Camille (I Spit on Your Grave) Keaton.
