Quite transparent attempt to make money from a thriving British club scene, Sorted is a movie that shows promise in certain departments but does very little. The perfect thriller plot (which is just to combine the club sequences together), the variable acting performance and the pretty ridiculous scenario, everything has stopped. Although Jovy is sometimes over forgiveness (especially when he uses often poorly fitting dance music) he does show the potential and lack of a drug report is extremely refreshing. Overall, however, the film is a missed opportunity, and the prospect of a great club film will stay there somewhere. Observable yet.
