First, when is this happening? This has to happen after the first movie because Kuzco knows Pacha and Chicha have their third child, but after the second movie it can't be, because Kronk doesn't get a girlfriend or wife or something? You never see her at the show. Why does Kuzco go to school? The whole story is that Kuzco goes to school to be an emperor. But wasn't the Emperor before that? And who is the Emperor while learning to be emperor? Shouldn't it be Yzma? Or was Yzma already detonated in this timeline? And if that's true, why is he waiting for him not to become an emperor? In addition, you know that in the first film he was trained from birth to be emperor by private tutors. So he should know what he's doing. <br /> <br /> Kronk. Why is Kronk a student? It's about 25 said it in the first movie. He's a high school adult. Does everyone think he's a fool? I really like Kronk, but I think because of his age and because everyone knows he works for Yzma, he was supposed to be a teacher. Being a home Ec teacher should be up to his aisle. Raspberry is very impossible. He assumes it's Kuzco's love interest / moral compass. But a lot of time, she leaves the bossy and know everything. She commonly says thinks I like "I should be proud because I'm beautiful and clever". As for Kuzco, he has ESP and knows whenever he has trouble when he cheats, or even when he sings Hot Hotie in his head, even though he runs short stories, school papers and keeps A + in all their classes. It seems to be interested in making Kuzco decide to do the right thing and do it well in school. In fact, Kuzco seems to be more maternal than love interest. <br /> <br /> Yzma. When I bought myself before Yzma tries to get Kuzco to fail, she becomes an empress. Not sure how it works with being fired and all. Yzma seems to be experiencing the first film in every episode. Almost in every show that appears in it, Kuzco turns the animal into hopes of failing in the classroom. (There are only 3 times I think it didn't happen.) The jokes about Yzma being old aren't as smart on the show as it was in the movie. And classic Yzma jokes are used to death on the show (like "Pull the level, Krunk!", Roller coaster, and lab). Also some other points that make no sense in this series. The fact that whenever Kuzco is assigned something that everyone behaves as a task, it will let it pass or fail in the classroom, but it seems to pass on all the tasks assigned to it. So why does one assignment matter so much? Seriously, who rules the kingdom when it happens? Do they have a consul or a steward? You will never see anyone who rules the kingdom unless Kuzco has returned his powers or Yzma is the Empress. Why does Kuzco go to a normal peasant school? Shouldn't he learn how to lead a country, what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? I saw that I had some common classes on similar farms (so he would know how to prepare the land for famine or something like that), but knot knots? How useful? Now I know someone will say, "But they don't think it makes sense; it's probably funny." Then they should have more funny things there. All the funny things about the show have already been made in the movie. Also, if you notice that some of these huge hole holes, why poke fun on them like in the movie? (For example, when Yzma and Kronk get into a secret lab before Kuzco and Pacha and Yzma and Kronk can explain how they came first.) <br /> <br /> There are some good points, it's nice. See some of the characters from the first movie in the series like Bucky and the Monkey with a Bug. Pacha and his family are still very good figures with good ground feelings. I feel that this series would be fun for younger children. In conclusion, the series is not as good as the film on which it is based, but may be suitable for younger children.
