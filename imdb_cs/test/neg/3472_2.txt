For a good takeover of the Roman Empire watch the excellent BBC produced miniseries "I, Claudius". It was just soaked. The behavior was pathetic and you almost saw the actor looking at the camera. Hans Matheson teased. The cheese factor was so high that it supports constipation with repeated glances. Even Caligula was tame. I think this film was silently supporting "religious" groups that remain nameless;). The clear tones of Christian preference and persecution were glaring if it gave any hint. Stay away from what you're doing - running time is so long that I was able to read Harry Potter's first book faster than it took to see this tribe. Italy did better - don't let Hans deceive you cute. He's not a great actor ... it's a great scream.
