This film was a complete disaster for me. One thing is that films have to be watchable, and that's some psychological credibility of the characters ... unfortunately it's not here. The main characters behave irrationally most of the time, and although they have some reason to do so, the director is not revealing it to us. Sophie Marceau's character is particularly irritating, all the while doing anything to expect something more reasonable (like meeting a mother in a hospital) ... and why did she exactly marry that guy? (no, it's not a spoiler) Occasionally the plot seems to be ripped off by some soap opera, and while the performance of the actors isn't bad, it doesn't help much. All in all, I couldn't find a way to connect with this movie. Not that I tried hard after the first hour. I never left the movie during the movie, but this time I was closest to my life.
