The DVD for this film is Alpha Video - a company that almost always issues the worst prints. In Alpha's defense, it is often the only print available, but specializing in public domain and cheap movies. If you can find another print of another company, try it first because the print of this film is scratched and faded. Compared to most Alpha DVDs, however, this is great - especially since the sound is pretty clear (and Alpha never seems to contain closed captions - even with horrible sound movies). The man is dating a lady for a very long time. One night he is a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon after, he comes purely to his fianc√© about it, she forgives him and they marry. Very soon after the wedding, he gets a frantic call from another woman - she needs to see him and she just tried to kill herself. When they meet, he learns that he has an STD and wanted her to know that he could have it. And although there is a nurse and nursing her for suicide, she somehow finds a gun and kills! He's making a huge mistake. He won't tell his doctor and tell his new wife. Some time has passed and now she and the baby are infected! At this point, the doctor meets the guy and tells him about the importance of the treatment and shows him the rooms filled with terribly infected people (in fact, they were just movies of people with sexually transmitted diseases who got into the film - mostly who have syphilis). <br /> <br /> In some ways, the movie is very progressive. It solves a serious problem and it is interesting to see how the film encourages couples not to wait for the wedding, but to get married quickly and give up these sexual urges - but only each other (not bad advice at all). On the other hand, the film never says exactly what it is talking about. They never use the terms STD, VD or the like, nor can they name diseases. Often it is syphilis, but other times it is about herpes or other sexually transmitted diseases - the information is simply not very clear or specific - a very common problem with such films of that time. The listeners at the time had to feel quite confused about what they had seen, and many of the naive ones probably needed all their "faster" friends to explain to them! Speaking of "such films" in the 1930s and 1950s, many small and often lean production companies made films that upset the dangers of drugs and sex (though they often wanted to promise a little Cheesecake) pie for viewers who usually couldn't see such first-class tariffs in Hollywood movies). Many of them are hysterically funny because they are so exaggerated and the information is so inaccurate. The best-known examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (the same two-bit production company), and compared to how these two movies are delicate and stupid, this cheap movie seems to be in the Criteria collection !! Interestingly, there are strange things (I would definitely be included in them) that love movies because they're often so bad and so terribly that they are great fun. But this one is not so bad, nor is the message that is intricate and the film of the victims is not as grotesque as some similar movies. While the report should be clearer and more useful, it is quite good for the 1933 film - despite the occasional misconduct and the absurd suicide scene. Remember the children - say "NO" to suicide! By the way, the "two years of treatment" discussed in the film was in fact the norm for syphilis in 1933. Today, it is much more treatable - just like other sexually transmitted diseases.
