My mother made me watch this movie with her. She will probably watch anything with a vampire adviser. I was bored all over the world. In various places, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans commemorates Spartacus, Battle of the Planet of Apes, The Passion of Christ and Mandingo! It reminds me mostly of the Italian swords and sandals of the nineteen-sixties (not the good ones), who spend countless times when Greek or Roman despots in robes talk and constantly draw while you wait impatiently for a muscle man. the hero and his lover, usually the daughter of a despot, do something. This film was in dire need of some color and tension. The characters were pretty two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The sets seemed to be made entirely of tin! I wonder how many civil war chess sets have been melted to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone who wears hand stockings and black lipsticks, please click NO.
