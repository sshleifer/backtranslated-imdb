This is an embarrassing nhashhing of the same conspiracy in n-th bunch of idiots - young-adult-in-peril-because-they-are-idiots slasher film of the early millennium: this time we get the story of a crazy miner who returns from the dead to regain his gold from the hands of the usurpers. We have almost no excitement, almost no bare body (although the girls are really hot just one of them showing her bare ass for a few seconds), the usual bunch of horror storm stars in portrait roles (this time Karen Black, Richard Lynch, John Philip Law, Jeff Conaway), a lot of fake blood, just a crazy freak resurrected as a zombie is cool enough to let you get stuck - well not exactly - to the screen until the end. Don't waste time if you're not complete.
