Now I'll do it without making spoilers. My cousin and I rented movies over the weekend and we came across it with a giant scary scarecrow on the cover. It looked fine, so we rented it next to Kungfu Hustle. Wow ... Just ... Wow. <br /> <br /> To get started, the movie was terrible. Now, boxing art, opening the scene and music was respectable-to-well done, but the movie itself is terrible. Acting is subpar (Sean, lead, shows almost no emotions and / or effort in his character), scarecrows look like the one on the cover (perhaps false advertising, maybe?) And the camera shots and angles were bad wrestling events. And believe me, I'm a fan of the game. I know the wrong camera angles. And honestly, this is exactly there with Gigli and Pootie Tang. It's so bad that I enjoy it. That makes me laugh. So in some way, this movie takes place as a good comedy for me. To be fair, it serves as what to do and do not do in movies, especially in the film slasher genre. I encourage people to follow it just to get a good overview of what to avoid.
