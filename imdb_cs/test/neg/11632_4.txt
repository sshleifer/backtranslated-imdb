Some changes for the better (special effects are more sophisticated), some for worse (Scott Grimes, nice guy in the original, turned into an unpleasant teenager), but in general this sequel is about the same as the original - which doesn't say much. PG-13 is questionable; although the film is not scary at all, there is some short but quite explicit gore, and some out-of-place nudity. (* 1/2)
