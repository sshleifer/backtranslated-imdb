I'm a Christian and I've watched enough Christian movies, but this is too bad. They're trying to do it well, but I think it's too hard. <br /> <br /> - In many places you can see that the movie is badly dubbed. - You can almost think that the main people in this movie were the only ones who stayed. I think there will be a lot more. <br /> <br /> - Quality is bad and acting could also be better. The story is not so bad, but it could be better. All I give is the story in this movie, but I can't rate it more than 3/10. Watch "Left Behind" instead!
