Before Jonathan Demme hits international acclaim with The Silence of the Lambs, he cut his teeth to create unpredictable comedies. It was one of them, and just as a few well-known American Oscars comedies might mention, it has a great concept, it is well stimulated, it has great performances, complicated romance. but it's just not very funny. Pfeiffer is a mob widow who moves to the city's shoulders after the murder of her husband (Baldwin). The chief of crime who killed him (Stockwell) chooses Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and complicates things. Pfeiffer also falls on a cop watching her. All this should be a minute of laughter. Pfeiffer, a sports and great wig is as good as a widow as well as overactive Ruehl and Modine is also good as a nice cop. But the script is simply devoid of single-row, witty, humorous or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film requires. As a result, it raises smiles at best rather than guffaws. It radiates magic, but is boring short on humor.
