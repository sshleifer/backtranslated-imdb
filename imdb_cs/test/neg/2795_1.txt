CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS. This movie was the worst movie ever. I couldn't even watch that it was so bad. This movie is actually worse than a scarecrow killer who says a lot. It was worse than terror, which was at least horrible. Even the film in the movie wasn't good. Shooting was false and the acting was worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip this. If you see it in a rental shop, start another route. There's nothing good about this movie. If you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch the Scarecrow Night or Pumpkin Head. If you want to see a new film about cheese film, watch Scarecrow. This movie is 0.2 out of 10. That's the horrible movie. LARGEST FILM.
