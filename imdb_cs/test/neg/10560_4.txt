As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years, I have been very hard to watch this movie. Too unreal. It seems that the producers of this film either did little or no research, or didn't care. Card tricks are something you would never see in a real poker game. Sanity? Plus, it was full of movie cuts and so on. Who couldn't do that? Cheating was amateur. Palming, marked cards, etc. Would you sit in a high-limit game where they use open cards? Would you sit in a game where players push their chips into the center of the pot (constantly), mix them and then just recruit how much they bet? Come! I gave it 4 because twists and turns can be interesting for some people, but for those who know how to play the game, it will be quite painful. Next time they should use real players and get some insight into how to do it right. OUCH !!!
