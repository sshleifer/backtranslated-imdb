(r # 64) <br /> <br /> Unredeemable, no merit, and especially sad waste. You know the film will be bad when Lance Henriksen is his only star power. The French title for this film says everything: "Inexplicable". How can you make this movie incredibly bad nowadays? Whether it's Jonas Quastel's trick, it worked. This is Ã¼ber-trash, I'm talking 'Manos'-level crap, senseless, unnoticeable, no-even-so-bad-to-good, top-level bile film. Lance Henriksen It's Harlan Knowles, a character who might be interesting if he wasn't so devoid of features or personality. He, along with lots of ants, goes on an excursion to seek evil Sasquatch who is believed to have invaded a plane that crashed in the forest or something. Nothing else will happen. There is some soft-core (meaning: Teletubbie level) nudity and some obvious rip-off "Predator". After 92 minutes of total pain and another torn scene, this time from the movie "Blair Witch", the film finally stagnates across the finish line and ends. As a bonus, we see the monster alone for only one or two scenes throughout the movie. There's not much to say about this movie. All you need to know is that it's a very bad movie and it's not worth seeing as a "so bad-is-good" movie. "Untold" is the fun value of what Orlando Bloom is to play character. Avoid it as arsenic.
