I would not recommend it to anyone, except the cinema visitors who would like to laugh at the movie, not with it. A rather promising assumption and a set of actors is gradually deteriorating over the film, which ends perhaps the worst ending ever in the film. I'm not going to mess it up, but basically the most used set of movie clich√©s will do badly and half heartily for the most beautiful past five minutes of any movie. The film also features the most clinking inducing scenes ever, an attempt on-screen chemistry between the two main roles when we are presented with a close up of Angela Jolie stroking Denzel Washington's finger lovingly. It may be the only thing he could move, but why the viewer is approaching to approach Washington's finger, which is swallowed up in the middle of a darkened light and music suitable for the sexual scene is behind me. I laughed loudly and shook my head. The direction of the story borrows hard from Se7en, but here it is made much easier and too obvious. If you want to call it a poor man, Se7en would be underestimated, this is really nothing more than a TV movie and not even Jolie and Washington's efforts can convince them that this is a movie at the box office.
