I write it 10 minutes before the movie ends. I feel comfortable writing now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this movie will end. Assumption is pretty simple, angry dog ​​in a small town, killing people. Great - simple storyline for a good fun horror camp 80. <br /> <br /> Uhh ..no. The main problem is that it is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can say that it should not really be adapted to the movie, at least not with the same plot. Why? Cuz its boring! For the first 45 minutes, he tries to create depth to his main characters and create tension. However, it takes too long (half of the movie!) - the characters are unlikely and we don't care about them anymore and only about zero tension. The simplest film (according to drawing and time) to compare it with classic jaws. Everything Jaws do right, Cujo's doing it wrong. Jaws created good characters and a real sense of horror. Cujo won't do it. Jaws effectively create a scary, scary villain in their shark. Cujo has a dirty St. Bernard run for snarling and jumping, and not much else. Jaws are exciting and unpredictable. Cujo is a tireless boredom that is still predictable to the end. Also confusing is the plethora of subplots that only work as boring red effects on the movie's main scene. <br /> <br /> If this movie was rewritten for a big screen and had a better director, which could be good. But it wasn't. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The people who are here say it's one of the finest kings to edit - I'm sorry you couldn't be more bad. The fog is a hundred times better, thinner is ten times better, and even the cat is twice as good! This is, in my opinion, one of the worst! The only good thing was that the action scenes with the dog looked real, though they were boring. The movies ended, and it was no better. Avoid.
