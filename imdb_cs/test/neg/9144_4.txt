That's the answer. The question is: What is the only reason to watch this movie? I loved her in "My name is Julia Ross." This is one of the best noir movies ever. Noir or whatever could be called, it's a very disturbing movie. She is entertaining in one of the worst publishing studios of all time. That would be "Janet Ames' guilt." This one has a creepy, promising title. He has a good cast. He has a great director. I was expecting something dark. Maybe something a little inexplicable. Instead, it's an uninspired, routine spy movie. It's almost totally boring. At least it was for me. Mrs. Foch is captivating. And that's about it.
