Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I like bad TV movies. I love them. I got involved. Work. I want to get involved. I'll spend time watching that thing. I watched emmy on TV last night. How in the infinite world was the TV movie Empire Falls for all prizes? He really had amazing talent. Of course. And they tried admirably. But how can anyone pretend it was a good script? OK direction? You know, I wish everyone the best. Really. But I thought it was absolutely astounding that Hollywood placed this very bad movie on so many honors. Valuation? For me, it was like waking up that Hollywood is such a small island community. Being cynical is not really my business. But wow. --xptyngi
