Well, I've seen a lot of reviews on this, and a lot of promo has always shown the decapitation scene. But this movie is tough. And I mean it in all ways. It's hard to find a copy because it was a low budget independent release and because the MPAA was on the run for every copy on VHS, it came out unrated, but had to be rated for MPAA. The copies disappeared into the underground scene. All the people involved in this film never in biz. So this film made it unique. VHS copies will almost never pop up on eBay or other sites, and if so, you will pay over $ 100 to buy it. But thanks to American connections, I was able to catch DVD releases sold worldwide. Limited, but it was supposed to be official. Now and then there are still some projections of this splatterfest. But is it worth all that surrounds him? As already mentioned, it's hard to catch but also to sit. There are bloody murders, there is necrophilia, there is nudity, but there is also a lot to talk between coppers. And to be honest, if you wanted to see the movie in 5 minutes, watch the end, it's a flashback in the mind of the killer. Blood is flowing and really it's splashes, but not all 80 minutes, spraying galore for 10 minutes. The film quality is fine, the sound is fine, no syk, the colors are fine, the black is black and not blue as in many low budgets. It's okay to watch, but you'll never be afraid, but he's one who looks with his friends for beer and pizza. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
