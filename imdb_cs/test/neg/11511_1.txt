I do not find this show amusing at all. In fact, I think it's much worse than any other horrible sit-com. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie because she can't act. The jokes at this show are terribly rude, and that is even worse when the only member who has a little (and a little bit of) playing talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie's brother Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portrayed Sadie's friends. There are really stupid and just terrible actors. Two words that can really describe this show are terribly crazy. It's a stupid humor that only little girls find funny because their brains haven't developed yet. Now I have explained my hatred of acting and terrible humor, what will happen next? The show's premise is a stupid idea. She has changed again (not so faithfully Ben-loving) and suddenly nobody knows her? It's moronic. In summary, I hate this show, but little girls who have no idea about the fun will enjoy it, so I think that's what goes beyond quality. Although I can say so much, the first season is clearly better than the second. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: I CANNOT BE ANY IT. <br /> <br /> My rating: Terrible show. TV G. 30 min.
