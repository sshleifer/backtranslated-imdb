As others have said, it's a ridiculously horrible movie (NOT A FILM!). It's not bad in a funny way, just painful trying to endure. Don't waste your time. Erika Eleniak is quite hot, but there is one scene where she is in the bathtub, and you can see the wrap that covers her breasts under the bubbles. Also, she's still fat. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes are so bad that they are unnoticeable if you know or care about martial arts, or even decent choreography, and editing / effects are pointless. /> <br /> There is no paycheck, it does not go anywhere, and sucks to get there.
