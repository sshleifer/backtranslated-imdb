The recent release of "Mad Dog Morgan" on Troma's DVD is disappointing. It seems to be a censored print for watching TV. Some of the more violent scenes have been modified and parts of the color language have been removed. Whoever viewed the movie will be crazy about this toxic DVD version. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be released on DVD in its original theatrical style. However, even as released on DVD, the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in the nineteenth century Australia. After touring the old Melbourne Gaol, with death masks convicted on display, it is "Mad Dog Morgan" that comes to mind.
