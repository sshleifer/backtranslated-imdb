The very strange scenario of Cameron Crowe (following his "Fast Times at Ridgemont High") has little inspiration and false responses to stupid gages. At least "Fast Times" had a fair share of satire and sensitivity for his grotesque (with the kind permission of the good director, Amy Heckerling and Crowe's undeniable penchant for capturing the perfect teenager's letter); Here, Chris Penn (Sean's brother, natch) is an idiot who makes hell of life for a straight dart Eric Stoltz, and filmmakers seem to think he's cheerful. Jenny Wright has some good moments as a mall-worker, but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in the head-scratching subplot of a teen who seems to be infatuated with a shell-shocked ex-soldier. Queasy, confused nonsense gave a shiny shine and a soundtrack full of pop-rock tunes, but characters you would like to avoid. Supporting players Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving and Sherilyn Fenn are lost in silly roles. * of ****
