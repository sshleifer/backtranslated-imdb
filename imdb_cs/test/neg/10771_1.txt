Before I start tearing off this movie, I'll mark you - WE LOVE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. The story is one of the best romantic adventures he has ever written. The film staring Jane Gray is very good and the Broadway musical is the hottest thing there. I thought when I heard this movie was based on the fact that it would be great because it was a BBC movie. To my surprise, it was a faint, utterly stupid story that UTTERLY couldn't capture a wonderful story. There were no exciting escapes with daring disguises. There was no deep love for your heart to tremble as Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed as her husband left her again. Everything that was was a confusing plot and a lot of those -Blue sex and violence. Drop Me! What a terrible movie! <br /> <br />
