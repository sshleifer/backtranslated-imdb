I say "movie" because it doesn't deserve to be labeled "movie" and certainly not "movie". I'm sorry to have paid for the rental, and although I've never left the movie before, it would have been if I had seen it in the theater. Future underground society (oooh, that's the original), lots of burning barrels, unexplained ambient light shining through the windows, ungrateful woman and her shocked son ... the list goes on and on. C. Thomas Howell influences the husky voice of a stereotypical loner; You know, Eastwood was killed. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child, but in his memories he is at the same age! Talk about bad memory! I stared incredulously as the little boy Abe accidentally presses the code into the door and opens it! No tension, religious piths (what religion?) Under / subtleties ... the saddest of all: I expected better from Roddy Piper, <br /> <br /> A pretty worst movie experience in my life.
