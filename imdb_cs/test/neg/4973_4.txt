Now it's 2008, which has a world-wide care for a guy like DB Sweeney, and it wasn't a big deal even then. Two Paradise Tickets are an overview of a story that's right and true, where three friends have come across the road in each of their personal circumstances. Again, conspiracy proved. The problem with this movie, besides being "so bad it's a convincing" title, is the script. Cliché to the cliché three guys do the same things you saw in any other road movie ... and blow up the vanny white house. The role of John C. McGinley is great, especially when compared to DB Sweeney's. (His career is dead, and so late. Although I have heard that he is moving to television, it's good for him). Also John C probably has the least horrible character in the movie. The score is so general that it looks like you're watching the 1993 movie of the third, or Jeff Anderson's movie. Also, a few years back, but at least it was fun.) I think so, I think I enjoyed it. But the stupid guy is uncomfortable, DB is trying to be this great unsuccessful guitarist (with some brute influences, like some of the worst classic rock) who have a special relationship with a stripper and John C is a wife who is a baby and leaves him after the death of his father, as well as the visit of one of his followers to his bookmakers. <br /> <br /> I'm still thinking about how to improve this movie. But I think burning the script would be a good start. But as I have been suggesting all the time, it is not the worst movie ever. And every chance I have to see McGinley starring, I'll take it. Hopefully it will start getting some better projects.
