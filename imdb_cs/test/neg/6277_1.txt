I wish I could reset it. Surely I will admit that I also chose it by mistake and thought it was the Spielberg version. A clever marketing trick that releases it at the moment and is shown in the video store. However, I was willing to do it anyway - I wish I didn't. <br /> <br /> Where to start? I have read some of the other reviews, and I must say that I disagree with anyone who thinks an actor was good - I apologize even to C. Thomas Howell. None of the shows were good. Neither. Although the meeting was decent, dialogue is terrible! "Ginormus" and "dick skinners" just don't cut it. Now, as far as the story is concerned - it was terribly adapted and had to be adjusted for 5 years. The main character constantly runs into situations that are comfortable - or at least look like the way the movie was edited together. For example, he tries to get to a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a short break, someone randomly gives him instructions to New Hope. What the hell? When he gets to New Hope, he happens to hit his dying brother. Then there is the part where he leaves his destination for a few days and just happens to hit a car where his wife and son traveled. was it? It has a black back pack that accidentally appears and disappears throughout the movie. There are parts of the film where the characters are only waking up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night - or worse still the twilight of the next day. Also, I cannot forget that the main character and the preacher fall from the floor of the house unreasonably - until later we find out that a stranger has landed on the house. Which reminds me of the moment they walk and suddenly find themselves under a stranger they have not noticed. What the hell, aliens are like two stories tall with huge bodies and more legs - how could they miss them? There is one point where a stranger kills a casual citizen, presumably by spitting some sort of junk on him - but you never see things fly that just appears on the faces of the guys. Special effects are generally horrible. The whole movie is like a bad train wreck. When we finally get to the end, after that guy tries to get to DC to find his family, he just appears. No search for any questions. But you're there, I'm so happy - the end. I'm sorry if my review beats me a bit, but this movie was so bad that I had a hard time organizing my contempt. Save your time and don't look at how this mold appears. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd rather get to the root canal - it would be less painful.
