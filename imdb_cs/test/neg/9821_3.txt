The book gets 10 out of 10 stars ... <br /> <br /> PROBABLY CONTAINS OTHER BOOKS AND FILM SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> If you have never read Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male, the source of Man Hunt, you'll probably enjoy Fritz Lang's story treatment. On the other hand, if you are in my camp and have practically memorized the book, the film will be disappointing. I suppose you read the story and continue my complaint. The little household novel is one of the most historically challenging classics of tension, tense and substitute, with only bare handfuls of characters that drive action. Fritz Lang and his writer Dudley Nichols feel the need to throw the protagonist's brother and the compassionate floozia, the latter reducing the depth of the story by bringing an external motivation to the script where he didn't need the novel. The true culmination of the book was not the nameless narrator's escape from the underground lair, but his own acceptance of his true motive to go first. And that's another thing: when David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can get us through the Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their protagonists, why can't Lang? "Thorndyk?" What was his hat like? Which brings me to my worst complaint: The Household Hunter is so critically British that he would bleed him out if he cut him. But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, is Canadian! He can barely keep an accent that is just a little deeper and more convincing than Kevin Costner in Robin Hood. He looked right in this role and was a good actor in the 1940s, but as a reluctant hero Rogue Malea? Let's look at Sceptered Isle itself for a more convincing version. Soon be remodeled with gentleness and, please! Will I say it for free?
