I saw this movie in the beautiful air-conditioned cinema here in Bangkok. And because the outside temperature floats somewhere around 37 Â° C with very high humidity, my 100Bt wasn't wasted. . This is the type of film that gives the taste test as it was. Anyone who claims he likes or loves goes immediately to the same list without the tasty phonies who are still going to talk about the superiority of British television. At least the helpless old wagon wheelchair was good for a few whispers. I'd rather watch Independence Day 10 times in a row than I would once again sit in this stinking movie.
