But the previews looked funny and I usually do not go to opening night movies, especially with my kids, because ..... you never know. Here is a film that doesn't appeal to children or adults because jokes are too perverted for children, and for adults they're completely fun. I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 years old and I had to explain my 6 year old what s H * T spells. Essentially, what's going on here is the total twist of the classic Dr. Seusse. He adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry a children's mother for her money. If it was a subplot, then maybe it would be okay, but it ends up being the main plot around the whole movie, and the "cat" plays a more subplot role in revealing the neighbor's mom for whom he really is. Take my advice and read the book and pass the film.
