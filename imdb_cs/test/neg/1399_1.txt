This is one of the most ridiculous westerns Hollywood has ever made. Gary Cooper plays 'Reb Hollister', a former Confederate officer who wants the law. He meets with moron named Weatherby, played by Leif Erickson, who is an American marshal without knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancée, Tonia Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Senor Robles, father Tony, has a lot of men, but they don't seem to be able to observe his cattle, which are regularly seized by the Marlow brothers. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, financed a loan at Robles estate, so things were absolutely absurd. He even has the power to demand mortgage payments before they are due, simply because he likes it. Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who can't fight because he only became a marshal, he could visit his fiancée, Tonio, (just another example of more nonsense of conspiracy. a written test to get this job? Wait a minute, even this guy couldn't pass a written test.) He switches his identity to Reb Hollister, who is of course an expert. Reb dares to greet Weatherby's girl with a passionate kiss while Weatherby looks like an idiot. Gary Cooper, Hollywood's number one stud, is fine here as Reb. Before the film ends, he not only takes Weatherby's work, but also steals his fiancée and Ruth Roman as Tonia, falls so hard and so fast that he passes films with Leif Erickson. over. There is no plot of credibility of the plot throughout the film, so despite the good cast and fresh photo, the film is a bagpipe. And Cooper's character is a complete heel to the shoe. The film also plays Barbara Payton as Branta Marlowa, a beautiful and talented actress who has unfortunately missed her chances by creating too many headlines for too bad reasons. I strongly recommend that you do this.
