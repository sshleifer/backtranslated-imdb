What we have here is the Disney standard right on the DVD sequel where I would expect cats to be cut in all areas, resulting in an animated movie that is short enough from the original. That doesn't mean it's a horrible movie, it's just that it's a very average movie full of prophetic messages that aims to show children the benefits of friendship and be nice to each other and if it's not gently (which isn't here) can quickly become an adult grate. The film has a very thin plot line with The Chronicle, which seeks to obtain the consent of his father, and ends up finding the true meaning of wealth and success. This is a moment of comedy, but it's not really enough to carry a film along its length.
