After reading the other reviews on this site, we weren't sure if we could criticize this movie because it doesn't sound bad enough. However, 2 minutes into the movie, we knew we were on the next flop. No summer is complete without ice cream, but this film served a melted, sour, broken ice cream cone (you know the kind that leaves you sticky and dirty and looking wet to take a nap). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What it was? It seemed to be a psychotic ice cream that rides around. And it is done. Nothing else will happen. First of all, what are the qualifications to make an ice cream in this city? 1. Spend a few years in the bleakest psychiatric hospital a person knows. This hospital was plagued by clowns, graffiti, false plastic sunflowers, and oversized syringes in the head. 2. Have extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the kids. 3. Make sure your car is stored with separate body parts, cockroaches, and don't forget white eyes! The actors in this film are pure B-films. Mixed with a bunch of strangers is who else than .... trailer-trash version of Macaulay Culkin !! Even his spell couldn't save this kick in his pants. None of these murders in this film seemed to be a rhyme or a reason. The whole film concept has disappeared! Who would kill a man with ice cream while shooting from a car? Gangsters? Fiends? Vanna White? Who? We are still struggling with this issue. <br /> <br /> Whoever was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be blacklisted from Hollywood immediately. They honestly thought that a pillow under a children's shirt would convince the audience that he was really fat? Have they forgotten the hands, face, legs and all other parts of the body? Secondly, this film was made in 1995, but the wardrobe seemed to be picked out of the lame 80 film, as evidenced by the white, high-crotch brother's pants that stretch in the crotch. While we were watching this shot-off production, we both developed severe cases of ADD. We found that we were leaving the room to walk aimlessly. In many places this movie, we found that staring at the empty wall behind the VV file was more fun than the actual movie. We were impressed by the fact that this film did not reach the bottom of 100. Then we took the tape out of the video recorder and left it on the black top to melt like a sub-standard ice cream cone.
