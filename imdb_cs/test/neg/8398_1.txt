At first I am amazed to see that this film has a rating of 7 on this site. initially I thought it might be people who sign up for IMDb and raise their rating. But after looking at rotten tomatoes and seeing that this movie has something like a 76% approval, it seems that maybe people have just been deceived by mistake by pretentious crap for stupidity. This movie is just awful. acting is just awful, but the rest of the movie is worse. at least acting provides some (unintentional) laughter. The plot includes a teenage skateboard boy who is being questioned along with his friends for the murder that happened in the park where he skates. and that's about it. the rest of the film consists of the aforementioned terrible games, the terrible dialogue, the slow footage of people walking, the faces of people, skating people, often set to music that doesn't fit into the scene. perhaps it was done to be "cold" or experimental or hip. Or perhaps it was done in hopes that it would fool people to think it was somehow deep, but it doesn't work. nothing in this movie works. it is pretentious waste. I can't recommend it.
