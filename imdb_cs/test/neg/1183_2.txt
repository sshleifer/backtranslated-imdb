*** Can Contain Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I had very high demands on this trailer-based movie. I knew a bit about real Ed Gein, so I thought it was a medium-term Hollywood version of the real events. The man was wrong. First, the writing seemed to come from the Eight, which hardly knew Ed's history, and in 20 minutes they did. The film completely overcomes Ed's most interesting aspects and his relationship with his mother (not to mention what the real police found in their home) and decided to focus primarily on the young representative who seems to just roam the scene. Similarly, all male characters seem to be ad-libbing their dialogue throughout the film. I'm not exaggerating. Don't even start with the historical slacks in this movie. Seriously, who the hell was he driving? This film is about to take place around 1957, but cops carry modern side batons, some things in the hardware store look like they came from Lowes, and when a policeman gets to a payphone, he dials 9-1- 1 (then ). Ed was also a little boy, scary as Anthony Perkins's character in Psycho (who was allegedly based on real life Ed), not on this crazy guy who looked like he looked like a bad man in Black Men. Another thing that really intercepted me was that the filmmakers made the whole thing in an abandoned, 3 building set. Because of the "smart" camera angles you will never see any real city and the interior of the sets looked like old, long-abandoned huts. Pop cash registers on pile-horse and bam! - instant hardware store. I'm usually quite forgiving low-budget horror movies, but this just begs for that. All you had to do was include most of the real events (even decorate!), Pay five good actors instead of 15 miserable ones, and think about Pete's time in 5 minutes. My advice: Google Ed Gein, you'll be much more fun.
