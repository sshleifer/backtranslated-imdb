STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Mark Goddard (C Thomas Howell) sat helplessly as a boy. his family, including his father, a hero cop (Jeff Fahey), was brutally murdered by criminal criminals he tried to overthrow. With an inner desire to punish the criminals who collapsed in it when he grew up as a result, Mark employs hard resources to bring the suspects who are chasing into it, and that is why he gets into a lot of trouble with his superiors. But then he learns about the "Incorporated", a secret group of men and women led by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter) who serves to get rid of the punishment that suits the offense. out alive can be harder than he thought. Sweeper gets into trouble from the off-set because we saw this exactly the same plot before (and better) in movies like The Star Chamber with Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood. The name also makes no sense. However, we also have to struggle with the utter absurdity of the film, including a scene where daughter headphones can drown the sound of a defeated family, which is the finale involving the evil guy chase that starts on the highway and ends at Wright Brothers' plane, as well as some of the ridiculous games have ever appeared on the screen and a very clich√©, a pretentious scenario. But here and there are some great action sequences, and the film's unintentional mixing factor certainly keeps it live. **
