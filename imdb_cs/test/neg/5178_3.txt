This movie could be great. It's not my opinion. The storyline is fragmented, the editor does not seem to be able to choose between Guy Ritchie's narrative and more straightforward. Great emphasis is placed on excessive violence, including torture. Too much if you ask me. The characters are very shallow and stereotypical, I'd like to see more depth there. It's hard to identify with the main character. As a result, the film remains shallow as a whole. The film says it gives the viewer an insight into the British criminal subclass, especially the Essex subclass. Football hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroin and violence, lots of violence. Violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general. In this movie, no one seems to use their (or her) brain, looking at a lot of animals in their clothes. As I said, there is not a lot of conspiracy and narration leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you're a man under 30 like gore and hardcore violence and think it's funny, it's a movie for you. If you're looking for a movie showing real people with a well-developed story, tension and depth, you can ... skip this one.
