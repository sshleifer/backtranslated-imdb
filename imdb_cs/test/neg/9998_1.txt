Sometimes I let my kids watch this waste so they understand how pathetic the "contestant" show is. They are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they do their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune. For anyone who appears on National TV and blubber, sniffle, and whining that fat (their own fault) is nausea. What does it say about us as a nation? Does this suggest that your lifestyle choices and their consequences are not our responsibility? "Biggest losers" is a good title, but it has nothing to do with weight. <br /> <br /> Absolute Waste.
