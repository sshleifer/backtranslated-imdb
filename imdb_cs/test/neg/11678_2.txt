The film uses random events of historical significance as its background and willy-nilly criss-cross lives and time series of its 3 central characters. For what purpose can one ask? The problem with this film is that the script becomes a "story", not a character or their life. It starts with a lot of rich, aimless college students (and a few unhealthy) drawn into naxality. Following is an affair, rejection and separation. People go their own ways, seemingly. Only until the heroine brings them to them. Not once, but twice. After a break in the 'Movement', the next hurdle for these 3 is Emergency imposed on the land of Indira Gandhi. Lots of political figures stretch for no apparent reason. Sub-parcels are too fanciful and do not put together a logical whole. The film tries to introduce a false pace, but never reaches a real rhythm. Hardly coherent at times, there is no maturation and growth at all in the arches of 3 ex-fellow mates. Even after they are probably married, engaged, settled, or anything else, they are still too eager to cross it and go to the village where they have sex with a former lover or ex-flame. What a prolific imagination has a screenwriter. So many 4-letter words are used without rhyme or the reason that its downright rude! Chitrangda Singh has a terrible American accent that he's not trying to hide. His hideous hearing her mouth clich√©-ridden dialogue like 'What is? I didn't think you'd come (after the hellish nightmare she was going through) or at the beginning "I appreciate your fears, but I'll take care of myself". Yikes. What clown wrote dialogues? He invites his friend to have a cup of "South American Indian" (no less), wishes a good morning and then wishes a good night from someone else in the family. Now what's wrong with it?!? Countless uncredited villagers and tribal are the best actors. Editing is really erratic with too many slices. Apparently, Sudhir Misra was trying to make a bold statement, so he went on to do this.
