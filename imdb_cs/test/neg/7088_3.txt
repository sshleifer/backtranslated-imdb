This is another Hollywood anti-communist polemic of the 1950s. Stalwart American Gene Barry, charming Englishwoman Valerie French and three others are kidnapped by an alien and give him a shell containing fantastic - and fantastically vague - power. What will the Earthlings do with such power? Throw him out or use him to wipe out all mankind? Anyone who knows American cinema around 1957 knows the answer to what they will do, but the story will mature when Americans actually test things in the middle of the Pacific. Then one scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, comes up with his own theory and uses it! His smarmy attitude then is nausea, and the cheerful disposition of all others is scary. Here's a spoiler for this dog: Caps inside the shell have a math code that says prof that kills only "confirmed the enemies of freedom! That's right - don't worry about the ethical pretext of killing everyone they decide A stranger is an enemy of freedom; just do it! Hooray! No commies! Stupid woman - and you threw into the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me darling!
