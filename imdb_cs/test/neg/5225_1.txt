I gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This film was made in 2003 and I saw movies made in the 1960s with better special effects. I wish I could go into detail, but the words can't describe how bad this movie was. I could do better with a home video camera and $ 20! I pray that Chuck Norris would never make a movie. If you think I am shooting this film down because it has a Christian theme, you are wrong. I like the fact that IL 'Chuck decided to make a film that would at least try to make God look good. This whole film can be summarized in 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.
