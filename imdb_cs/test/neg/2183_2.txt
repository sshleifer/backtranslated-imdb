"Go Fish" collected Rose Troche correctly or badly a filmmaker's reputation with great promise. Its then hard to understand how she could make a film made up of stereotypes that one associates with lower sitcoms. The entire film is hollow. I crouched all the way. It is believed to be a view of human sexuality in the 1990s. Well, it's no more than learning from "In a Out". Most of us actually know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there are men who are sexually attracted to men, and there are also men who are sexually attracted to both sexes. <br /> <br /> Rarely did this revelation appear on screen with such little wit and style. Pathetic.
