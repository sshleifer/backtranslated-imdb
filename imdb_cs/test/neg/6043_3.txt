OK, we have 4 city electricians who find a mini nuke reactor, turn it around and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spider queen also from a parallel universe that has slipped away with several of its relatives to take over the country, but unfortunately it's the only one who left? If so, why did the rest of mankind not join and find it. Also, what happened to the army could not be used by several billion plus ammunition and why to hide in the basement, when there had to be much more defensible places available. Also not digging at the city workers, but how did they know what the mini nuke reactor looked like and how if they didn't have one in the parallel universe, they could reopen the crack? Sorry, there was nothing sympathetic about the movie
