When I read reviews of Kahin Pyaar On Ho Jaay, I thought, "Huh?". It was so confusing. Sure, I went to see the movie and what do you know? It's a "The Wedding Singer" remake. Several scenes have been changed to fit the whole of Indian, but the rest is a straightforward extract from the Hollywood hit in 1998. Bollywood is no good for nothing, but this is so poor that it just bother me. I groaned so much attention and realized that I wasn't the only one! One guy actually came out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles. He shouted and whined too. Why doesn't he just take it? He does not do justice to the role originally featured by Adam Sandler. He doesn't have Sandler's sense of comic timing. Rani is a beautiful actress and one of my favorites, but not even Drew Barrymore. The scene where he stands in front of the mirror trying to say his new surname ("Hi, I'm Mrs. Pugalia") does not match the version of Barrymore ("Hello, I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia"). I felt embarrassed to watch the scene, even though I liked the original. Music is not too bad. It's probably the only austerity grace of this otherwise horrible movie! Avoid it at all costs!
