The film was slow, the dialogue between actors / actresses felt "flat" and there was basically no development of characters in the story. Omar Epps skulks around with a crazy look on his face all the time, pouting and basically looking upset at everyone. The Danes have no magic on the screen, and Ribisi's character is a sobriety that no one would want to hang, even if they were paid for it. Plunge into a strange scene where Epps has to dance an old man, and you have what could be the worst movie in the cinema history. I watched him on satellite (thank God I didn't pay for it) and wished I didn't. Do yourself a favor and go get your underwear and socks outlet if you need to do something but are tempted to watch this movie when / if it comes to TV. A horrible movie when you ask me, and I generally have something good to say about some movie out there.
