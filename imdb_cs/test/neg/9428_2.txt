This film boasts production line planning. It looks like the filmmakers have looked at recent hit movies and threw spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Child! Airplane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film deals with the age of Stewart / Allyson artists; But I'm sure we still think they're much younger. In the "Strategic Air Command" there are reports that I found curiously shocking and offensive. element: A happily married couple is questioned when Mr. Stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife. The movie is the most dramatic scene, she calls on him. The end is absolutely unresolved - Allyson cries her heart on the bed and Stewart goes to her. No discussion; he just says he's right and goes to his devastated woman. Everything she knew could cut her wrist. Later, Allyson apologizes for asking about her husband's decision. <br /> <br /> Incredible! Stay Stewart-Allyson in The Stratton Story (1949). Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy
