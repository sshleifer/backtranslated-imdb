Warnings, spoilers ahead (although I don't think anyone else has seen it yet) <br /> <br /> The movie starts pretty well, but it breaks down in about half and becomes a vaulted, sweet sweet, predictable and unrealistic "harmonious romantic "Mess. It is very obvious that there are serious problems in the marriage of the main characters, but these problems are never resolved, but forgotten. In principle, once he decides to have a child behind his back (without even asking), all their problems magically disappear without a trace or explanation. Given what happened up to now, it would have been much more logical if the marriage had broken down, rather than become a banal, and the clich√© 'with the child would change everything' ending. Two main characters "Families and neighbors are also extremely one-dimensional and do not seem to actually serve if they do not irritate the viewer, and mysteriously disappear from the film as soon as" harmonious moments "begin. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to copy this movie, but due to the start I would expect something more. 4/10 for me.
