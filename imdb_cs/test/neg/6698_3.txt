If someone thinks it's a great sports movie, it's probably the only sport movie they've ever seen. There are various aspects of a sports movie you may have. Whether it's a professional or college or high school. Examples of sports movies that I liked (and I haven't seen many) are Jim Thorpe: All Americans, All Right Moves, Any Given Sunday, Eight Men Out and Rocky, among others. All these films had a little more than just ordinary sports. Whether it was a male ascent and then a descent of greatness, or a man who had lost his dream of being a vengeful coach, or the money for professional sports. There is not much content in Hoosiers. Even the film seemed to have no beginning or end. There was no character development, everyone was forced on us. I could summarize this movie, citing a very bad coach: "Go out and try to get more points than the other one."
