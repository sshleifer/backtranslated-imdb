But even cartoons need a credible plot line. I suppose that in 1934 some part of this viewer would have long been enjoying a lukewarm farce. It's not good age. This is given by Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts to experienced and expert players shot in leading positions. Pendelton, who is featured prominently in the Thin series man tries his best but is over with a rude plot. Since it's a gangster scene, it's not exactly the original material. Saving the film is always an excellent Edward Everett Horton in wasted performance. But don't waste your time watching Everett in this movie. I would like to encourage everyone to watch him in his vacation, with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. The same era of 1936, but a much better scenario and storyline. Better gags and no need to say star power.
