In general, you can ask two questions about low budget horror films of the 1980s. and especially this demonic wind. 1. Is it a good movie? No. 2. Is this a funny movie? You bet! The Wind Demon is a horribly dirty and nauseous story, filled with charming makeup effects and ugly violence. The story is almost non-existent and includes a group of young people who reveal the horrible secret of one of the group's ancestors. His grandparents probably lived in a neighborhood worshiping the devil, and evil (in the form of demons and fog) still dwells there. But I have to hand him over to this film. From start to finish, breathing sickness! Devilish undertones, playful gore and (relatively) decent playing together make this movie up high above mainstream, certainly unrecognized 80-year-old slashers. This shows some creativity and courage (literally), where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily. These creators seem to have been inspired by the success of "Evil Dead" and perhaps Lambert Bava's "Demons", but what the hell! It's fun and made a lot of enthusiasm. Although this movie has a very high "what is f ***" value - by default, sometimes. Especially when the memories and laser shows are happily mixed. And the hell is the story of the two wannabe wizards? However, "Demon Wind" gets my recommendation if your friends aren't too high about horror!
