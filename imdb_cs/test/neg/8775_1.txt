Whatever the producer did, he was completely missing. A lone Ranger is not a camp, but an "icon" for good people around the world. And it's a total violation of the character's spirit that the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was forbidden to wear a mask in public appearances when the film was released. Whelp, the long story of a short, united austerity grace on this gross (and misunderstood) distortion was that in that year I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore at Columbus Ohio as part of a tour of bad press about Mr. Moore's treatment. Needless to say, Mr. Moore's character, integrity and presence far surpassed the film. Some things can't be done better. There's only one Lone Ranger.
