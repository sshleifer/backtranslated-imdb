The story was disjointed, acting was no calliber that you can catorize. More serial pilot than real movie. I wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't find anything like that. Whatever it was that lost the boys who were so sympathetic, apparently missing. Make it try. Fence hooks were clumsy in the middle of what could have been an episode of the dawsons stream with dark clothes, and the story's arc went nowhere. I was very disappointed. The end of the scene were special effects driven comfort and how the story villain planned his entire scheme .. who was he (or she) trying to baby, talk about naive. Stick to the films of this kind of genre from the 1980s, when they had more ideas.
