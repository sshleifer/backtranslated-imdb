Critics fall over themselves within Weinstein's sphere of influence to praise this ugly, misleading and repulsive adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it is based. Minghell's ham-oblique direction of the boldly bloody and penetrating excessively episodic odyssey is one of the many mistakes of this "civil-war love story." Are they kidding? After Mrs. Kidman and Mr. Law has met cute zero-screen chemistry in a small North Carolina town and stole a kiss before they go to war for Jude and his girlfriend's photo of the girl he left behind, it's a two-hour kidney test to see if he'll survive the myriad of close experiences death to meet his close friend. Who cares? Philip S. Hoffman's amateur scene chewing on a disgusting and indecent role pales on Renee Zelweger's appearance as a corn dynamo who miraculously explodes on a lonely Kidman farm to save the day. Rarely has a performance shouting from "look at me, I behave" complacency. Her deafening deafening nerve wakes up into the long forests for a few minutes until it is painfully thin. They released Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (which is farce) of thinking, Weinsteins apparently owns, along with Dick Clarke, a critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their overblown failure. The resulting crime is that prices have become pointless and small, less powerful PR-driven films are becoming obscure. Cold Mountain is a conceptual film and an empty, bitter waste of time. Cold really !!!
