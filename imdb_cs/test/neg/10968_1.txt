Looking at the evaluation, you would assume that it is a classic, but again another example of poor independent filmmakers trying to arouse interest in their film. Are they not even smart that 10/10 in the vote? I think to make the curve and equalize all 1/10 it gets. Is it better than a decent movie? No. Acting, corny and garbage. Sound Effects, Cheap and Ugly if it wasn't where the actors were watching, you don't know where it is coming from. <br /> <br /> Camera. These people behave as if they have borrowed their father's camera after watching the matrix. Less is more, but more of this team is absolutely p. <br /> <br /> Zombies are also garbage. I have no doubt that most of them will never hear again and it will be for good reason. I hope the zombies dream their eyes because it was 90 minutes papu that I wont get back. And the counterfeiting rating is only a million times worse. One reviewer said he was one of the best horror movies he has seen in the last 30 years? I can only assume that his recent corneal transplant was then successful. Watch the trailer as a warning of how bad this movie is.
