This film is an example of a small budget, inefficient star casting, weak action and bad entertainment. This kind of movie is made for commercial breaks and not for the fun of Bollywood movie fans. I went to this movie because I thought the former gangster was acceptable, so it is. The only thing that I appreciate is how the new actress got very bold in the film, very similar to the actress Bollywood dand. is good, sexy and good. She definitely go up in her career. Our mithunda was always good at his work. I did not like imraan for his role, he must advise him to improve when he made many films as a new actor and he was seen as an established actor This movie has nothing but a bold scene that a new actress has ever done
