The contribution of Waters to the world of cinema must be searched through the telescope, and when / when something is found (by total chance and a lot of happiness), it must be analyzed by a microscope. And after being analyzed, he would get into a "trash bin for laboratories for absolutely useless things". The only atom of this microscope is worth all his films together. CB is an etremely and deliberately. Common JW stuff: comic book dialogue, simplistic conspiracy, moronically cheerful characters, chewing gum pop, overclocking, etc. Waters knows that incabaple is making quality film, so hiding behind the mask of "deliberately cheese film" -maker - which is supposed to special kind of "anti-artist". But in the world of cinematography, being anti-talent is often wrong with talent, which is exactly what Waters hoped - and finally got. It's a con. Charlatans invade the cinema world and modern pop art; It's a plague. Perhaps we are responsible for John Waters for inspiring Baz Luhrman to put all those horrible, silly turkeys. It's like a virus: one Waters creates five new bad directors and then these five create more and so on. Where will it end? With a "dancer in the dark"? Can this bomb really be covered?
