This movie has some nice gorey parts like tits getting a little off and another big bite. Freak Castle itself is a good monster. I'd be scared to pieces if he followed me. However, the film had some silly parts about it. Husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blind his teenage daughter. I suppose death is more a pity than blindness, but you never know that parents feel bad when their daughter is blind. The only thing that matters is that "J.J. is dead!" While their teenage daughter walks around to run into things and talk about how they will never be able to drive a car. Parents are like - "gold, stop going without a guide, you know better than that," and then they cry and never stop being depressed because JJ is dead. Sounds like favortism to me. <br /> <br /> The dialog lines are not very realistic or well executed. For example, when you hear a huge crash at the castle, everyone goes down to the cellar to find out what it is. It was a huge mirror that hit the ground and shattered. Her husband ran to the broken mirror in horror, clearly saying, "The mirror has collapsed." I don't know, I'd say a little more than if a giant mirror mysteriously hit the ground in my castle. Husband and wife have some serious relationship problems and it's fun to watch them stupid. No one sees a blind girl. Advice: If a blind girl says she hears things, trust her and don't tell her to close. I think it's a moral story. Listen to people when they tell you things, or you might end up killing to prove your opinion. Finally, I thought the chief policeman was the best figure. He was the best actor and character. All the others (except Freak Castle) were a nice mill run. 3/10
