In any case, this overly simplistic one-character scenario should not be interpreted as a fun pastime. In fact, it has about enough material for eighteen minutes short, and even that would seriously tax your attention span. Zero characters are developed over Noble Willingham. Never ending shots of lips and phones induce sleep and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could write it. In fact, this whole sad thing shouldn't even be a movie. Tape recording would be more than enough to sleep. Definitely not recommended. - MERK
