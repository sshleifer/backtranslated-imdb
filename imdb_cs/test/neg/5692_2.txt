Do you see a movie called 'Battle Space', what do you think? Space battles with cold bursts of explosion and everyone shoots at each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, you get SOME goodness of battle, but for most of the time it's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing. NO ONE TALKS !!!! What's that nonsense ?! We got a storyteller and a ton of British computers, but that's about it. The main protagonist must be the worst I've ever seen, because he has no dialogue, and no suggestions (literally!). Some of the things that are happening are just stupid as if they were using a rocket (like going into space) for a basic transport planet, why not just use one of those clever spaceships? Anyway, the music is almost non-existent, with a few boring boring samples without life, but the main thing you notice is the Atari sound effects that the ships use ... you have to be kidding. I can also say that the budget was low because everything looks fake, which is not what you would expect from a movie, especially what should be a super cool space battle movie. I really think the budget had to be a double-digit number, it's so bad that you will laugh more than you should on how bad it is. I'm starting to think they paid actors based on how much dialogue they had, because there is very little (if you can't say it's my main gripe, as I have already said three times).
