"Opposing Force [1986]" was not as good as "Dr. Strangelove" and was not as good as "The Bridge on the River Kwai". Hell, it wasn't as good as "GI Jane", which is pretty sad. The film revolves around a fundamental ethical issue: In a simulated prisoner situation, how far can you go before breaking the law? What exactly is the law in such a situation? How can you simulate torturing someone without torturing someone? Can you intentionally cause pain? How about breaking bones? Mock up Execution? Sexual Abuse? Severe loss of blood? Real bullet weapons? Death? Somewhere between them is really a fuzzy line dividing "acceptable" from "cruel". <br /> <br /> Now, what could you do if you found yourself in such a curriculum and the lines between simulation and reality disappear? What could you do? This film attempts to portray this dilemma. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in "resistance training". I have a brother who went through the POW USAF training program. According to him, it was technically very close to the mark. The film has a pretty good assumption, but it doesn't have a particularly good story. I wonder if it could be based on some real event, but it was pretty obvious that it wasn't when the explosions started. They had to change three screenwriting scenarios because it requires a real extreme turnaround and divides into a somewhat nonsensical filming with lots of disturbing explosions. I found it to have somewhat unsatisfactory ending; again, a little unnecessary. I stayed wondering what the whole thing was - I'm starting to know it wasn't there. It could be a lot better if the story went a little more with the fireworks.
