My God. I never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than a domestic disruption soon, but here it is. Armed with rotten plot, horrible cuts, agile acting and headache-style (sorry, I have no other words for it), Sanctimony is a kind of film that almost compels you to rethink the whole genre; This means that this film is so bad that even the thrillers I have condemned as complete failures now seem a little better. Now, not just Sanctimony is a horrible movie in itself, it will also succeed in the challenging task of pulling out better movies and making them pathetic. Right from the main titles - nothing but the ruthless attempt to reproduce those from Se7en - I had the impression that they didn't feel anything right. When the movie began with a series of sloping, lusty flanks of fast cuts full of bloody images and bombastic colors, I knew where the smell came from. It turns out that two policemen, or rather police officer Jim Renart (Michael Par√©) and police officer Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin) are investigating the murder in Vancouver. Serial killer, known as "Monkey Killer" (what a horrible, freezing nickname, uh?) For his working methods, he killed enough people. You see, this matrix seems to work according to the proverb "see no evil, hear no evil, say no evil," and cut its eyes, ears, and tongues from its victims. So far six eyes, six ears and three tongues. Renart and Smith found out that Monkey Killer is likely to kill three more people ... well, because he probably wants to finish 666. Suddenly, the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), a young, successful, good-looking businessman, terrible. And that's where American Psycho starts. So we are watching the lives of two policemen and a young psychopath, none of whom is interesting until they finally meet. On the way to the disco where Renart barely misses Gerrick, we inadvertently offer one of the most entertaining scenes in recent memory: Renart goes to the back of the discotheque because ... well, just because the script tells us it's a suspicious place ; then, with one stroke in his stomach, Renard gets rid of the big guard who blocks the way, and the guard is never heard again? Does this scene happen to anyone else as totally unrealistic? But after another murder, Gerrick turns as a witness, but Smith and especially Renart suspect that he might be a murderer. In the typical fashion mode of Instinct, Smith gets some data with a young entrepreneur, provided she could discover her true identity. I will not spoil the end, but it is simply embarrassment; there are contradictions, some conspiracy holes, problems that have never been resolved, and in particular there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder that should be shocking and sad comes as such exaggerated and absurd that I cannot honestly imagine how no one could laugh at it. <br /> <br /> After 87 minutes, Sanctimony is really pushing it. You never care for a single character because they are so flat (not to mention boredom) that you know exactly who is the first time you meet them for the first time. You have never entered the story because scenes are connected by weak devices when they are not totally unnecessary and are not in place. Acting ranges from average (Van Dien) to downright severe (Rubin, and most of the supporting cast); music is extremely general techno and photography is one of the worst I've ever seen. Of course, like every fiasco of this genre, we have a little unjustified nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
