AKA <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 3 x 1.78: 1 to 2.39: 1 image (Triptych) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br / 1978: The Teen Working Class (Matthew Leitch) assumes a false identity and a high school where he learns hard lessons about the division between Rich and Poor. Duncan Roy's autobiographical film (JACKSON: MY LIFE ...) YOUR FAILURE, exposing the aristocracy to Thatcherite as seen through the eyes of a low-rent "ordinary" whose worldview is transformed by his adventures between the Upper Classes . Unfortunately, Roy's script tells very little about what we haven't yet known about the abundance of idle rich, and the story is only briefly set on by Leitch's relationship with a handsome but self-destructive bounty boy (Peter Youngblood Hills) who turns out to be no more hypocritical than people who wants to emulate. Also play Diana Quick (as an outrageous snob who believes working class people are "embarrassed to be alive"!), Bill Nighy as a black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson ("EastEnders"), Blake Ritson (DIFER FOR GIRLS ) and Georgina Hale in a typically spectacular portrait, flashing her breasts at all and impeccably, without care in the world! Unfortunately, most of the film's effect is diluted by Roy's insistence on using the Triptych effect (three separate 1.78: 1 images are marked with a letterbox in the 2.39: 1 frame, each providing a different view of each scene) ). ), which reduces the image and distance of viewers from events on the screen. A long, meaningless film, too personal for a wide appeal and limited by the entire film process that fails to reconcile the story at hand. There is also a single-image version (theatrically framed to 1.85: 1) with a subtitle on the AKA: LIES A LIKE WISHES screen.
