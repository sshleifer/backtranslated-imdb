Martin Lawrence is not a funny man or a Runteldat. He just has too much to think about and he's too crazy to wait for his game. He's trying to make fun of critics, which goes down to "f ***". Then it is more of a primitive sex joke with throat cancer smokers and from there it goes down the hill. 3/10
