After receiving the DVD of this Sunday's diary I was hoping that these are not the usual duff movies that are given away because no one would ever buy them. I was wrong. Sheens is at the same level as a ten-year-old in mime production at school, and the same is true for most casts. Neill is satisfactory, but he plays Russian and is not helped by his hybrid Northern Irish / New Zealand accent, nor by other KGB characters, all of whom sound as if they were in the reunion of Cambridge Lights. In fact, the only people with real accents are peculiarities that add a special word here and there and help us at least know where everything is happening in what is otherwise a complete mash. The espionage factor is largely non-threatening and consists mainly of Sheen faffing about various ridiculous disguises while trying to blend in with the background, quickly becoming not only boring but also ridiculous. The plot has potential, but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements. That could have been much better.
