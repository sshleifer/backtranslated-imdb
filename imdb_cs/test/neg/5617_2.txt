This is the type of late night swing that is usually associated with Andrew Stevens or Shannon Tweed. Though unlike most of Tweed and Stevens' T&A powered vehicles, it is lethally boring! <br /> <br /> Let's go down to chase. The real reason for watching this non-thriller is to see Shannon Doherty's breasts. Anyone who states differently is LIAR! However, most of her steamy sex scenes seem to be all smoke and mirrors. Frames where the camera is on its naked body is little or no face at all, or is behind dripping wet shower doors. I must admit that the final where Doherty is bound, blindfolded and at risk of a knife, assuming a certain fetishistic excitement. buy! As everyone involved is probably too embarrassed to let it go on DVD!
