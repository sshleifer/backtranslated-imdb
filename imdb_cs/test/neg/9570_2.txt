Most of all the missing in this movie is that it doesn't give room for imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary, but not as good as a documentary because it's not a documentary. Patchwork film without a coherent story. Very superficial, there's nothing to think about, because the movie already tells you what to think. Too many different problems touch, but none of them is designed to think. I don't even know if it's a funny movie that wants to be a serious or serious movie that wants to be funny. Many scenes are very unrealistic and acting is very bad. The movie is pretty boring.
