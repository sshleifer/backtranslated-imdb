Ladies and gentlemen .. Be sad (or be happy!) .. We are in the disgusting forensic TV Series-ERA !! Count on me and anatematize our happiness: "CSI: Crime Investigation", "CSI: Miami", "CSI: NY", "NCIS", "Crossing Jordan", "Da Vinci's Inquest" , "The Cosby Mysteries"! .. Have we had so much? From the late 1990s to the end of the 2000s we have almost the same sick genius series of criminologists with a partner (or team) who go to deal with crimes by examining autopsies. So you will certainly have plenty and many repulsive scenes where we see clearly, precisely and terribly the most horrific shots in T.V. OH BOH .. Once we had great days; a good cop (or detective) of ERA such as Columbo, Kojak, Magnum, and Simon and Simon. Or good old Sci-Fi ERA, like Six Million Dollar Man, Bionic Woman, Knight Rider. And oh boy we also have hot & sexy like: cover, The Love Boat, Baywatch, even a flop like Thunder in Paradise. <br /> <br /> All of them were unforgettable, original, good. Real good thoughts, actions, women .. When X FILES came .. And then it was the beginning of the misfortune or be accurate: Disaster! Files X Undoubtedly one of the biggest, but there were a few minor drawbacks, we had agent Dana Scully (physician and FBI agent) at every episode that does an autopsy, and of course her bike (as a series has succeeded) has become part of our living room, so Thirsty Producers loved her with all the physical terror + exciting pursuit of truth. That's why they tried to repeat it in another, not too distant classification: Forensic! But it has become so ugly, full of distortions and very crisp as BONES. Plus the presence of unsexy Emily Deschanel, and bleed like David Boreanaz (he was much better in the angel), and all these corpses .. To the extent that every time I watched I found my own screams AAAAHHHHHH! What a terrible rough !! .. <br /> <br /> Please cancel it .. You have canceled the actual good shows like (The Lone Gunmen) or (A Man Called Hawk). Here it is bad .. So please .. Little grace and enough with Bones-ERA !!! .. or we fall dead alone from Nausea and Monoton !!
