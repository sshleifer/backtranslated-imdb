Police officer Michael (Thomas Arana, "The Church") has his hands full in the investigation of a serial killer who is leaving part of the body of the people he murdered in the house of one recently widowed Tracy (Joanna Pacula). Mike must find a way to prevent bodies from accumulating, and perhaps find love in this process. The feeling of "giallo" yore penetrates this movie, even though we know who the killer is from get-go, and the movie contains some good set-pieces (the scene later in the movie set at the school for the blind is especially unforgettable), but that doesn't mean it's all when everything is fine. he said and did. All in all, not as good as Bava's earlier "Macabre", nor his first two films "Demons", but pleasant enough if you can forgive a somewhat outrageous plot plot to end the movie. It is a pity that the DVD with video entertainment lacked accessories of any kind, as I would be interested in some. <br /> <br /> My Class: C-
