After reading the book Heart of Darkness, the film did not do justice. The film puts the book to shame and everyone who hasn't experienced the book would frown on the story and plot because it was shown so badly by the film. In the film, the characters and set were just some of the years below that occurred in the film. The director has omitted so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made him one of the best literary works ever made. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in the vocabulary and cleverness of the written word. The film won't even show it. Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book have been completely omitted, as if Kurtz was not on the ship when he died. Also when Marlow went to deliver the news for Kurtz's intended, she reacted differently in the film, rather than the book. Another major difference was that Marlow had seen a lady, who was blindfolded at the end of the film, not at the beginning, like a book. This had an impact on how viewers perceived Marlow, and the film completely spoiled it. There were a lot of false false backgrounds and a compliment, a lot of bad actors who were supposed to go with him. There was one exception to the terrible actors and that would be Isaach De Bankol√©, who played Mfum. His character was best displayed. Although the film wasn't that great, I would still recommend it ONLY if you read and understood the book well. This way you can see what the differences in the film and the book are and think about them. If you haven't read the book, I don't recommend the movie because it's boring, lifeless. I loved the book so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.
