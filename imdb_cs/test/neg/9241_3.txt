Harmony Korrine - Do You Hate Him or Hate Him? Hate may be a better word for this evidence. Of course not everything he does. But it could have been so different because the first ten minutes of this movie promise so much, including a fantastic idea of ​​impersonating Michael Jackson, who falls in love with Marilyn Monroe. Fantastic. And in Paris! That could be great. But unfortunately, Korrine can ignite a strange decent idea, but since she is a horrible writer, the story fails at all levels and the walkout audience I witnessed for about an hour in is a positive proof that he is the boring and cocky movie-making out there. Apparently, the rate of walking at its premiere in recent years at Cannes was quite shocking. Instead of focusing on the two protagonists, he silently switches the story into the chateau space to introduce a lot of other impersonators, which makes the experience difficult and telling. When does an independent cinema stop financing this start?
