Due to a very deceptive advertising campaign, I saw this movie in theaters at the relatively young age of 10 years. The advances in television represented the film as a comedy, and I annoyed my parents until they took me. After watching the movie, I was impressed. I had no idea what to think. Totally different from everything I had seen before, leaving many questions for such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I saw in 2-3 years, and I still think it is one of the best films that have been made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are in top form, like a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist who develops a bond with him as he tries to decipher his mystery. The cast of support is also almost perfect, every resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in its own way. The open end was handled very well, giving a lot of evidence to support what you think happened at the end. How this film did not receive at least one Oscar nomination that year surpasses me. If you have not seen this movie, run to Wal-Mart NOW. The DVD is usually in the box of the gangue, pick it up! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
