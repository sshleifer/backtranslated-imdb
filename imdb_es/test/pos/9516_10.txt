Although I am not Greek, I have had a permanent interest in the Eastern Empire. Its fall in 1453 was the greatest loss to Christianity in its entire history. However, although the Easter Empire is not a subject much discussed in American intellectual circles, the United States not only imitated the public architecture of the Golden Byzantines, the United States is very absorbed in the predestined Byzantine historical cycle and now They have faced many of the crises that affect certain people from a Middle Eastern extraction about which there is said to be a slight tendency to excessive exuberance in religious matters that humiliated the Great Byzantium. I wonder if the loss of the ability to speak clearly was the first signaling post on the road to disaster. <br /> <br /> John Romer must be recognized not only for his excellent production but also for his cheerful enthusiasm for the subject that is most refreshing. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for Americans who like political correctness.
