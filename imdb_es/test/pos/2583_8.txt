If you've been looking for a movie in which a runaway nympho is chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man, look no further than the latest Paramount Vantage release 'Black Snake Moan'. Are not you looking for exactly what I just described? Well, then you better get going and go to your local theater and still see it as the character of Samuel L. Jackson, Lazaro would say. As long as you have an open mind and do not take everything seriously, there is no reason why you should not leave the theater happy to have seen it. <br /> <br /> In the third offer of the director Craig Brewer, we are taken to the deep south where, as the slogan of the film says, everything is hotter. While we are there, we are introduced to the fearful man of the heavens, Lazaro, as stated above, played by Jackson, and the almost always half-naked Rae; a role bravely assumed by Christina Ricci. In the movie, this unlikely pair intersects enough for his characters to learn a lesson from each other. Both lessons finally convey the message to the audience that no matter what, we are all human. Nobody is perfect and if everyone realized that, we would be much better. The question of whether this will be understood or accepted by everyone who sees the film is another story. <br /> <br /> One thing that is not under discussion is how great Jackson and Ricci are here. You would think that with the role of a woman crazed by sex, overfeeding would be a fact, but no, not here. Ricci makes his way and demonstrates a real talent with a raw performance that also doubles as his best to date. Then we have Jackson who disappears completely and, for the first time in a long time, makes us forget who he is. Unfortunately, the third star of the film, Justin Timberlake, who plays Rae's boyfriend with military fate, is not so good. At first, it fails miserably, as it seems to be trying too much. Later on, he keeps advancing, he is still far from the level he reached in January's 'Alpha Dog'. <br /> <br /> The other thing that 'Black Snake Moan' has is a splendid soundtrack. With themes from The Black Keys, John Doe, pieces of the score made by Scott Bomar and, of course, four, count them, four songs by Jackson himself. Actually, it is one of his songs, the main action of the film, 'Stackolee', which is the fuel for the fire of this great collection. It's only worth the price of the ticket. Other notable musical delights of the soundtrack are "The Chain" by Bomar, "When the Lights Go Out" by Black Keys, and the title song that is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazaro sings to Rae. on a stormy night. <br /> <br /> The efforts of Craig Brewer can not pass without mentioning. His latest film, 'Hustle & Flow', which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim, put him on the map. What he has done with 'Black Snake Moan' will be what sets him apart from other rookies in the industry. Not only did he direct 'Moan', he also wrote his script. The end result is a surprising and intelligent story. As you watch them, you feel that you know exactly where they are going, despite their brave composure. Just when you think you've predicted the next move, Brewer shifts gears and takes a completely different route. However, there are some spots within the script. The background characters are monotonous and flat, while the ending is somewhat disappointing. It left me wanting something more exciting. After so many successes, I think the final scenes were a bit weak compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I imagine that most people who see 'Black Snake Moan' will not enjoy it because of the fact, they can not help thinking how unlikely situations are. The depressing part of this is that there are many other movies with scenarios so unlikely and even more outrageous that they are widely welcomed. They are the themes of race, religious motives and sexuality that the film exhibits that will have more effect on the opinion than anything else. The idea of ​​a black man chaining a white woman in his house is enough so that most people do not even consider seeing him. In a nutshell, it's not for everyone. As I said, to enjoy the most you have to go with an open mind, or else you're just wasting your money. For those of you who can do that, I recommend it highly.
