It was time "Kate Jackson" got her credit for this movie ... I remember seeing her and trying to understand her on television ... my grandmother was in bed dying of cancer and she was barely 15 years old. I did not find until years after Richard died a long time ago ... I miss him in the other shows / movies he was in. <br /> <br /> I still have a copy of the VHS tape but NOT "CC'd" or subtitled for people with hearing problems and that is the ONLY flaw in the movie that I can remember or know to date. I have not been able to find a copy on DVD or VHS that has English subtitles, even. If anyone knows that there is a copy on VHS or DVD that is CC'd or has subtitles in English, let me know. <br /> <br /> thanks - Cofffeenut
