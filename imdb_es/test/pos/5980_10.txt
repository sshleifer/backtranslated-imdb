THE ASCENT (1976), by Larisa Shepitko, is an extraordinary and exhausting account of the partisan struggle against the Nazis in Belarus occupied by the Germans. The Ascent reflects the Russian obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War, but unusually it is imbued with religious symbolism. and ready to recognize the existence of the Russian collaborator less than big. The real battle is not with the Nazis, who float in the background as mere extras, but between the Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, the captured supporter who finds the spiritual strength to go to his unbeaten death. With its numerous references to the Crucifixion, history acquires heroic proportions that glorify the sufferings of the martyr and their influence on future generations. A remarkable work.
