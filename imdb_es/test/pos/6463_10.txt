I cry in many movies. Call me sentimental Call me one of those spectators who always like to see a happy ending. This movie, although it has a sad ending, was great! Of all the actors I would love to have lunch with, it would be Sidney Poitier. His performance, along with John Cassavetes and Jack Warden (of 12 names of Angry Men) is stellar. His character, who befriends a man who flees (Cassavetes) and helps him in all possible ways, is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is another one of those forgotten noires made during the end of the Nordic era. It is well done, it has a magnificent cast, an extremely talented performance and a great cinematography. It is a movie that is worth seeing again and again. I highly recommend this one! This is just another really great movie made by Mr. Poitier and must be sold on DVD. Even though I cried, congratulations to such great art!
