I did not know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. He knew he had many followers, but he had also seen many of the director's later works that, while deliciously bloody, were also quite incoherent. NOT TORTURE A PATTERN actually had a linear plot and a mystery that kept me guessing almost to the end. And after everything said and done, it was a really disturbing and spooky experience. One important caveat: I would rather have listened to the original soundtrack and read the English subtitles than the unequal dubbing found here.
