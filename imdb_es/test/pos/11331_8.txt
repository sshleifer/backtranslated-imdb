The notion of conjugal fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today, but it is exactly the adherence of the main characters to that notion that makes the whole story so tragically moving. It is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to excel, since, as they refer to their respective wives, "they are not like them". <br /> <br /> As Tony Leung said in the movie, love just happens. It is not necessary that there be a rational explanation of how it happens, it simply does. Despite not wanting to bow to the level of their respective wives, it happened. Fidelity, social customs and times conspired to make this relationship come true. Simply being in love is far from being enough. <br /> <br /> I had the misfortune to sit next to a young couple (still in college thanks to the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the film, and not initiated into the pains of lost love and opportunities losses). His great inability to digest the subtlety and deep emotions evoked made me realize how much a movie like this is wasted, as well as the work of other Wong Kar Wei, in the local audience.
