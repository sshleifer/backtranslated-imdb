I was referred to this movie by a friend. I had never heard of that, but I thought I had Christopher Lampbert, so I rented it and, to discover it was not Christopher Lampbert, it was Thomas Jane who was great in this movie. I love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house. The characters were great for everyone and the script was incredible. I really wish that Skip Woods would write and direct another film. In my book, Thursday is the impeccable tale of this guy who tries to do wife and son things after a bleak past, but then his old drug dealer friend turns up and turns into all Thursday. This is one of my favorite movies and shows real potential in Thomas Jane. But this movie is very weird, but I found it in a couple of Hollywood videos on VHS. So dust off the old VCR and open on Thursday because it receives the seal of approval from Pee Wee
