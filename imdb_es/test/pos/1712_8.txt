Harry Langdon's "Saturday afternoon" is often among the biggest silent comedies, at least when it comes to short subjects, and therefore it can be a little disappointing for some. Unlike some of the other classics recognized, such as "Cops" by Keaton or "The Immigrant" by Chaplin, this film is, in some aspects, a conventional and familiar situation comedy, and does not offer much laughter; one may even wonder if Langdon belongs to such a rare company. However, in my opinion, it is a perfectly charming comedy in its minor sense, and Harry is fascinating to watch. <br /> <br /> For a modern spectator raised in television comedies, the plot of "Saturday Afternoon" may suggest The Honeymooners or their many spin-offs: two dark types, one of whom is married and very low control of his wife, try to escape with a couple of girls to spend a fun afternoon; But everything goes wrong, and they end up having to fight against the tough guy girlfriends of the girls. Does this sound familiar? And maybe a little sad? Well, the premise was already exhausted when this movie was made, but beyond that, nothing about Langdon was typical. It was strange, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged baby who was half asleep. Any Freudian who catches "Saturday afternoon" will have a field day with scenes between this shy chubby baby and his stern and domineering mama wife. When Harry tries to hide money under the carpet, but she catches him on the spot and forces him to turn him in, you'll swear he's seeing an interaction between a 6-year-old boy and his Mom. . . and maybe that's why Harry Langdon gave some people chills, and still does. <br /> <br /> But he's a convincing screen figure, and it's not what he does but the way he does it. In that scene with the coins under the carpet, for example, Harry finds the coins by placing one foot before the other, carefully, like a tightrope walker, counting his steps until he finds the right place, and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moved like nobody else. Whether he makes you laugh or not, the boy is fascinating, apparently in a world of his own. In regards to the plot of his films, Harry is curiously passive, and almost never makes the story advance by himself. At the end of "Saturday Afternoon", when the big fist fight is taking place, Harry's co-star, Vernon Dent, is in the middle of the action, but Harry is stunned for much of the time, and ends up like a punch. drunk between two cars (sitting on one's running board, but with their feet on the other) as they run through the streets. It is a memorable image and, as the critic Walter Kerr wrote, perfectly encapsulates Langdon's personality on the screen: he is a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of a frantic action, blinking sleepily as the world rushes. It's also worth noting that Langdon and Dent, who worked together frequently, have a relationship in this movie that suggests a plan that Laurel & Hardy would follow when they joined a year later. Langdon's style was a likely influence on Stan Laurel, especially here. <br /> <br /> "Saturday Afternnon" and its star may not be for everyone, but the movie is well worth watching, and Langdon may see it. an impression that is difficult to shake.
