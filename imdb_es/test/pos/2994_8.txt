First love. Teen love We have all experienced it, even if it was not as sweet as that shared by the protagonists. "Friends" could be considered an adaptation of the classic "The Blue Lagoon", originally from 1949, and its remakes of 1980 (the most popular, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While "The Blue Lagoon" places the two young lovers on a desert island, without contact with civilization, "Friends" goes the opposite way and is sure to sound much more real and will be a harder film for the contemporary public . Paul and Michelle who, for different reasons, turn their backs on the family and the adult world so that they end up living together in a small cabin in the south of France. Having just each other and the innocence of their childhood, their friendship slowly becomes much more as they struggle to stay, in this sweet story of coming of age. This movie, even to this day, is controversial since the actors are teenagers and you certainly see the ages that are mentioned in the movie (15 and 14 1/2). The film contains a hint of child abuse, nudity, depictions of teen sex and teen pregnancy. But the real controversy is not the issue, but the fact that the love of Paul and Michelle is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. While this worked well for stranded lovers once and on a desert island, having them in a modern environment presents some very difficult moral problems. Laws that prohibit sexual consent between minors are valid in almost all countries, and the lack of sexual education in adolescents is considered one of the causes of the increase in unwanted pregnancies and abortions in adolescents. It's a movie like this, just child pornography or a slap in the face of our own hypocrisy, with respect to a modern society that does not serve teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development, but that are needed to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions and most of us feel uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece, this film is really a forgotten and rough gem. The script advances with extreme simplicity, albeit with some sappiness, but never makes any effort to express its message, although by today's standards, it is somewhat slow. The photography is beautiful and has scenes of great beauty. The performance of the two protagonists varies from really horrible in some scenes to wonderfully innocent and credible in others. Pop music, unlike most of today's productions, is used with good taste and, sometimes, the lyrics express the thoughts of the protagonists. In general, this is a lovely piece, even if the moral values ​​do not match yours.
