I was lucky enough to see a midnight screening of this movie tonight. I must say that I expected a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely wrong. This movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but I loved everything. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the henchman of the mad doctor to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and intelligent dialogue, it did nothing but shine. But I really can not ignore the magic that is Bruce Campbell. Although I thought that Ted Raimi stole the show, Bruce did what he does best on the big screen. Somewhere between the evil American businessman and the tragic victim, he showed the same energy that has always proved incredibly attractive to the public. The film itself was often interrupted by the applause of the spectators. The crowd was definitely excited with every little twist the movie took. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be Oscar material, but my God, it was amazing. I would recommend it to any Bruce Campbell fan. Also, anyone who likes Campy's science fiction movies, do yourself a favor and look at this. I can not wait until this goes on DVD. <br /> <br /> Take it as you want ... <br /> <br /> - Powered
