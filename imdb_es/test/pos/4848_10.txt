I had to call my mother (a WASP) to ask her about this. Was it really that bad in the 40s in New York? Surprise, she could not remember. So I told her to watch the movie. Arthur Miller, in not a screen game but a NOVEL for a change, was 30 years old when he wrote this in 1945. It is a painful description of anti-Semitism. However, interestingly, there is a tender history of human relationships (Finkelstein, the Jew, with Newman, the non-Jew, mainly) underlying the cruel history. The acting is competent and the cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think that it is not great in the theater is that it is >> aaagh << controversial. <Br /> I actually give it ten out of ten. Maybe a little high, but it's worth seeing.
