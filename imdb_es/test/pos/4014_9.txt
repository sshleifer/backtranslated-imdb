These days, a children's show is rarely presented that does not involve 1) a preteen / teen pop star that is as fun as watching dry paint 2) involves a plot on how to find the perfect date with a different boy / girl each time 3) It revolves around the erratic cry and unintelligible humor. About 95% of the programs on Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network meet the criteria listed. To put it in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality and good storytelling. It is as if the producers and writers thought that the children are not intelligent enough to understand the development of the character and the details of the plot. They could not be more unconscious. Sure children enjoy a good laugh and erratic behavior (if done at a conservative level and done well), but also want to enjoy a story, see a drama and see how they challenge people. They do not want to see people who live in an impeccable world where they get everything they want. They know that this world is not all fun and games, they know it is not perfect. We all have problems and we all must learn to work around them. This show revolves around that kind of thing. Alex Mack is an average teenager who seems to have everything in her favor for her great sister, Annie. Her mother works in an office but sometimes she is a mother who stays at home. His father, George, is an important scientist at the plant, a chemical corporation that employs most of the city in which they live, Paradise Valley. Alex is unpopular and is chosen by most of his teammates. Her only friend is Ray (but she gets more friends as the series progresses). On his first day of Jr. High, Alex walks home not very happy with school, but a truck that delivers chemicals from the plant crashes into a fire hydrant trying to avoid hitting it, shedding a strange chemical known as GC-161, where the chemical mixture with water, covering Alex in it. Soon after, he begins to develop strange powers, such as turning into a puddle, firing lasers from his hand and moving things with his mind. She also shines constantly when she is nervous (although we never see much of that later). Apart from his sister Annie and his friend Ray, Alex decides to keep these powers secret for everyone, including his parents for fear of being kidnapped by the Plant, whose corrupt owner, Danielle Atron, has his chief of security, Vince, in look for the mysterious GC161 child. Each episode deals with Alex who tries to live a normal life as a child, at the same time he learns to live with his strange powers. The series may look like a girls show, but it is not. When I was a kid, I liked watching this show because of its impressive effects and dramas. The producers successfully add some elements of science fiction with the elements of the adolescent drama. In fact, some episodes were silent, violent and a little mysterious. The unfounded managers of the plant, Atron and Vince, are good antagonists of the series, since the writers really establish them as a threat and give you that terrible feeling every time they appear on the screen. Also, intelligent movement adding to David, the driver of the truck that spilled the GC-161, like the awkward assistant of Vince in the search of the comic effect, but you can also love it towards the end. It was interesting to see little Alex try to live like a normal child, but he struggles to perfect his powers. Sometimes, you forget that these are children fighting against a giant institution run by adults, because you are attracted to the story. The show does a good job of interacting with the children by showing Alex that she can have superpowers, but she is still a girl and should be careful. Even some episode will find you distressed by Alex's calamities. My favorite episode in which Alex wishes he had never been born proves most of these elements. As I said, the producers never hesitated to add some laughter if they come from Ray's only line or from the strange habits of George or David trying to be a good guy. Of course, you find cheesy moments and a full episode that really has nothing to do with the plot of the series, but what good series does not? All in all great show. 9/10
