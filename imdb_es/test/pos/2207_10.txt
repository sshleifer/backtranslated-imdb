Dark and dark sets, exciting music that crosses your turn like a knife (or a razor), a perfect cast led by Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. This is an exciting theater transferred impeccably to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented composer of our time and Todd is his masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the humorous ending of Act I "A Little Priest", where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims that will end up in their meat pies . This work never ceases to excite, excite and satisfy. Betsy Joslyn also stands out as Johanna, even her, since the naive of the plays seems a bit crazy. Edmund Lyndeck becomes a brave character as the corrupt Judge who wants Joslyn and is the subject of Todd's revenge. Lansbury and Hearn direct the show as only two great actors / stars can do it. Other musical themes include "Worst Cakes in London", "Todhan's" Johanna "Lovett, and the opening of" II GOD IS GOOD "from Act II, and that's a title to describe this production!
