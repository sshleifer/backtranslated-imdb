I was a big fan of this series. Yesterday I saw it again on DVD. I was afraid if the laughter would come or not? But in some episodes I laughed hysterically and some episodes were good. Acting as Rakesh Bedi (Raja) and Satish Shah is brilliant, while Swaroop Sampat is simply bad, but I think she does the work. Maybe a better actress could have been used instead of her. This series shows what a good and clean comedy is. <br /> <br /> If this series went on the air in the current year, it would have given it 9 out of 10. And to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good. I offer it 10/10. I recommend this series to watch on DVD.
