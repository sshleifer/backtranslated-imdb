This wonderful movie has never failed me. The color, the convincing cast and the impressive scenery make great contributions. This production, unlike the last remake of Carlton, is more impressionistic and is presented more from the perspective of children. It focuses on certain episodes of the enchanting story of E. Nesbit instead of trying to make a more documentary style of "warts and everything" that Carlton adopts. Above all, the excellent musical score of the late Johnny Douglas sustains the story throughout history, adding additional emotional depth. The net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the moving story of "The Railway Children." <br /> <br /> An uncomfortable factor for the viewer to reflect on throughout this film is how things have changed since that time - and in many ways, for the worse! Yes, perhaps many of us no longer have to use outdoor toilets and ride in horse-drawn carriages, but what about the quality of life in general? Consider the grumpy celebrities who now "adorn" our television screens. His language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. Consider, too, the fragile aspects of "here today, the day after tomorrow" of many of today's "associations", plus all single mothers - whatever happened in that institution called "marriage", when people accepted the faults of the others but they still stayed together, loving their children? These details add an extra touch to see this wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I hope that, as generations pass, children can still enjoy this movie. Not to mention certain adults!
