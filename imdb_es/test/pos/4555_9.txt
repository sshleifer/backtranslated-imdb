During my trip on a youth leadership forum, I was browsing channels until I found "Tommy Boy" on TBS. Since I had never seen this movie, I wanted to see it. My roommate, who has already seen this, told me: "This movie is a classic." After watching the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is constantly fun from beginning to end, thanks to the comedic duo of Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is a riot as the title character, a spastic fool who simply navigates through life as if it were not important. His forms of laziness soon stop when his father (Brian Dennehy), a rich "Break Pads King", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. This leads Tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend Richard (David Spade), to hit the road to sell enough pads to save the company. <br /> <br /> The main reason why "Tommy Boy" works is the fun performances of the main cast. Farley is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person is Spade and the third is Rob Lowe, the villain of the movie who has bad luck. Another fun guy is Dan Aykroyd, like Ray Zalinsky, a well-known extraordinary car. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie works is the great amount of jokes. Chris Farley has fun slapstick moments, and David Spade has fun sarcastic comments and simple phrases. The jokes in the film (some of which involve a deer and a plane toilet) are very funny, thanks to the director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), the writers Bonnie and Terry Turner. <br /> < br /> (3rd Rock From the Sun, That 70s Show), and the cast. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is a very funny movie, although for some unknown reason most film critics (including Roger Ebert) find it horrible and without grace. (I wonder when his sense of humor died). I recommend "Tommy Boy" for those who are great fans of comedy. Thank you very much, roommate.
