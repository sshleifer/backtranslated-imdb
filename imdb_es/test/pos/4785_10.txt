Steamboat Willy was not the first caricature of Mickey Mouse. The first movie to star the friend of America was "Plane Crazy". "Plane Crazy" was released on May 15, 1928 in Hollywood California, in silent film format. "Steamboat Willy" was released on November 18, 1928 as a SOUND movie (it was also released on July 29, 1928 as a silent movie). In this way, "Steamboat ..." became Mickey's first sound movie, but NOT the first movie for the little American mouse. While many game shows have used the question: "What was the first appearance of Mickey Mouse?" The real answer is "Plane Crazy" not "Steamboat Willy". These dates can be paid in IMDb under "release dates".
