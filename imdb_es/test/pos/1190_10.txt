Treat Williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie, and really wasted it. Do not get carried away by your bad movie choices since then. This movie really stands out. "Hair" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more with the person, of the famous peace movement of the 60s. There is a lot of spectacular music done in a spectacular way. Unlike the music videos of the late 70s, 80s and 90s, the videos match the theme of music. In other words, the video makes sense when combined with the songs, so you know you never could have done it on MTV. The issue resides in drugs and being hippies, but it is mainly an anti-war film that deals with the meaningless tragedies of Vietnam. One of the protagonists is a boy from Oklahoma who tries to make a difference, believing in all the patriotic booty that they feed him with a spoon, and meets a gang in New York, who are more or less glorified thugs; his characters are very unique, and probably would not make sense today, but this group joins in burning their draft cards. What happens in a spectacular scenario and in fascinating scenes that involve not only the three protagonists, but the other 3 members of the gang, as well as a newcomer with a small child, whose entrance is easily one of the ten entrances greatest of all time in the cinema, in part because she sings one of the best songs of that generation. In spite of their faults, you get to love these people, a cinematic triumph with a big heart and a great ending.
