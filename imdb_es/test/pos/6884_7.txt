The "Puppet Master only with terrifying parts" of Yong-ki Jeong was the most recent horror film in Korea that I had the pleasure of seeing. With the title of "Inhyeongsa" in Asia, this film immediately impressed me when I saw it online, with images that made me think of Puppet Master, Childs Play and other horror movies based on toys and dolls in the past. But for some reason I did not think ... "Boy, this will be in bad taste", I imagined it would be spooky and fun. The Toysome horror is almost fine. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, but I like that, so it was fine. The score, almost like the one I found with Acacia, was beautiful and reminded me a lot of the classic horror scores of the past. I will not reveal much, but the story was strong in this case, and I would recommend it to any Asian HORROR fan. It is not extreme, it should not be taken with the greatest seriousness, but it is really good.
