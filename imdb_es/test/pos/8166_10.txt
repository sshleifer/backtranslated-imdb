First of all, I would like to say that I am only an amateur when commenting on films and that English is not my native language, but that I felt a strong feeling that forces me to write about that film; possibly as a way to thank and congratulate C. Jay Cox, the cast and crew for such a brilliant production. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I saw "Latter Days" for the first time. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it might be similar to the movie "Priest", which I really liked to show a gay priest out of the closet. But "Priest", perhaps due to his limited Catholic ideological notions, did not satisfy the needs of my audience by revealing a sad and sad ending. <br /> <br /> The "last days", on the other hand, broke that concept (and some others too, like Mormon principles); presenting a tender and happy story, bringing it to a happy and emotional ending, and yet, awakening a feeling of God's blessing and hope. In fact, a great movie! <br /> <br /> Somehow, "the Days of the Last Days" made me feel like a city of angels. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes incredibly beautiful gay love stories!
