Oliver Stone is not someone to shy away from a movie or theme for that matter. He is anxious to confront people with their fears or show them their ugly faces in the mirror. Look in your CV for the test! This film is not an exception, but on the contrary, it is another jewel that, unfortunately, not many have seen. <br /> <br /> As controversial films go, this is one you should be grateful for. A film that should encourage you to think about you, the people that are by your side. The prejudices that exist and that each one of us has in one way or another. We like to admit it or not, but it is easier to classify people and say "Ah, he is 'xyz', yes, it must be like ...". I may be reading too much, but I do not believe that. I think Oliver Stone is a very intelligent filmmaker who pointed to those things. And if that's something you want to explore (like a movie or inside of you), then go see this movie and get excited!
