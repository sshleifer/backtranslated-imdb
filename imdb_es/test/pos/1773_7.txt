This is one of the several marine yarns of his time, which has the added distinction (although not in itself unique) of a female buccaneer in its center. At first, the two leaders, Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan, may seem grumpy, but eventually develop well in their roles, thanks without a doubt to the talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. Marshall, with a velvety voice, is presented unusually as the obligatory philosophical exuberance of a ship's doctor, and Gomez is suitably larger than life as Blackbeard The Pirate. <br /> <br /> Debra Paget is Jourdan's wife. who incurs the jealous fury of the disheveled character in whom Jourdan instills the first pains of love (which, however, does not save him from occasional whipping or sword wounds); By the way, the film was the second exotic team of Jourdan and Paget in a year, after BIRD OF PARADISE of Delmer Daves. The direct result of this unexpected softening of Anne's character is that she fought with the Blackbeard team, and her unlikely climate sacrifice to save the lives of the trapped Jourdan, Paget and Marshall. <br /> <br /> While the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its kind, the energy direction of Jacques Tourneur and the great score of Franz Waxman ensure an above-average effort that progresses at a good pace; By the way, Tourneur had already done service in the genre with the top vehicle Burt Lancaster, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW (1950). As usual in vintage Technicolor productions, cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating. By the way, different execution times are given for this movie (81 or 87 minutes) and, for the record, the version that I saw was the shortest.
