This was one of those movies that I always found myself with (either on TV or on a cheap DVD), but I was never surprised to give it a try, since I thought I was not missing much. It was in one night and I thought oh well? Why not. A good decision too, since I would kick myself for taking so long to achieve it. For me, it left me impressed, since it's up there with the best features of Burt Reynold ('Deliverance', 'White Lightning' and 'Boogie Nights') and goes back to those shocking urban crime thrillers of the 70's and 80's that They did not fear to be a dark omen and do everything possible to set up characters, pack with a brutal realistic force and effectively incorporate local locations (as is the case in Atlanta here) to the crease with photographs to the ground. In certain shades he reminded me of 'dirty Harry', but that's not much. However, it is a sharp blues score, with its slow kicks, funky changes and unhinged sounds, it made me think a lot about the pulsating Lalo Schifrin score that he orchestrated for 'Dirty Harry'. The music soundtrack on the other hand is unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Sgt. Tom Sharky was a narcotic agent from the Atlantic before a slip during a bust saw him demoted to work as vice president. Along with their new squad, they find a prostitution network, which catches their attention because it is owned by someone difficult to track down and to condemn a crime lord. What they unearth involves a prominent government figure and a prostitute who can give them some important names, but they must reach it before it becomes a target. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynold acts, but also directs them. a firm and muscular style that would adapt to his laconic performance and the thematic and tense script of Gerald Di Pego (adapted from the novel by William Diehl). Well, it does show some kind of insightful heart / thoughts between that armor within the scenes involving the British actress Rachel Ward, either in the surveillance scenes when she is watching from another building (and little by little she is falling in love with she) until they finally get together, but these last half-way interactions reduce the momentum but give it noir as hits. The performances are quite successful, since Reynold formulated a great relationship with the exceptional actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The scathing mockery and witty dialogues between these guys were wonderful. As for the corrupt villains, Vittorio Gassman builds a mighty force and power, but it is Henry Silva (who seems born for these roles) a relentless and implacable turn that makes the show. Where your appearance seems to delineate things to come and help them fit into place. In addition, his climax of cat and mouse full of adrenaline and violent with Sharky and his team is brilliantly done. <br /> <br /> Exciting action passages can be fast and dry, but remain lethally violent as an immense interrogation sequence. . Some old-fashioned filming techniques add to suspense. The intriguing material keeps it quite tactical to be derived from the character, but when we believe that its smooth navigation offers one or two strong surprises along with some intensely severe confrontations.
