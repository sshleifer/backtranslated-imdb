I do not know if I would dare to say that this movie belongs to the stack of 'Aussie trash', but it is fair to say that there are no Academy Award nominees here. What must be taken into account is that most of the actors in this film were not really actors as such, only children with nothing better to do at that time. There were many others who were offered roles in the film, but were rejected to navigate the coast; All things taken into account, it really was not a bad movie for its time. In some respects, it is not very different from today's times, where peer pressure is still alive and carefree, only without mobile phones, computers and other similar devices that children lived without, unlike this generation . Anyway, I have to rate this movie as an old favorite that I see once in a blue moon and I never take myself too seriously ...
