-has Carla Gugino * yay * and a horrible ending * boo * <br /> <br /> - "Jaded" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who comes to a city trying to escape from her past. While there she meets two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have fun. But one of the girls takes things a little further and rapes her while the second stops her. They discover her on the beach where the incident occurs the next day and take her to a hospital. After that, we spent the rest of the movie watching her trying to take down the two girls and, at the same time, we learn new information about who she is and where she comes from and a little about her past. <br /> <br /> - Director and co-author Caryn Krooth does an excellent job with this film considering her low budget. It is portable and, at times, it looks 16 mm, but it fits the film, since the story demands a severe look. All the actors do good work with what they are given and there really is nothing to complain about. The outstanding feature of the film is, of course, Carla Gugino, who discovers everything in this film. She is more naked in this movie than in "Sin City". Christopher McDonald is also in the movie, but his character does not make much sense, but it's fun to watch. I did not really pay much attention to music, since it does not really attract attention, but it does the work with what it has. The film is rated R and is for a very good reason. It is very sexual and very graphic at times. Essentially, sometimes it's soft edges, but sex scenes are necessary for the movie, so they do not seem to be there for the simple fact of being there. Although there is a nonsensical scene in which we see that Chris McDonald understands, that scene was a little pointless, but I guess it's not a big problem. The only flaw in the movie is that we can not see the trial in court after everything we went through in the movie. It's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something. <br /> <br /> "It's a shame that the talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature film since this. This is a very talented woman who can do great things on a very small budget. I really hope she comes back to the game soon because she is an amazing director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema, instead, what we have is a nice movie that shows a great director in the making. <br /> <br /> - Hide the children and close the curtains, you do not want people to do it. I think you're watching porn while watching this movie.
