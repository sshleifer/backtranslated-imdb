I've recently seen a few films from the Far East ... some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, the Eye), and some were not that great (Versus, The Triple Cross). Then there are others like Uzumaki and Returner, which although defective I still enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The basic premise has to do with the mysterious and horrible effects that a growing obsession with spirals has on a community. Does it sound silly? Yes, that is what was thought. First, the good. The address was top notch, certainly a little over the top in some places, but never less interesting and elegant. Secondly, the story was original and as other writers remarked very lovelace-esq ... it was interesting. What reminded me most, however, was at the beginning of Cronenberg; Movies like Shivers and Videodrome. <br /> <br /> The performance was not great, but it's not too horrible either. To be honest, I was actually bored sometimes ... I felt that the pace especially at the beginning was a bit slow. My main problem was that I was too silly and funny to be a real horror, but not enough to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washing machine =)) and I liked the last shot / speech. At first I thought it ended too abruptly, but about 20 seconds later I realized the meaning and I liked the ending. However, due to the lack of seriousness in the story, combined with the most important scenes, such as the news report from the school, I was not very interested in the characters at the end. The final scene, which maybe was supposed to be a bit touching, while in reality I really could not care about the girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * <br /> <br /> So, overall, I liked this movie, but it frustrated me and I think there was real potential besides some good scenes. Couple of other points, the main girl is pretty pretty and cute, and the song that plays at the end is also good. I rated it 7/10. <br /> <br />
