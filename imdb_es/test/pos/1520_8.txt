Closet land is not in a happy movie. Nor is it connected to any kind of social realism. This is perhaps his strength. The distance between time and specific nations strengthens the message, makes it more powerful and takes away the burden of nationalism and propaganda that is often perceived in films made to criticize nations as opposed to their own (of course, I am speaking mainly of the propaganda of the United States in the United States). some commercial movie). <br /> <br /> Bit closet land is much more than a message. It is a film of pure and surreal beauty, full of the same clean and clinical form found in works like 1984 and is equal to it. <br /> <br /> I'm an old Alan Rickman fan, the man with the golden sarcasm (and, I might add, the incomparable sex appeal ;-)). The game between him and Madeleine Stowe is brilliant. Every time I see him, he seems to play a character even more unpleasant than the last ... <br /> <br /> But, enough sweetness. The movie lacks action. I do not want any car to crash, but I want something to happen, except to speak pure. After an hour I really got tired of the interrogation room, the predictable actions and, more than anything, I wanted a more complex view of all this, the world, the previous lives of the characters and all the rest of the framework that was missing . For some people a good touch. For me, something less positive. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Closet Land is a worthwhile movie, it's time to make a trip to the abyss of human nature. <br /> <br /> And of course. Of course for us who really love the always bad Alan Rickman.
