I'm glad I'm not the only one who finds this series very good. This is the best series for young ladies! I have a strange taste in comedies and it's hard for me to please my intelligence, and I'm so happy that his humor is exactly what I need. I love the gang of actors! If someone knows a series or just a movie similar to this, I say enough please answer because I missed the series. <br /> <br /> And I kindly ask the writers and producers to CONTINUE it, even if the actors. Now we've all grown up, I guess! <br /> <br /> Have a good morning / day / afternoon / night! (because I do not know the exact time you will read this publication)
