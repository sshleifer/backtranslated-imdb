This was the third time I tried to watch this movie. The two previous times, I found the beginning so disgustingly sweet and "schmaltzy" that I simply stopped seeing. However, now that I am a little older and more compulsive, I forced myself to watch the whole movie and I was very surprised to see that I really liked it a little. So, I watch the movie in the same way I would like to swim in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that's around 21-22 degrees Celsius for all those who love metrics). Sure, the water is terribly cold and shocking at first, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, you'll get used to it, so resist the urge to jump right away! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a long exchange between Flynn and his daughter, played by Patty Brady. Some may find very nice and endearing conversations, although others may find them a bit difficult to take, as these moments are incredibly sweet. In a way, it was an amazing performance by Flynn because it's hard to imagine him in real life having children or acting in a domestic way, especially that he wanted to be faithful to a woman in this movie, now THIS IS ACTING! NEVER SAY GOODBYE refers to the divorced couple, Flynn and Parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. Since both love each other, as well as their lispy child, it seems an inevitable conclusion that they will once again marry. However, there are some serious problems that stand in his way: Lucille Watson (who plays her older mother-in-law and control character), Flynn's girlfriend (after all, he is Errol Flynn and is divorced, so you have to wait for a girl somewhere and a marine (played by Forrest Tucker). <br /> <br /> No wonder all this is resolved in the end and everyone lives happily ever after. If it's formulaic and predictable, the film is a winner because it's fun to watch, Flynn, despite his reputation as an action and adventure hero, is very good at comedy-romance and it's fun to watch. Movie has the scene of chewing Cuddles Sakall, which is so cute and sweet that it is perfect in this kind of movies.And, in spite of the sweetness, the movie is pretty well written.The conclusion is that the movie is FUNNY. /> <br /> Therefore, my recommendation is that VEA is Take the movie and force yourself to not realize the disgustingly sweet aspects of the movie. Once you have overcome this, the rest of the movie is an image that is well worth your time.
