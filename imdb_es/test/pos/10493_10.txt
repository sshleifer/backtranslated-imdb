The first time I saw this movie on hbo was around 1983 and I loved it! I checked all the auction websites to buy the vhs copy. This is a very good suspense movie with some twists that make it more interesting. I do not want to say much more because if you ever have the chance to see it, you'll be glad you did not say too much!
