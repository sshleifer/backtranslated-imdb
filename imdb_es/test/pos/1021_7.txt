A pleasant film, no doubt, and very evocative of his time and that particular stage in the "rites of passage" of any child. But I have to say that after reading the very positive comments here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. Everything revolves around the most atrocious part of the history of school works. The idea that Quack Quack is chosen to play not only in one of the three three-star spins, but in a fanatic, is laughable. And without that, nothing. The subplots had no relationship that I could see with the main plot, all could be eliminated in its entirety without affecting in any way the main story, which surely suggests a fundamental flaw. When all of their subplots seem quilted, they know that a central idea is extending beyond its limits. However, it is a benign film with its heart in the right place, there are some good performances, and you only have the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated in the final 'cut'. That good feeling permeates the movie. And that has to count for something. A very good defective movie. 7 out of 10
