While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it's better than most in general. I mean, he had his little laughs and just a good feeling. It is not often that we see two old fans just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes. Walter and Jack had great chemistry together as friends / brothers-in-law. Just seeing them in a romantic relationship with these women was fun and you encouraged them to the end because, however, we have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had game! : D I loved the whole plot of being able to go ahead and have fun no matter how old you are. I recommend this movie for a good laugh if you want one. <br /> <br /> 7/10
