A very visible film, and that was expected with impatience after having seen the trailer several times. <br /> <br /> Everything seems magnificent, from the ridiculous efforts of the high class effete to distance oneself from mediocrity, For the scum of the lower class that tries to keep their heads above the filth, the film captures the spirit 18th century in a brilliant way. <br /> <br /> Jonny Lee Miller plays Maclean extremely well, although the role is not exact. , and Robert Carlyle seems a bit wasted on Plunkett, Miller's road partner. <br /> <br /> The real protagonist of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr. Chance (a kind of police chief from 1740) with an evil Glee who got him out of the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> A great movie, and anyone who enjoys the color and style of Peter Greenaway's films will love the look of it, although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours pass. . <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
