I also saw it in the cinema in the 80s and I have never forgotten it, although I have never seen it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I would see it now it would look old-fashioned, but remembering the story and comparing it to some of the terrible modern movies I've seen in Zone Horror, I think it would get up very well. <br /> <br /> I can still remember that his coffin slid out and opened and all the corpses revived, and the blue ray. Having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this, it must be good.
