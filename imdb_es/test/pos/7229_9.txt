In the sordid streets somewhere in New York City, a lone punk named Tromeo (Will Keenan) has little friends, but all they do is tattoo, pierce themselves and simply party all the time. He falls in love with a beautiful and rich girl named Juliet (Jane Jenson), who also worries that his father is becoming an abusive and abusive son. You know what, but as the characters in our title meet and fall, things start to be quite magical. they. Unfortunately, their parents are confronted, since Juliet's father wants to take over Tromeo's dad's movie studio, but could love really conquer them all and stop this fight? <br /> <br /> The satire of the horror comedy of the crazy and nasty horror comedy Troma is a wonderful and modern version of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. This was released in cinemas in 1997 and received some good reviews, as it is a dark humor satire of the legendary story that started it all, it has good laughs, piercings, graphic violence and gore, like a shattered head in a fire hydrant . . For me, this is the third best Troma movie with the immortal "Toxic Avenger" and "Troma's War" being the second one, yes, the acting can be a bit bad like some Troma movies, but the above things makes up for it and This is a must see the movie if you like horror comedies, Peter Jackson and Troma or if you want to see a comic version of a beloved story, BTW is also looking for a couple of funny appearances by The Toxic Avenger and SGT. Kabukiman NYPD. <br /> <br /> It was also recommended: "The toxic avenger", "Meet The Feebles", "Ichi The Killer", "Re-Animator", "Terror Firmer", "Class of Nuke'Em High", "Romeo and Juliet (1968 and 1996)", "Pieces", "Troma War", "Toxie Citizen: The Toxic Avenger 4", "Cart Case", "Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky", "Demons "," New Nightmare "," Freddy Vs.
