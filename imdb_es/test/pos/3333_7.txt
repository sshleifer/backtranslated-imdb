"The Saint Takes Over", starring George Sanders as Simon Templar, also known as "The Saint" in this 1940 entry to the series. It also stars Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guilfoyle. On board a ship en route to the United States, The Saint meets and tries to find time with a woman (Wendy Barrie) who gives her the weed. Simon will come to New York to help Inspector Fernack, now completely discredited due to a kidnapping of gang members; $ 50,000 were found in his house. The gangster, Rocky (Roland Drew), of course, was declared innocent at the trial, and he and his fellow mafiosi pay the bill for the framework and attorney's representation: $ 90,000 in total. Today you need it to defend yourself against a parking ticket. This was murder for murder. <br /> <br /> Rocky sends his bodyguard, Pearly Gates (Guilfoyle) to the lawyer's house to steal the $ 90,000 from the safe. The lawyer catches him with his flushed hand and sends him back to his boss with a message. Seconds later, he is dead. Rocky finds a similar fate. And again and again, who is killing this group of gangsters? The Saint has to get one of them to speak so that Fernack can be released. Can you reach someone before they are killed? The woman he met aboard the ship reappears and occupies a prominent place in the case. <br /> <br /> Few actors have a way of speaking like George Sanders, and his wit, good looks, soft voice and depth as an actor. Simon costume templar perfectly. Paul Guilfoyle provides some humor while nerves drink milk Pearly Gates, and Jonathan Hale is great as Inspector Fernack sick, sometimes exasperated but worried. Wendy Barrie, who appeared in many episodes of Saint, is very good as the woman who captures Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very nice.
