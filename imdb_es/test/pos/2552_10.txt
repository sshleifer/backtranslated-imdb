Ramin Bahrani established a scene at the beginning in Chop Shop that made me immediately identify where the character of Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend came from. The two of them climb a meter and, as soon as the doors close, they ask if they could get everyone's attention for a moment, and they're selling chocolate bars or M & M's or something, and then proceed to sell some pubs. If you (like me) have ever been on a subway in New York City, at any time, this is the kind of situation that happens so often that you almost do not notice it. Often, people in a subway see children like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something in a subway and do not pay attention to them. Bahrani's approach is not necessarily only in the children who put things on sale in the subway trips, but in the survival and in the state of being in the lower class in the United States. It is, later, in your hands, reflective and heartbreaking, usually at the same time. <br /> <br /> To compare it with Pixote or with the bicycle thief is not too far away (actually in the latter, at least the father and son have each other), although Bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style. We care about this character, Ali, who is not more than eleven years old and works in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping to disarm others, and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him. But it is not simply because we have clich√©s fed by force, apart from, you know, a brother and sister (more, brother) who try to take care of each other. Bahrani makes history accessible through the simple aspiration of Ali, the kind of goal that can be achieved in his situation: save enough to buy a used food truck that Ali and Isamar can operate themselves. <br /> <br /> It's all that Ali is working for, but what Bahrani shows us with a brutal detail is this work, what Ali has to do to make this happen, even if its unpleasant things, like starting car tire hubcaps at Shea Stadium or, at some point, steal A purse at a desperate moment. This makes it an even more serious problem when Ale sees what her sister does for money on the side at night, doing sexual favors for the men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. He does not mention it and set it aside, but it's always something that increases the tension, something that Ale wants to protect her sister. It adds to the tragedy when Ale discovers the real cost of what it will take to turn the food truck into a profit generator, a cost that adds to the anguish he simply internalizes. <br /> <br /> One could immediately see the fact that Ale is an orphan in a neighborhood like Queens. The film was filmed in a natural way, as in a work of neo-neo realism (let's call it realism), presenting practically all non-professional actors in the parts of mechanics and workers and people in the streets, but Bahrani is more focused in the here and now, and that is what makes Chop Shop so immediate and sincere. There is no trace of melodrama in the film, just the accompaniment of music, apart from live Latin music that comes from cars and radios. Sometimes, Bahrani focuses on a very subtle moment that makes it more pronounced in other scenes, such as the way Ale is awake but acts as if she were asleep the first night after having witnessed Isamar's nocturnal date, and we see that When you lie down in bed, you probably know you're awake but no one can say a word. Or, in many other scenes, poetic touches that seem impeccable, like when the man shows Ale how the pigeon feeding works. <br /> <br /> It's rough and rough, as you might expect, and it's not like that. Give your main characters much hope despite the few moments of happiness scattered. It is also a beautifully shot hand-held film, where the technique, like many of the films made in its urban tone and focus, informs and complements the subjects on the screen and what they are doing, but it is never reckless. Shooting or too much striking. The filmmaker has an excellent cast of "real life" (Ale was taken from a public school in New York without any experience) and knows how not to miss a shot, while at the same time achieving a brutal art just by showing what it shows . It is not City of God or Pixote; It's your own little masterpiece about a character or characters we would not normally take a second look at (or the first just) on our way into a city like New York. If you are not moved by Ale and his daily struggles, I do not know what to do for you.
