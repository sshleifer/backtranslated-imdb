This was very funny, even if it crumbled a bit in the end. Do not exaggerate with the homage after Hitchcock. Owen (Danny DeVito) was lucky to have "Strangers on A Train" at the local cinema, so the movie tells you that was the inspiration. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very funny but also a bit sad. He has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like him. His teacher, Billy Crystal, is going through a serious block of writers and his wife stole his book and turned it into his own success, which has also frustrated him a lot. <br /> <br /> The best parts are the proposal from Mr. Pinsky's book ("One hundred girls I'd like to make pig") and all the scenes with Anne Ramsey, which is so horrible that even Mother Teresa would have wanted kill her too.
