This is a funny movie. The feeling of Bob and Eddie Show could lead to a sequel, but I doubt he earns enough money. <br /> <br /> Deniro proves that he can be a great straight man again with some fun and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch work with people instead of animals and CGI rodents. Ren√© Russo, well, it's fun to watch anyway and he has played his excellent role. <br /> <br /> Some strange and unusual acrobatics, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and we got a lot of the movie and the big results at the end. DO NOT LEAVE AT the beginning of the credits! <br /> <br /> At least a 7.
