This is a "docu-drama" of (mostly) the last years of KW's life, with almost all parts played by actors (but find out what mayor the television superintendent plays!). It was created for the BBC4 arts channel, but I guess soon there will be syndication and DVD. KW is skillfully played by the excellent Michael Sheen, who here repeats his role in the previous scenario with great success. Most of the cast is also very good, and a nice touch is the recreation of the television appearances of the time with the new actors. However, this is not a light sight, since anyone familiar with KW's diaries and their unhappy general behavior will already know how twisted it could be in later life, so do not expect 80 minutes of Carry-style buffet On, since the emphasis is decidedly negative. . Recommended, but it's tragicomic, by the way.
