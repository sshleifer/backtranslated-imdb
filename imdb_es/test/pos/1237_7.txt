Adapted from the work of Sam Shepard, this film retains many elements of play, such as a relatively fixed environment (a motel on Highway 50 in the Southwest) and extensive and intriguing dialogues. A woman "May" is harassed by a man "Eddie" (played by Sam Shepard). She tries to hide from him in the secluded motel, but he finds her. The film explores the history of their relationship, mainly from their childhood, which has led them to this point. It is very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and understand that their present dysfunctional relationship is the result of past events that are beyond their control. Mainly we see them fight, make up, fight, make up and so on. An image that stands out in my mind is that of Eddie dragging May over his shoulder, kicking and screaming, taking her to a place she does not want to go. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also a perfect country and full of voices. Lesser known artist "Sandy Rogers". She has this field doll voice that almost sings in some parts of the album! This is the type of movie that will be hosted somewhere in your brain / soul. In other words, go and see it!
