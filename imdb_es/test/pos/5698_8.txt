I swore that I would never allow myself to devote myself to the false authority figures of the sixties who told me that things were better in the "good old days". The current Australian prime minister is a sordid example of such a mentality. <br /> <br /> But I changed to "A Decade under the Influence" because I found myself watching the much-advertised documentary "Sneakers" on the Other Channel as such a daunting experience. I found the values ​​expressed by the respondents of "Zapatillas" too ugly to accept as reasonable. So materialistic! So devoid of any indignation of indignation in a society that can tolerate killing someone to steal their very ugly shoes! So they lack a worthwhile purpose that they can report without displeasure to the exploitation of an audience by haranguing it from holding those shoes over their heads to close a sponsorship deal for themselves with a company of shoemakers, it was too much to follow observing <Br /> <br /> "A decade under the influence" represented a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places. <br /> <br /> I have noticed the change in the cinema. doing that accompanied the exposure of the disastrous debacle of US foreign policy in Vietnam and so many less informed places on my website www.peterhenderson.com.au. "A decade under the influence" documents the precise moment in which that change occurred. <br /> <br /> Before the 1970s, the armed forces were represented in American films as an invincible fighting force composed of decent human beings who transmuted into conquering heroes on the battlefield. After the seventies, they are usually portrayed as a discouraged mob cheated by a group of bureaucrats clowns in the Pentagon. Before the 1970s, the FBI agent and the honest cop tended to be described as his friend and protector. After the seventies, the FBI agents were all incompetent and the best a policeman could hope for was to ignore his stupidity and the corruption of his superior and defend justice in an idiosyncratic manner. <br /> <br /> Before the seventies, the archetypal American "little boy", the "average Joe", type Jimmy Stewart, would face the problems encountered and, therefore, get an idea of ​​wisdom underlying of its elected leaders and of the justice of the "American way". After the seventies, Kevin Costner usurps that role, but now it is the voice of one who cries out in the desert for evil to be exposed, or to accept his fate and do the best he can. <br /> <br /> And now those "old-time religion" mentalities have been stripped of all honesty and righteousness and portrayed (with a certain amount of justification) as intolerant bigotry and selfish hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> "A decade under the influence" says it as it was. "A decade under the influence" says it as it is now. Represents the redemption of the American film industry from the hand of the magnates of studies in artistic, moral and intellectual bankruptcy. It shows the assault on the Hollywood Bastille by independent filmmakers who promised to take a disillusioned and tired audience to theaters. The fact that his failures were numerous, and sometimes disastrous, simply underscores the greatness of his achievement. An achievement reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of the big box office stars, such as Clooney, Daman, Affleck, etc., and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent.
