I captured this movie on the Horror channel and I was quite impressed by the atmosphere and the gothic tone of the film. As a big fan of all things related to vampires, I'm always happy to see a new variation of vampire myths, in this case, a ghoul-like creature that resides in another Lovecraftian dimension. The director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark humor of the subject, using the decadent art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a love story that embraces time and space: the pure love of friendship as opposed to the Lust for blood and life. For the vampires in history. The characters of the story are transported to another dimension by means of a substance that alters the mind, where a vampire creature that changes shape seems to grant them their hearts desires, while taking away the essence of their life. There are some analogies with drug addiction and loss of control, and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I enjoyed watching the two main male characters in the story, Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich, who were very attractive, always a positive point in a vampire story for the spectators! The makeup of the special effects and the effects of the creatures were well done, and the design of the vampire dimension was very effective. In short, a nice version of the myths of vampires, and is recommended to all who like their vampires with some intelligence and not just action. The only thing missing to do even better would have been a little more eroticism and nudity, since it would have adapted to the plot and the themes.
