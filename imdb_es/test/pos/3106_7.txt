On the way to a country house to listen to a new play that is read, a theatrical producer, his secretary and the playwright end up trapped in the mud. They go to a nearby house, only to end up in the house of the dramatist's fianc√©. If you can not guess that they are going to commit murder and chaos, then you have not paid attention. <br /> <br /> This is a good entry into the old genre of the dark house. Not only does he have a good mystery, but he also has some very funny liners wandering around him. The cast is excellent in all areas and they are more than willing to have a good time with what is good material. <br /> <br /> I would love to say that this is one of the best of the genre, it should have been, but for me something happened in the way it made me downgrade to only seven out of ten. I can not tell you what it is, in any way I'm not sure. Maybe it's the feeling that I knew where I was almost from the beginning, or maybe it's something else, I'm not sure of what, but there was something that I could not help but love this movie despite wanting to love it. . I just missed being great and somehow fell short. <br /> <br /> That said I SUGGEST YOU WILL. After all, it is a very ingenious film, which entertains completely, although it only needs to be great.
