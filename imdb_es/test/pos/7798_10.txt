I can not believe that this movie has such a low rating. It could be said that it is one of the best comedies that have been made, and probably the best Bollywood comedy of the 90s. The film did not work too well at the box office and people had diametrically opposed reactions after watching it. I guess most people did not expect it to be a full comedy and they expected a normal movie. If you love comedies, this is a must see. And Aamir Khan is outstanding.
