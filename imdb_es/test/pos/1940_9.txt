I just took a look at another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways in which the teenagers in this movie use the body of their dead friend. one that is overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most disturbing of all, it is not surprising that it is what the character of crispin glover (layne) does. he is delighted that one of his friends has murdered another friend of his, the murderer's girlfriend. Not because Layne does not like this guy, he's rather excited about his death because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored with life, and dead inside, that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it gives him something to focus on.
