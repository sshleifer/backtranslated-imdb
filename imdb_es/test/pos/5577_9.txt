I think FARSCAPE is the best scifi since Babylon 5 and it's one of the best science fiction TV series of all time (with Dr. Who, Blake's 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and B5 mentioned above). I find that the characters and races of Farscape are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical "humans with birthmarks" that are found in many series. The effects are pretty good and the stories attractive. Despite having lost most of season 2 and part of season 1, the development of the character seems very well done.
