In "Checking Out," Peter Falk plays an elderly New Yorker who summons his children home so they can be with him before he plans to commit suicide. As the movie progresses, we can see the faults of all and other problems. While some people may interpret this as a "comforting" movie, I enjoyed it mainly because the character of Peter Falk did not let anything discourage him, and I even got involved in a bit lascivious from time to time. <br /> <br /> Therefore, It may not be the best movie, but it's worth seeing. For a long time I thought that Peter Falk has the perfect look to interpret this type of paper, with his glass eye and everything. Also starring Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danese (Falk's real life wife).
