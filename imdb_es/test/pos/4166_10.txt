All the characters in this caricature were hilarious. Norman, the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad boy, would always swear to kill Max with an insane laugh. Writing is the best. <br /> <br /> I was stuck on the set when this would happen when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they did, they would have forced me to buy it. This and a caricature of Conan the Barbarian are the ones I miss the most from my childhood. I think these cartoons are the most despised of all the great cartoons. I used to see these cartoons on channel 13 in the Los Angeles area. <br /> <br /> I remember that the owl was always afraid, warning Max that he was in trouble and that he was the chosen one. Max did not believe that he was the chosen one and always gave the owl trouble. Norman was less talkative but his simplicity was fun. He said things like "I eat monsters for breakfast" when I was fighting against them. And then, when fighting against zombies, he would say: "I eat zombies to ... it does not matter". Classic comedy and action comedy. <br /> <br /> I vote for them to broadcast to Mighty Max.
