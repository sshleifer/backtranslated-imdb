When one stops to remember the frequent screen group of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, "They Died With They Boots On" (1941) is probably the film that best remembers. It is the great saga of General Custer (Flynn): counted from the moment he enters the military academy of West Point and falls in love with the delicious Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland), during his stay in the American Civil War, and finally with his death in Little Big Horn. The director, Raoul Walsh, rides his historical epic on the laurels of the highly questionable retraction of historical texts, rewritten by screenwriters Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until truth and fiction are completely distorted. Therefore, the battle against the Crazy Horse Chief (Anthony Quinn) is presented as a twisted agreement between the politicians: California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and a falsely absent corporation that wants to reclaim the land that Custer gave to the Indians through the systematic genocide of the nation. First Peoples <br /> <br /> Flynn, who cleverly plays Custer as if he were part of Arnold Schwartzenegger in two parts by Albert Schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. Literally oozing charm and sex appeal for every pore that easily melts the heart of your loyal heroine. Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet, Warner resident players, provide wonderful cameos that seem to have much more depth and character than what is actually written in the material for them. <br /> <br /> In general, then, despite its scarce historical representation. in favor of a good romantic yarn, "They Died With They Boots On" is a broad forage for a Saturday morning or a Sunday night lulling with the bride. The Warner DVD is pretty nice. Although the grain of the film is often obvious, the grayscale has reproduced very well with deep blacks and very clean white and solid. Some fading is evident during the transitions of the scene. The audio has been cleaned very well and is presented at an adequate listening level.
