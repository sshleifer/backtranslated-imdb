I really did not see this coming. Roy Andersson had me trapped, I'm the perfect fool for a static camera (Long live King Borowczyk!) And I laughed hysterically during the first fifteen minutes of the film, hit me right between the eyes. You have to be a brilliant man to make self-pity hilarious. Andersson reminds me of the third companion of the Pequod in Moby Dick, Flask, a man who took his whole life as a practical joke that the good lord himself is playing with us. And the network of selfishness in this movie is truly hilarious. <br /> <br /> The level of satire is at a high point, you have a deceived repentant and repentant harp about the cruelty of the world and then you totally ignore spiritual self-reflection that cries out in agony. The very depths of egotism are connected. I never really thought it would be possible to go further than "The Silence" by Bergman in this regard. However, the grotesque self-esteem and self-esteem, for every character in this film, is amazing. It shows us an existence in which the talented and the inactive rails against a world that they believe has been unfair towards them, really are legends in their own living rooms. Human beings in this film make self-deception and self-deception a great art form! <br /> <br /> Only one woman in the movie seems to have some kind of understanding of what is going on. An old woman who refuses to leave a chapel, kneeling in prayer for the forgiveness of all humanity, her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I have heard. She reveals through her prayers that what is wrong in the world should not be fixed by simple retouching, there are not only some faults, there is a gulf of corruption that can only be repaired by the immolation and the day of judgment. Watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk, he was standing waist-deep in a cold river at midnight screaming at thousands of Kyrie people for the sins of humanity. Another big surprise is that it is clear that his prayers are useless and, in fact, he is preventing everyone from going home at the time of closing. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for the presumptuous, nobody gets rid, no idols are left on the altar, no group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group. There has never been a more amazing, more startlingly beautiful summary of our sins. It's a movie for the end of the world, it's the big joke, the great practical joke of human life! <br /> <br /> From the image catalog it is too difficult to choose a favorite, I slapped my thigh and almost fell off the chair at the cinema, screaming with laughter when a man tried to throw the tablecloth from under a set the service. I will not spoil what happens, but the suspense accumulates and something truly unexpected happens. It's probably the funniest thing I've seen in a movie theater. I'm quite reserved and I could not control myself: that's the measure of the greatness of this movie. <br /> <br /> The filming of "You, the Living One" is impeccably formalistic. We are shown the palette of an artist, sordid browns, yellows, grays and azure blues charged by the impact of the luminous textures of brass. There is never a tone out of place, it is like an hour and a half of melting Symphonic whistlerian colors. The obsession that must have been put in putting that color scheme in place is extraordinary. And no shot is lost, as with all great movies, there is not an inch free of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best movie I've seen in my life.
