Presented at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and gaining considerable fame, this film seems to be another modern and profound school drama. <br /> <br /> This is a group of teenagers who overcome a revealing and desperate day in school. Everything is spinning around a suicide, which is shown from the beginning to a certain point, which occurs at 2:37 pm. The characters are somehow all connected to each other. What moves them is described through sequences of short interviews, strictly filmed in b / w. The characters are well written, the acting is intriguing (especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus are discoveries). <br /> <br /> Let's continue with the cinema technique. That is what really impressed me. Rarely there are cuts, most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists, as in the Gus van Sants elephant. Some scenes are presented more than once, but each time from a different point of view (here: character). This surely evokes an atmosphere that develops slowly, but that literally catches you. The colors are vibrant, somehow improper considering the difficult plot, but that is nothing more than an intelligent contrast, an "all is well". The use of lighting is adequate all the time, which underlines the real mood of the characters. And finally, there are decent music locations. <br /> <br /> 2:37 somehow it stings you from the beginning. It does not compromise or serve laughter. Rather it unites what psychologists would define as moments of terror. This film focuses substantially on the emotional precipices. There is no one who can not handle some kind of neurosis, even the minor parts represented (for example, teachers) seem to be in some state of disorder. And that's what prevents this movie from being really good. His summary of harrowing tragedies is not realistic for his bones. There is no: friendship, love, smile, truth, passion. There is: pretense, humiliation, despair, illness and beatings. It's like being hit in the face very hard all the time, but you're asleep after the first hour. This movie keeps hitting you, until in the end it reveals something quite instructive. <br /> <br /> For acting in a sensitive and magnificent way: 9. For being technically innovative and original: 9. For being one-dimensional: 3. <br /> <br /> Makes a solid 7 out of 10.
