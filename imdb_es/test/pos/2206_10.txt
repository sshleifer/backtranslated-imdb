First of all, I've seen this program since I was a little boy, and I've always loved it. Sure, maybe I did not understand it when I was so young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I've been able to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I've ever heard! Every note is perfect, I do not even need to listen to the song to enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Moving on to this particular production, this is great! Of course, nobody could play Mrs. Lovett besides Angela Lansbury, and she does it perfectly. And she should, she has been playing this part for several years. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. The best Sweeney Todd I've heard. He has a wonderful voice, but he can throw his voice so well! His "epiphany" is incredible, as can be seen by the reaction of the audience. The judge, Toby, Antony and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to fast forward through the green finch and Johanna's linnet bird. She just does not sing that song well. <br /> <br /> This program can be appreciated at all ages, but it is not always accepted. I'm not your typical middle-aged theater lover, I'm only 15 years old, but Sweeney Todd has given me a greater appreciation for music than any other musical.
