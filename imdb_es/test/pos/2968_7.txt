After seeing Meredith in "Beyond the Prairie" I had to buy another movie with her gaze fixed. I can not believe how he got into this teen movie. It is better to see this with the sound off, but just focus on Meredith while moving across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on "Beyond the Prairie." It's worth it at any price, it needs to pay you to see. <br /> <br /> This beautiful lady needs someone to put her in a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. Maybe some of your last ones fit, but I have not seen them. She has the smile of Cathrine Bell and the eyes of Dana Delany with a much younger body. <br /> <br />
