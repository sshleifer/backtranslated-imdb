I gave this movie a 10 simply because of my sick obsession with Ingrid Bergman :) hahaha. I really believe that she was the best actress in the history of the world with her talent and all her films are absolutely wonderful (even when they are horrible) because SHE is in them. If it had not been she and Vivien Leigh (as I had originally wished, I heard) I would have given her a 9.0 Simply because I love Viv, but probably not as much as Ingrid. And any other actress would have made it maybe a 6. It's a good story, two wild people who fall in love in a society where it's bad to be bad. It reminds me a bit of GWTW, except with a more intellectual attitude. Gary Cooper is very handsome as always and, of course, his voice never changes the whole movie, but Ingrid makes him look as amazing and intelligent and 20 times sexier than he probably should be.
