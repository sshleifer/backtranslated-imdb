This film is attractive from beginning to end, with excellent performances, a great soundtrack with original music by Douglas Brown and a script of good rhythm full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Full of new faces and not so new ones. The film presents a promising talent, especially in the case of Craig Morris, who plays the main character Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also co-wrote the script, shows a calm force combined with strong emotional performance while creating a credible character on the screen. Also a moving rendition of Paul Vario who plays Uncle Benny with genuine warmth was so convincing that I became hungry while lovingly preparing his Italian sauce. <br /> <br /> Big new faces, good new music and a great new story, what more could you want? This movie is highly recommended!
