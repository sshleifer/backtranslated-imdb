I absolutely loved this movie! It's my number one favorite. Although there were some shortcomings (which film has no flaws?), This film was very well written, directed and produced. The characters in this movie are very real and credible. They made all the characters fit into a specific role. I think the most apparent of "Here On Earth" was the love triangle, as well as the other emotional situations introduced in the film. It is not one of those movies in which you do not seem to relate to anything, because in this there are situations in which everyone is or has been. There are so many different things in this movie that it's hard not to relate to. that. I am only 18 years old and I can even relate to that. It was encouraging and heartbreaking at the same time. "Here On Earth" will make you laugh, cry and sometimes get angry. I give this movie an excellent review and I recommend it to everyone who loves romance and passion.
