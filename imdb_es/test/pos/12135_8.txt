So you think you've seen all the mafia movies ever made! Here is one that nobody has heard. It is a low-budget B-movie, shot in the marshes of Jersey. For us, fans of mafia movies, had a bit of everything: sex, violence, curse and wise who acted as "glasses." While violence dominated the movie, I laughed at some familiar scenes I've seen in The Sopranos and Goodfellas. Look for a 1977 version of "Badabing Girls" at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> All of our favorite mobster stereotypes were presented here. And, as for realism, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was excellent, representing the classic character of wise as we have seen him so many times over the years. This was probably his first shot, and it was a gem. Pesci fans should run to the video store to watch this movie. You have to look carefully because it has different names. My copy called it "The Family Enforcer." Here he is known as "The collector of death". But whatever its name, it should be called: A winner.
