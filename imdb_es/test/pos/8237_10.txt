It is well known that Irene Dunne could sing more than a little. And I think that his talent as a comedian can only really be understood once one has struggled with a Haydn sonata or a Debussy song and has made it a success. His instrument is his voice and his handling is pure musical mastery. She could address anywhere. The only thing he could not do was not succeed. This movie is a perfect example. In it, channel Ruth Gordon (because the work is the thing), is feminine, charming, voluntary and modest, generous, protective and combative, but never pretentious. She manages to remain as credible as Alexander Knox in another difficult role that he assumes with aplomb. The spectator comes to believe in what he is seeing and to take care of him. It's comforting to see a movie that is entertaining and intellectually challenging while pressing all the right patriotic buttons. Honestly, I hope that Dunne's entire work reaches DVD sometime because it's really hard to keep a secret like that among a few initiates.
