My father, the hero, used to be my favorite movie when I was younger. This is Andre, a divorced Frenchman who wants to take his beautiful daughter (Katharine Heigl) on vacation, hoping to get a little closer to her. But, of course, Nicole is not so easy to deal with, she just started. Puberty, I suppose. She is angry and hurt because her father was never there for her and decides to give her a hard time. One day on the beach, Nicole meets handsome Ben, and she makes a wild story about her and her father. The whole island gets involved and the film becomes a fun and entertaining entertaining movie. I would give my father the hero 8/10
