The first murder scene is one of the best murders in the history of cinema (almost as good as the rain scene in Psycho) and the performance of Robert Walker is fantastic. A psychopath involved with a tennis star in the exchange of murders. That's the story and in general This movie is very good, but there's a problem: why are not both Guy Haines to go to the police in the first place? 4/5 <br /> <br />
