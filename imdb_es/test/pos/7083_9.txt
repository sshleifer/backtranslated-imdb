I have loved One True Thing since the first time I saw him in the theater, and I cried. I bought it as soon as it was available, and I lost count of how many times I've seen it. <br /> <br /> For me One True Thing is the best movie about family relationships. I love seeing how relationships in the family change and evolve towards what they end up being. I can relate to many details in the movie. My mother died of bone cancer, so she really hits me at home. Maybe that's why I love it so much. <br /> <br /> I like relationships between children and their parents, and the relationship of brother and sister, but I especially love the relationship between husband and wife. For me it is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movement to anyone who enjoys this type of film.
