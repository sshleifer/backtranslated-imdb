<br /> <br /> This is the best simulated documentary of a dog show I've seen in a long time. A long time. Well, let's be honest, never. Is not that part of the charm? The idea of ​​actually taking the trouble to make a movie by mocking a documentary about an event that would seem strange to most people in the first place. Even if there were no big laughs, one would still be smiling with the idea. Any movie that tries something new has a high score in my proverbial book. I loved dogs too!
