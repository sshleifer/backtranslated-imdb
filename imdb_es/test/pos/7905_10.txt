The commentator before me declared that this movie is the worst thing that was imposed on him as a child. I have to say that I loved this movie when I was little and I still love it today. The film has the best theme to run from the union of the whole family. Considering the period of time in which the film was released, I thought that the film acted well. I wish I could find a copy somewhere! Of all the films of the 1980s that I saw as a child, this was one of my favorites. I know I probably saw him at least once a week with my brother and my mother. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who knows, or does not know. So if you find a copy, I suggest you see it! It is wonderful and comforting.
