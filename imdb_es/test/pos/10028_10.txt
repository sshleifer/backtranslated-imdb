After working on 7 films with director Mickael Curtiz (The adventures of Robin Hood are his best achievement), Errol Flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This meeting is a happy thing for cinematography. THE DIED WITH THE THE BOOTS ON is his first and best film together. Raoul Walsh plays General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debut in West Point, until the Civil War and finally in the battle of Little Big Horn. It is true that the film shows a too heroic portrait of Custer, but that is not important. The important thing is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory that the characters carry. Who can forget California Joe, the great "Queen's Own Buttler" with his song "Garryowen", the touching Mrs Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the diabolical Sharp well played by Arthur Kennedy? <br /> <br /> An eternal blow Follow this epic and tragic straw.
