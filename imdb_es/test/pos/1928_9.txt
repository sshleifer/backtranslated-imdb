I came across this by chance. I was at my friends' house and he had just begun to see it, so I sat thinking that we would shoot the breeze while this played in the background. However, in a few seconds I immersed myself in this docu-drama, and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and without saying a word. <br /> <br /> I never knew the history of the first solo of the world yacht race, much less the tragic events of a man's attempt against all odds, which was meant to be his redemption for all his misfortunes. Life, but ultimately, ends up becoming an example of them. Not knowing the story, I observed this with the same fervor I imagined those who were reading about the race at the time it was really happening, involved in what was happening and eager to get more information, hoping that the amateur I was going to achieve solitary and beat the professionals, which makes the shocking turns of history even more tragic, I felt that I was living the story. <br /> <br /> The story is told with great care, and the interviewees clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy, which gives a great idea, but it is also contrasted with the archive material of the interviews in the At the time of the tragedy, the recordings and photographs of the lonely sailors are also used excellently, and the information on the minds of the sailors and how loneliness was affecting them was excellent. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that this story is not better known or has become a movie, but I'm also grateful. . Grateful that we have this documentary drama to tell the story of those who knew the man, instead of a bland film adaptation, and grateful to have captured this jewel of a movie by pure chance. <br /> <br /> It's a must-see, whether you like documentaries or not.
