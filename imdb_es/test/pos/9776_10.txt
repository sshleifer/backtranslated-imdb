As soon as I saw the "Changi" ad on the History Channel, I knew I would love it. Fantastically captured the spirit of ANZAC: you would die if you did not have companions around you. The characters of "Changi" were strong and each one contributed something different to the story, and the Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but they were described as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, just like the Australians did. The direction, the script, the acting and the stage were marvelously done, with a clear and easy to follow plot. Humor was the key to the survival of the soldiers, and it was great to see that a miniseries about the war really had some kind of humor, which is usually hard to do without offending people. From what I have read about soldiers in the Changi PoW camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years that Australian, British, New Zealand, American and Dutch men spent there. I would recommend this series to anyone, whether they are interested in the war or not. 10/10.
