This was a very good soft core film for both men and women. A lot of nudity / sex, but without the general feeling you usually find. They could not have done a better job in the casting, since the whole set was impressive. Trust me, guys, if you want your woman to be in the mood, do something with Bobby Johnston! And I'm sure the lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual man. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if they are aware of a movie in which they do it, please PM! I would love to know. The photography was much better than usual. That was the story. Predictable, but pleasant, sweet and romantic character. At the very least, it was not one of those annoying mysteries of predictable murders filled with blonde women with huge fake breasts. I give you this 7/10!
