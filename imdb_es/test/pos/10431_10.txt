Eric Bogosian's ability to shoot from character to character in this 'one-man show' shows his true rank as a character actor. Each person has its own message to transmit the truth, society, class, drugs, etc. This is an absolute must for anyone who is a fan of acting! His performance contains some of the most fun and real moments that I have experienced as a spectator.
