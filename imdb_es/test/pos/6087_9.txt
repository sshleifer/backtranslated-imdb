The "English patient" can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose epics as extensive as "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Bridge over the River Kwai" must have inspired director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and like "Lawrence", it takes place in North Africa, but during World War II. The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an expert and often difficult archaeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Count Laszlo de Almasy de Fiennes - the titular character. The fact that his name does not sound like it is English plays a key role in what develops. He was badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the movie begins, and Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche, takes care of him in Europe. What makes this story epic is the vast journey through place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two unfortunate lovers. The film makes it clear that true love and passion, even with terrible consequences, can make life worthwhile or worth dying for. If you are a romantic at heart, and you can appreciate a movie without the standard happy endings and the simple moral codes, you can find that 'The English Patient' speaks directly to you. <br /> <br />
