This is definitely a musical highlight of 1944 with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth, (Rusty Parker), "Charlie Chan in Egypt", sang and danced with Gene Kelly, (Danny McGuire), "Anchors Away", Danny McGuire owned a nightclub in Brooklyn, New York and was in love with Rusty Parker, who was a dancer in his club along with Phil Silvers, (Genius), "Coney Island", who was the comedian in this photo and also worked and danced along with Danny, Rusty. Otto Kruger, (John Coudair), "Duel in the Sun" played the role of promoter of a cover magazine and decided that Rusty Parker was going to be his best model. The music of Jerome Kern is heard throughout the image and the song "Long Ago & Far Away" is the musical theme of this musical. This film was nominated for many awards and was a huge success at the box office during World War II, which kept people from thinking about the war that was occurring at the time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant successes and their career exploded on the silver screen for many years. Great musical and a movie you do not want to miss, this is truly a great classic movie. Enjoy
