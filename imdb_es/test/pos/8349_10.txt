Since I saw the trailer of the DVD of "The Little Mermaid II: Return to the sea", I had the feeling that this movie is going to be great because I am a big fan of Disney. And guess what? I'm right! This film is a very valuable successor to the original classic "The Lady and the Tramp". <br /> <br /> It tells the story of Scamp, the lady of Tramp's evil son, Scamp, who wants to be wild and free instead of living. a housedog life Although the movie may not be as good as the first, it has a great moral that you could not find anywhere else until you see it. <br /> <br /> I admit that the film is not for everyone, but those of you who hate it, all I can say is that you do not have a spirit for this and I suggest you do not go to see it again. But hey! It's really an amazing story, replete with brilliant animations, music and star-studded voices with Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Alyssa Milano (Charmed). So if you have not seen the movie, why be there? Go and get the copy !!!
