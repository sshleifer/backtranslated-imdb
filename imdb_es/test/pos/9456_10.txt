When I saw the first preview of this, I almost fainted with emotion. I have been a fan of Twelfth Night for a long time, I became Shakespeare, so having a modern adaptation is a dream come true. My anticipation was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot basically follows the original plot and that means: complicated! I do not even want to try to relate it, the summer plot will probably cover the basics. Imagine that a girl pretends to be a boy in a boarding school and thinks of all the possible situations they could create. I will not even stop to question the plausibility of such a plot; Reality is NOT the point of the movie. <br /> <br /> What IS, however, is absolutely hilarious. Almost all the scenes nail the comic configuration. Congratulations to the writers, directors and actors in that regard. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star of this film and carries it beautifully. She is super cute, she is not a bitch and she can do impeccable comedy. I admire her so much for not going in a hurry in her movies or in public life as so many stars do nowadays. I'm glad there's at least one decent young actress in Hollywood. Ok, I'm not in my soap box anymore ... <br /> <br /> Channing Tatum, yes, it's sexy and it's made like a flippin gorilla, but it really makes me laugh! My favorite scenes in the whole movie are when he tries to talk to Olivia first talking about cheese and then about her training regimen. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast did not fail either, with wonderful additions to the characters in the form of the incompetent debutante mother and Monique, the classic evil bride. <br /> <br /> In general, lots of fun, laughs and a very attractive cast. Maybe not on par with the original, but it surpasses the modern versions of other works, including the 10 things that I promote much more than I promote.
