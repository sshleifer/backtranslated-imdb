"The Egyptian" is established during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world, Pharaoh Akhnaton, who, thirteen centuries before Christ tried to introduce a monotheistic religion, the Atenism, in ancient Egypt. The main character, however, is not Akhnaton, but the fictional Sinuhe. As a baby, Sinuhe finds himself mysteriously floating in a basket on the Nile River and adopted by the doctor Senmut and his wife. As he grows into adulthood, he follows his adoptive father into the medical profession, initially working (as his father did) among the poor of the city, but becomes important after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier Horemheb, They save Pharaoh's life on a desert hunting expedition. Sinuhe is appointed doctor of the Court, but obsesses with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer. Sinuhe not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win his love, but also dishonors when his neglect of his duties means he can not save the life of Akhnaton's daughter. <br /> <br /> Sinuhe flees into exile, where he succeeds as a healer in neighboring countries, but returns to Egypt when he learns of a Hittite plot to invade. Although Akhnaton easily forgives him for his previous offenses, Sinuhe finds the country in a state of turmoil. Pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil strife between his followers and priests of the old polytheistic faith, and he is too peaceful by nature to take action to deal with the Hittite threat. Sinuhe is involved in a plot by Horemheb, now the Egyptian army general, and Princess Baketamon of Akhnaton to overthrow Pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses of the film come mainly from its Two romantic subplots. In the course of the film, Sinuhe is revealed as the lost son of the previous pharaoh and half brother of Akhnaton and Baketamon. Therefore, it could surprise a modern audience that she should fall in love with him; Marriage between brothers and sisters was not necessarily considered incestuous by the standards of Egyptian royalty, but the standards of the film audiences of the 1950s were generally less liberal at this point. In any case, the love triangle of Horemheb-Baketamon-Sinuhe is an unnecessary complication and detracts from the role of Baketamon in the film, that of the voice of the cynical, cold-eyed Realpolitik. <br /> <br /> The subplot Nefer, which takes up most of the first hour of the movie, is overwritten and overly melodramatic. Nefer is morally useless but fascinating, and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also a great dramatic ability to make it credible, especially when Nefer achieves the difficult task of winning Sinuhe away from a woman as beautiful as Jean Simmons (who plays Merit, Sinuhe's rival for his affections). Therefore, it is unfortunate that the role was for an actress as comically inept as Bella Darvi, whose only qualification was that she was the producer's lover, Darryl F. Zanuck. Darvi was not only a wooden actress, but also spoke with a foreign accent, made even more incomprehensible by a whisper. It was not even particularly attractive compared to the two legendary beauties of Hollywood in the film, Simmons and Gene Tierney, who plays Baketamon. <br /> <br /> The film is best when it focuses on its main political and religious themes. The other actors are better than Darvi, although Peter Ustinov, like the servant of Sinuhe, Kaptah, makes the same mistake as in "Spartacus", that of trying to provide comic relief to a film that does not need it. His voice, however, was too patriotic for a "comic servant" role. <br /> <br /> Edmund Purdom, a little known British actor, was pushed into the lead role when Marlon Brando retired at the last minute. , but more than adequately fills the shoes of the great man, even though his acting style was quite different. He faces the challenge of showing the changes in the character of Sinuhe, from the non-mundane idealist to the fool in love and the bitter cynic to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes. Victor Mature was never the most expressive of actors, but he is well prepared for the role of Horemheb, a man of practical and realistic action. He is better here than he was in his other epic of 1954, "Demetrius and the Gladiators." Simmons is luminous and beautiful like Merit. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding (until now better known to me as the second Mr. Elizabeth Taylor) plays Akhnaton as a possible philosopher-king who ends up as a kind of stupid saint. His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an inadequate ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice that gives him an air of moral grandeur far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. Although Aten had more in common with the Supreme Being of the Deists than with the Jehovah of the Old Testament or the Christian Trinitarian God, there is a deliberate attempt to draw parallels between Atenism and Christianity. In the film, the Atenista symbol is the "ankh", no doubt chosen for its resemblance to a cross, but in reality it was a common Egyptian hieroglyph for life, not exclusive of Atenism. Akhnaton's language often has a biblical tone; His comparison of himself with the "whistling of the wind in the desert" recalls the "voice of weeping in the desert" by Juan el Bautista (hence the title of this review). Sinuhe's discovery in the river parallels the story of Moses in the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Sinuhe, who has become the heir of the dead Akhnaton spirit, achieves his own moral greatness. The message of the film is that while we may need practical action men like Horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers who are prepared to ask the question "why?" Despite all its faults, "The Egyptian" is a film that is idealistic and humane in its approach to both religion and politics. 7/10
