I really liked that movie; It was a great representation of a family that had many ups and downs, but in the end they knew that they had a special love for each other. I have seen many films starring Jaclyn Smith, but my God, this was one of the best, although it came out 12 years ago. This movie contained a cast of stars, and what I loved most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors I had not seen before. This movie was a bit long, but I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a movie that you can sit with your family and watch, although we would have to cover the children's eyes several times due to discretionary love scenes. In general, I rate this movie with a 10 on a scale of 1-10. Lifetime does not transmit it enough, so if anyone knows which store sells it, let me know because it is an obligation.
