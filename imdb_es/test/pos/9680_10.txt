I myself am Russian, sometimes I find it difficult to get the reference jokes about personalities or celebrities of American television. Apart from that, Family Guy is the most intelligent, funny and politically incorrect program seen on earth. The voice acting is excellent and sounds clear enough even for a speaker who is not English, like me, to understand. The animations are also good, maybe even too good for a TV show. Here we have the equivalent to the Adult Swimming Channel, but nothing compared to this gem. Not even Simpsons or South Park. I hope the creators keep entertaining and having fun. I do not want to see everything spiraling towards mediocre entertainment.
