There is so much I can take from Filipino movies, especially nowadays, where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy (which I hate). The fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me speechless during the movie was a great advantage. It has good cinematographic scenes and the editing was great, especially the cinematography. I think Claudine deserves the best actress here instead of getting one in the Milan movie. the fact that there are so few Filipino films that I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did a great job in this movie. I truly loved this film, technically and in terms of character development; The plot was complex and that's what made it great.
