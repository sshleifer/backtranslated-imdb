I really liked the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour, until the animal cruelty of civilized humans in Scotland affected me in the second half and it saddened me so much that I could not see it. However, the filmmaker did this to point out that the first natural scientists ruined everything they did not understand by "studying" it literally until death without taking into account the rights and comfort of the animals studied, which we now know should not be studied. anywhere other than in the natural world in which they live, and as discreetly as possible. I recommend this film, since it was a mostly serious and honest story of Tarzan, and made a point of showing the animal cruelty that reigned in the scientific world of the nineteenth century, as well as the pure and simple life, beautifully primitive that Tarzan lived as a A young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimpanzees after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very touching in his life as Tarzan, as was Ralph Richardson. in his last role in the film as the ultra rich Tarzan, which reeks of the nobility in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was pretty and quite good as Tarzan's harassed and civilized "Jane" in his first role in the film. For his charismatic work in this film and his very disturbing eyes, I can not understand why Lambert did not become a big star later, but his really bad movie choices may have done it. The terrible Ian Holm, like a wounded Frenchman in Africa Tarzan, who helped Tarzan and then accompanied him to his ancestral home in Scotland, hitherto unknown. It was great as always. <br /> <br /> I am very happy that Tarzan has grown tired of not being as cruel as a civilized animal world at the time and in the end he went home to Africa to live his life with his nice and affectionate "relatives" "They raised him instead of staying in Scotland and living like royalty, which would have ruined him if it was not like that. kill it first
