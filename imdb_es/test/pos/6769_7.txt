Send them to the freezer. This is the solution found by two butchers after discovering the popularity of selling human flesh. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror movie. The complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile, if you can take it. Definitely a dark film but also a little redeeming.
