This film was surpassed by 'The Jackal' (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), which was released the same year. Having seen both movies, I can honestly say that this is the top movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the production value of 'The Jackal' was very good, probably had a substantially higher budget. However, 'The Assignment' is well written and has a fascinating story. Aiden Quinn is impeccable in dual roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay did a great job in establishing a deep and multi-layered relationship between the title character and his family. I especially liked the ending. <br /> <br /> I remembered the character of Jack Ryan in Tom Clancy movies. Both are naval officers who find themselves in incredibly dangerous roles while working covertly in the name of national security. And yet, both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their respective characters as heroes who manage to be virile and gentle. They have a genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. <br /> <br /> What I do not understand is how the opinions of everyone who published in this movie (including myself) can be much more positive than the warm reception the film has received. This is a film that has enough complexity and subtlety that it remains convincing after several presentations. If you are a spy movie fan, I recommend 'The Assignment' with enthusiasm.
