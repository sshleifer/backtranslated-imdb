... David Bovie sings in this movie. BUT IT IS !!! It's all about America, so do not be ashamed to see it. Just think, if you can, to avoid further damage ... You know, you're the same common guy next door, so be careful! One of the best criticisms of the "common" mind and friendship. Do not you still care? Go for the music: it's worth a try, just close your eyes and Pat Metheny and David Bowie will touch you so deeply that you'll start screaming! And while you watch, if you dare to open your eyes, please do not do the popcorn and those things, you're going to lose a lot. You may think it's not worth it, but, think twice, and do not look at your neighbors' turf, you never know what to find there ... Is it worth it? Try it! But do not die or boast about it ...
