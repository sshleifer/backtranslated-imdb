There are only a handful of movies that were made on such a large scale and that made a big difference in the art of making movies. <br /> <br /> "Bronenosets Potyomkin" is one of these films, and should be on the list of anyone who wants to learn more about the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Grigori Aleksandrov and Sergei M. Eisenstein directed this innovative film that documents the horrors that occur in a Russian battleship. When the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors, the locals embrace and support them. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers is sent to the small town to do business. What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Anyone who has seen "The Untouchables" and "Bronenosets Potyomkin" knows exactly what I mean. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that this film raised the level for film making as well as "Intolerance" some years before. If you do not mind silent movies, do yourself a favor and see "Bronenosets Potyomkin". <br /> <br /> If you do not like silent movies ... look at "Bronenosets Potyomkin" anyway. <br /> <br />
