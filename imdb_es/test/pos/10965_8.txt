1º seen 8/26/2001 - 8 de 10 (Dir-John Cassavetes): The good independent cinema of Cassavetes presented a style very different from the one that Hollywood shows its audience. This film also presented some very taboo subjects, especially the real racism that probably prevailed throughout the country, but it was not exhibited by the mostly white filmmakers of the time. About the only black actors who had much respect at this time were the ones who acted and showed personality as the whites (also known as Sidney Poitier). Besides this, the idea of ​​finishing a movie without really ending the relationships that started leaves many spectators stunned, but in reality it makes viewers realize that life is like that (continues ...). I prefer this kind of ending because it makes you think more about the characters and what may happen next, and the conclusions are not only presented to you. The film follows the lives of people (in particular, a couple of people who have a brief relationship and who have opposite skin colors) and then observe what happens when the white man realizes what he has done. This is done very well and makes the film very special. The performance is supposedly done in an improvised manner, which makes the film even more surprising. I guess you can say that I like this movie, if you can not say it. If you can find it, check out this classic from the first independent movie.
