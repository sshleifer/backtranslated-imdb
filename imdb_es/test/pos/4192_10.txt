Forget about Easy Rider: the head is THE movie about the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Almost laughter: while the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one minute television commercial about dandruff! Look: the 50-foot Victor Mature tries to figure out what the hell he's doing in this movie. Listen: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on a leash) tell Davey Jones "Your music is terribly white"! Experience: the only live performance of the Monkees as a real rock band plays the first real punk-rock song (Circle Sky) honestly. Listen: while Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transgender father! Confused: being very confused, as confused as Terri Garr is when Mickey Dolenz makes sexual innuendos about her in her film debut. Witness: useless protests against the Vietnam War jump out of nowhere and disappear quickly! Note: Mike Nesmith spat at Christmas while wearing a smoker-style Victorian jacket in a gothic spider web horror scene! Let yourself go: towards the karmic happiness inspired by a comic version of Indian mysticism, transmitted by a black and white character character with a black face, while Peter Tork pretends he knows how to play the guitar! Discover: the first feature film by award-winning Academy Award-winning director Bob Rafelson, written by Academy Award-winning actor Jack Nicholson. Imagine it's not happening: when the Monkees commit group suicide by jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge! Take drugs - take many drugs: take as many drugs as the cast and crew evidently did when making this movie! <br /> <br /> With Head, the Monkees revealed themselves as the most angry and evil artists in Hollywood history. without exception. It is disconcerting to discover that they blamed the failure of this film on a bad promotion. Without a doubt, the promotion was practically non-existent; But they did not recognize how angry, how depressing, how self-destructive is this movie ?! I mean, this movie is a trip - in bad acid - to the suicide room of a psychiatric hospital. The only movie that I know is so depressing is Terry Gilliam's Brazil; and, like Brazil, this film reveals why life in the late twentieth century was almost unbearable, if you were lucky. It is not simply that Western culture suffered a serious overload of information, but that the information itself was bad, bad, worse and more grim. In fact, it was the overload effect that kept people going, as this allowed people to get distracted by one crisis or another: if the news from Vietnam was too hard to bear, they could change the channel and see a documentary about the ascent. unemployment rate. <br /> <br /> The "positive" response to the reality revealed in Head was Woodstock: three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and insects and bad food and dirty drink and poop and urine and acid. and Peter Townsend almost killing Abbie Hoffman. It all happened behind a steel fence, under the watchful eyes of a true army of NY State Troopers, which means that the "freedom" of Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song that John Sebastion thought he was singing while he was so tense I could barely speak. "500,000 imbeciles too stupid to get out of the rain" was the judgment of a critic about Woodstock (I think it was Andy Warhol). <br /> <br /> The only good thing that happened there was the Star Spangled Banner by Jimi Hendrix. Two years earlier, Jimi Hendrix Experience had made its first national tour of America, as the opening of the band preparing for the Monkees. <br /> <br /> Look, everything is connected in some way. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself, no, you owe it to your unborn children, to see the real 1960s, only to find it in Film in this strange, miraculous and absolutely absurd tribute to a of the most interesting capitalist scams of the late twentieth century.
