Located in the hometown of Bam Margera, Westchester PA, 'Haggard' is a semi-true story about the life of Ryan Dunn and his friends Falcone and Vallo. <br /> <br /> Dunn has been abandoned by his 2-year-old girlfriend, Glauren, who is now seeing a beer brewer, a long-haired metal head called 'Hellboy' and this is driving Dunn crazy jealousy. <br /> <br /> In a desperate attempt to uncover the truth about what is happening Glauren and Hellboy, Dunn pays his friends Vallo and Falcone to break into his house and present evidence of the matter, with somewhat disastrous results for all involved! I found this movie very funny, maybe partly because I'm a fan of Jackass and CKY, and it must be said that much of the humor will probably be lost in those who have no previous knowledge of Margera's comedy. ' <br /> <br /> The film contains much of what will be of interest to the skaters, especially the appearance of skateboarding legend Tony Hawk as a police officer. There are also cameos from Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Jason Ellis and the long-suffering parents of Bam, April and Phil. <br /> <br /> The extra DVD includes music videos from CKY (with Bam Jess's brother on drums), and Bam's favorite band, HIM (Bam's character in the film takes its name from the leader of Ville Ville Vallo) There is also a documentary and a sketch of "too hot for imbeciles". <br /> <br /> In summary, as I said before This film will be mainly of interest to the skaters and Jackass / CKY fans, but I think that Margera and her colleagues have made a great effort with 'Haggard' and me, I enjoyed it very much.
