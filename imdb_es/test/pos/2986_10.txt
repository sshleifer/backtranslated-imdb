An extraordinary film that brought to the surface all kinds of feelings I had when I was much younger. I loved it, and the music of Elton John. I remember seeing at the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never met anyone else who saw this movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> The dreams that inspired In me, for decades, I never abandoned myself, and seeing the film again recently, everything returned to speed, I confess, however, that my children (20 years old) They have not experienced a similar emotional emotion. A generational thing? <br /> <br /> Why is it not on DVD?
