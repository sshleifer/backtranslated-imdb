This is the first American movie I've seen this year and I think it will be the best for the feeling. As a teenage singer in the United States, Aaron is not as popular as he used to be, most of the Americans I met said his song is fake and he did not even know how to rap. But attention, everyone, are children, how many people can understand it. Being a pop fan is difficult, and being a pop star is more difficult. I think this time Aaron (JD) shows us something real. And I think that people should learn to understand each other. On the other hand, I really like the music in the movie. I remember that the first song that appeared in the movie is "Saturday Night" and also includes some real live show by Aaron, and the second one is "One Better", so think that if you like this movie, maybe you're also a fan of pop. Finally, I hope you have a great time ^^ A voice of a Chinese child.
