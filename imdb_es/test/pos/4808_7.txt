Running Out of Time is somewhere in the middle of Johnny To's cannon, in the "good" category. As a crime thriller is not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not leave you speechless, but it has something else going for it. It's a Johnny To movie, after all, he has to do it. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau has 72 hours to live. He decides to play a strange game of cat and mouse with a hostage negotiator from the Hong Kong police, played by Lau Ching Wan. That is the plot in a few words. In addition to that, it accumulates layers of twists and turns that keep procedures interesting at all times. From time to time it becomes too complicated by itself, but it never allows it to get the best of itself. However, just when Johnny To is about to deliver a crime movie and well made crime (which, let's face it, it's ten cents), slips into bits and pieces that bring Running Out of Time to life as a complete emotional experience, providing the soul and the heart to the well oiled skeleton. <br /> <br /> The concepts of synchronism and minimalism (staples in your work) are explored with great effect here. Always subtle, letting the images speak for themselves, giving them time to develop with long shots and slow tracking shots, exemplary cut to the score, everything is here. A little love story on a bus between Andy Lau and a girl is one of the highlights of the film and part of the "heart" I'm talking about. So simple but so powerful. The same happens with the scenes of the cars of Lau's and Lau Ching Wan and the confrontation in the bowling hall. <br /> <br /> However, something prevents me from stating that Running Out of Time is a masterpiece. To have all the skill and dexterity to a higher level, but it can also be too hard or insipid at times. When it's good, it's really good. There are even isolated moments of pure brilliance that are TOO MUCH for their own good, leaving a bittersweet bitter taste for the rest of the movie. I am convinced that if you put all your effort into that, you can make a great movie. As it is, this is another of his films that is flawed but nice. Under the elegant style of HK, it is black humor and sincere drama that makes this a compelling film. It's worth seeing, definitely.
