This is a nice movie. It is very realistic for the "wonderful world of music". I've been there and I've done it. It shows a human element in each character and the realism that nobody is perfect. These amateur musicians were not such bad players. The character of Cleavon Little, Marshall Tucker, played very well. Marshall was not a saint. Here he was being paid for doing a job and he's giving these guys a hard time for everything in the van on the way. You do not bite the hands that feed you. I find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience that he has, claims that he does not know any of the dixieland tunes. He has a tremendous sense of predicting chord changes to melodies he does not know. It is not common, but neither is it unheard of. He delivers a real and hard message at the end of the film when he says to the clarinet: "It's not a religion, devotion is not enough". At that level, he's right, although I think the clarinet could have handled the work. I was practicing to the fullest and vocal accompaniment music is not that hard to read. Very nice movie
