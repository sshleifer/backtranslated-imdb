I can not say that this was not done well. At a recent film festival the director admitted that some scenes took 30 shots. And there is no indication that he did not get exactly what he wanted. But this is a strangely non-Hispanic movie in the same way that West Side Story was many years ago. Both leaders, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The environment, a kind of underground auto repair district in Queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of entry alone. But there is something unsatisfactory about the film's key theme, namely, what the sister feels she has to do to survive. I can understand the brother's reaction, but it seems to me too easy. The film seems to suggest that people like these do not need our help, that they will find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I would not encourage anyone to believe that. There would be much more resistance to the choices made here than represented. Apart from that as an entertainment works well. As an accurate description of a culture, not so well, I think.
