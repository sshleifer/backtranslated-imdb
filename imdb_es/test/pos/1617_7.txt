In defense of this film I must repeat what I had said previously. The film is called Arachina, it has no cast and I do not mean any name, as it happens in the actors who play films of unseen artistic films. I want to say that no name like in your local high school decided to make a movie without a name and could have a budget of 2 dollars. So, what do you expect? Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was never taken seriously, which automatically removes it from the list of the worst movies. That list is only for big-star and big-budget movies that are taken too seriously. The movie The Oscar comes to mind, most of Sylvester Stallone's films. The two tracks were not Hepburn and Tracy, but they did their job well enough for this movie. The woman kicked hard and the boy was not a stupid idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man who played the retentive anal teacher was not Clifton Webb, but he did a great job. And the Bimbos, for lack of a better one, were played by two competent actors. I laughed at the special effects of 50 cents. But that was part of the charm of the movie. He played like a hybrid. The tremors and the night of the living dead. The premise of the film is like all the Giant Bug movies of the 50s. A meteorite or radiation shakes the ecosystem and, before you know it, we have giant ants, lobsters, rocks or lizards that terrorize the locals. A meteor was the cause of the problems this time. I was very entertained. I did not expect much and I go much more than I expected.
