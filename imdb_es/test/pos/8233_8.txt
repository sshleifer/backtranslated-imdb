This is a very solid Western Randolph Scott. He plays Bat Masterson and goes to Liberal, Kansas to clean up the city. He becomes a good friend of Robert Ryan, who played a very important role in the role of man. It was not until after this that Robert Ryan began to play much darker roles. In fact, in 1947, Randolph Scott made another film that was not a western and never did anything other than Westerns until he retired in 1962. This movie has a good pace and increases to the climax constantly. I can not say anything else, since I would give away the plot. Be sure to see this one. 8/10
