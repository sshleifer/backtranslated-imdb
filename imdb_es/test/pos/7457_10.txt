Duckman was a program that used to be on for the last hour, more or less, before it was time to sleep, about ten years ago. It was a contrast to many of the childhood-type animations I was seeing at that moment; He was still addicted to the lesser things of Disney and Looney Tunes, and most of the Saturday morning cartoons were still on the way out of the peak since the days of the Ninja and Batman Turtles. But also at this time I began to recognize that the satirical cartoon shows more aggressive, mature, surreal, obscene and (although I did not know the term at that time) were more creative than the things to which I was accustomed. Around the time of Beavis and Butt-head, Ren and Stimpy, and even The Maxx hit televisions through MTV, USA. UU He took out two programs, one of them was Weird Science and the other was Duckman. I have always remembered some key fragments of the program, and some of the lines are very easy to quote for those who have not completely forgotten about it. Luckily, I found a tape recently with about six episodes that I recorded a long time ago, and the jokes were kept fresh. And the delivery of the jokes are quick in the best episodes. <br /> <br /> In the voice department, the talent options are first class for the story lines, which are generally just an excuse for the raw and fascinating parodies of pop culture, politics, movies and television shows, music. , detective mysteries, and the dysfunctional family unit. Jason Alexander is an excellent choice for Duckman, and his performance is a comic 180 of his days in Seinfeld (even if there might be some similar features here and there). In addition, the voices of Gregg Berger as the unmistakably monotoned and deadpan Cornfed, Dweezil Zappa as the hilariously inept Ajax, and Nancy Travis as the despicable and odious Sister-in-law Bernice, contribute in a total amount. Along with great writing, even when a joke is not certain, the ingenuity behind it compensates, the style of animation, although it is far from some of today's refurbished and improved computer products, is inventive and, often, abstract. It has the sandy, homemade quality that Beavis and Butt-head or South Park would later have. And, like those programs, if you're a small child, I want to say little as in the youngest ones when you watched the program, you may not understand most of the jokes (that is, there are enough references of stripper and VD to fill two programs sometimes). But it is inventive to capture it if it comes out on television late at night and works quite well in that time interval. Only one set of DVDs can be expected. <br /> <br /> So, for anyone who has hardly or never heard of this program, here is a general note: think of this program as if Dashiell Hammett had met Walt Disney and decided to go to the neighborhoods Poor Las Vegas with a free mini-bar and do a collaboration in the line of Luis Bunuel and The Simpsons combined. Not to mention that he is from the group that Rugrats did. (Strong) A
