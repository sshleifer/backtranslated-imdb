The movie is excellent Acting, cinematography, direction and music are fascinating. It seems to me that the reason why so many give the film a low score is due to the devotion they have for the original version of 1937 starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for a good reason! - It engendered an incredible level of commitment. When talking to people who saw the original when it came out, I think the impact was something like the first "Starwars" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and it is wonderful. But that does not mean that this version is not worthy either. The 1973 version catches you from the first scene. The noise and tumult are fantastic, especially because of the way they prepare you for the peace of Shangri La. And the music of Burt Bacharach is beautiful. So - by all means enjoy the 1937 version. But do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the King Kong of 1935 destroy Peter Jackson this year.
