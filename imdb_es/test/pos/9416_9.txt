This film takes the voice of terror and makes it better. Holmes is protecting an inventor in Switzerland and is in the way of Professor Moriarity, who has become a Nazi. This is a better version of Holmes in a world of the Second World War. Rathbone does a great job with Holmes as a spy and detective. Look at this if you liked the voice of terror.
