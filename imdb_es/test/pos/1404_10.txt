He was surprised at how even the acting was in everything. William Haines had a range of acting that is wonderful for silent movies. Not on the edge. There are times when the work with the camera is excellent, and combined with the story, as when he is waiting to see the Superintendent, very well done. <br /> <br /> I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br />
