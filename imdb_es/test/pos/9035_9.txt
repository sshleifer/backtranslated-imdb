Intruder in the dust (1949) Dir: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> Excellent tale 'Southern Gothic', adapted from Faulkner's novel, about a black man, accused of the murder of a white man, who asks a young white man who has become a friend to help him prove his innocence. Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hern√°ndez) is a kind of anomaly in this small town. He is a black man who owns the land on which he lives and does not think much about the ill social order that mostly maintains peace here and in many similar small cities. Then, when he finds Lucas holding a firearm on the body of Vinson Gowrie, who was shot in the back, the young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (whom Lucas saved after Chick fell through the ice while hunted in his land) fears that the city finally has the opportunity to "make Lucas a *****". Arrested, and with a very real possibility of being lynched before the end of the night, Lucas looks for Chick in search of help, since the only person he knows is "not full of notions". Chick asks his uncle John, a lawyer, to defend Lucas, and while the man initially resented his own notions, he accepts and they compete against the mafia gathered to save Lucas's life. <br /> <br /> The film has a Frankness uncommon for its time and is largely free of moralization. The lawyer character has a tendency to speak of an incredibly self-conscious dialogue that sounds mostly like something on the printed page, but has a minimal impact on the tone. That is a credit to the rich characterization of all the others. Juano Hernandez, who had appeared mainly in the Oscar Micheaux films, is excellent as the proud Lucas. Porter Hall as the father of the murdered man, in perhaps the best role in which I have seen him, and Elizabeth Patterson as a brave old woman who sympathizes with Lucas's case, highlighted in supporting roles. The adjustment is perfectly made. Actually, it was filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. Brown also uses the crowd in an effective way, it is always an anonymous mafia against a single person (like Lucas when he is arrested or John when he goes to his office), that is very threatening. Or the grotesque of the whole city gathered in prison to witness the lynching as if it were a parade. It is to highlight an absolutely fascinating scene when Chick and his friend Aleck go to the evidence in a cemetery. Robert Surtees (THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, THIRTY SECONDS ON TOKYO, BEN-HUR) took the picture. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of 4
