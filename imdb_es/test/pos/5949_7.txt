I saw the movement while I was in Paris in May 2006 ... I was debating between that and an impossible mission ... I am very happy to have chosen OSS 117 not only because it was fun, but I could also watch a FRench film in France . I had a great time ... I would recommend it. It is important to understand today's French society to really enjoy the humor of this film ... I can not wait for the DVD to come out ... I do not know how some of the word games of 'jeu De mots' would be translated into English . I'll buy it when it comes out! PS I saw in 'BRice de Nice', which is a film starring Dujardin of which all children spoke in France. this film is a comedy but more foolish than one can imagine ... comparing both films, I must say that Dujardin did a good job on OSS 117.
