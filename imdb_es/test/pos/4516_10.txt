I know that to include everything in the book, the film should have lasted several hours, so I think they did everything possible to include things that were crucial and fundamental to the story. I think the casting was great, the children who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir when he was an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were especially moving. I thought the locations they used were interesting ... scenes set in Afghanistan were filmed in China, and a scene that took place in Fremont, California (the graduation scene) was filmed on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra in "Kite Runner" and that was the day, the day they filmed the graduation scene. We reported to Treasure Island in the morning, they checked everyone's locker room to make sure they looked like it was in the late 80's, and then we took our seats in the audience. They shot the scene over and over until they were happy with her. It was great to see the actors up close and also the author of the book, who was present as a story advisor. I thought that this book was excellent and I recommend the book and the film to anyone. This is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and eventual redemption. "There is a way to be good again."
