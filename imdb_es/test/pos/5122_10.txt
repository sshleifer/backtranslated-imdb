Logan Lerman and Dean Collins III of Jack & Bobby Fame provide a nice touch of familiarity as friends, although it may not be the closest thing to Jack & Bobby, but the expressions of the young students who take their stand for a good cause are very good expressed in this movie. Logan Lerman can apparently be cast in roles of being "different" as seen from here as seen in this, as well as in Jack and Bobby. The movie also opens with a very good melody coined as lost 45 "And I wonder where the lions are?" A song that I always heard in the speaker @ my old Job of ChristmasTreeShops and put it on my local radio show The Lost45s presented by Barry Scott, but the last time I suggested this with this movie is his dedication, but the Dedication was left out. The environmentalist show is also well expressed in this film for the protection of the ground owls as seen in this film as well. Hoot, Sogive Hoot in the Wo tradition. Odsey Owl Commercials of the 1970s too. Sincerely, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer a.k.a. "Ste".
