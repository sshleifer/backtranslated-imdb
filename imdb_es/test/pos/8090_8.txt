This was the first Charlie Chaplin movie. Yes, he had inserted a bit of sound and speaks in his previous film, MODERN TIMES, but it was still essentially a silent movie. So, it was not until 1940 that the public heard Chaplin speak in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. While I enjoyed the movie, this did not impress me as much as Chaplin's other feature films of the mid-20s and 30's. That's because I really felt annoyed at Chaplin's over-acting when he played Adenoid Hynkel, especially when he was giving his speeches The stupid pseudo dialogue seemed somewhat like a minor comedian (like the Three Stooges). Besides, playing a funny Hitler is hard for me. <br /> <br /> However, when Chaplin played with the Jewish barber, it was not especially fun (he really did not mean to be a funny character) but he was a tremendous voice for reason and decency. This film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially because it does not excel there), but for its excellent performance and humanity. The final speech of the barber (posing as Hynkel) is brilliant and almost made me cry. Watch the movie just for this reason.
