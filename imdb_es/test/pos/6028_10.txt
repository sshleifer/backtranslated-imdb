I must tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think that part definitely worked ... quite well actually. However, the movie was also very good. Some parts of this movie are really good. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a great action. The mystery is quite difficult to understand and Rose [McGowan] does something "worthy of an Oscar" acting towards the end of the movie, but I do not want to reveal anything. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also great in the movie, along with some of the other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like mysteries, action movies, or just like Rose ... I think you would like this movie.
