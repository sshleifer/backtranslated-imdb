I love this movie!! Of course I love Madonna, but who cares, it's really fun! * Rocks of ALANiS *. When I saw this movie for the first time in theaters in 1987, I thought it was very funny! Madonna is very funny and I love her doubled accent and her extravagant / funky appearance. The funniest part of all time is when Madonna (Nikki) yells at a man who is about to take a taxi. And also when Griffin Dunne (Louden) stumbles and falls at the scene of the interview in the apartment. ** ALANiS Rocks **. Madonna's character, Nikki, steals / raises tents and cheats people throughout the entire movie; his funny pranks are enough to keep you on the floor all the time. "You did not steal anything, when you rob in a store you attack the cashier, we have broken some tapes, there is a small difference" I love it !!! It's classic *** ALANiS Rocks ***. I do not know why this movie closed like it did. I do not see anything wrong with that, of course, if you're a big fan of Madonna, then whatever you do is just amazing. Anyone who wants to see fun and classic entertainment then sees "Who is that girl?" And another very important fact that, if known by all men, or at least by everything that exists, ALANiS will always "rock" you until the end! That's what Madonna does in this movie, and in its entirety! His performance is excellent!
