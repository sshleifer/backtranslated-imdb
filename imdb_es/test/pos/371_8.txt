I knew the premise of this film and, obviously, I can not stop watching a good movie, especially from the director of "Master of Suspense" Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Basically, tennis champ Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets the eccentric stranger Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train that travels from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno "suggests" exchanging murders. Obviously, Guy did not take it seriously, until Guy's wife, Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) was murdered in an amusement park. Guy, of course, is the main suspect, and Bruno keeps "stumbling on him," reminding him of his "plan" and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants killed. This murder investigation and Bruno's harassment threaten his career as a tennis player, and his relationship with the daughter of Senator Morton (north of Leo G. Carroll, northwest), Anne (Ruth Roman). Bruno realizes that Guy will not do his murder, so he decides to place the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty, Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park. After their game of tennis, Guy and Anne (who obviously discovered the "plan" of murder) run to the amusement park to stop Bruno, and they fight in the carousel out of control. Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (the director's daughter) as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Mrs. Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Mr. Anthony, Howard St. John as Police Captain Turley and John Brown as Prof. Collins , and the Hitchcock cameo is the Man Boarding Train carrying a double bass. Some dialogues and interactions of interesting characters, some good moments of suspense and, of course, the unforgettable end of the carousel, a good classic movie. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 in The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the movie was number 32 in 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very well!
