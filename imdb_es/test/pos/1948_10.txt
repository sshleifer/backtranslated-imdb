This movie is so 1980's and that's what I like a lot about it. He does an excellent job of transmitting the sensation of that strange decade. The reality that Russian nuclear weapons could kill you at any time. Reagan in the White House told everyone that things were fine, while more and more social programs were cut. Young people abandoned, but not as much as their parents did in the 1960s. Young people still went to school, they only smoked so much drug that their feelings were almost dead. Nothing affected them, not even the death of one of their companions at the hands of one of their friends. How strange it is to realize that the murder was wrong, but you're not sure why. Seeing the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and talking about a very sick society. Glover is great, Keanu is great, Hopper is amazing. One of the most memorable movies I've seen.
