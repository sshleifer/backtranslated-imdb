This film is attractive and complex while maintaining a simple beauty. Our two characters come together to share the basis of curiosity and loneliness, but it is a springboard to learn these people, they are lifestyles and pasts that support it. <br /> <br /> The two main actors (Bohl, Brundruge) were at the time like any of the two actors I have seen. 100% credible, they transport the public seemingly effortlessly to their world. The perfect performance of the actors joined the beautiful and realistic dialogue of Bechard and his true direction makes the story move towards a shocking and moving end. This film is easy to visual treatment, which increases the intensity of the story. The soundtrack goes through the viewer, calming but extracting the emotional content of the film. I find that this project is nothing less than a masterpiece. intriguing. intense.
