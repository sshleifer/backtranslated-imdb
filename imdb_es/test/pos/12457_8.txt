I thought that this was a very bold representation of the old 'Tarzan' concept popularized by Hollywood, Weismuller, et al. <br /> <br /> Yes; There are a lot of silly things But then, the idea is silly. It is almost incredible that chimpanzees father a human baby until adulthood. I am tempted to say that it is completely incredible, but that the concept has never been attempted. And there is certainly too much anthropomorphism for your comfort. Although under the circumstances I can see how that would be very difficult to avoid. Now we also have a much greater vision of the problems of acculturation and we know that a human being raised from childhood without guidelines of human behavior will never learn them in adulthood. <br /> <br /> Still, if you can get your head around that lot, there's a lot to admire that is both imaginative and daring. Lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. I am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and comprehensive role I have seen him play. There are also many other excellent performances. Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm are, among others, what is particularly disturbing, and rightly so, is the perception that simians have of humans. We came to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, dumb and defenseless brutes over whom we routinely dominate. And it demonstrates well how the false "civilization" and the "morality" with which we conceal and justify our conduct, is nothing more than an expression of selfishness and arrogance. It may seem a little exaggerated at times, especially in the museum's horrible dissection rooms, but what we see is not just a truth about the Victorians; It is a truth about how we are today. It is one that needs to be declared, and can not be declared often enough. The obsession of the character of Holm with the 'ray-zor' as a symptom of civilization, as if possessing a facial hair was a primitive condition to be despised, is an excellent example of this. Primitive bearded readers take notice. <br /> <br /> The story is depressing. In short it is a tragedy. Because although it returns to the jungle and the freedom of moral tyranny is a true human "civilization"; We know he is condemned. Before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild apes will be hunted to extinction as bush meat, and their environment will be developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify the insatiable human excess. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a story about ourselves. The path to extinction that other apes follow, must be followed by humans. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for its ethical approach, despite the difficult times.
