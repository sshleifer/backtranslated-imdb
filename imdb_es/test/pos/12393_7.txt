In general, it is an accepted fact that Marcel Carné's films of 1936-1946 are masterpieces and it is considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrities. This is an unfair opinion: at least, two of the latter are eminently visible: "Thérèse Raquin", his best post-war work, and "les tricheurs" (cheats). <br /> <br /> There is a strange evolution from Prevert's golden hour to "les tricheurs": in "enfants du paradis" "quai des brumes" or "le jour se lève", true love is frustrated for the villains. In "les tricheurs" true love no longer exists: we deal with a group of young people who do not believe in anything; falling in love would be incongruous for this youth. Adults are not villains at all: Mic's brother and mother are friendly people, but she is beyond his command. Anyway, very few adults appear. <br /> <br /> For two hours, the characters do not stop playing, dancing, listening to jazz records (a music that was not yet part of bourgeois culture, and drinking a lot.) When two of them discover that they care one for the other, it will be too late. <br /> <br /> The cast is quite good, Laurent Terzieff as a cynical existentialist and Andréa Parisy as a rich child are the standouts.On the other hand, Pascale Petit and mainly Jacques Charrier (who married Brigitte Bardot the same year as "les tricheurs") does not have the ambiguity that her parts ask for, they are all smiling, too sweet and nice to be credible. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, " les tricheurs "was labeled" nouvelle vague "! When you know what the priests of this film school (like Godard) thought of Carné, it's really a good joke, but this disenchantment that you feel throughout the film is really disturbing.
