This is a small and underestimated thriller, which has many emotions, with a great story, Sandra Bullock is great! All the characters are great, and I was surprised at how unpredictable it was since there were only a few predictable moments, besides, Sandra Bullock is simply amazing in this! Jeremy Northam played an incredible villain, and I know what the character of Bullock is about, because I'm the same type of person (I almost never go out), and this is pretty well done and written for the most part. This should be higher than 5.5 in my opinion, and Denis Miller was surprisingly better than expected in his small role. The scene in which Northam terrorizes Bullock in his boat was quite exciting, and it was one of my favorite moments, and I also liked the chase scene at the carnival, and I also liked the ending, as it was pretty good, even if I did. I think Northam was defeated too quickly. There are also many other good chase scenes, and it's also smart sometimes, and there are also some shocking moments. This is a little underestimated thriller, which has a lot of emotion, with a great story. Sandra Bullock is wonderful, I recommend this one! The address is great! Irwin Winkler makes a great! work here with an excellent camera work, adding good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The acting is fantastic! Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is extremely nice, strong as nails, but quite vulnerable, and I could feel for her because, like I said, I'm like Angela, I almost never go out, I really enjoyed her work in this movie! (Rules of oxen !!!!!!!). Jeremy Northam is excellent as the villain, he was astute, unpredictable and very threatening, he was great. Dennis Miller is surprisingly well and not annoying in his small role, and managed to bring some comic relief. The rest of the cast is fine. In general, I recommend this one! *** 1/2 out of 5
