This review is based on Producer's Cut: <br /> <br /> 'Halloween 5' was a big disappointment at the box office in '89. Personally, I've always loved it and I'm proud to have it in my collection. But due to its failure and also due to rights issues, it will be 6 years before we see another delivery. The film had the gift of being one of the best, if not the best, of the series. A hardcore fanatic writing the script, the return not only of Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also the return of Tommy Doyle's character from the first film, an important study that backs the project and Fall The Launching everything made the film sound like a success in manufacturing. So, what went wrong? I'll give you two good reasons: re-shots and bad editing. Due to a bad screening test and also to the unfortunate death of Donald Pleasence, the film was changed, and not for the better. The film, like parts III and 5, accumulated at the box office and received negative criticism from critics and most fans of the series. But then, thanks to the magic of contraband, the original cut leaked out and many fans, including myself, were very happy. I will end this part of my criticism by saying this: this movie is, until now at least, my favorite movie of 'Halloween' and I am not afraid to admit that. <br /> <br /> Pros: The score is simply fascinating. It has some of the best writings and dialogues of the series. 'Halloween 4' emulated the original because it was more suspense and humor instead of blood and guts, and 6 is the same. Great performances, especially since the late and very lost Donald Pleasence. It moves at an impressive rate. An interesting explanation for Michael's illness and why he will not die. Some brutal deaths. Some pretty chilling moments, my favorite is the character of Kim Darby. Many really handsome winks to the previous films. Some good surprises. Like the two previous sequels, this one has an incredible end of suspense. <br /> <br /> Cons: Although the explanation of Michael's evil is fascinating, it makes it a little less scary. Since when can Michael move from one place to another so fast? <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: This was the first 'Halloween' I saw in the theater. I was so excited because I really thought that 5 would be the last and then I heard that this was happening. I enjoyed it at that moment, but over time I saw it for what it really was: a great movie caught in an OK with a terrible ending. Why did the filmmakers have to listen to people in the test exams? If they had released this superior version, it could have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess it is in now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
