I just found the full set of 3 DVDs in Wal-Mart in the bin for $ 5.50, so I thought I'd take another look. Total of 13 hours to see everything (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on television in the sixties. Many independent stations repeated them for many years. <br /> <br /> Better than I expected, the time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of its creators and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all allied fighters. and women. More abstract and artistic than a direct documentary, but very truthful in its description of the causes and the final results of the Second World War. That war depended to a great extent on maritime transport, and the final victory depended on who achieved the final domain of the world's oceans. The Allies were the ones who could do it. <br /> <br /> It was also interesting to see how they try to strike a balance between the big events and the individual soldiers and the sailors who made them come true. The score is impressive, although a bit too much by today's standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett contributed as much as Richard Rodgers to the final score. I imagine that Rodgers provided all the main themes, and it was Bennett who had to adapt them to the images. Great job! <br /> <br /> It should be seen by all potential rulers or rulers. A warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals, determination and supplies to support them. Logistics: its quality and delivery will determine the eventual winners. The allies exceeded and exceeded the material quality of the Axis, attacked its source in the process and ensured its eventual defeat. <br /> <br /> I regret to see that the producer, Henry Salomon, had a very short life. The facts of IMDb were quite brief, I have to find out more about him. He made some more outstanding documentaries before his early death. I may have more to say later <br /> <br /> Trivia: I made all 3 LPs were made of background music, pretty good in general. Unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the latter, immediately relegating to a state of novelty, instead of listening to music in earnest. Pity too, because it contained some interesting but smaller themes in the series. Silly things like shots of 16-inch guns, torpedoes shot, bulldozers, airplanes ... mainly for children mainly. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
