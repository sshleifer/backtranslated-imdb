I have a strong feeling that what I think about this film will depend to a large extent on its frame of reference. If you have never seen a Miyazaki movie before, it is likely to confuse you. If you've seen a Miyazaki movie before, then it probably will still confuse you ... but you will not mind! That's because I discovered that the first time I saw one of his animated films, I tried too hard to find out what was happening and why, and that affected my enjoyment of the movie. Now that I've seen almost all of Miyazaki's films, I see the strangeness and just take it all, enjoying the beauty of it all. In many ways, these films (at least for Western audiences) are like drugs: many strange and beautiful images that at first do not always make sense but that feel very good to see them! Of all the Miyazaki films, this could have the most unusual and incomprehensible story line, even more than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But, how are you and many other films of Studio Gibli, if you sit down and see how you are rewarded with a fabulous story. But, because it is very difficult to describe (and others have already done), I will not even go there. <br /> <br /> As for the work of art, it is very typical of one of these Japanese films, although there was a remarkable change. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds. This was NOT a bad thing at all, the beautiful pastel-colored look was very nice and unique. In a way, it seemed that a bit of Bill Plympton's artistic style was infused into a typical Miyazaki movie. With a high frame rate, an animation of exceptional characters (that impregnate them with a lot of personality) and a great "surprise factor", this is an exceptional movie for all ages. Although it's clearly designed for younger audiences (especially for TOTORO fans), it's a bit scary here and there (during storm segments) but there are a lot of great things for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically), I loved the beautiful things and I applaud the other worldliness of the film. <br /> <br /> A great movie, among the best of Miyazaki. I do not give it a 10 because I do not dare to do that, and I also liked a little more the other movies in the studio (especially TOTORO). But that does NOT mean you should not rush to see it now, do it and do yourself a favor.
