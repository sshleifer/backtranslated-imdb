Beware of the Scottish game! In his fascinating and harrowing opera, Dario Argento returns to his classical form, recovering the composure he lost while filming twisted and delirious psycho-actors like Tenebre and Phenomena. In fact, based on a simple narrative that is offset by opulent pieces, imaginatively brutal murder sequences and refined photography, the film feels like the Argento that we once knew. The only real infraction of Opera is his lack of a Goblin score, which provided unusual, iconic and timeless music for many of Argento's best films (the opera selections used here are wonderful, however). <br /> <br /> The production is filled by several competent actors. While she is not Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra looks like Cristina Marsillach and achieves enough strength and compassion to understand the role of the tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as Marco, opera director, horror film and opera director. And Daria Nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively brief role (see how the featerette is made on the DVD for a fun interview with Nicolodi about his role, clearly brazen and resentful at the end of his relationship with Argento). Fans of Stage Fright (another excellent giallo of 1987, directed by Michele Soavi, who was the director of the second unit of Opera) will hardly recognize the final girl of that movie, Barbara Cupisti, as stage director here (I think they are the glasses that do it). ). <br /> <br /> With me, it's often the little things that matter, and Argento's fascination / obsession with nightmare images alone makes him my ideal filmmaker. The opera is full of small details that left me smiling. For example, I love that we never see the face of "The Great" by Mara Czekova. I also love the scene in which the killer is scraping the tip of his sharp and deadly dagger on a television screen that shows Betty's performance as Lady Macbeth. Finally, I challenge even the grayer slasher veterans so they do not flinch when the "pin grids" are placed over Betty's eyes. <br /> <br /> In summary, Opera is a clean, tense and tense thriller. With his solid performances, his lucid approach and his literate cinematography, he begs to be in the same category as Deep Red and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. Could opera be the last great giallo?
