Of so many excellent and so on in Nevskiy, one of them, especially compact *, tickled me so deeply that it ended up being the film's most fabulous moment for me. <br /> <br /> Or at least the one that tends to lead annoying people to see the movie, brandishing the disc in their hands for emphasis. <br /> <br /> The vague abstract recognition of the rather simple and concrete blame involved in the guilty pleasure of this can really gel and pushed me to pay the intellectual bill eventually. <br /> <br /> Until then ... <br /> <br /> The disappearance of the organist was so successful.
