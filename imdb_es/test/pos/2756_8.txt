This is a "revised" presentation of Riverdance, presented at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Of the three Irish "dance" musicals that I saw from the mid to late 90s (which include the first "Riverdance" and "The Lord of Dance"), I liked this better. <br /> <br /> I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, has a more varied and colorful setting and eliminated each of the two that original that was not good to start with. This is just a very solid show with few weak points. To be sure, there are some songs / dances that are just "fair" but none that are poor, which is surprising considering there are 20 numbers in all. <br /> <br /> The cast is similar to the first Riverdance with the main exception of Colin Dunne who replaced Michael Flatley as the featured dancer. Both are extremely talented. The main difference could be in his appearance with Dunne, a black haired and battered boy, while Flatley is the clean-shaven blonde. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big that it sometimes becomes annoying. Fortunately, the female protagonist, Jean Butler, is still there and it's great to see: what a beauty and talent so funny! Butler and the rest of these women have the best legs I've seen in dancers. I also enjoyed the dance of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco performer, and two guys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. A number - with those two pairings against Dunne and two other dancers -0 is called "Trading Taps" and it's really fun to watch, maybe the highlight of the whole show. Nor do I have any complaints about the violinist Eileen Ivers. <br /> <br /> The "fast" Irish songs that attract me most here. I appreciate that the audience does not get in the way of the performance with screams and screams as women do in the video "The Lord of Dance".
