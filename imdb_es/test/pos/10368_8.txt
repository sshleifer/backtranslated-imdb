Although I have definitely read this particular book by Agatha Christie at some point, I do not remember anything about it, except the name "Abernethie". What is good is that seeing how this story unfolds without knowing how it will develop allowed me to once again appreciate the pure GENIUS of Agatha Christie: the way she tricks you and then throws the rug out from under your feet is the main reason for its success and timelessness. In addition to their stories, the excellent production values, the beautiful places, the wonderful music, the first performance, the elegant address, etc. are the reasons for the success and timelessness of this series, and all these virtues are present in "After the Funeral". . A tip: be alert from the start, there are clues that have been dropped everywhere even in the opening sequence! There are also some rather disconcerting moments, in contrast to the peaceful countryside English towns and some small touches of humor. A must for lovers of mystery, and only a very good movie in general. (***)
