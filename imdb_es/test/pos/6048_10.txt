By today's standards, the DI may seem a bit silly. Lee Emery's version is more accurate. I graduated from Boot Camp in Parris Island, South Carolina in 1964. Jim Moore is the closest thing to reality you could put on the screen in 1957. I can not comment on the plot, but I thought the end was not realistic for MCRD . PVT Owens is like many who found themselves in a much more difficult situation than I expected. Like so many, he joined the Marine Corps for all the wrong reasons. My drilling intruders were more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. Much more. The ID is more the Korean era and Full Metal Jacket is more the Vietnam era. Today's movies allow that kind of thing on the screen. I have the ID in my collection. I only found it recently on DVD.
