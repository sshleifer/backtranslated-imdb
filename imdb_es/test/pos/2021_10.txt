I love this movie, especially because Mark Wahlberg is in it and, secondly, because the end justifies the means. There is something in this movie that absorbs you and allows you to feel all the emotions that the characters feel. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. Take a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived at the time (maybe these days they have become smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has many subtle facets to allow light to pass through. Like a diamond, this movie shines. You will not waste your popcorn on this. Semi-chick movie but my husband also enjoyed it. There are some laughs released too.
