There are very few films that can tell such a complicated story on as many levels as Mishima: A life in four chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of storytelling is the possibility of doing a flashback and moving forward without losing the rhythm of the movie. This film not only returns and the fourth with the greatest ease, but also flows through some of Yukio Mishima's best stories. This film excels in all aspects and it is a joy to see it. Not to mention the incredible soundtrack of Philip Glass.
