THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> The Cell, like Antz, must be observed twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was mediocre, but after seeing the movie it impressed me so much that I decided I had to rent it again. I did it, and found that the movie was much more enjoyable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories with quality and is a visually intelligent film that imagines images and plots ideas that can not be combined. The script of the film can be awkward at times, like the performance, but the images are ingenious and bring the story to an exotic and intriguing life. The Oscar-nominated make-up is also bold and careful, while the beautiful costumes and the absolutely brilliant overall decoration went unnoticed. Tarsem Singh, who also directed music videos, goes totally crazy with his address and the result is good. He has a great talent and this movie has a lot of potential if you give him a chance. In general, The Cell is powerful, disturbing and avoids being too sticky, which makes it an excellent and pleasant watch.
