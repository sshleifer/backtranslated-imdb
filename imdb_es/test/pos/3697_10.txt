This movie is excellent. The passion between Jade and Billy is memorable and the acting was excellent. That's why you do not leave a 16-year-old boy and such a man together! It shows why a single mother should not go out with a younger man with a teenage daughter in the house, because she seemed young enough to be Jessy's son. <br /> <br /> I give it ten out of ten, The actor was wonderful and the movements between the actors were correct. <br /> <br /> The age difference between Jenny and Rob was also good, because they were similar in age. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a fun movie, but I think no one under 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes.
