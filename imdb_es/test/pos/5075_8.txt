Most of this political thriller was presented as a movie mostly with a somewhat better development of many of the main characters, which was much appreciated, until the BIG turn and the powerful climax that recalled the twists experienced in "Silence of the Lambs "or" The sixth sense ". Reese Witherspoon as the anguished wife of the missing Egyptian husband and Yigal Naor as the strong-arm interrogator offer solid performances. Unfortunately, Jake Gyllenhaal receives a more two-dimensional character and has to deal with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally torn CIA analyst that has been featured many times before in other films. At the beginning is the beautiful scene with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of "Saving Private Ryan," the silent scene that was used so effectively to reflect a consequence of the violence. The script also provides a little more insight into the "enemy" mentality, but still does not allow the audience to really understand, again allowing the audience to turn into a stereotyped characterization. Cinematography and photography are also somewhat disappointing because, unlike "Jarhead" or "Blackhawk Down", there is a lack of crisp and plain visceral presentation that does not allow the audience to really be there in the film, there is some distance that keeps To the public To realize the intensity of the emotions that occur on the screen. However, in general, the film redeems itself at the end, offering the audience a measured look at the complexity of the use of interpretation by the United States and the possible complications and consequences that may occur through its use. Eight of ten stars.
