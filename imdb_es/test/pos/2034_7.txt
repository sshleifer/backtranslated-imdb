I've been waiting for the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed. I will not bother to summarize the story since everyone else has done it, but I will say it was simply entertaining. The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were nice. <br /> <br /> My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely missing; The film ended very abruptly, in fact, the writing became quite lax in the second half, as if the writers were not sure what to do with the plot. As the plot was not as important as the music and the action, this did not really affect the entertainment value of the film, so it is not a complaint as important as it seems. <br /> <br /> (2) This is really sharp, but the music that the characters in the movie heard sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. Devil Inside from INXS was from 1987 and Are You Ready from AC / DC was from 1990, among other errors. This bothers me a bit, since they obviously did everything possible to make a good period piece, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. Again, it's not a big problem. <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought of something else that was strange. The members of the Steel Dragon band were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played members of the band, and each had a couple lines of speakers with AMERICAN accents. That was also a little lazy, but it was still great to see the real musicians playing musicians, so I'll forgive him too. <br /> <br /> I could probably kill myself all day, but I do not want to give. The impression that this was not a super entertaining movie. I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I'll certainly buy the soundtrack CD for just the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the Steelheart band singer, if you remember them!). The highlight of the film was possibly a great achievement in which Mark Wahlberg plays a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays "Good Vibrations" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. The surprised look on Mark's face is priceless. Classic rock and roll movie! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment
