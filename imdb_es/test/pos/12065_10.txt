Hilarious show with so many great stories, which reflects the world of today as we know it, in such a fun way that it literally stole my laughs for other shows. I laughed so much that I found other comedy shows without grace. The unique confessions of each character are a great original technique that makes the show fun and very fun. You may think that this is an average comedy show about a difficult life with a family. That's what I thought at first, but I discovered that it contains new and unique techniques that completely distinguish it from any other average comedy show. Michael Rapaport is a star. I wish this show was not canceled.
