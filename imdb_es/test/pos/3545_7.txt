I watched this movie in the early 1990s when I had been on VHS for a while. At that time, I found it interesting, and I was especially surprised by the segment of Ken Russell, with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgery. <br /> <br /> Last night, in a second race. From the last Indiana Jones movie, John Hurt's vision triggered an unexpected flashback of "Aria," which he had not thought of in years, and the sudden memory of Russell's piece itself was enough to provoke an outbreak of tears for a little bit . <br /> <br /> If I can make this observation, I note with interest the reaction of love and hate that people have expressed in Russell's segment, and I have found this interesting difference in other films that delve into deep trauma. and its side effects. Some get IT, others NOT, interesting. <br /> <br /> I see from the comments and the rating that the general work hit people in various ways. This is how it affects me and affects me.
