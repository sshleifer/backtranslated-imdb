During my adolescence, or should I say it's the best time, I "ate" all kinds of science fiction novels every day of the week. It was in the sixties and seventies when television was not a killer of leisure time as important as today, one night, in the mid-seventies, I saw the film on television. I think it was ARD and it surprised me. It impressed me in such a way that I can almost remember every scene even today. <br /> <br /> Today I watch my children playing SIMS or something, and I think we are close to what the Fassbender film expressed. I would also very much appreciate if you could buy this movie on a DVD. But in vain I tried almost everything to get a clue as to where. The MATRIX movie can not touch the quality and state of the art of this film by far. And, by the way, we do not have glue if we were a superior reality or just one of the two simulation models. Probably after our death we will definitely know ...
