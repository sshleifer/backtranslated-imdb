What is the most violent movie of all time? Rambo III? Command? Robocop? Add these three very violent together, and you will not even match the carnage in The Stabilizer, the wildest, dumbest and craziest action movie I've ever seen. For a hundred minutes, things explode and people die in dozens of strange ways. It will make you laugh and be happy, and when everything is over you will be more than a little exhausted. This movie is a buried gem, a cult classic that unfortunately lacks cult. <br /> <br /> The Stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter Goldson (Peter O'Brian), a big, oily man with a curly mullet. He arrives in Indonesia on the path of the evil and bad Greg Rainmaker. We know he's evil because he's only mentioned by his full name ("I hate SCUM as Greg RAINmaker!") And he uses a killing method that is so horrible that I can not even pronounce it here. Wait, yes I can. He stomps people in spiky shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. <br /> <br /> When Greg Rainmaker is not pouring alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure, he is kidnapping important teachers and heading to a huge empire in the underworld. It depends on Goldson (a Jewish action hero? Gevalt!) And his motley team of support partners to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and exploiting many things. Maybe "stabilize" has a different meaning in Indonesia. <br /> <br /> And the violence, oh the violence. This is a movie you do not want, that is, you can not capture, let five minutes of time pass on the screen without any kind of explosion, stabbing, car accident or interception of the dialogue. The violence is extreme; Not graphic and bloody, only really weird. For example, The Stabilizer & company invades one of Rainmaker's warehouses (driving through a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle, of course). When it is perched on the balcony, with heavy fire coming from below, the stabilizer does the only thing it can do. Drive from the balcony towards the boy's head, his front tire bounces like a basketball. Amazing. <br /> <br /> From the excessively gratuitous love scenes (the two great female characters jump into the sack with the hero of their choice, not two minutes after they speak to each other for the first time) to the misdirected dialogue ("Victor, you talented bastard!") The stabilizer has it all. This is a movie for all ages, along with Citizen Kane and Gymkata. It is not widely available at the launch. If you find it anywhere for any price, buy it and enjoy the madness. <br /> <br />
