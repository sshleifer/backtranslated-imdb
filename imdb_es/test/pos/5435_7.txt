Robin Williams shows his standing talents and increases his status as a comedian in this film of "what is wrong in American politics and how can Hollywood make an influence without boring people." Of course, Hollywood uses movies with hidden or not-so-hidden agendas. I think this movie is for people who like political discussions and stand up. And the advances of this movie were for everyone just to make sure that as many people can see this. Everyone knows that Hollywood is more liberal / democratic than Bush & Co, so they have to do these movies from time to time ... but this was perhaps too obvious, at least I think, to make a real change. <br /> <br /> Still, great problems and political conversations and fresh ... I enjoyed it and thanks to the ratings of IMDb.com I was positively surprised when I left the cinema, and yes, I laughed many times. Sometimes, you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness ... watch this movie if you like good and good relationships or politics and you will not be offended by the various references of how things are not right at this time. Rent it if that does not match you.
