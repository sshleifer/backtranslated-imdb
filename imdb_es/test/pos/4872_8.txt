This is more of the same that made this caricature popular ... but who complains? It's always fun to watch the poor coyote try several gadgets to get the Road Runner, and then be pulverized by each of those inventions. <br /> <br /> The underground cave chase was different from the normal rate and was smart. He gave us an aerial view of the chase in a structure similar to a labyrinth. I did not say it was funny; simply different from normal pranks above the ground. <br /> <br /> This, along with some other Road Runner shorts, appear in Volume 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection and the transfers are spectacular. The colors are magnificent.
