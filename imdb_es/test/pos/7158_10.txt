I saw Forgiving the Franklins at a screening of Paramount and I loved it. I have to be honest. I really did not want to go and I had grown tired of the movies that were being made today. I have to tell you that Forgiving The Franklins was new and wonderful. Together, I laughed, it was a great story that told that I could not believe that two guys shot this and put everything together. I thought if these guys could make a movie like this with this budget, imagine what they could do with a lot of money behind them. And then I thought that being the tired guy that I am in the studios would probably fix it anyway. That said, thank you, I got lost in your movie and that's why I go to the cinema to forget the world for a couple of hours.
