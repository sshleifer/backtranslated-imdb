The surface is one of the best t.v. series that I've seen The acting is great and the plot is exciting. Each episode left me barely able to wait to see the next one. I especially thought that Carter Jenkins, who played Miles Bennett, did an excellent job ... he's a very talented actor and I hope to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Surface has only done one season ... once again, the public has disappointed me. It's hard to imagine that a great show like this will be canceled, while the crap reality shows continue year after year. Whoever made the decision to cancel this program really dropped the ball on this one.
