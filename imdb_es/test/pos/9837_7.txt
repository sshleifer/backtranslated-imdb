Years ago, I did not love or respect Jimmy Cagney's films almost as much as I do now. I noticed that many of Cagney's films made with Warner Brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and their acting style was far from subtle. However, the more I watched these films, the more I was hooked despite these aspects. In fact, now I like them and I wait for them! Fans of old Hollywood movies probably understand what I'm saying: teenagers and other young people who are not! Well, when it comes to entertainment, THE MAYOR OF HELL never ceases from beginning to end. While the idea of ​​a shadowy character like Cagney taking charge of running a reform school is ridiculous, and while all the changes he made also seemed implausible, everything worked and provided a solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> The band of tough thugs was pre-Dead End Kids and instead of Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop, Frankie Darrow and Farina play similar roles. Yes, I said "Farina". This black actor was already famous for his roles in the comedy Our Gang and was, believe it or not, one of the best-paid children's actors in Hollywood. All he needed to surrender in return was for them to give him an insipid name and act like a good stereotyped "black." Here, it was actually quite good and the usual black stereotypes are a little more moderate than usual. However, some will shudder at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving Farina and her father, Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. With horrible names like "Farina" and "Snowflake", do not say I did not warn you. <br /> <br /> Apart from this small complaint and an argument hard to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. Children do a great job, as do Cagney and Dudley Digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil warden. Also, as an added bonus, you can see the perennial Warner actor Allen Jenkins in his first studio role.
