I liked this movie. I saw it in a crowded house at the Toronto International Film Festival the day after the gala opening that it should have been fine. It was assumed that the director, Gavin Hood, would be present at the screening today, but unfortunately his twins were born just a few hours before, so he had to fly on a return flight. "2 births in 24 hours" was the way he joked about it. <br /> <br /> Surrender refers to "extraordinary rendition," a term by which terrorism suspects in the United States can be sent without the legal consent of their parents. Nations, to prisons abroad to be interrogated and detained. <br /> <br /> It is quite predictable: the innocent Egyptian-American man wrongly accused of being a terrorist "disappears" while on his way from South Africa to Washingon DC. He is sent abroad, while his wife at home (Reese Witherspoon) struggles to find and release him. But what makes this film special is some good choices for telling stories: 1) a story with a human touch of what is happening in the place where a suicide bomb detonated; 2) the humanity of an agent of the CIA who tries to understand and be honest with what is really happening; and 3) the chronology of the storytelling that turns it into a tense and tense story that moves and shakes at the right times. Oh, relief! And a mixture of emotions that swirl as the story struggles for an end. <br /> <br /> Strong performance with Meryl Streep as an outstanding vixen.
