Although I lived in Australia in 1975, shortly after I moved abroad, fed up with the constant industrial agitation, the general adoration of mediocrity, unless one is an athlete! - and the complacency of so many Australians who chose to ignore the dizzying pace of change that is taking place in the northern countries. <br /> <br /> As a result I missed The Dismissal, along with many other television dramas made in Australia in the 80s and 90s, such as the excellent Janus and Phoenix series, which I've seen since then, along with Wildside. <br /> <br /> For me, the filmed history of The Dismissal is fair and, as far as I know, accurate. However, as for the public "outrage", it only shows one side of the image, not how the families were affected by the controversy. I know, since my two brothers would not talk to me for months afterwards. <br /> <br /> But the comment is, in my opinion, very partial in everything. The inescapable fact is that, despite the fierce expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community, the Australian electorate chose, and chose decisively, in favor of Fraser, as they did again two years later. <br /> <br /> This aside, a historically accurate and extraordinarily well-done docudrama.
