Finally I saw LAURE and I have to say that I enjoyed it equally and I was horrified. The good thing about this is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. History does not exist for sure, but with these films it does not really matter. The languid pace and the settings are exotic. The movie has a lot in its favor. Unfortunately, it also has some things against it. The first thing is that the beautiful Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry. Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for most of the movie, the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite responsibility. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. Surely they prevented their attractions from being displayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are simply ineffective or even ridiculous. There is a sex scene that stands out as one of the dumbest I've seen in a soft porn movie: our young blond couple is picked up by a helicopter pilot who turns out to be a transvestite! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) And they have a kind of orgy in the helicopter, in the air. And Al Cliver is filming all this with his 16 mm camera! It is not a joke. Ridiculous. Later we see that 16 mm images are edited in a moviola. While the images advance, Al and Annie begin to kiss. This scene is really good, but the images on the screen behind them were sometimes too much. Seeing the images of the transvestite standing with her bimbo while she was piloting the helicopter, she almost rolled me on the ground laughing loudly. Is this supposed to be erotic or credible in some way? The last thing I want to see is a woman pleasing a man who is dragging, certainly when the man who is dragging becomes such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie getting it was great, as was the music throughout the scene. I just wish the recording on the editing screen was not so silly. <br /> <br /> Speaking of drag, another boring plot point in LAURE that really drags the film to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and her two wives. A marriage trio is an interesting idea, but it is almost not recorded here as hot or even interesting. The two women are a little bored and rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes on for most of the movie, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there are nudes but not as much as other films of the same era. I just needed more skin to put it on. <br /> <br /> Except for those minor complaints and drag queen moments, LAURE is really very visible. I love this kind of softcore movies from the 1970s when the focus was on the mood and atmosphere, not on the rudimentary things we see today. <br /> <br /> ps: make sure you see Emanuelle in Egypt, starring Annie & Al, but also another famous screen couple, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also great.
