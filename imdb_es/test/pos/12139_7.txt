I agree with all the strengths mentioned in the other reviews, but there are a few heartbeats that keep it firmly within the genre of criminal drama or film noir and limit it to being a great drama beyond the limits of the "elements" that make film noir - not to say that the great noirs of the film are not / can not / should not also be great dramas, but this is not. <br /> <br /> Another note is the music in the film is used sparingly, but I would say that it is used to accentuate the action more often than the wife's elements. <br /> <br /> Great configuration of this movie by the way, with an abrupt type of endless ending that is either right or a disappointment depends. <br /> <br /> The spoilers follow some details. <br /> <br /> The big twist in the story involves children watching their mother die, or it should be the big moment. But children are never shown to react in one way or another. Neither of us cries, nor asks his father what happened, the children are good actors and the father's reactions are, I suppose, what matters, but this is a big false step. This is the heart of the story and the children remain mostly blank in their reaction. They really do not have any, in the next scene they look like nothing happened. <br /> <br /> In the same way, there is a link that is formed between the characters of Belmondo and Ventura. Belmondo says he knew the partner who was killed, but this is never explained and does not have a dramatic impact on Belmondo or anyone else. The romantic secondary plot of Belmondo also tenses the credibility, although it is convincing. The character of Ventura only allows Belmondo to involve a total stranger in his escape plan for no reason. He does not even comment or seem to notice. Another gap. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie, and I will not spoil it, the ending happens off the screen with a shallow voice to tell you what happened. I guess this tries to make him feel more faithful to life, but again, like these other mistakes, he leaves the drama off the screen. <br /> <br /> What is the point of not dealing with these problems? I do not know, other than that maybe the objectives of the film were limited to giving the audience what they want from a criminal melodrama: suggest some deeper elements and then continue to ignore them. <br /> <br /> Also bad, there is a lot to recommend this movie, Ventura is very good, but too bad, it could have been a great drama and a crime story, as with the favorite IMDb movie of all time , THE GODFATHER. This movie had potential. However, if it is done in the USA. UU., More problems would probably sink the film, but in the hands of the right director would be a good remake, although it is doubtful that Ventura's performance can be overcome. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing, but it's frustrating as a whole.
