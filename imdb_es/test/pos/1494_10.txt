... the last time I laughed so much. It is a testament to Rowan Atkinson's talent that he managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality, barely speaking a word. All the success of the program is based on the shoulders of Atkinson, but he carries it easily. Despite the fact that the program lasted only one season, anyone who is vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the social face of rubber, so great is the talent and effort put into acting. Sometimes exasperating, sometimes kind, Mr. Bean is an innocent and unfortunate guy who is also a bad incarnate. The brightness of this character can not be expressed in words, you have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The show becomes too depressing at times, like in the famous New Year's Eve sketch, or when Bean celebrates his birthday. Going alone to a restaurant, offering a greeting card signed by himself and receiving a stake that does not feel like it. However, there are times when you can not help but be impressed by the inventive methods with which Bean moves away from problems, such as when he gets rid of the stake in numerous intelligent ways or when he becomes a swimsuit without taking. His pants were first! Whatever his reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, he is forced to laugh as he watches. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to point out that although "Bean" is classified as a program for children, it is just as fun for any adult with a sense of humor. Because the more "adult" jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the smart slapstick (yes, there is such a thing) it's funny, no matter how old you are, "Bean" is the truest definition of a family program . This is just a classic and always brightens my day.
