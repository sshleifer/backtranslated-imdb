The name "Lucio Fulci" brings together images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of many fans. Thanks to films like "Zombie 2", "City of the Living Dead", "The Beyond" and "The New York Ripper", Fulci has the reputation of being one of the greatest directors in history. And although many of his latest films no doubt justify his reputation until the release of "Zombie 2" in 1979, Fulci's films did not contain the amount of blood and guts he knew, in fact, for the most part they were free of Gore Relying on more traditional clashes and disturbing images to work with. "Do not Torture a Duckling" has almost no blood, but it is ranked as his best. <br /> <br /> "Do not Torture a Duckling" is located in a small Sicilian city where superstition rules instead of logic. The people of the town distrust so much of the strangers as of the different ones, they often avoid them. After a series of murders of children, many people descend on the city, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan), who tries to discover the truth about the murders while they continue to occur. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary movie. It is very well done with an excellent cast full of many Italian exploit film favorites. It also contains a solid score, as well as many creative movements of the camera, courtesy or Lucio Fulci. But the real appeal of "Do not Torture to Duckling" is the disturbing nature of the film. Young children, about twelve years of age, are shown mocking retarded people, visiting prostitutes and being proposed by an older woman. It also contains some very scathing comments about the middle class and the Catholic Church. It is for reasons like this that "Do not Torture a Duckling" was blacklisted throughout Europe when it was first launched and never showed up in the United States. However, "Do not Torture a Duckling" is a monumental achievement in the film giallo, as well as the best work of Lucio Fulci. I really can not recommend this enough, take a look.
