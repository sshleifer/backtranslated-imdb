One of Starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog ​​in search of an orange after being encouraged by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. The dog encounters an orange after falling from the back of a car to be sold, but at night he must protect the orange when he enters a diabolical nightclub with many strange and terrifying characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog returns the orange to the girl and is saved from a terrible death of scurvy. The mascot presents new techniques that I have not yet seen in the Starewicz films. The addition of synchronization sound and a mix of live action with stop-motion animation creates a new twist on Starewicz's old puppet style. The live scenes of moving cars and the feet of people who walk by while a puppet sitting on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. The singing of the cars and the shouting of the street vendors is remarkable due to the fact that the small changes of study to the sounds are expensive and that the use of the new technology on the part of Starewicz seems something old. The new puppet characters in this film are terrifying contributions to the devil's club scene. Twigs and newspaper strips come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs that incubate skeleton chicks. The characters come flying from everywhere in patties and frying pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses fast approaches that are achieved through editing to accelerate the rhythm of what could have been a slow scene before. In general, Starewicz can update his filmmaking style to meet the demands of a new audience, which makes this film one of the best examples of his work.
