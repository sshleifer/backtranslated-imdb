In the movie, "The Hawk and the Snowman," when they showed Christopher Boyce around the complex, the satellite in the background was the real Ryholite satellite that is now in space. TRW allows internal shooting. TRW also allowed indoor and outdoor shots for one of the original Star Trek TV series. (The episode is one in which Spock goes blind when a chain of satellite lights is activated to kill the aliens). Christopher escaped from prison (Lompock) and appeared in America's Most Wanted. I was drinking in a bar when the show came out. He said: "Hey, that's me." It goes without saying that he was captured and transferred to a maximum security prison.
