I've seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and I never tire of it just because it's perfect. And he also has the best film music and the best supporting roles written for a movie. I mean, you just have to love Robert Duval, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie, but especially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer won an Oscar instead of this incredible war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the best movie in the world (The Godfather) and the best actors in Hollywood where you can only succeed. Now I just have to twist something to get this preview, so do not read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
