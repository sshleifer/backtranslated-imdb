In the past, I was one of the RNs in the Emergency Room, these skaters would occasionally land. They were not treated well, and some of them were provoked by their asocial personalities, but we all knew they were a talented group of "wonderkids" even then. I deserved better attention than they received, I'm afraid. They had an "attitude" in swords. <br /> <br /> I am very happy to have captured this documentary about IFC tonight; it will be activated again at 1 am and I will be watching it again. <br /> <br /> Little attention was paid until the rich and dying child was able to convince his parents to drain the pool, and the film really highlights that, as a starting point ... it was an incredible moment, and it deserved to be. Recorded. Stacy Peralta deserves all the accolades that have been made, and those Z-Boys may enjoy their memories and their contribution to the true sport of skateboarding. As for the few "bitter grape" reviews that are included in this document, there were always and always will be "wannabees" and hangers that never do more than dream ... the Z-boys lived it, breathed it, if it were like that . <Br /> <br /> Pleased to see the classic movies and even the lonely girl, "Peggy", who was so much talked about as the only woman who earned her respect. <br /> <br /> Thanks to IFC, I received to really take the occasional drug-free trip of my youth and relive the heartbeat again.
