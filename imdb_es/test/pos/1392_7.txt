Lieutenant Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners of his sunken ship are washed ashore on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). After some random deaths of prisoners, Rackham takes Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Luckily for everyone, Barbara Bach is also on the island! Unfortunately, there are some crazy fishermen who like to kill people. <br /> <br /> This Italian production operator seems to have it all: a touch of CREATURA DE LA LAGUNA NEGRA mixed with DR. MOREAU with a hint of voodoo BLANCO ZOMBIE and Atlantis things. Despite some fishermen's costumes that look confusing, the film benefits from some photographs of beautiful places and a good mid-way turn. All the actors are good and Joseph Cotton appears even as an old biologist. The director Sergio Martino manages well enough, since there is action every 10 minutes or so. That can not be said of his late follow-up THE FISHMEN AND THE REE (1995), easily one of the most outlandish and far-fetched sequels since HIGHLANDER II.
