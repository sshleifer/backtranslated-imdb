This movie is very similar to Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also has some similarities with Island of Fire with Jackie Chan and I also heard that there are other very similar action movies, but this movie has a much better action than Death Warrant or even Island of Fire (that's right, Jackie Chan's movie). Rarely do American action movies have such good action sequences, although there were many negative reviews in this movie, which easily surpasses most of the action films of the time that were most successful. There were many scenes of martial arts, David Bradley was as fast as Bruce Lee in this film and, what was good, that the fight scenes were much longer than in most American martial art films. The shooting scenes were similar with John Woo's films, maybe not so good, but still very exciting. There were also many impressive explosions and a great chase scene. I've seen some other David Bradley movies, but this one, however, is the best in terms of action. Okay, this movie has some cheesy moments, but what movie is not? The acting was decent, Charles Napier was amazing and his character was very hard. Adam Clark, who played against Squid, and Yuji Okumoto, who played the main bad guy, were also very good. Other actors performed quite well too, although acting is not important in this type of film. If you are a fan of action movies (I mean the fan of real action movies, who can really appreciate the good action), you should watch this movie.
