I just watched this movie in a preview and I can only recommend watching it. It lasted about 90 minutes and when it was over, I felt it could last for hours. The stories of the protagonists are very realistic and you really feel at home. The film basically consists of dialogues but I did not get bored for a minute. 18 people of really different characters and each of them acted so well. I had to laugh, I felt uncomfortable, I was sad and I still felt happiness. In short, it is a film that shows the different types of people in our society, the way they communicate and how love has changed and nowadays is handled as something economic. Appointments becomes something that is similar to an audition. The whole audience loved it. So please look if there is a possibility. You'll love it!
