Even after all these years, this is still "a perfect movie" for me. I still remember sitting for a long time in the theater after he finished, stunned by the experience, overcome by emotion. I own the DVD (of course!) It is seen at least once a year. It is incomparable and I can not add much to what has already been written about its excellence and beauty. So I'm glad that others like it as much as I do. One note: the author of the book on which it is based, Michael Ondatje, was delighted with the film and was quoted as saying that he wished he had thought of some of the beautiful scenes written exclusively for the film ... the way Kip " invites "Hana by his side with a trail of small candles, and the way he arranges Hana to see the frescoes in the ruined medieval church.
