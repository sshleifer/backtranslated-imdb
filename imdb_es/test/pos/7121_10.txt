Gamers: DR is not an elegant movie, it's more like an amateur video. Horrible magic effect, really false fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village ... sword, ax, shield, tunic, plate ... okok ... everything. You will need about 10 minutes to adjust your visual expectation, then you will get 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I'm from Hongkong and it's very hard to find role players, none of my friends play RPGs and I always like to be one of the characters in the D & D world. Observing Gamers: DR just show me what it would be like to be a gamer. You will see rules books, dice, games, etc. etc etc .; You hear terms like "fighter", "wizard", "hit point", "level", "character", "flaming hand", "evil chaotic". <br /> <br /> What I like RPG is that it allows you to do everything you want, not linked by the RPG software. Gamers: DR provides the same element, you will not know what will happen next and it will probably make you laugh until death. The film goes as much to the real life of the players as in the D & D world. You will hear the player throw the dice when the character in the game acts, which will make him feel that he really participates in the game. <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil anything, but in short, Gamers: DR is a must-see for fans of role-playing games. For people who never play a role-playing game, I'm sure you still have a lot of fun.
