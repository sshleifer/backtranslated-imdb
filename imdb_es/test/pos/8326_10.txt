When Jurassic Park appeared for the first time, it was revolutionary in the making of films and special effects. For the first time, people go coldly to a dinosaur movie and become convinced that they were seeing real dinosaurs brought to life. However, although some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of how the true creatures might have been (T.Rex, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, etc.) some were modified to fit the film (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus) and the film took place in the present on a tropical island where they were not in their natural habitat. Walking With Dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their real habitats millions of years ago. The amount of detail and scientific information used in this is great. Now we can see views like a Triassic desert, a whole herd of Diplodocus, an Icthyosaur gave birth, a MASSIVE sea monster, a pterosaur sight, dinosaurs thriving in the South Pole, two Torosaurus horns, a roar of T.Rex To the camera and the impact of the comet that spelled its doom. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, reproduce, hunt and swim. But the series also reveals the other creatures with whom they shared the world, two episodes focusing mainly on two different types of animals, the flying pterosaurs and the marine reptiles that lived under the waves. The locations and landscapes are spectacular and look even more unique when a CG Dino appears on the screen. And as for CGI and animatronics, the movements of CGI dinosaurs seem totally and completely natural, the coloration is bright and vivid and the crew have taken careful measures to ensure that CG animals interact with their environments in any way that a real creature splashing in the water, brushing the bushes, lifting the dust and casting shadows on the ground. It is true that the CG is not perfect in some brief cases in which the animals seem too computerized, but the rest of the time it looks impressive. The puppet is poor in some cases, but it has its moments particularly the scene with the Cynodonts in the first episode. Kenneth Branagh's narrative is also very good and gives us vital information and drama at the same time. But, of course, the real pleasure is to see a living dinosaur doing the same thing that all those years ago and also see some really cute moments with puppies of Cynodont (hybrid of mammals / reptiles), Sauropodlets (baby Diplodocus) and chicks T. Rex (Yes, even T.Rex can be cute) and then reminds us that nature can be brutal and even more so than before. All this adds up to a masterpiece of prehistoric nature that allows you to see a real dinosaur and take your breath away, all from the safety of your living room. If you like nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, amazing images or just having a really good visualization and entertaining yourself, then Walking With Dinosaurs is definitely for you.
