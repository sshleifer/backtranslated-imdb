You can earn a rich experience by watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a seemingly simple story of a gifted student, Yiu Kwok, who later becomes a professor of classical Chinese poetry. He is married and has two children, and things at home seem normal. He still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his children alternately fill him with pride (the eldest) and disappointment (the youngest). <br /> <br /> His passion for poetry makes him an object of falling in love with a senior student in one of his classes. The student, Choi Lam, draws pictures of him during the class, significantly, one of him with a flower that comes out of his mouth. She teases him more with her intelligence than with her sexuality, although that is also an element. Of course, he is not immune to his attention, although he tries to keep the line of demarcation between the teacher and the student in his place. <br /> <br /> The reason why it does not succeed in the end is complicated. First of all, there is a real depth in communication between him and Choi Lam. It becomes evident that he really likes, and is mutual. Second, there is a long-standing problem in his marriage that is revealed when an old friend of his and his wife get sick. The consequences of the wife's involvement with this friend, both past and present, are almost too sad to bear. <br /> <br /> Nothing trivially is treated in this film. All the characters have a vivid inner life and an easily discernible story. The two protagonists, Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui, are exceptional, as are Karena Lam as student Choi Lam, and Shaun Tam as the eldest son in Yin. <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservations.
