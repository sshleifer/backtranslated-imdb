One of the best of the 'kitchen sinks'. Fantastic views of London and invaluable fragments of the working class life of the 60s. Loach's eye seems to capture everything, but does not judge anything, it is a test of what is to come. As with 'Kes', 'Riff-raff' and 'Sweet Sixteen', it serves as a film social history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing, you love her, you enjoy her, you want to take care of her, but keep your head in her self-destructive decisions and still follow her with a vain hope. Well backed by Terence Stamp, (fresh out of 'The collector', he also catches 'The Hit') and a plethora of English faces (all very young). Perfectly adjusted to Donovan's dulcet tones. Stamp sings' Yellow is the color ', in a charming scene, ending with him saying: "Improving, it's not me" (song that is also used in' The rules of Attraction '- I think) Look at Carol Whites' mom Preparing to 'go out and find a guy', putting the false eyelashes to the sound of 'Rosie' on the radio - it's priceless. A treasure for all who lived at that time and a reminder of how good life is now in England. Incidentally, Soderburgh used 'Poor cow' clips in 'The Limey'.
