FOUR FRIENDS was billed for the first time on HBO in 82 as a sleeper hit. Having heard the term 'sleeper' when I was 14 years old, back then, I was anxious to see one. (!) Boy - I was surprised! That movie! I had not really fallen in love with a non-special effects film outside of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, much less a 'hippy movie' ... but having grown up with a couple of hippies - I understood the power behind Mr Penn's movie. FOUR FRIENDS is definitely one of the types. The script is very nice, and that cast! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor so well! He simply personifies the "type of writer" to perfection, both intelligent and clumsy (the scene in the window ...) and strong but very vulnerable. For me, he captures what it is to be so in love that it lasts more than a decade ... and I've always found solace in the character, and in the film. Throughout the 1980s, FOUR FRIENDS was a crime partner for me, and I was able to watch the movie whenever I could on HBO, even if I had to stay up until 5 in the morning! And still, always at the end: there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters are separated from the spectators on the beach. Jodi Thelen personifies "that girl" to the hilt, it is so difficult not to be seduced by her. This movie really stands the test of time. From time to time I watch my video ... or show it to a friend ... and STILL has a solid reaction. I've met women who absolutely fall in love with Georgia! So many levels ..! Only an incredible piece of humanity from the 60's. Very special, very magical. I recently found Robert Grossbach's NOVELIZATION OF FOUR FRIENDS, and it's even more detailed than the movie! Current dates of events, etc. A real find! And what's more, haha, I found the novel while searching in a used bookstore ... in Omaha, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ I guess you have to have an eye for her! When I was in L.A. in 1992 working as an extra (I went into a souvenir shop of Rudy Lil), and there were a lot of photos of the movie! Unfortunately, I was bankrupt and could not indulge myself ... but those pictures of Georgia and everyone's happened to me! I met the director Joe Sergant on the set of SKYLARK in Emporia, KS, in the summer of 92 ... and we talked about FOUR FRIENDS, very good! Also ... working in a video store in Omaha in 98. I waited for a woman who was a relative of Jim Metzler ...! He told him to spread the word that there was a child in Omaha who was a fan of the movie, and that he had gotten everything he could. Once again, the film captures everything that is in the heart of Danilo's character ... excellent, excellent work, one of the best efforts of Mrs. Tesich and Penn. Steve Tesich is very surprised. An incredible writer. "Isadora Duncan!" <br /> <br /> - C.
