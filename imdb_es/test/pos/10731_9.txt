Kramer vs. Kramer is an almost heart-warming drama about the shocking and drastic increases of the two subjects of a failed married couple. Meryl Streep, in the midst of her characteristic maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy housewife mother who feels confined to that role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband, in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman. to find another role for herself. Hoffman is stunned, having no idea what to do with himself, since he has taken so many things for granted that he does not know the first thing that is needed to take his son to school in the morning. <br /> <br /> Hoffman perfectly characterizes this husband as such a juicy burden of setbacks. He is restless, implacable and impatient, but even though the positive side of these three adjectives must include the opposite, he is immensely obsessed with whatever turns his head. He has focused on his career in advertising, and when he is allowed to raise his son Billy alone, chaos begins immediately. He is the one who makes temper tantrums and rages half of an activity. After a while, while befriending his neighbor and Joanna's former friend, played by the sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his aircraft enough to understand why his wife left. Meanwhile, his unlimited energy is redirected towards Billy's upbringing and he loses his job. <br /> <br /> The battle for custody of the title is a brilliantly gray circumstance. Even if the ending is a little unmotivated, subject to the audience, the last line and the last shot still have that witty touch of screen writing that seemed to diminish after the magic years of the 70s.
