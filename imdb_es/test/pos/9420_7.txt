It is one of the paradoxes of the anti-Nazi films Sherlock Holmes by Basil Rathbone (Voice of Terror, SH in Washington, and this one) that, while the plots and scenarios are mostly terrible, he is so good at them. Despite a strange wind-blown hairstyle meant to make her look younger, she explodes each scene with so much bite and attack that it barely registers how flimsy the frames are. Here he also has a great acting relationship with Lionel Atwill, which makes Professor Moriarty wonderfully repulsive: a heavy eyelid cockroach with nice memories of sadism and depravity (he may not have been acting, kids). At the climax, changed to a lab coat to drain Rathbone's blood "drop by drop", he is as sinister as the archenemy Newman of Seinfeld. The film itself is an old license plate for children, but it benefits from the attention of director Roy William Neill to the staging and the environment. It is also quite clear in the restoration of the UCLA DVD: do not even think about buying any other edition, all printed faded public domain.
