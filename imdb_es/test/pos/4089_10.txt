Why take a perfectly good original drama, based on a perfectly good novel, and remake it as a quasi-musical? And cast it with actors who lack only talent to sing or dance? Something similar to "Showgirls" or the two most recent "Star Wars" movies, "Lost Horizon" is full of involuntary laughter. Who can forget Sir John Gielgud with an uncomfortable smile in his Dali Lhama attire, overseeing an interpretive dance of the Republican party ("Family")? <br /> <br /> Or Sally Kellerman lovingly admonishing George Kennedy, making her best impression of Cher as she jumps from one rock to another ("Every little thing you do")? And my favorite, Bobby Van embodying the strength of the United States educational system ("Question Me An Answer")? I can not wait for the release of the DVD, since I hope it contains comments from Liv Ullmann, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to make this movie!
