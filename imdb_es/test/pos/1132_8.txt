I'm not a great person on television ... but when I saw the first episode of Greek, I could not wait until next week! I do not miss the show for NOTHING! <br /> <br /> THANK GOD for the DVR! LOL I'm in love with Cappie ... he acts like a bad guy, but he's so sweet ... Everyone has his own character, we have almost all kinds of people. You can still throw a plump Hispanic person. <br /> <br /> I did not go to school in the US So, I never liked the idea of ​​fraternity houses and things like that, then, when my husband told me about the program that I did not pay attention to him, until he asked me to see it and, since he had nothing better to do I accepted. I laughed so hard the first night that I just needed to keep seeing him. <br /> <br /> So ... I'm with the other people who voted for this program to continue! I wait a second, a third and who knows how many more episodes! It's a really good show, very fun and entertaining!
