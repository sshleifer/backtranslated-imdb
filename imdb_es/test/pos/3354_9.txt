The first time I saw "Alice in Wonderland," an X-rated musical comedy, "it was in the early '80s in a movie theater in New York City with some friends. We enjoyed it very much, although we wondered why all the "goodies" were covered by various forms of colored patches and why the movie leapt from one scene to the next, leaving us guessing ... what we just lost. edited version (cut) soft core, which left me with the desire to see her again soon, but in its original integral version Well, more than 20 years passed, during which I completely forgot this film and, just a few days ago , by pure chance, I came across a very used VHS copy (which had seen better times: a bit of discolored colors, harsh sound and some faults), but guess what? It is the original version without cuts and, this time, I really had a Humor, music and porn can seem an uncomfortable combination but, in this case, it really works and, it is unlikely that the vast majority of boring porn movies that now invade our screens, this is a really fun and sexual fantasy Entertaining, you will not be disappointed. . The direction is smart, the quick editing makes the film fly like a bird, all the familiar characters are adorable or just funny, all the actors seem to have a good time, the songs are sticky (it is worth mentioning the "grow" sung by Alicia at the beginning of the film and the funny "What makes a good girl like you in a Knight like this?"), the dance numbers are well choreographed and organized (Terry Hall, surprisingly energetic, proves that she can also dance and dancing) dances with enthusiasm his entrails ... Do not worry, she also does what was best known for ...), the acting, the singing, the ensemble, the costumes are of a quality level and then .. is Kristine "Blue Eyes" DeBell, in the first lead role of her career and (oh boy!), She certainly has some HC. sequences! Personally I think that they are not absolutely unpleasant, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and very exciting. She is young and (ohhh!) Very pretty; With the help of his new friends in Wonderland, he discovers his body and sexuality, he sings, he dances and ... what do you expect? She is also experiencing sex! The final sequence, when she finally makes love with her boyfriend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the film. I think his "physique du role" (the innocent blue eyes and the captivating smile) and his ability to act make these explicit sequences more acceptable and really fun. There are many sexual relationships in (this) Wonderland and everyone seems to be eager to "take care" of the first available boys or girls, which means a lot of hard action to be seen. On the other hand, some shots of close-ups, clearly "spliced", just to make the "porn hounds" really happy, are a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, sexual action is not offensive because it is handled with great humor and mixes almost perfectly with music, dances and comedy. If you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex, see it together. Take my word, you'll have an hour and a half of very good time (maybe also an extra action after the show ...) This is "Adult entertainment", so be careful, do not leave this video or among others. If your 10-year-old son can get his hands on it, he could have fun, but he will be forced to give embarrassing explanations about the reasons why "this" Alicia behaves very differently from the Lewis Carroll novel or the he saw. in the disney video. I bet you will not forget this "one" very soon. It's a real pity that they do not do it that way anymore! I give it a 9 out of 10.
