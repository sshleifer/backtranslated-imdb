I'm not entirely sure how I came across this movie, but I'm glad I did. Initially, we were discouraged by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother who hates reading (especially on weekends) enjoyed this movie. I found the fantastic script and the way it was delivered in such a way that it was only added to the puddles of urine on my couch. Not entirely sure if it is as much fun for the native Danes as the comedy seems to be enhanced by the lack of subtitle tone and the ambiguity of the translation. I have not seen many Danish films (or any of them), but judging by this film, I guess they are not limited by the same political correctness as in any other place (God bless them) making the character of Eigel a respite. Fresh air, because let's face it, special needs are fun. There are so many excellent one-line phrases in this movie that it embarrasses American comedies.
