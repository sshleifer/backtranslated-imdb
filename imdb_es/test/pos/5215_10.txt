This fact-based television drama, mostly routine, is driven by Cole's excellent performance. This is the story of a highly trained military man, dissatisfied with his wife and children, fakes his death and flees with the other woman. To support her in the way she is used to, he steals banks. Predictable, but it's not a bad watch.
