Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, Harry Horner, best known for his set design. Robert Ryan plays a maintenance staff who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is that he is a psychopathic killer and does not know it. Miss Lupino is an empathic soul and tries to win over Ryan, without much success. He is not the kind of man that compassion could help or heal. Therefore, we have an interesting situation of two people who basically have good intentions, but one of them can not do well because something is wrong with him. He suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. <br /> <br /> Essentially the effect that Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. The public soon realizes that Ryan is a crazy killer, but it takes Lupino much longer. Therefore, we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to 'win' Ryan so that things work, get the job done, get on with life. But moving on with things is not in Ryan's composition, since he is incapable of any of the more normal and rudimentary forms of normalcy, and as soon as there is an opening, his paranoia is affirmed. <br /> <br /> As a study on mental illness, the movie is not too impressive. What is superlative is to show the effect of a major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mixture and its effect on a normal person. In this sense, the film is realistic and compassionate, although it is implacably logical in the sense that Lupino can not "fix" Ryan, but we want him to do it. The result is that, if you are willing, you can get emotionally involved in this movie if you can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. <br /> <br /> Horner shows us, gradually, the design of The House of the Lupines, a forbidden Gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with the staircase, the kitchen and the pantry; and we got to know which windows Miss Lupino can use to escape and which ones can not.
