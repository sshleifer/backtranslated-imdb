This movie is exceptional! On this date of APR, 8 of 2007, On time from Show was requested. It had been a while since I saw it, but it presents Thomas Jane in the first paper in which I saw it. At first you see a normal guy who seems a bit presumptuous, with a wife who seems to be about to go his own way. The cut of directors that I just saw has an opening scene that is great. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a type of cheerleader, she looks very fresh and hot. Trying to buy a coffee late at night, without small bills that turn violent in a hurry, Paulina shows that her name on her jacket is the real deal. Reuniting with his old friend Nick played by Aaron Eckhart was great at first, and even lent him his wife's car to take care of some issues. Then he sees silver briefcases, and the day changes for the strange and violent. There is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes. But, Paulina's Dallas steals the show, I think. His telling of a Casey story to the doctor who is there to get a personal interview on an adoption application is outrageous. As a rule, I never thought tall women were so attractive, but as with any rule, there are exceptions. Paulina is like I've never seen her in movies before. Sexy and lethal, like in a movie with Tom Selleck, but with a malevolence never before seen. If you're looking for a movie to add to your collection, it's worth it. Naked Pauline is worth the price alone, but this story has everything one could wish to have. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a tremendous mixture. When I saw it for the first time years ago, it amazed me, and I know you will feel the same.
