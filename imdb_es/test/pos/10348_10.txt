The brilliant performance of David Tennant and Sarah Parish made me cry since many of the scenes were so familiar to me. My husband suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1977 and required an important operation that involved raising his brain and covering the leak. Like Tricia, I had the naïveté to expect him to be his old self again. After more than 25 years of loving and caring for him, he abandoned me without warning to go live with a woman I barely knew. Then he applied and now I'm going through a divorce. I hope the program has helped people understand how to deal with a brain injury.
