Cuba Gooding, Jr. will win the Oscar for BEST ACTOR in 2003. And Ed Harris will win the BEST SUPPORT ACTOR. What a beautiful and moving movie it is, but be sure to bring a box of tissues because if this movie does not reach you, then you have ice water in your veins. <br /> <br /> It was 1976. The stage was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a coach and white high school soccer teacher, Ed Harris. Then there is a black man, scared but nice, Cuba Gooding, whose biggest possessions, including a radio, are stacked in a shopping cart that is also used as his bicycle. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris is very interested in the partner for a reason explained much later in the film. It gives Cuba the nickname "Radio" and what follows is a fascinating, moving and moving exploration of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The movie is nothing more than a masterpiece.
