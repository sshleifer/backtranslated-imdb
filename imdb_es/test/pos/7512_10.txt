This is one of the best movies ever made. Brilliant performance by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This movie is disturbing and extremely deep. Do not be fooled into believing that this is just a comedy. It is a brilliant satire on the medical profession. It is not a pretty image. Healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons, who spend all their time making money outside the hospital. And yet, you really think this is a hospital. The producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases. This movie really reveals how difficult it is to run a hospital and how bad things were in 1971. I loved this movie. PS - I noticed that the incompetent surgeon, wheel merchant, was the head of the firm at LA Law. The young doctor played in Lou Grant. I also noticed that the registration nurse has appeared since Becker and other programs.
