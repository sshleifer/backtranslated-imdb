This movie turned out to be pretty much what I expected. Of course it is silly, of course it is predictable. We all know the fairy tale. But knowing that when you go to see it, it's nice enough to see it. It was fun and sweet. I found it annoying that they showed geeks like children who did not wash their hair or children who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore t-shirts about math. I was an outcast in high school and I did not do these things. It goes much deeper than that. It has to do with many things, some of which are the amount of money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness, and how important it is to other children. Anyway, I'm not going to go into it. I do not agree with other opinions that Drew is not convincing as a geek. With orthotics, without makeup and unwashed hair, I do not think many people were drooling over her. And even when she goes back to high school and gets rid of those things. She still wears the "wrong" clothes, the "wrong" hair and has the "wrong" attitude to be considered cool. And your other "geek" friend can be beautiful, but it does not matter, where I come from, you can still be an outcast and be beautiful. (in and out)
