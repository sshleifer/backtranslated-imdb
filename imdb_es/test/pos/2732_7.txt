SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> 15 PARK AVENUE: My humble version of this movie <br /> <br /> Now, for a film viewer who has such limited tastes as mine, niche films like 15 Park Avenue should be to be acceptable to my sensibility. With this thought, and a slight sense of embarrassment of not having seen the full movie before, I saw this movie last Saturday. There are some initial similarities with other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch), of which, this film borrows at least 3 concepts: - <br /> <br /> a) That (at least some) the truths are relative b) The first scene of Shabana and Konkonam spinning in a car when rolling the opening credits is incredibly similar to the car trip that Betty and Rita undertook on Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the object of the investigation becomes a place that is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more overtly symbolic in Aparna's film. C) The incident that revolves around the crazy beggar becomes extremely reminiscent of all the "occurrence behind Winkies" involving a vagabond, but while that terrifying creature is an embodiment of something and that "something", as well as the character per se, is perfectly linked to other works of Lynch (carefully note the long hair and disheveled), the effect of the beggar in 15 PA seems to be a tribute and, therefore, insignificant in the context of the film and its message . <br /> <br /> The other films of which 15 PAs also lend themselves are Blow Up (especially the last scene is a shot back to the truth versus the perceived truth presented at the end of Antonioni's masterpiece) . Of course, the angle of the teacher and schizophrenia also brings to mind, "A beautiful mind." Although, certainly, the topic here is the high level physics and Shabana, who professes it, inadvertently ends up being the brilliant antithesis of the delusional hallucinations of Konkona's character through those prophecies. In an outstanding scene of the film, some of these elements are juxtaposed with each other and that scene deviates from the "real" world of Shabana, where Quantum Physics and the Theory of Relativity justify the finitude and composition of the universe. to the artificial building of Mithi's 'make believe' world. But, in spite of all their differences, the sisters are also the same. Both are incapable of forming lasting relationships, one by choice and the other by nature. Then, the pain of Mithi being rejected in love by Joydeep is in harmony with the inability of Shaban to form a special bond with Kunal (Dhritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm getting ahead of myself. In general, viewers tend to see this movie in one of the following two ways: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 1: "It was Shabana all the time" There is a certain section of the audience that thinks that. But that explanation is not only too far-fetched, but is also devised, since that would mean that she was also dreaming of many other characters (that is, all those characters she visualized by visualizing Mithi along with her). <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 2: "There was a REAL Mithi and the ending is a metaphor" This View says that the essence of the film is summarized in a dialogue in the film, when in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), Mithi is looking for something she will never find, her wife Laxmi (Shefali Shah) philosophizes that we are all looking for that illusory utopia, the end of the rainbow in which the illusion of happiness and satisfaction seems to be <br /> <br /> There is other more minor possibilities that have not been so well received by our public understanding as: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 3: "Shabana and Konkona are alter egos of the same person" Hypothesis 4: "Shabana is also a product of The imagin Mithi ation "Hypothesis 5:" The old man, emaciated, maybe angry. The beggar is the true protagonist of the story "<br /> <br /> Are these hypotheses worthy of being tested? Well, your conjecture is as good as mine. <br /> <br />" Why 15 Park Avenue? "Contrary to the popular perception that I was thinking about Park Avenue in New York, I think it got the brand name of a semi-popular bath soap.Remember, your statement of Jo Jo's profession as" Prime Minister of Shikakai ", which as you may know is a popular ingredient used in the manufacture of shampoos.The prefix '15' is used as it was on December 15 when Mithi became engaged to Joydeep and after her stoppage, she remains forever In a change of time, the film has its fair share of flaws: the lack of use of a strong background score, which in films like these can increase the narrative, some careless dialogues not diminished by some forced delivery of dialogues. (Shaba na and Dhritimaan are excellent despite the IMO) by some of the cast members, although many members of this cast have been wasted. The sudden insecurity of Shefali Chaya about her husband seems to be a dimension introduced without imagination into the plot. I give it 7/10, since it made me think, but not higher than that, because I can easily understand its sources of inspiration and have experienced (and for the most part, I enjoyed a lot) those previous ones, I have already thought about similar lines previously . . Therefore, the experience after 15 PA is destined to be without a certain degree of novelty. Where did I come from? 9.5 / 10 to '36 Chowringhee Lane '(although rumors persist that a ghost of Satyajit Ray directed it), 7.5 to' Paromiter Ek Din ', 7 to' Mr and Mrs Iyer 'and 5 to' Paroma ' On the existential level, he could not invoke my interest, not even as much as saying a 'Truman Show'
