The comments of the previous user are really hard. One wonders if they have even seen this beautiful sweet movie. As for being so unpleasant about it in front of the writer / director ... that's just rude! For those who grew up in the eighties, it is an ingenious piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced. Irish cinema surely has a lot of angry and bitter people involved, and the spleen comment on this fact is proof of that ... As people we have a choice; have fun and moan for the people who really go out and do things or do something yourself. I know which one is easier ... Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and see how a short film is made ... you will not be disappointed
