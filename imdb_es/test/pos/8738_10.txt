Cactus Flower is what I call a "pizza movie": a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy. Perfect for a night at home with a pizza. Knowing all the lines (and what lines!) Memory only improves enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Like so many others here have re-told the plot, I will simply add the correction that Bergman's character, Miss Dickinson, was a nurse-receptionist, which means she was an expert nurse, and so Both an educated person, not "just" a receptionist. <br /> <br /> Bergman's performance in this film, and the film itself, was largely dismissed, but today's audiences will marvel at his rank; not only the impeccable comic moment, but the ability to make us believe that his character is not aware of his own feelings and reveals them to Toni and us so clearly. While the general plot increases credibility, Bergman's performance is convincing: honest and absolutely credible. <br /> <br /> He also highlights Jack Weston's performance as Matthau's old friend and co-conspirator, Harvey. No one could deliver a zinger like Weston, and I.A.L. The diamond script gives you a lot. For example: "That is a big, dirty and rotten lie that has class". Weston excelled in characters a little sordid because it radiated a warmth that allowed you to forgive the defects of his characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a rather direct adaptation of the work of Abe Burrows (which was adapted from a French work by Barillet and Gredy). On Broadway, the role of Matthau was played by Barry Nelson. Bergman, by Lauren Bacall, and Hawn, by Brenda Vaccaro. He ran for 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two Tony Awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff, who played Igor). <br /> <br /> For me, the score of the film, written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones. It is another point to emphasize. The main theme (A Time For Love Is Anytime) is played by Sarah Vaughn on the opening and closing credits. It also hints at different arrangements throughout the film, especially when romantic piano music underscores Berman's discourse to Hawn at the record store. Jones also created versions of popular songs of the time (To Sir With Love, I'm A Believer) for nightclub scenes. As with all the elements of the film, there is an enormous amount of talent, taste and obvious professionalism. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, few modern romantic comedies can take a candle to this classic. It's great to finally have it available on DVD. It's time to order a pizza ...
