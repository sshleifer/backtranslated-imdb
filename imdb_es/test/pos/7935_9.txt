Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership, where they worked together to match the image and music, scene by scene. Unfortunately, the sound recording was a disaster, so for once, the devotion to authenticity on the Criterion DVD is counterproductive. Fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the film in VHS (BMG Classics) with an excellent re-recording of the music (by the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare this film with contemporary propaganda films in England, Germany and the United States. Eisenstein's film was made in 1938, in response to the fear of a German invasion; and Olivier in 1943, when a German invasion of England was still expected. Both films are scenic, but in different ways. Olivier begins by showing a theatrical performance of the play at the Globe Theater of Shakespeare's own company, then takes us out of the theater to a more cinematic (though still stylized) stage. Eisenstein's film is cinematic from the beginning, but the dialogue and the discourses are still influenced by the melodramatic acting conventions of the old Russian theater. This works very well for Cerkassov's speeches as Alexander, because part of his work as a prince and military leader was to play a role in public. <br /> <br /> In Nazi Germany, the first major propaganda film was the tedious Leni Riefenstahl. Triumph of the Will, which recorded a great political spectacle: mass crowds that hailed Hitler's speeches. The propaganda in his masterpiece, the film of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is much more subtle, with its cult of the athletic male body that carries the disturbing nuances of the myth of Aryan superiority. But German propaganda films in times of war could also be subtle. Urlaub auf Ehrenwort by Karl Ritter is typical. It shows a young lieutenant letting the men of his company leave with a 24-hour permit before returning to the trenches of the First World War (and almost to certain death). Against the advice of the veterans, he accepts his word of honor to return, although he will be tried and shot if they do not. Naturally, they all return (although some of them scold themselves for it), supposedly inspiring audiences to similar demonstrations of duties for their country. <br /> <br /> In the United States, one of the best propaganda films of the Second World War. It was the Air Force of Howard Hawks. In it, we follow the crew of a bomber that does not match each other when they unite with each other with the experience of the battle, and overcome the obstacles to continue their part in the war. Usually, for Hawks movies, however, their true loyalty is more to each other than to their country. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein has to go back into history to find any Russian military triumph. Ironically, Alexander (like the other Russian princes) descends from the Vikings who sailed the Russian rivers to conquer and rule their own fiefdoms. Then he is a conqueror who repels another aspiring conqueror. Physically, they are not so different (although the actors portraying the German princes were obviously chosen for their ugliness and stupidity). But the real contrast is between the common soldiers. The Russian peasants are as tall and strong as the nobles; while the German peasants who sneak out of the shield wall to kill the wounded Russians are one foot shorter than their masters. There is some historical truth in this contrast. The Russian serfs in the Middle Ages were much better off than their European counterparts, because they could always escape to the desert and clear their own land. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's film also intelligently gives us our first glimpse of Alexander as a fisherman. In the battle with the Germans, he uses his knowledge of the fisherman's ice, as well as his knowledge of his military tactics to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks the shield wall, they are forced to regroup and form en masse on the west side of the lake, where the ice is thinner. <br /> <br /> One of the other pleasures of the Eisenstein film (which most audiences miss) is the historically accurate way in which it portrays the politics of medieval Russia. Cities like Pskov and Novgorod owed their increasing wealth and prominence mainly to commerce, which put the merchants in power, and left the princes until their military experience and feudal taxes were necessary to repel the invaders. In the film, Alexander is shown not only as a military leader, but also as a political politician, who knows how to wait for his time and how to make the most of his popularity after victory.
