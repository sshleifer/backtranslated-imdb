Assy McGee is a show that you really must have a certain age to appreciate. Otherwise, it is likely that you will lose references to the 80's police films and just think that it is a joke about a straight errant. Do you think it's a childish and brainless mood? Go see the Stallone 'Cobra' movie and you'll see what I mean. This show actually has a very subtle humor, which says a lot, both for a program that is transmitted in adult swimming and for a program about a walking donkey. <br /> <br /> All standard genre clich√©s are in place and make Movies like Harry and Cobra Dirt so big and mature for parody. Sanchez is Assy's partner, who, according to gender, is sensible and constantly apologizes for the homicidal behavior of his partner. The chief of police is, of course, a difficult case that spits fire and lives to shout "I want your license plate on my desk first thing in the morning!" The exaggerated, and sometimes completely absurd, way in which the movie "Renegade Cop" of the 1980s was parodied, is well suited to the subject. For example, while breaking a bus robbery, one of the criminals stops to ask Assy: "Hey, where are you going, imbecile?" To which the title character removes the phrase from a single line: "I'm going ... to shoot you". <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for anyone who loves the action movies of the 80s, and has seen enough to understand humor.
