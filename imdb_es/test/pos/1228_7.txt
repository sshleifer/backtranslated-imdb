I'm not here to tell you that "Armored" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. No The directors referred to are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("The Warriors"). Those two assistants were not entertained with details like putting women in their films. It is not necessary to apply skirts. They made movies of guys without mercy. Weapons, many weapons. The men suffered a violent death with a tic of the jaw. His films were like a sap to the head. You want a friend Get a dog. <br /> <br /> "Armored" is a movie for guys. Armored duel trucks? Bloody bullet wounds? Does the money explode? If that does not make the lizard part of your brain excited, then get away. <br /> <br /> At 88 minutes, "Armored" is all muscle without an ounce of fat. We met with six security guards who drive armored trucks, three by truck. The six, led by Matt Dillon, plan a fake kidnapping that involves two trucks. Your mission is someday to deliver $ 42 million from the federal reserve (I think). The idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse, save the cash and then organize a kidnapping. Of course, the police will suspect them, but if they stay together they will overcome it. <br /> <br /> The problem is that one of the six, played by Columbus Short, is an obstacle. First. But he faces the eviction. And he is the guardian of his unfortunate younger brother. He needs cash. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon cheats, begs, persuades retention. There is no blood in anyone's hands. A clean getaway All good, not bad. You will be rich forever. Blue skies smiling at you ... <br /> <br /> Right. <br /> <br /> Everything goes to hell, of course. It's one damn thing after another and the bets keep going up. And almost everything happens claustrophobic inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact, the film is diverted to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay. By chance, I like industrial urban decay. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Matt Dillon, who is the best bad dog. He goes from charming to disappointed, to frustrated, to indignant, to going totally crazy in the course of the film. Love that boy. <br /> <br /> Also, the credit is due to the threatening, throbbing, blistered and totally sinister electronic soundtrack of John Murphy. I guess you've heard some Tangerine Dream albums. <br /> <br /> Also, it's surprising that this is a PG-13 movie. I picked one ?? one! ?? F-bomb in this whole movie about violent thieves of hard men. On some level, I like that. Take the children. <br /> <br /> The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian who made an excellent set on the Budapest subway system called "Kontroll". The screenwriter is a guy out of nowhere called James V. Simpson. <br /> <br /> Many of the people in this movie are just beginning. I am willing to bet that the esteem given to this film will increase as time passes and these filmmakers advance in their careers.
