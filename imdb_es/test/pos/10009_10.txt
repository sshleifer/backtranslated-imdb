I loved this movie from beginning to end. I'm a musician and I let drugs interfere with some of the things I used to love (skating, drawing), but my friends were always there for me. The music was like my rehabilitation. , life support, and my drug. I change my life. I can relate totally to this movie and I wish there was more than I could say. This movie left me speechless to be honest. I just saw it on the Ifc channel. I usually hate having satellites, but this was an advantage of having satellites. The ifc channel shows some really cool movies and without them I would never have found this movie. I'm not a big fan of international films because I think many of them do not. I do a very good job in translating lines. I mean the obvious language barrier that lets you believe what they're saying, but I guess it's not a big problem. I almost never got to see this INCREDIBLE movie. I stayed awake instead of going to bed ... much earlier than usual. Hahaha. I hope everyone enjoys the hell of this movement. I love this movie as much as I do. I wish I could write all this in capital letters, but again it's the rules, I think that's screaming, but it would really show my enthusiasm for the movie. I give three thumbs very high! <br /> <br /> This movie surprised me!
