This program came to Canada through PBS in the mid-90s and really, I really loved it. Even 10 years later, watching the various news networks, I can not help thinking about the cynical manipulation that takes place in the name of the ratings and the various "show ponies" that we all see on television as shown in several episodes of Frontline. The scripts are well written and all the actors have an impeccable comic moment and none of them is hindered by a hint of idiotic laughter. There is a lot of fun stuff here very well executed and we do not need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh at. I do not understand why this show never took off in North America, since it is really a jewel! I was really excited to see the available DVDs, even though they are in PAL format. I thought I would take them to my computer and then I would see the converted files. I took a chance and asked ABC. 6 to 8 weeks later, I had 3 seasons. Even better it worked on my NTSC DVD player. I suspect that any player bought in the last 2 years that makes xvid / divx will play them. Good thing! 10 years later, the episodes are very good! You do not need to know anything about Australian politics to get the humor, since everything will be familiar to Western audiences. My wife and I had a 10 day front line festival and we kept laughing a few weeks after seeing the 39 episodes
