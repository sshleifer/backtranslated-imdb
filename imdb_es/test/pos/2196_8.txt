Last year, I fell in love with Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd, so I wanted to see the other versions of this musical and found it in the library. Although I think Burton's is better, probably because I like cinema more than theater, this is still a great production of history. I have not seen any of the other versions, but I'm trying to put them in my hands. <br /> <br /> After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, I can hardly imagine anyone else in the role, but George Hearn does a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is great, as always, and all the singing is fantastic. I found myself singing along. This is a work that you do not want to miss, but try to see it before you see the movie version so you do not have a partial view like mine.
