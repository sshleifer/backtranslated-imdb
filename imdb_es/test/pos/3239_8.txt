I can not comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the soundtrack will be released, the work of Ilona Sekacz is truly lasting. Twenty years later, I continue to be moved by the disturbing themes of this production and I return to it frequently. <br /> <br /> History surrounds the entry into the society of Catherine Moreland. Catherine, somewhat clumsy and possessed by an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction?), Catherine goes to Bath in the company of Mrs. Allen, where she meets Henry Tilney. She is invited to visit Tilneys at Northanger Abbey, the seat of the formidable (and with some economic challenge) of General Tilney, who has the unfortunate misconception that there is wealth in progress. <br /> <br /> Where mutual attraction mixes with the family Finance, the dispute is inevitable. This, together with the vivid imagination of Catherines, leads her to fear for her safety. His final departure is marred by accusations and accusations of deception and complicity. <br /> <br /> But the attraction between Catherine and Henry resists these tests. Come back to give a happy ending. This final scene is especially convincing, given the incidental music of Ilona Sekacz. <br /> <br /> It may be a "bad" production from the point of view of purists, flashy costumes and unstable performances, but for me it's 88 minutes of happiness.
