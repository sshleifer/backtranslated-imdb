John Ford paid the cars his tribute to a special image, 'Wagon Master' made after two great epics of Indian cavalry ... It is a charming poetic film, full of romantic reincarnation of the pioneer spirit ... I did not have to overcome to the greats who had preceded him ... <br /> <br /> Photographically, it's extremely simple ... The camera moves only once or twice throughout the film, and never when a director has made it move to underlining a shot ... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the stunning crepuscular shots of the women who march tired in the dust behind their cars ... They come and go, while the camera remains motionless and the audience follows being a spectator of the march of history, not a participant in it ... Of course, when Ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically, as in 'Stagecoach', he knows how to do it ... But "W agon Master "is a tender and nostalgic look back ... <br /> <br /> Filled with traditional western songs performed by The Sons of the Pioneers, it tells of the journey from West to Utah (in 1879) of a wagon of Mormon train directed by Ward Bond in the role of Elder Wiggs, and of two young horse traders (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr). And in a series of beautiful images, while the train of wagons fights against the outlaws, the Indians and nature in their struggle to reach the 'promised land', the modest 'Wagon Master' manages to capture the history and legend of the West ... <br /> <br /> The same Ford has said that 'Wagon Master' (of which he wrote the original story) was one of his three films 'closer to being what he wanted to achieve'. <br /> <Ford's career as a Western director was amazing ... More than anyone could use the genre to protect his feelings about family, society and the American way of life ... Ford saw the border as a land to be submitted by a special class of settlers and men of the law whose great sacrifices make the earth safe from those who come after ... These early westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned, and civilized citizens who they followed them must always have them in fear and respect ... Ford westerns often employ flashbacks that emphasize the historical In the authenticity of their approach ... <br /> <br /> In 'Wagon Master', for example, the popular songs in the soundtrack tell us about the difficulties of the pioneers of a century ago, and Ford shows them in almost documentary form ... In a sequence, the train is encamped in a circle and the settlers decide to celebrate r a square dance ... To design a dance floor they have to put boards on the desert sand, and with this ritual celebration Ford shows the defeat of the desert through the metaphor of the approach on earth ... <br / > <br /> It's a lovely movie, full of a wonderful happy optimism, and it's easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfying ?? Does it never break the faith with the mood and style established in the first sequences? But one wonders if the most romantic is what best suits the chosen theme? <br /> <br /> The wagon-train experience must have been one of the most physically demanding and distressing tests a man (with his wife) has ever had? He must have been full of doubts: was I wrong to sell everything and come? How can we hope to survive? How will we face the other extreme? Almost all the other painful steps on the road? <br /> <br /> However, none of these feelings really manifests in "Wagon Master". The trip, as is the general boil, does not seem to be particularly dangerous. It could be, of course, that Mormons were so "high" in the religious spirit that this tended to act as an anesthetic. In other words, his reactions were not those of normal human weakness ... If so, was Ford right and the doubtful were wrong? <br /> <br /> What is beyond doubt is the proper and proper boiling, especially at the first meeting, of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. This is the essence of young lighthearted adventurers, particularly Do you feel about the young Westerners of those extraordinary times? Is it a remarkable relationship and stays lodged in the mind?
