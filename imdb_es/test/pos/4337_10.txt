Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible performance! Unbelievable scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy villains, evil for no reason! The last 30 minutes of this movie could be the best 30 minutes ever filmed, especially in the scene where decent, hard-working citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil motorcyclists and then shooting them, just to be join The children of the neighborhood (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the old woman with the broom? She is sweeping the scum! And if that's not enough, let's not forget how fast the punks surrender after they kill Fraker. I'm laughing just thinking about it. <br /> <br /> I also love the scene of the death of Kersey's girlfriend. He simply * moves away * after watching it explode. Those little things like this make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I do not even mention the strange soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie thanks to Martin Balsam, who I think is one of the best actors in history (and who is the "hit by the" The scum scene is hilarious) and I went with a new favorite movie Thank you, Death Wish 3 for making me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> Some other things I forgot to mention: 1. The strange sound effect after Kersey says "Cash!" When buying your used car. Say ah! It sounds so evil. 2. MANDY Fraker. Mandy! Did the writers run out of hard-guy names? 3. The fact that gangs apparently have an exchange program of "loan and lease" thugs: "I need more boys". And that Mandy has a telephone line that works in an abandoned building. 4. At the end of the film, after Kersey exploits Fraker: is it just me or does it seem that the street gang is about to break into the choreography while they give up? Just watch how they are synchronized after the female punk sounds the "stop" signal. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Nothing encourages me like Death Wish 3!
