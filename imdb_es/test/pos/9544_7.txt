This covers almost all areas of the creative process and traverses the three stages chronologically, with the main focus placed directly on production. There are documentaries that detail more and better cover the other two groups. It consists of illustrations, behind the scenes recordings, movie clips and many interviews. With a run time of just over two hours, the public is entitled to a large amount of information, since this is almost the same duration as the movie itself. One could argue that a large part of the time is spent on people, with the trade and the result of their collaborative efforts second. This is well done, with tight editing. It delves into technology and reveals how certain effects were achieved. This spends a lot of time in physical training, in preparation for combats and so on. You get nice candid shots of the people, the team and the actors alike. The set of 10 Ultimate Matrix discs also contains almost three hours of music, in a simple system, with selection of individual tracks and a Play All function, approximately 38 minutes of BTS material in addition to the title itself, in various functions. The original release, however, has several very brief extras, which include clips from the making of the sequels, a preview of The Animatrix and the Yuen Wo Ping blocking tapes (a full tour of a couple of the greatest sequences of martial arts, with acrobatics). interpreters and almost the exact cinematography, with the same shots and angles of those bits in the effort of the finished silver screen). The language is quite strong, but rare, almost non-existent. I recommend any of the versions of this to anyone who enjoys the concept and / or wants to know how they put the first together. 7/10
