I was not surprised that it was a very depressing and exhausting movie. After all, it's about the impact of war on civilians And it's about the "king of depression", Ingmar Bergman. In other words, many of Bergman's works deepen human misery and anguish, so this film does not seem so extraordinary from this director. <br /> <br /> Although it is harder to see, the last half of The Movie offers perhaps more information about the lower depths of humanity. That's because initially, the main characters (Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow) try to overcome adversity and are basically decent people (although a little stupid). However, as deprivation occurs after deprivation, they (especially von Sydow) become less and less human and more animals, doing ANYTHING to survive. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see it, NO WAY FREE! But, an interesting vision of human nature. <br /> <br /> PS - 1 thing I LOVED about this movie is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche. When the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to have a drink or wine, they finished the wine completely! In most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them intact. It drives me crazy, since I would NEVER leave a $ 4 alcoholic drink without drinking it, unless it tasted terrible or I had an insect floating in it! BRAVO!
