The word impossible has led many to select a particular view with respect to any incredible task. In 1927, it was believed that no man could blow the breath of the Atlantic Ocean. Many tried but failed and some even gave their life to the effort. However, it had to be done, since each challenge must face the same determination. Such is the heart of this film called "The Spirit of St. Louis". The actor chosen for this historical film is none other than James Stewart himself from the United States, who convincingly interprets Charles Lindbergh. Although there are many facets of Lindbergh's life, the segment presented here is his effort to be the First Man to fly across the Atlantic. The story is interesting and, for Stewards fans, they force you to say the least. In search of sufficient funds to build a special plane, for the decisive decision to start the journey on a bleak day in May 1927, "Luck Lindy", as he was baptized, endured huge risks, which appear in this magnificent film. Other notables who helped make this film credible are Murray Hamilton, who plays Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson as Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space and Charles Watts as O.W. Schultz. The total sum of this now famous movie is that despite the scant support in its debut, since then it has become a classic in its own right. Well done! ****
