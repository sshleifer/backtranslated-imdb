This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, captures America's zeitgeist today ... which makes it more fearsome and relevant. The "subversives" (university students, hippies, black activists, academics) are being rounded up by the government and given long prison sentences for what amounts to crimes of thought and social protest. As an alternative to life in prison, these convicted "criminals" are offered three days in "Punishment Park." Your goal within the park is to go to the American flag where freedom awaits you. Not in vain, the option of the Punishment Park is a dirty lie. This brilliant film by Peter Watkins even precedes "Battle Royale" and "Series 7", although its angle of attack is more blatantly political. Filmed in '71, it looks and feels as fresh as anything made today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is clear. The narrative moves back and forth between various groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthy-style trials that condemned them. Today, this film still retains its power. In '71, there was nothing more than anything like it. This is a masterpiece that succeeds in a dozen levels. It has the balls that most people today have lost.
