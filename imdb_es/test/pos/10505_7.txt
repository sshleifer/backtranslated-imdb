A strange beam of light penetrates the bedroom of Dr. Craig Burton (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) when they are making love. Approximately two hours are not counted as they embrace apparently unharmed. Under hypnosis during a session with the psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lamarche (Lindsay Crouse), Craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by extraterrestrials. Sherry resists this idea as absurd and is very happy to pass on to her husband the news that she is pregnant. Surprised after trying to get pregnant for years, Sherry is frightened by Craig's persistence that the fetus is not his ... this is due to a check in his low sperm count with especially high odds that there could be no way impregnated his wife. The uncomfortable and disturbing experiences with the fetus inside her lead Sherry to some frightening discoveries ... her doctor, David Wetherly (Wilford Brimley) finds that ultrasound gives some unusual results of the appearance of the developing infant, but it is Craig who he realizes that he looks like an alien! Sparks are lit by cutting electrical equipment, even turning off the Wetherly pacemaker! Through hypnosis, Sherry reveals the experience of his abduction, but Lamarche believes that his problem is psychological, not physiological. Craig turns to the sociologist Dr. Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif), who does not believe in the theory of the extraterrestrial impregnation of his wife, whose work focuses on the studies of extraterrestrial life and kidnapping. But, Bert is reluctant to help Craig, who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible harm. The tragic results occur when Lamarche and others try to keep Craig from his goals of "cutting the thing" by believing he is crazy. Craig will continue his task trying to drag Bert down this path with him. <br /> <br /> A grim and absorbing story about a man's struggle to save his wife from the harm of beings no one else believes exist. Fortunately, Dourif's character is not a nut, but an intelligent doctor who wants to learn more, but his quest for the truth of aliens is not hostile ... he hopes to learn from Sherry, but he is not incredibly demanding in this. Goal. The story is told realistically ... it's easy to understand why others can consider Craig as a rocker. Vosloo does not take the character too far, but expresses the anguish of his current situation. How can he save his wife from these hostiles and prove to others that he is not crazy? McWhirter deserves credit for the demands of the difficult scenes of abduction in which his unfortunate character is naked at this table being investigated and bothered by these things. Crouse is fine in his limited role, but important as the voice of reason in a situation where his clients seem to be out of control psychologically. The effects of the monsters are icky and effective. I think the movie works quite well and the director Yuzna deserves the merit of restricting himself for this movie, at least. The last twenty minutes, while Craig tries to perform his "removal surgery" with a frightened Bert who observes how the situation intensifies, is scathing. <br /> <br /> You know, the fans of "Fire in the Sky" could discover it. movie.
