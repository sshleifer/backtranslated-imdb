I am impressed that 'Hail the Woman' was done at all; Published just one year after American women won the vote, this turgid drama makes a serious statement against the double sexual standard that judges women's sexual behavior more harshly than men's. <br /> <br /> SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD. A prologue, set in the Plymouth colony in 1621, shows a Pilgrim girl condemned to the duck stool for flirting with a child; The child is not penalized. Now we come to Flint Hill, New Hampshire in the present (1921). Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a bombastic grandiloquent: what we call in Britain and Australia "an annoying God". Beresford is determined that his son David (Lloyd Hughes) become a preacher, regardless of how David feels about it. As for Beresford's daughter, Judith ... well, Beresford is confident that women are not important enough to be more than wives and mothers. Apparently, God told him this personally. <br /> <br /> David's evangelical career is compromised when he imbues Nan Higgins, the local man's stepdaughter of casual jobs. (The character of Tully Marshall is identified in the credits only as the "Man of Strange Jobs," but a close-up of a check reveals that his name is Jake Higgins.) The prejudices of 1921 require that he be simply Nan's stepfather, not his biological father.) To save his son from the scandal, Beresford buys Nan's stepfather with a check. Nan goes to the big city to merge into oblivion like a single mother. <br /> <br /> Judith is naturally dismayed by the limitations imposed by her gender. (Or, rather, by the perception of other people about this). Meet Wyndham Gray (excellent performance of Edward Martindel), an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes. But Judith is engaged informally with local Joe Hurd, who will not tolerate such nonsense. Hurd is played by Vernon Dent, a burly performer who is now remembered only for his comedy roles (as Harry Langdon's second banana, and as a villain in the Three Stooges films). He gives an excellent performance here, in a role outside his usual range. Unfortunately, in real life, Dent spent his last years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Judith ends up working in an orphanage. In 1921, I expected the orphanage to be only for whites, so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out that it included a Chinese child. (And an unpleasant surprise when used as the butt of a racial joke). The movie makes a strange mistake here. In a Christmas sequence, we see the orphanage's lover reciting "A visit from San Nicol√°s" ... but (in a dialogue) she gives credit to Santa Claus with SIX reindeer instead of eight. This is followed by a brief animation sequence, which shows Santa with six reindeer hooked to his sleigh. I suppose the animators (either by accident or to save money) left out two reindeer, and the title card revised the poem to coincide with the error. <br /> <br /> Lloyd Hughes was generally an insipid and unimpressive actor. His most famous performance is his role in "The Lost World," where he is easily overshadowed by a brontosaurus. For his climactic scene in 'Hail the Woman', Hughes gives a memorable performance when he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. In his performance as the father who shouts the gospel, Theodore Roberts has been accused of exaggerating to the point of making his role a caricature. I do not agree: unfortunately, decades after this film was filmed, I continue to find silly 'saints' exactly like this man ... ready to destroy the lives of everyone around him, and I am firmly convinced that they have the authority to God to do it. <Br /> <br /> In the central role of Judith Beresford, Florence Vidor offers a sensible, realistic and intelligent performance. Normally I do not like Vidor, who used to be chosen in glamor roles, but it was not pretty enough to justify them. Here, the physical appearance of your character is less relevant than usual. <br /> <br /> This whole film is directed in an impressive way by John Griffith Wray, a director who deserves to be much better known. Unfortunately, Wray died at the beginning of the age of television fans, in his mid-thirties: if he had lived another ten years, he would surely have directed several classics of sound. In 'Hail the Woman' there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions: I was especially impressed by a scene in the New England forest, when Vidor and Dent fight in front of a huge tree uprooted. (I wonder where was filmed actually). "Hail the Woman" is about unpleasant topics, but it deserves to be much better known, and I will qualify this ambitious drama 9 out of 10.
