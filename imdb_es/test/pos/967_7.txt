Big Fat Liar is a pretty funny movie. But as I looked at it, I thought of something. Some of the events that occur in this movie are incredible. So really, the movie is a big lie. There's no way he could have gotten away with all this. Here are all the incredible things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he pretends, his father choked on a meatball and acted as if he was the father. Jason (Frankie Munez) could not have got away with it. Well, luckily for us, he did not. So he did not stay with that, the outrageous. <br /> <br /> 2. Even if the grandmother was blind, she might still have discovered that this was not her granddaughter. <br /> <br /> 3. They could not get on the plane, fly to Los Angeles, act like they were clothes sellers, sneak into the studio, and then, and then ... Well, something from the movie is a little incredible. But it does not hurt to say a little white lie. Trust me, I do it all the time. <br /> <br /> The fat liar, although incredible at times, is fun. It is also very fun. But let me say one thing before continuing with this review. If Paul Giamatti was not in this movie, it would really stink. It would be terrible. Big and fat liar is also quite funny, although cheesy at times. I give it a thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Fat Liar: *** / ****
