"In Love and War" is a simple television movie to feel good, and must be seen as such. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> It's the story of a Second World War The British soldier Newby, captured with his command by the Italians and imprisoned in an old orphanage. When the Italians surrender to the allies, the command is freed and tries to flee. However, the Germans arrive and the command is captured again. Only Newby, injured, remains at liberty. The rest of the film tells how it is hidden and protected by the partisans, and their survival. <br /> <br /> (End of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, "In Love and War" is a refreshing and direct movie. Half comedy, half romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. The 'atmosphere' is warm and sunny, and the various stereotypes (the desperately disorganized or romantic Italians, the Germans with severe serious looks and the phlegmatic and pragmatic Britons), although they are not original, remain comical. Nicola Piovani's musical score also adds to the Mediterranean flavor. <br /> <br /> Although it is far from being a "Tea with Mussolini" or "La Vita E Bella", "In Love and War" is a simple sweet movie that will put a smile, and maybe even a little tan , in your face.
