I think John Houston's "The Dead" is a true classic. Not only was Houston the last movie, but he was quoted as saying that "everything I know about making films is in this movie." The story, intimately adapted from "Dubliners" by James Joyce, is a great piece together with excellent performances by Angelica Houston, John's daughter, and a cast of English and Irish actors who bring the story to life. This is a film that should be part of any serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but because the story is timeless and very attractive. The film is not hasty, nor is it loaded with action. Rather, the story develops from within the characters, who bring light and meaning to the dialogue. The end of the film is impressive, poetic and disturbing. I recommend "The Dead" without reservations as one of the best movies ever made.
