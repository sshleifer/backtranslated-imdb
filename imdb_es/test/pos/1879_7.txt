The man with the screaming brain is certainly not a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure he never pretended to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, which means that it works as a kind of summary of his whole career: slapstick, Sarcasm, cheese, action and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, unequal: there are many things in history that do not make much sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts simply because a female brain has been implanted?), And some of the scenes resemble retreads of others, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William fight for control of William's body, is taken from Evil Dead II). There are, however, many little touches and non-secuitists that feel rather bright, like when William is at the height of his panic and screams at a statue, "What are you looking at ?!" The movie looks like an original Sci-Fi Channel, probably because it was. The acting is pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; She was ruthless and cunning, yes, but she seemed to have a tragic air about her at certain times that history never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard role of "awkward assistant" admirably, and Bruce is amused as the arrogant, sardonic and condescending American imbecile. (Now that he is writing his own films, one would think he would take over a role in which he has no longer been typecast). Man with the Screaming Brain is a strange and absurd B movie that should be enjoyable for anyone who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.
