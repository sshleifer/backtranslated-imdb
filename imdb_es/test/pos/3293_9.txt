This story has had a special place in my heart for the past thirty-one years. As a child, I enjoyed the stories of men from the mountains and the desert. Books like "Call of the Wild", "White Fang", "The Frontiersman" and "My Side Of The Mountain" influenced me greatly. I wanted to live as much as a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more than that, when I saw this film on television in 1975. I wanted to be like "Trapper". However, as I grew older I discovered that I was too domesticated to live like this. However, I still romantic about living that kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this film in that the story has the simplicity that prevails in "Disneyisque" films, but if you can look beyond the mechanics in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the true topics. , then I think you are pleasantly touched. I intend to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-one years, I still feel a chill when I see a torrent of snow running down the side of the mountain and hear the disturbing and rumbling laughter of the Trapper. <br /> <br /> -Good luck, veteran and stay free- <br /> <br /> PS If you want to read more about the real story, I found this link in the Mad Trapper of Rat River: <br /> <br /> http: //www.mysteriesofcanada .com / NWT / madtrapper.htm
