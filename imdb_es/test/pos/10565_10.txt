Woohoo! Where to start? <br /> <br /> This adaptation of the third novel by Sarah Waters is one of my favorite movies of all time! <br /> <br /> I am not very big in fiction novels (seriously I NEVER read fiction), but the book is as fabulous as the movie! Or should I say that the movie is as fabulous as the book? I LOVE THIS HISTORY !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I postponed seeing this three-hour movie (2 part series on DVD, 3 part series on TV / book) for about a year and a half. It just did not look that interesting ... CHILD WAS INCORRECT! <br /> <br /> I immediately immersed myself in the rich and suspenseful plot ... completely captivated! Like the book, you can not stop looking / reading. Get your attention for the full 3 hours ... and when it's over ... you wish it would not. <br /> <br /> The story flows so beautifully and you will be wondering where the time will be. He went. <br /> <br /> The secondary plot of lesbians was just the icing on the cake! The parts I love most are the subtle facial expressions and the looks / eye contact between the two characters. You really feel their desire for each other, and yet they can not act on it ... until they have to. <br /> <br /> I can point out that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the movie, obviously in the heart of the film is a true story of unexpected love, but it's certainly not what it's all about of the movie For me that's what makes this story so unique and intriguing. I have never read or heard anything like it. Sarah Waters is a pure genius! <br /> <br /> The turns and turns you take leave you hanging on the edge of your seat. Seriously! My hands were glued to my couch with every surprising twist of the plot and I even shouted several times ("OH MY GOD! IN NO WAY! THAT COULD NOT HAPPEN! DID IT?") ... I NEVER do that ! /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I wish they had added more of the book. But obviously having the adaptation restricted by time could not add everything that I would have liked. However, how horrible it is ... I think I am now being brutally selfish ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes seem a bit rushed. However, they put all the important parts in the place where, even if you only watch the movie and choose not to read the book, you will be more satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> The actors are simply SUPERBOSOS! Bright even! Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Maud) have excellent chemistry on the screen that makes your TV test. Simply electric! The emotions ... the desperation ... the fight that each of them feels is expressed without effort by these wonderfully talented actresses. Rupert Evans plays a guy as bad as Gentleman. I found myself furious every time he appeared on the screen, but I loved it because it was so damn cute and, somehow, still charming, even if you wanted to twist its neck. Imelda Staunton gives another fantastic performance as Mrs. Sucksby. She is such an affectionate actress that you can not help but love her ... even when the character she plays is not so charming. Everyone else in the cast was perfect! They really represented the characters well and were exactly as I imagined them after reading the book. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for any movie buff! Actually, ANYONE and ALL should see this movie AND read the book. You probably will not be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars from me! There are only four other movies that I have given the same rating. For me it is very rare to enjoy a movie so much that I give it 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingersmith is truly a masterpiece!
