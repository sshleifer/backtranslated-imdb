It is very difficult to portray a Tagore novel along cinematographic lines. And if you forget a dark 1967 production, then it is the first time that Chokher Bali is made on a large scale. In general, the sets looked fantastic with the right touches to make a successful period drama. Prasenjit, so accustomed to doing malicious business things, made a good effort. I saw the Bengali version and discovered that Aishwariya's voice was bent, which made her dialogue a little heard. poor. While the director did a good job of portraying each of the characters delicately, however, there was very little significant plot, probably the lack of the story itself. However, the development of the characters, including those with minor roles, seems to be the goal. The strongest point. It is difficult to convert some stories of Tagore into movies, since only the visual parts seem to notice.
