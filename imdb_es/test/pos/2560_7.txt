Better than I expected from a movie sold on the premise of nymphomania and interracial slavery. The music is great, and the cinematography is very much focused on turning Ricci into a Betty Paige garbage trailer and it works. Samuel L. has to shout a lot, so it's good, as well as playing a lot of blues guitar, which looks great. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. I have the feeling that this material under any other person would have been complete s *% #, but instead, he only managed to create his own little and strange niche of transgressive pulp, while still being an effective drama.
