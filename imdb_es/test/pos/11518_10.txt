LIGHTS OF NEW YORK was the first feature film "for everyone", with 57 energetic minutes and directed by Bryan Foy (from the famous vaudeville family). <br /> <br /> The story has two silly hairdressers (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palette) longs for the opportunity of "life in the big city" and getting involved with gangsters and pirate spirit. One of the boys is framed by the murder of a policeman, but is saved at the last moment by a weapon (Gladys Brockwell). <br /> <br /> Much of the story takes place in a nightclub called The Night Hawk. , that is directed by a swindler named Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) who has his eyes set on a beautiful corian (Helene Costello) who is Landis' girlfriend. Costello does a short dance and we hear Harry Downing (who resembles Ted Lewis) sing "At Dawning" in his best Al Jolson style. <br /> <br /> The performance ranges from good (Palette and Brockwell) to awful (Oakman). A couple of actors mute their lines but then continue with the scene. As noted elsewhere, it was intended to be a short 2-reel and was made with a limited budget. However, the quality of the sound is surprisingly good, all the voices are clearly recorded, and there is a kinematic touch in the death of the silhouette. <br /> <br /> The movie was a blockbuster, although it was shown as a silent movie where the theaters were not wired for new sound technology. No one expected this little movie to make $ 1.3 million. He briefly made the stars of Costello and Landis and certainly launched Palette in his long career as a star actor. <br /> <br /> The co-stars include Mary Carr as the mother, Robert Elliott as the detective, Eddie Kane as the street cop and Tom Dugan as a bully
