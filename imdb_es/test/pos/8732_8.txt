CACTUS FLOWER was a charming 1969 comedy based on a work by Neil Simon about a dentist (Walter Matthau) who had an affair with a young free-spirited woman (Goldie Hawn), totally unaware that her devout nurse / assistant (Ingrid Bergman ) she is in love of him. Matthau can play this role while he sleeps and it does not disappoint to be the fanatical dentist, Dr. Julian Winston, who is dating a woman but really has no idea that he is in love with another. Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for her brilliant performance as Toni Simmons, the elderly flower girl who slowly realizes she is stuck in a dead end and is not as tenuous as she seems on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this movie was the performance of the legendary Ingrid Bergman as Stephanie Dickinson, the completely devoted assistant of Dr. Winston, who is willing to bury and sacrifice her own happiness as long as Dr. Winston is happy with Tony. Bergman is luminous in this film, she looks absolutely beautiful (although the camera has always loved her) and shows an unforeseen gift for light comedy. Yes, the dialogue and the adjustments are a little outdated, but the story is timeless and the performances of the stars make it imminently visible.
