I saw this movie many years ago, and absolutely hated it; I could not wait for it to end and I would have left, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this movie, and more, I would say that it persecutes me with its images and music throughout the years. How many movies have I cried and laughed in the movie theater, and then I forget them as soon as I go out on the street, like ... you see, I can not even think of one! More rare are the films like Death in Venice that enter your consciousness and work marine changes. The French like to say that the film is an art, and films like this show that they are right. I give him 10 stars, above 3 that I gave him the night I saw him.
