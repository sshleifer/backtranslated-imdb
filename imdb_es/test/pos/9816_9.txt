This film, based on Pascal Laime's book La Dentelliere, is an acclaimed film with excellent cinematography and expensive Italian language. Set in a Balzac-style scholastic ensemble of the 19th century, it portrays the story of a crazy love story: a man and a woman. There is an infamous line in this gloomy punch-Mussolinni that says: "She does not smell like tomatoes". Slata perfumery of this Italian masterpiece, Scola is director of the stature of Mussolinni: your cake will jump in your strawberries and if you let this director cover you olives like Superman. Do you remember Nietzsche? This will scare you, do not forget to visit the Mussolinni cake next to the Colosseum in Rome, on the other side of Via Appia. This movie will erase your Pampers from the inside out and the outside in, it will make you cry with romantic joy! If you liked Ulises, you will clean it well with these strawberries until the end of the roll. Enjoy!
