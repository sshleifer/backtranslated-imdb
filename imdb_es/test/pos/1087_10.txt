Satya was excellent ... The company was equally good but more polished, probably because of the money earned in previous films. Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining. The dialogue is gritty, raw and, at times, hilarious. Nana Pataker shines once again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority, but the cast of support is very talented. The direction is tense and the story evolves at a satisfactory pace with a very dramatic climax. As a representation of reality, it may be too dramatized, but at the end of the day it is a movie, so the balance is accurate. I have ordered my DVD and I can not wait to see it again at home. As a lover of this type of gangster movies, this is very rewarding and is highly recommended for lovers of Bollywood gangster movies that are not "Yash Raj".
