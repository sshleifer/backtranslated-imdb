Two lucky but astute ladies decided to act as HAVANA WIDOWS sailing to Cuba to meet and blackmail rich gentlemen ... <br /> <br /> This was the kind of interesting comic that the studio produced effortlessly during the 1930's . Well done and very funny, the public of Depression does not seem to have enough of these funny and popular photo dramas. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell are perfectly chosen as fast-talking, frantic women who will go great distances to make a little dishonest mass. Even though Joan has the best brand and romantic scenes, both girls are as talented and visible as they are beautiful. <br /> <br /> The handsome Lyle Talbot plays Joan's persistent suitor, but has relatively little to do. Chubby, the cherub Guy Kibbee appears as the intended goal of the girls. Whether he wakes up to find himself in the wrong bed or chases him through the roof of a Cuban hacienda in his long stays, it's just as funny. Behind him comes a range of character actors: Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne, Dewey Robinson, all equally adept at pleasing the toughest people. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize non-accredited James Murray as the suspicious bank teller with the counterfeit check. This talented actor was taken out of total darkness to star in THE CROWD (1928) by King Vidor, one of the most prestigious films of the silent era. Hopes were high for a great career, but his celebrity quickly faded with sound images. After a long series of small papers and small, broken and destitute parts, his life ended in the waters of a New York River in 1936. He was only 35 years old. <br /> <br /> Although never the star of the first Joan Blondell (1906-1979) and Glenda Farrell (1904-1971), they animated dozens of films in Warner Bros. during the 1930s, especially the eight in the that appeared together. Whether they play gold prospectors or workers, reporters or secretaries, these blonde and cranky ladies were almost always a competition for any protagonist who was lucky enough to share the same billing with them. With a joke or a look, his characters showed that they were ready to face the world, and any man in it. Never as wickedly brazen as Mae West of Paramount, he always had the feeling that, however strong they were, Blondell and Farrell used their toughness to defend vulnerable hearts prepared to break with the right man. While many of the performances of seven decades ago may seem like countryside or devised today, these two beautiful ladies are still animated and daring.
