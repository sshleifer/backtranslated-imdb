** SPOILERS ** In fact, it is based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole" about a gay man who was killed by a GI on leave because of his sexual orientation. The film "Crossfire" is about a violently anti-Semitic GI that, due to its own failures and frustrations in life, faces those of Jewish persuasion. With whom he obviously feels threatened by. <br /> <br /> Getting him drunk in a local mill in DC barley, the sober US soldier, Montgomery, Robert Ryan, sees Joseph Samuel, Sam Leven, and starts to be a bit excessive . Sarcastically, friendly with him. It seems that Montgomery is a little annoyed with Samuels because he is talking to his best friend and friend of GI Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel is also entering, what Neanderthal Montgomery can not, for the young and sensitive GI who is dedicated to the arts, is an artist and painter abroad, about the war, the Second World War, the war that has just ended . In addition to the unstable peace, if that is what it is with the dawn of the atomic bomb, now it is following it in this dangerous and unstable world. What really outrages Montgomery more than anything else about Samuels is that he is obviously Jewish. That more than anything else is enough reason for the racist Montgomery to want Samuels to enter. <br /> <br /> Samules Invites Mitchell to join him and his friend, Miss Lewis, Marlow Dwyer, in their apartment to have a couple of drinks and continue the very deep and stimulating conversation they started in the bar. This has, it seems, very jealous and feels hurt and rejected Montgomery along with his also drunk but somewhat clueless, in what Montgomery's plans for Samuels are, friend and fellow of GI Floyd Bowers, Steve Brodie, later That night I do not invite you Samuels' place. <br /> <br /> With the party already over, with Mitchell and Miss Lewis missing, the two very drunk GIs broke the place unceremoniously. The fact that Samuels, in Montgomery's sickly, anti-Semitic mind, had stolen Mitchell had caused him a furious frenzy. Montgomery and Bowers burst into Samuel's house assaulting his well-stocked liquor cabinet, and Montgomery takes a couple of drinks, against Samuels's strong objections, Samuels' highly expansive and refined wines and liquors, which are very different from the watery and cheap drink that is so unpleasant. Montgomery is used to gobbling up. All this soon provoked a violent and brutal assault on Samuels by the pissed off psychotic and drunkard of Montgomery, with Bowers beside himself on the couch for all the liquor he consumed, which strikes the poor innocent man to death. <br /> <br /> The movie "Crossfire" becomes a long and tedious one, since it's obvious from the start who the Samuels killer is, the investigation of why Samuels, a wounded World War II veteran and decorated, who got the purple heart at the battle of Okinawa, was killed with Montgomery acting as if he were really interested, yes, in finding the murderer of Samuels, who is really himself. This so-called voluntary action by Montgomery to shed the suspicion that he may be the man who killed him. <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even, for someone who presumably considers himself very intelligent, he is stupid in him, constantly opening his big yacht and throwing anti-Semitic and racist epitaphs and insults on the murdered Samuels. ! That only throws suspicion on himself and nobody else. I guess that guy just could not help it. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that Montgomery murdered Samuels, who in his sickly mind was one of "them", even murders his dead friend in fear, for being involved in the murder of Samuels, Bowers! Who in Montgomery's racist way of thinking is one of "us"! Just because he was afraid Bowers would talk to the police to save his pitiful neck and put Montgomey in Samuels' death. <br /> <br /> The detective in the case, Captain Finlay, Robert Young, does not take long to see the lies and obvious deceptions of Montgomerys and then has him ready to have another "friend" GI of his Leroy ( William Phipps), who was the target of all his foolish and racist jokes from Hillbilly, prepared the arrogant creep. This makes Montgomery return to the scene of his crime, where he murdered Bowers, where he was set up. That was all Capt. Finlay needed to make Montgomery panic, when Montgomery saw that the template was up, and run into the crossfire of a police ambush. <br /> <br /> Dated a little now, but very strong in 1947 when it was released. "Crossfire" tackled the horrors of anti-Semitism when, at that time, it remained hidden, and disappeared from view in almost all post-World War II Hollywood films about the evils of racism in the United States and Europe. Even after the Second World War and with what happened to the Jews in it. When the speaker should have been very complete and honest, to make the film public, they deserved so rightly.
