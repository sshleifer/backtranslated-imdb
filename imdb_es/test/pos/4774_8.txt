No doubt about that. This is the animated short that put Uncle Walt on the map of success. When Walt's older brother Roy suggested that the next Mickey Mouse short should include sound, Walt took the opportunity. The result: Steamboat Willie was a runaway success in 1928. After all, it was the first animated track with a synchronized sound track (mainly music and sound effects, since the dialogue was minimal). Not that it looks like a wet blanket, but the short is far from perfect. The pre-1935 animation was squeaky and a little abrupt (but once the team improved and better artistic techniques developed, the rest was smooth navigation) and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the then well-known RCA sound system , or Western Electric Noiseless sound system, but both signatures rejected it, which led Disney to use the system of photophones with which PA Powers was experimenting at that time). The plot (is there a real plot line here?) It refers to Mickey (as the aforementioned Willie) is the pilot of a steamboat, who is terrified by Black Pete (Captain Pete) and decides to have an impromptu session in the boat, using the various animals on board as musical instruments (ASPCA, take note). If you do not think too much about technical shortcomings, Steamboat Willie can be eight minutes of fun (and a piece of history).
