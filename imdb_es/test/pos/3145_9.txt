I saw this last night at the seventh annual home theater festival in New York, a rather tumultuous place that calmed down for this sweet and moving film for two women. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two: one, older and more blind, the other, a twenty-year-old who helps her with her mail, is skillfully established and its depth is evident. <br /> <br /> There are no car chases, explosions or amazing special effects. - only the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of human beings that extend one another to help and be helped. <br /> <br /> Let's see if you can!
