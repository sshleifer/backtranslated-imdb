Jack and Kate first meet the doctor Daniel Farady and then the psychics Miles Straume and show that they have not come to the island with the intention of rescuing the survivors. Locke and his group find the anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis, and Ben Linus shoots him. Meanwhile, Jack's group finds pilot Frank Lapidus, who landed the helicopter with minor damage that can be repaired. Jack forces Miles to say the real intention of why they have come to the island. <br /> <br /> The second episode of the Fourth Season returns to the island, with four new characters, stops the confusing "flash-forwards" and seems that it will finally be the beginning of the explanations that I (and most of the fans and spectators) I hope they are provided in "Lost." Why the government's interest in Ben Linus and how he is informed from the ship are some of the questions I hope to see in the next episodes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
