Thank God for the movie database on the Internet! The first time I got this movie I saw it every night before going to bed and every time I got something different. But no matter how I cut it, it was disturbing. The black and white and all the contractions really scared me. You look at the screen without being sure of what you are looking at, and just when you think you have it, it becomes clear and it is something completely different. The images are VERY disturbing, the razors and straight lines do not fit well in any movie. Even so, every time I saw it, I interpreted it in a somewhat different way (there is no dialogue, you know), so I decided to check the IMdB for the summary of the plot. Boy who pulls me by a loop, I had no idea what was supposed to be God. Now I'm going to see it with this in mind and see what happens ...
