"Nobi" or "Fires On the Plain" is a film that is so excellent on many levels that you can not say enough good things about it. The only thing I regret is not being able to see this 1959 film before. <br /> <br /> Being a kind of film purist, I tend to watch movies for their artistic merits based on dialogue, acting, photography and even efforts to remain faithful to the period in terms of costumes. Ultimately, I want to know if the film is "truthful" enough to reveal the human condition to make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think. <br /> <br /> "Fires on the Plain" is a great film because it creates a portrait full of realistic human reactions to the fires of a great historical catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war on all levels, as any good war movie should be. . The war is horrifying, bloody, destructive. He is also a murderer in the psyche. However, the fundamentals of "Fires on the Plain" is his unrepentant look towards Japanese soldiers. It shows them slowly collapsing under the weight of the superior American firepower and the inability of their nation to wage a war of their own creation. A fatalistic code that encourages death before surrendering is at the heart of this madness. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such an honest and brutal look at the bitter fruits of Japan's military misadventure just 14 years after the end. From what the Japanese call the "Great Pacific War". Ichikawa, reveals what the Germans called "life of war", the plight of the common soldier. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is interesting, because even today Japan is having a hard time coming to terms with its fanaticism during the war. , the subjugation of the conquered peoples, the racism of their war against the Chinese and the war crimes that included the cannibalism of soldiers and officers practiced not only against each other, but also against the Allied prisoners of war. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa produces a clear representation of the victimization of soldiers by a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural pressures. <br /> <br /> This rigorous examination is done skillfully when portraying condemned soldiers as human beings who exhibit, on several occasions, fear, brilliantly. The laconic humor, the dialogue enriched by its scarcity, and a plot whose complexity is disproved by the dark and wild environment. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's portrait is an irregular and painful tapestry of defeated men. The tubercular Tamura, played as an overwhelming and gentle soul by Eiji Funakoshi, is a good soldier who can not abandon his humanity, although he is as frightened and lost as his companions. Before going to a hospital that will reject him for being too healthy, Tamura receives a hand grenade from a superior who, recognizing the hopelessness of his situation, advises Tamura to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Why is she desperately ill? The unit supplied and militarily incapacitated did not receive the order to surrender at the beginning of the film, which is revealing. Ichikawa makes it clear that the war is over and that everyone is simply waiting to die. When Tamura leaves his unit for his desperate search for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his companions digging uselessly for an anti-aircraft shelter. They appear as corpses that look up from their own common grave. <br /> <br /> We see later how the overburdened hospital medical staff abandons dying patients to a US artillery bombardment. Pathetic patients, who crawl out of their huts in a vain attempt to survive, look like pathetic, serpentine creatures that crawl from an omnipotent force. You know they will not survive. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than a defeated army is the one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its companions. While Tamura is teetering through the jungles of Leyte, we find the nobles, the dying and the exploiters. Cannibalism rears its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat each other instead of surrendering to American "canned meat." <br /> <br /> When men talk about surrender, the propaganda of how Americans kill prisoners is countered by a world. Anyway, a soldier who reveals that approaching Americans feed and take care of Prisoners of war because they, unlike the Japanese, respect the brave soldiers who are forced to surrender. <br /> <br /> It is the Japanese who try to die fighting for the emperor long after the resistance has lost all meaning. Those who are willing to fight to the death will be killed. It is the calculation of war. <br /> <br /> After shooting a fellow murderer and cannibal, whom he previously offered his own body as food, the negligent and fatalistic delivery of Tamura also seems to be an intentional form of suicide. His death is a lonely image. Ichikawa was trying to tell us about the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped by the cultural suicide codes of his country? <br /> <br /> If someone watches this movie carefully, it will. See that absolutism and fanaticism is the enemy. Americans are portrayed as technologically advanced people who are willing to use that technology in the form of an inexorable military power, a lesson that transformed Japanese post-war society. Ichikawa's film is not so superficial as to accuse the United States. Ichikawa processes the sedimentary layers of the destructive policies of Japan that created the war and then continue it when all is lost. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons launched on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He does not have to do it. The slow-motion destruction of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japan's immolation.
