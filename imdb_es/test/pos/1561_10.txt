in the story It is a reality mixed with Americana and very original. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is a girl tired of her boring life working on a minimum wage job in New England. Her sordid boss proposes her: she abandons and takes some money out of the register. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short trip, and your Ford Escort shuts down. Then he meets a nice older couple, represented by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have a recreational vehicle and offer themselves gently to help her out. It is not safe for a girl to be alone on the road. Especially I-95. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is very realistic like Alice, and initially lets the character of Judith Ivey help her; buy decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. At first, it's a good vacation for Alice, who hopes to meet her girlfriend, who attends college in Miami. There is an interesting cinematography, since the trio drives the RV to Florida: the rest stops, the soft landscape and finally the beautiful mountains of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Eventually, there's something wrong, and Ivey's character apparently has invented stories about his daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a bit sinister. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the outcome of this movie, but it ends positively while the audience waits in suspense. This movie reminded me a bit of Spielberg's "Duel", although initially it was not so threatening, the moral of the story is that you never know what people think, especially if you drive cross country. Beware!!. You will enjoy this movie.
