This is one of my favorite movies of all time, if you're not in cars, forget it! This movie features 1 of the best muscle cars in Australia, the XYGTHO. Yes, the performance is not the best, it was never done to win an Oscar. The action of the automobile will keep you coming back for more and more. There's a fantastic collection of heavy trucks from the 70's and an Awesome '57 Chev, with a really cool cat handling it! There is also a really great song sung by Terry Serio, the main actor. The acting is quite funny when taken lightly, but the main focus of this film is smoking and dragging. Big, fast cars with lots of steel (NO PLASTIC TROLLEYS), and some dragged down the street. I recommend it only to the people who are in the cars and not to someone who is looking for a great performance.
