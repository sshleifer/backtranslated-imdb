Forget about Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this clever comedy of errors. I suppose that only institutionalized sexism explains why this movie and Stanwyck's other big Christmas story, "Meet John Doe" are not revered with the same level of love that ... well, you know what his name is. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall type rag who has been lying to him for years for his pompous editorial about the folk ambience of his recipes. She is an ace b.s. Artist until the day the Morgan sailor is taken out of the ocean after 18 days afloat and 6 weeks of recovery in a Navy hospital. Launched the last year of World War II, the film is full of subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia, but it never gets submerged in sentimentality. Stanwyck is sexy and daring as always and meets her partner in the hunky Morgan with whom she is love at first sight. Unfortunately, she has to play married to the Gardiner architect who has actually been looking for her hand on her farm in CT, just to fool her boss. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall adds a lot of bad-tempered and double-entender Hungarian humor as support for Babs' true source of culinary talent, and Una O'Connor is hilarious as Gardiner's disgusting Irish housekeeper.
