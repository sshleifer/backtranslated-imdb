This is a very noir episode. It begins with Jim's return from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney, daughter-in-law of John Huston, who knew some things about the black movie) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen enters the house while Jim picks up his daughter from the back seat and takes her to his room. Then he discovers that Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course he calls Dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of Karen, but they find their neighbor next door murdered in the bushes. So, of course, that makes Jim an immediate suspect. <br /> <br /> This is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by Rocky and he asks Jim to review the story once again. Rocky suggests that by telling Jim the story, he may remember a small detail that he did not think was important at the time, but could now give us a clue to what happened. It's a really well-written scene and completes the transition from the Rocky character of a player to a worried parent. It is also a good way to show that Rocky is not just a disoriented old man. As he says: "You come to me because I am your father, and I am more intelligent than you!" This is one of those moments when we see that Jim got his intelligence. <br /> <br /> This episode also features an appearance by hottie Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the series "Dark Shadows" and went on to play Laura Banner, Bruce's wife in the series "Incredible Hulk" A few years later. It looks great here. <br /> <br /> This episode also marks the first mention of Minette's crime family, a name that would continue to appear in the Rockford Archives almost whenever they needed a family of gangsters. This time, it's Vincent Minette whom Rockford helps stop. <br /> <br /> Lieutenant. Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance in the series and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant who was in the previous season one episodes to a police Sargent. I guess they thought it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly, they were right, although I prefer the last lieutenant Chapman to Lieutenant Diehl. <br /> <br /> Not much of the typical "Rockford" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.
