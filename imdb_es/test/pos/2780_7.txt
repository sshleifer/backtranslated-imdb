I present to you many students who now sign up for the exchange of students in Barcelona and they disappoint me when they do not have such an exciting time. <br /> <br /> The movie was nice. Of course, it is always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou. <br /> <br /> However, I have a very strong problem with part of the movie. The lesbian companion tells Xavier that women like to be physically mastered (which I do not agree with) and shows him some kind of movement to grab the ass that is guaranteed to get a woman. Xavier then tries the back grip on a shy married friend, who starts by saying "no no," "I'm married, I'm married," but then somehow succumbs to the hold? Suddenly she is moaning "yes, yes" and they are doing it in the banks of Parc GÃ¼ell. I found this really very offensive. It is also very stereotyped. How many times have we seen scenes where the woman says "no" but obviously does not say so? It does not mean no. Grabbing the ass / physical domination is not going to do it right. He simply fully supported the stereotypical myths of rape. <br /> <br /> I was not even sure how to read the next scene in which the lesbian rejoices over how it worked and how next time I was just going to demand "Suck it, bitch" (or something like that). Did he really think that forcing a woman who did not respect his feelings was the way to go? <br /> <br /> This section really ruined the movie for me.
