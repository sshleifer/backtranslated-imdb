This thriller is one of the few (movies) surprises I've had in a long time. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, with whom I spoke when I was in the theater said it was horrible ... but then I thought ... none of these people really understand the horror / thriller or metal rock movies, so WHY TO DO IT? I LISTEN TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE ????? This movie is great, but ONLY if you are able to understand and enjoy this type of entertainment. In short (too late): see it with an open mind and you could open your mind. ... the soundtracks are also great ...
