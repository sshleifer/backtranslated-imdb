I tend to get mad when I hear about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Very often he is classified as a filmmaker without talent, only to surprise and displease entire audiences with images of pure blood. It is true that his films contain more dirt and explicit diseases as his average American production, but his films are always powerful and the arguments are horribly morbid. Not torturing a duckling is another story! This movie is a pure gem of Italian crash cinema! I dare easily call this film a masterpiece: it is an ancient giallo that includes all the bright aspects of genuine horror. The film shows the search for an inhuman serial killer in a small Italian mountain town. The bodies of 3 young children are found, horribly mutilated. There are quite a few pseudo crazies in the city, but all roads lead nowhere. Among the suspects is a greedy vagabond and a terrifying woman, obsessed with witchcraft and voodoo. As a true intellectual brain, Fulci knows how to find the right spooky tone for his film. It portrays the small city as a claustrophobic and inescapable scenario of macabre events, supported by a vertiginous soundtrack. Fulci also develops himself as a genius narrator here. The script is always one step ahead of you and the complex plot will trick you more than once. In other words, this is a unique giallo (murder mystery with horror bar). The gore is not presented as grotesque and explicit as in the subsequent milestones of Lucio (among them are the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond and the New York Ripper), although some sequences of nausea and difficult to see are still shown. <br /> <br /> Do not torture a duckling is the most convincing and effective achievement that Lucio Fulci has presented and easily ranks among the best Italian horror films ever made. Right next to the masterpieces made by Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The film is fascinating from beginning to end, some aspects of the plot are alarmingly realistic and the tension is adrenaline at all times! A must see for fans of terror and an absolute priority for lovers of Italian hits!
