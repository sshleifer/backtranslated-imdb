I must have seen a different version of the first person in the comments section of the users. <br /> <br /> It's really very good ... Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are very good together. The character of Val Kilmer is very similar to what it was in the novel, although the emphasis is on Gus and Call and the Comanches. We can also see what happened to Call and Newt's mother. I will not spoil it, but it gives me a lot of information about Call's character. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a really convincing job. Steve Zahn had the biggest challenge, I thought, to follow Robert Duvall! There is a lot of action, humor, tragedy. It has something for everyone. I can not wait for the air to come out, my family is jealous. I see it early!
