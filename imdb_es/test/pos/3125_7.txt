This film is about two horse traders who agree to accompany a small group of Mormons across the desert. On the way, they meet a murderous family of thugs who threaten peaceful people and endanger their pilgrimage. <br /> <br /> WAGON MASTER is what I would call a "small" John Ford movie, as it obviously happened. He does not have the budget or scope of some of his other westerns. In particular, this film lacks the well-known stars like John Wayne, but it allows some of the usual secondary characters to occupy a central place. Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Ward Bond, veteran actors of Ford, have been elevated to leading roles and perhaps the one that came out as "the" leader was probably Johnson, although the other two obtained the same amount of screen time and Focus This is not a bad thing, since the movie worked well without the big star, and it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> Now, this does not mean that I loved the movie. It was very good but certainly not perfect. In particular, when it comes to music, you probably love it or hate it. I found the music of the Children of the Pioneers a little clumsy at times. It evoked a good mood, but seemed to dominate the scenes occasionally. I think a little bit would have worked much better. In addition, with his incessant singing in the background, he was still waiting for Roy Rogers to appear at any moment. Another minor problem is that the plot was surprisingly simple and the ending was practically an inevitable conclusion. <br /> <br /> However, and I am pleased to say that there is a 'however', although it is quite formulated and sentimental, the film still worked well. This was mainly due to the good direction of John Ford, as usual, as well as the exceptional performance of Ben Johnson. He was able to provide an excellent anchor for the movie. Another advantage for me is that I saw this in the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another film about Mormon migration. Although BRIGHAM YOUNG was a bit silly and too "holy" in his representations, here the Mormons were less "perfect" and more like real people, with weaknesses and personalities. Oh, and speaking of BRIGHAM YOUNG, it seems that Jane Darwell was the "go to" girl for the Mormon-themed films during this era, as she was one of the main supporting figures in both films. Considering that she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and that she set about 20 years before WAGON MASTER, this is a trick! <br /> <br /> Also, if you want to take a look at the famous Jim Thorpe, he is in a small role in which he plays the impassive Indian dances with Jane Darwell around the campfire.
