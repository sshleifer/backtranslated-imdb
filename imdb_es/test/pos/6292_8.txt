I love! I love Pauly Shore. It seems that some people do not agree. It's humor, and he's not like everyone else. The movie is great I love the story and most of the people in the movie. It's funny from the first time you meet him at school. I like the fact that she chose him over the boy at home. I like that Tiffani Theissan is not a bad girl in the end. All the secrets are revealed. Only the people you want to see stay at the end. (except for those of you who do not like Pauly Shore). Even if he does not like it, there are funny parts, and his family tortures him for most of the movie. She is a country girl who went crazy and needs to be heard. She finally does it. It has the right amount of love and romance. I give it an 8 out of 10.
