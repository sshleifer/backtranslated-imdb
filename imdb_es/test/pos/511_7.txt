It seems to me that many people do not know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the like. What all these heroes (and in the case of the group of heroes X-Men) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue suit) who persecuted vampires due to a personal grudge and, finally, confronting Dracula himself, and for lack of a better boring word. So boring, in fact, that the character was archived and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until it was reinvented. <br /> <br /> David Goyer made a stroke of genius when he took Blade's character and turned him into a dark gentleman dressed in leather. However, he can not take all the credit and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington, who with his distinctive visual style brings out the best in the character. The character of Blade (Wesley Snipes) is quite surprising in this film and mix martial arts with Batman as darkness. Snipes is quite good as the title character and is successful in highlighting the character's duality and inner demons. However, he is a fairly rigid actor in both voice and posture and is only interesting enough for a movie (which is clearly seen in the lower sequels). Kris Kristofferson is also good and really brings the tormented Whistler character to life with energy and a sense of time. N'Bushe Wright, however, is quite weak as a female leader who makes her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is quite funny and manages to do a lot with a secondary character. The German, Udo Kier, should also be mentioned, since he brings a lot of delicacy and style to the vampire race, probably due to his experiences playing with Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance when Deacon Frost stands as one of the best villains on the screen that he may have seen. <br /> <br /> The story is good and, I think, it renews the vampire genre (something that has not been done since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) adding many contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. Saying that the movie has a comic feel does not mean the movie is unrealistic. Far from there. A great effort has been made to make the film look as real as possible. Including the effects that are pretty good for your time. I found that the "dust" of the vampire was a very nice touch. Instead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies, Norrington chose to let the vampires sink spontaneously, which looks great. The fact that the general effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film, which otherwise would have collapsed. <br /> <br /> As stated earlier, Norrington has a very different visual style that sets it apart from the rest. Directors of the following Blade films. Del Toro is almost as skilled, but I prefer the Norrington style. His style gives the film a very special look, but the most important thing is that it gives the film an atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere that works very well in tune with the main character and the story. Along with the visual style, the music also works well and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that probably should have had an 8 on my part, but a few Annoying flaws (which can not be revealed without spoiling the film, suffice it to say that many of them they are located near the end of the film) they make the film resolve with a 7. high. <br /> <br /> 7/10
