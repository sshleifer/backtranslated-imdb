Wow, I think the overall average rating of this movie on this site is incredibly low. There's really no reason why you do not like this movie. "Michael" is a simple romantic comedy, but quite original and easy to enjoy. The plot involves a group of reporters / experts who will examine the mysterious appearance of an angel (John Travolta) in the Midwest. The angel proves to be less holy and more mundane than we might expect, and that is what makes it entertaining. His interest in women and the Beatles gives a new twist to the angel thing. The romantic side of this film involves Michael, the angel who tries to reunite Andie MacDowell and William Hurt. The two may not have the best screen chemistry of all time, but they certainly have enough to work well. Everyone who has rated this movie so low (a 5.4?), Come on! The movie is not so bad. In fact, I found it quite funny and memorable. Sure, it's not the best you'll see, but it's still good. This is a movie that I feel has been noticeably underestimated. It's fun, romantic and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** out of ****
