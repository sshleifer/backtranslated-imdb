I enjoyed this movie and after it's over, it still makes you think about it. I think Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role, although his "death" performance was a bit exaggerated, but as Jeremy Brett did not care. <br /> <br /> This is a good drama and it does It follows closely the Oscar Wildes novel. If you like this movie, then I recommend you watch "An Ideal Husband" with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. <br /> <br /> This movie gives you a great idea of ​​Oscar Wildes' way of thinking. It is remembered how, in a way, Dorian Gray is Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas and Basil Halward is Oscar Wilde.
