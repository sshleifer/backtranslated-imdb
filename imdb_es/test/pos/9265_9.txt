I became a fan of the TV series "Homicide: Life on the Street" at the end of the series, but I became a fan very quickly. It was a police program unlike any other: visually different in its use of handheld cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multi-ethnic and multi-racial cast and its varied and fascinating personalities, and covering all the good and bad of a police department, including corruption crashes and personalities that surface. <br /> <br /> Homicide: The Movie, the follow-up to the reunion, is as good as a movie made for television. After Lieutenant Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the cast members of the series returned to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film. The intensity and the fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series. In short, an excellent movie for television. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
