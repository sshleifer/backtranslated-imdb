Rajkumar Santoshi tests his hands in comedy and succeeds. One of the few good films that involves Salman Khan. A very funny movie from start to finish. All the characters contribute to the film and believe me, there are many of them. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Viju Khote, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Talsania and more. The direction, the editing, the sound are not up to par, but that still does not matter, because the actors more than compensate that part.
