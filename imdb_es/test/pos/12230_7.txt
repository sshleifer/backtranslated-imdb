"A Fare to Remember" is a totally derivative film, almost ridiculous, but it has a warmth that makes it a very effective and optimistic holiday movie. It stars Challen Kates, a pretty pretty newcomer, as a high-powered advertising executive who, just before her wedding, has to run from L.A. to Seattle to support a client who has rejected all other submissions. She has transportation difficulties from the beginning and apparently has no money. This is the first silly thing: were there no ATMs somewhere? She must make a fortune. In any case, he meets a taxi driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless man, and he takes her to his presentation and, when he emerges with a huge box of dried meat (the customer's product), is there to take her to the airport . All flights are canceled, so to get to L.A. for her wedding, she hires him to take her there. <br /> <br /> On the way, they unite and learn from each other. It's a very sweet movie, although there's absolutely nothing new in it, it combines "Six Days and Seven Nights" and some other movies. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they are nice and the acting is good. Look for Jerry Springer as the head of the Karl Malden dry meat and cameo company. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch during the holiday season. It is in all life.
