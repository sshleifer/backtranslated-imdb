The Beguiled is one of those unseen movies in the careers of a director and / or actor that ends up playing better than expected. In the same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel collaborated on Dirty Harry, they also worked together on this little psycho-sexual drama set in the country of the Confederation of the Civil War. It's almost 180 of what 'Harry' had for the public. Here is a movie that is under the radar, and on a low budget for almost no business compared to what Dirty Harry did. It is also a story where Eastwood is not surrounded by a world full of dangerous men but women who, despite their first appearances, have darker sides. And there is even a romance between some of the most difficult and complex scenes. But in this kind of frame to make the film, Siegel actually has a little more freedom to do things with the style of the image that extends to something more European; It reminds me here and there of Polanski's work in the 60's. Everything works, although quite well, even with the initial doubt that these two male film figures (Eastwood, the obvious and Siegel having achieved his niche in the B- noir and low budget thrillers) can achieve material that could be made for a movie for life. <br /> <br /> It was also captivating and very funny to see Eastwood's performance working with these girls. He is doing something a little subversive in his performance by continuing to have the kind of machismo of Eastwood, if there is something so close to his clich√© image, being one step ahead of this small school for young women sometimes and not in others. . Seeing Eastwood in a performance like this, like in Play Misty for Me (Eastwood's other 1971 work), shows how great she can act credibly with very good actresses. Particularly here are the four main female characters, each of different ages and each with different attractions for their man 'Yankee'. While Siegel's work directing all actors has its moments in the first half, in reality, once the story crosses half of the dream sequence (less successful than the director could be), the real scenes juicy begin to improve. . A lot of this is the best that Siegel directed dramatically, pushing the psychological and emotional edges of the scenes where it was not expected. <br /> <br /> It's a difficult movie, all this praise aside, since it does not paint anyone. for being too respectable, only the character of Hallie, the slave in turn who plays Mae Mercer, is somewhat separate from what happens between the overly curious woman and McBurney. Along with this, Eastood here is acting in a role that is and is not what you usually see during this time of your true formative years in movies. He's an anti-hero here, which was his trademark of the Westerns and other thrillers he was doing at the time. But unlike those films, he is not really in a way that is 'bigger than life', so to speak, as he is a deserter and womanizer, deceiving and complicated even in his most charming and pleasant moments. If it is not one of his best works as an actor, which is difficult to put together considering his catalog, it is worth seeing for fans who want to see his side. It's a credit to him, but also to what he clicked on in his collaborations with Siegel, since they both took a risk at this moment in Hollywood.
