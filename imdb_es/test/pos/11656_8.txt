This film is the story of a Catholic nun as an advisor to a convicted murderer on death row. The film describes what she does as a nun, who has no productive role. She could have had doubts in her real role. But eventually she plays the role that only a nun could do, which has nothing but faith in Christ. In the United States, there are so many movies that describe convicted criminals or jails. Those scenes, especially the execution, are very different from Japan.
