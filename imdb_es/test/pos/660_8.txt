I just saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years. I still find it a nice and romantic film that captures a time that has been lost forever. The innocence and purity of an already distant time, is captured with sincerity in this little film. The performance is above average and the brief appearance of Richard Gere as a war hero Raider Marine, shocked by the commotion, is of great interest to any movie fan or Gere fanatic. Jan-Micheal Vincent is at his best and looks and acts like the "All-American" boy. The late Bruno Kirby (who was branded as B. Kirby, Jr.) has a substantial role as "Pop," a rejector of the Navy Corporation who loves peace, dreaming of returning home with his wife. If you are looking for sex, drugs or rock and roll, this movie is not for you. If you are looking for action and adventure, the same applies. However, if you want to recover a moment in America of innocence, honor, romance and love, then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.
