I must say that I did not expect much from this movie, but it turned out that it was not bad at all. The most surprising, of course, was the performance of Aidan Quinn. I would never expect to see this good actor as an action hero. The good thing about this is that he really builds his character (Annibal). I mean, it was not like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis would do it, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he is really upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some clich√©s were avoided. When Annibal receives his training, you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average American would do in such a situation, ask what the hell is going on and refuse to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional naval officer, he does not give up and tries not to lose his courage, which is quite successful, except for a brief breakdown on Christmas Eve, which I think was very realistic. I'm glad that Aidan Quinn has had the opportunity to show him another face (in fact, two, because he also plays the villain), although the film was not as successful.
