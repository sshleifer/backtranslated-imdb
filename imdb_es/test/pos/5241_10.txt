What some errors for forced dialogue and / or dismiss as archetypal characterizations accurately represent how people talked, lived and were before World War II, much less in the years that "The Big Trail" represents in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie took my breath away the first time I saw it years ago. Reading the tables here helped me understand why it was missing at the box office and why the film attendees got the benefit of Wayne at B Westerns for another ten years. Wayne was, in my opinion, better on "The Big Trail" and the Bs years than most of his stars after 1939 with Ford's incredible cavalry trilogy, "True Grit" and "The Shootist" as great exceptions. <br /> <br /> What a shame the theaters missed the jackpot in this in 1930. If this movie was a hit, we could have enjoyed more movies with more realism and less hokum. In my opinion, this is not only one of the best westerns filmed with a precise dialogue and an accurate performance of the character, but it is among the best representations of a passage of any kind ever filmed. <br /> <br /> breathe away Especially dialogue and precise characterizations of types that simply do not exist anymore. Some celebrate the superficial homogenization of our culture that, in fact, hides the greatest cultural degradation (in "people like us" and "people like them") and the political division (corporatists vs. Main Streetists) in the history of the United States, but for me "The Big Trail" represents a time when our superficial differences were more obvious, but below them, most people wanted to solve the nation's failures and most people aspired to build a great culture and a great nation. <br /> <br /> "The Great Path" It is an epic of the crucible in movement towards the American dream. Certainly, the best movie on that road I've seen. That subject once filmed.
