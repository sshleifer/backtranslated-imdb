This is the plot of "The Shipment", a rural comedy located in the small town of Paradise, Arizona. Despite its simple and classic story, the film (directed by Alex Wright) has its funny moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (as Candy Porter), looking at a Vigorous green pill, says: "What is this? A mint candy?" ? " Or when the girl enters the sheriff's house and finds him completely naked. Or when the delivery of Vigoroso ends in ESO lake, in the final sequence ... The cast offers some good performances: Matthew Modine as the sheriff of Paradise Valley, who still loves his old girlfriend; and by Elizabeth Berkley, whose character still loves her old boyfriend ... The cast of support, including Nicholas Turturro, Paul Rodriguez (like the Mexican Jos√®) and G Michael Gray (what kind of teeth ...), makes be nice work, too. It's not an Oscar material, but it's not that bad. A fun comedy without pretensions.
