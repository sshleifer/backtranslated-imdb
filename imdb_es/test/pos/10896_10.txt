Since I was allowed to play Goldeneye once again, it has been impossible to stop thinking. I'm surprised he could have gone without that. It is, without a doubt, one of the best games of all time. I have never played any other shooting game, but I know that this rule is about everything. Most people blame him for too much violence, but I find it ridiculous. There may be some graphic antics, but there are much worse things. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that it's fun. With an impressive arsenal of weapons like the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Gun, you'll go through several challenging levels of the film, completing crucial objectives and defending yourself from swarms of guards. There are a lot of incredible tricks to get and even two secret levels that you will only gain if you have the real skill. Goldeneye is also one of the best multiplayer games of all time. You can choose several characters from the movie, classic villains from old movies 007 (Baron Samedi, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws), and guards in the game. Chances are that you and your partner (s) laugh so hard while blowing each other out that you will look like Bart and Lisa Simpson watching an episode of the Itchy and Scratchy program. <br /> <br /> So if you do not have the game, do not rent it: just buy it. It's too good to be true. To see great things about Goldeneye, visit the website of Detstar.com Goldeneye. All lovers of James Bond will dig this game in a big way.
