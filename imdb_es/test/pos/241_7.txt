Rita Hayworth lights the screen in this fun, elegant and charming musical starring Gene Kelly. Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker, who dreams of being a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, his career is not getting anywhere in Danny McGuire's nightclub. When one of his fellow dancers says he is going to participate in a Cover Girl contest, he decides to follow his dreams and enter. She reminds the editor of her grandmother, of whom she was deeply in love many years ago. But when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about that. <br /> <br /> I had never seen Rita before this, and I'm so glad I did! She has so much presence on stage and is a very good actress. There are some good numbers here, not the best of any musical, but they are melodic and good to listen to. One thing I did not like was the character of Gene Kelly. I should have supported his girlfriend! But anyway, that is perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie. Cover Girl is a glorious and fluffy film, a perfect escapism. It is not the ideal movie of all, but a wonderful movie, however, due to the power of Rita Hayworth's star. Great movie, really impressed.
