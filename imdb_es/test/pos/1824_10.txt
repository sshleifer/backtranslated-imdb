It was 1983 and I was 13 years old. I saw Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were working. After it ended I wanted to talk to someone immediately. It turns out that my best friend also saw it and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend we would watch him until we could recite it. We wake up his parents late at night laughing hysterically. We begin to adore the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying that this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally. And I understand that the whole talk of Valley Girl becomes annoying, but that was in the 80's. But in the heart of the film, it's a love story and a family story but good. The girl meets the boy and there are sparks from both sides, an instant connection. Julie's friends do not like it: it does not fit, it does not go to school, it does not have money. They like it better with their ex-boyfriend, the soccer player, even though he's an imbecile. She makes the ultimate sacrifice: her own happiness for the happiness of her friends. And she has these really cool hippie parents. It is one of the first films of Nicholas Cage and his first leading role. One minute is absolutely hilarious and the next is incredibly moving and romantic. Your friend Fred is also quite funny. If you were a teenager in the 80s, you will love this movie or at least it will bring back memories. It's not my favorite movie anymore, but it's still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. I'm looking forward to its release on DVD if it's ever released. You can go to the website of Deborah Foreman to sign a petition for its release on DVD and there are two movie soundtracks that are indispensable if you like the music of the 80s.
