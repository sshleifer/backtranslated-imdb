President Harry S. Truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the story you do not know. <br /> <br /> Seven years before, Richard Rhodes' magnificent Pulitzer Prize "Making the Atomic Bomb", the BBC produced a seven-part miniseries, "Oppenheimer", which was a study of the character of the people who designed and built the weapon that marked the beginning of the Atomic Age, permanently linking science and technology to the state (and, in particular, the army), not only making history, but changing the world forever. <br /> <br /> The production is impeccable, the release is absolutely miraculous, not only the main characters, but even the supporting characters have strange similarities with the people portrayed, in particular, Sam Waterston in the leading role of the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project, which was based in the Los Alamos laboratory, New Mexico (the site he personally chose), Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire Manhattan Engineering District (formal name of the project); David Suchet as physicist and final nemesis of Oppenheimer, Edward Teller (who, almost forty years later, whispered in the ear of Ronald Reagan and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - "Star Wars") and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer. The attention to detail is uniformly excellent everywhere. <br /> <br /> In part it's a thriller, partly a love story and, ultimately, a tragedy, this series faithfully recreates a chapter of world history, and that of science, that we dare not To forget. The highest recommendation. <br /> <br /> (NOTE: viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy Jacob Bronowski's 13-part series "The Ascent of Man" and the BBC film about the work of Michael Frayn "Copenhagen" .)
