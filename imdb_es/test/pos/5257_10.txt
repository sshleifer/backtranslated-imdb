Yes, this movie is another remake. Yes, this movie can be considered a girl movie. And yes, this movie is not perfect. The Women is, however, a modern and intelligent update on the social behavior of all women, with an impressive cast of A-listers that includes Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning and Bette Midler. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four main characters, Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and the female creature out of this world who is responsible for most of the drama of the movie, called Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary is trying to deal with her unfaithful husband (who has never been seen in the film), following the advice of her friends and her mother (Candice Bergen). <br /> <br /> Aside from Mary, there is Sylvie who is divided between her social life and her professional life. She has decisions to make that test her moral and ethical values. Then there is the writer Alex, who is a lesbian, with many guts, but knows how to do it with words. And finally, Edie with four girls and another baby on the way, who loves children and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret at the end. <br /> <br /> Together the women live to get revenge, trust each other, and give us life lessons. But it is the cameos of Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher and Debi Mazar that show the cruel and habitual behavior of women. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, is tough, tongue-in-cheek, experienced and yet feels that she could have become what her daughter does later. Hay Fisher shows how to blackmail and prove the limits of selfishness, morality and betrayal. Mazar, the gossip girl, who shows no mercy for what she says and to whom she says it. Leachman, who plays Ryan's daring housekeeper, knows her place, when and where she needs it, and how to offer a good one-line job. Finally, there's Mydler, who plays Leah Miller, a crazy and eclectic but wise Hollywood agent. She is the only character that gives Ryan's Mary a revelation about who she really is when she discovers "what I want". Even though the Midler scene stole the performance and memorable quotes, it was underutilized. <br /> <br /> But going back to the movie, together, the women show the public what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what they want until the time comes when you answer that very own question. It addresses feminism, what it means to be a woman (fierce, ruthless, malicious, cunning, intelligent, astute, intelligent, shy, proud, ashamed, self-conscious, careless, beautiful, strong, independent); and also what women want, why women are the way they are. It's fun, modern and of course not a masterpiece. But the bottom line is that it's worth the money and time to see veteran and young actresses who teach us all about women.
