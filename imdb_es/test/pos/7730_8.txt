I really liked this movie, not so much because of the story (which was good, but it was a bit slow in some places), but more because of the incredibly beautiful landscape of Greece and the Greek islands! Susan Sarandon is completely committed to the love interest and carefree John Cassavetes, a man "on the edge". But the landscape! Oh oh oh
