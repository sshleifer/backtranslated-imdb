The people of Aardman have made a great, beautiful and wild adaptation of their Wallace and Gromit short films to present them as the man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more than the intelligence (or practical sense) for the latter. In this case, they have invented a machine that can capture all the rabbits that are eating the crops in a quiet English town. Particularly for Mrs. Tottington (or 'Totty' for those who are 'intimate'), to the chagrin of Victor Quartermaine, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trusty rifle. Wallace and Gromit seem to succeed with their machine, but Wallace has a confusion: a machine that is made to make more food suddenly crosses a rabbit, the curse is underway! <br /> <br /> A lot of this is about so much carefree fun that a child's movie could ask for, but it also shows off its hat to the oldest tradition in the classic cartoon slapstick: Looney Tunes, who at his Once it is Indebted with a lot of silent comedy and vaudeville. Of course, the guys from Aardman (Nick Park and Steve Box) have a lot of tricks and tricks and wit with their stuff. It is never less surprising to see how they put the stop motion in use, even when a joke or a joke can be a little funny side "ho-ho" not funny "ha-ha" (a tired criticism, but I'll say it). Curse of the Were-Rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its distorted history and its sudden dives in the exhibition (the history of the golden bullet is a stain), Park and Box and company never lose sight of the joy in the material. <br /> <br /> It's fuzzy and warm and completely out of place for children (even the little ones will love the adventures and weird devices, like the truck that Wallace and Gromit drive), and for adults there are small spikes of funky and absurd tones amid a classic English farce. Alone (and, probably, I am a minority opinion here) compared to Chicken Run is almost a lightweight job: there are fewer plots than a series of jokes, and of course many word games with bunnies, monsters and carnivals. and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their pistols, like the Fiennes with Quartermaine's voice). But when it's better, it's one of the most entertaining movies of 2005. It gives me a big silly smile at any time on TV.
