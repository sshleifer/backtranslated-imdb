I really enjoy the Surface show. The show is very entertaining and it is a clean show. A surface like Show is interesting. It keeps my attention. He has compassion and suspense. I love all the cast members who are in the program. All of them are very good options. I think it's very important to have the right cast of Any show because that's what makes any show a success and, of course, the scenes and the show itself. Television has changed a lot over the years. It has changed in good and bad ways. I love watching some comedy, action, suspense and romance. And scifi. But Surface is a program that I hope will come back for many seasons because it is a great program and it is something families can see. My children have grown, but my husband and I enjoyed watching this kind of shows. I appreciate your time and let me comment my opinion. <br /> <br /> Thanks. <br /> <br /> Paulette Blackwell
