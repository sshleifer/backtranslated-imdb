Tempest by Paul Mazursky: interesting, strange and strange movie about a crisis of middle age. Located in New York and on a remote Greek island with John Cassavettes as a world-renowned architect who decides to leave. He is accompanied by his daughter (Molly Ringwald) and lounge singer (Susan Sarandon). A beautiful transfer of this 25-year movie on the DVD, but without extras, not even the theatrical trailer. Tons of wonderful landscapes and a dialogue of great clarity make this film of 2 and a half hours an interesting trip. Raul Julia and Gena Rowlands complete a strong cast. A good drama mixed with comedy, tension and almost madness. It's worth renting this recent DVD release. B +
