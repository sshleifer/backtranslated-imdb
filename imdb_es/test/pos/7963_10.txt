How often do we live our romantic life like on the big screen, with torrid affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never, if what I see as normal life around me is something to judge. The romances, as stated above, are almost never matters that shake the earth and leave you on top of the world or batter and bruised. <br /> <br /> Romance, in its daily form, is lived millions of times in the whole world, it is a slow, subtle and calm matter. Something that grows in you, very slowly, probably without you even noticing that it is slowly taking over your being. Nobody can tell me when I'm in love. Because if someone did, I would not believe him anyway, because nobody but I would know. And even then, it's just a feeling, a certain knowledge that you're feeling this exalting emotion. That you only want the best for someone, that you would never want to see him suffer a moment of sadness. That you are willing to have great pain for them. I would not dare to say that he is willing to die for his loved one, because we are all human and do not know what we are capable of facing death until that moment arrives. <br /> <br /> Is the love between the main characters of the film, so subtle and discreet, no less noble than that of Romeo and Juliet? The unexpressed emotions, the unsaid feelings, convey much more than the repeated cries of "I love you". The moderation shown by the main actor, who is so moving in the scene in which he observes his love interest through the window of the caf√©, although he never moved to make himself known, was simply moving. Would most of us be selfish enough to remain hidden, knowing that their emotions and feelings could not be reciprocated? <br /> <br /> On another note, how will I deal with my own certain death? While I can affirm that I have been seriously ill, I can not say in all honesty that I was ever close to death. Will I be so calm, putting all my affairs in order and leaving instructions for others to take what I left behind? I suspect that I will be calm, because I will have no choice about it. Can I be so disinterested? Once again, the answer will have to be negative. I can empathize with the anguish, knowing that your life is lost, that fate has dealt you a fatal blow and that future events, no matter how little they are left, are no longer under your control. <br /> <br /> Life is nothing more than a series of small events whose culmination may seem grand to some in retrospect. But only very rarely.
