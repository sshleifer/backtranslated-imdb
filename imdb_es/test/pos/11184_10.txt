I had only written a review on IMDb before this, since I think that most games do not deserve the time and effort ... Curse of Monkey Island is different. <br /> <br /> Having played and impressed by Monkey 1 and 2, I had high expectations for the third release ... and it did not disappoint. The first thing that struck me was the graphics substantially improved. Do not get me wrong, for the games made in 1990 and 1991, respectively, Monkey 1 and 2 were innovative and provided good, but CMI comes forward and offers an excellent cartoon style game that is fun and satisfying. . All the scenes and settings have been carefully designed and well thought out, and they adapt perfectly to this type of game. Animation / CGI is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; A fantastic combination in this case. <br /> <br /> For me, the script has been crucial in the success of the two previous games. The CMI script is intelligent, appropriate and, above all, absolutely hilarious. Added to this, the script is now audio unlike the previous two where the speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. The voice of Dominic Armato is perfect for Guybrush: witty, clear and slightly naive. All other voice talents are perfectly suited to their characters, especially Earl Boen, who is the voice behind LeChuck. I loved each and every one of the characters throughout the game: not only their personalities and ingenuity, but also the way in which each character is animated in an extraordinary way. While on the subject of audio effects, the soundtrack deserves a mention. The soundtracks of Monkey 1 and 2 were monotonous and, in spite of this, they were very effective to give atmosphere and to represent a change in the state of mind. The soundtrack of CMI is, once again, a step forward. Each scene is complemented by a catchy, subtle, playful and pirate melody (if it is a word). With a change in configuration or mood, the music also adapts, which adds to the entertainment and fun that the game offers. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​Monkey Island is to solve the puzzles and problems in order to progress. This may sound easy, but in reality it is diabolically complicated in many places. Some may be disappointed by the level of logic and the amount of thought that goes into Monkey Island, but in reality this makes the game even more entertaining and fun, and also increases the value of repetition. The option of "The Curse of the Island of the Monkeys" or "The Curse of the Island of the Monkeys: Mega Monkey" (that involves more complicated and abundant puzzles) adapts to the players of all the abilities and also offers a good reason to play the game at least twice. Whatever level of difficulty you choose, you are guaranteed a different game each time you play again, with numerous voice options and other puzzles to solve that do not affect the outcome of the game, but are there to have fun. The most entertaining section of the game is Ship Combat, and the sword "fight" that follows. These were particularly well thought out and make the game worthwhile. Add to this a great story, non-violent and suitable for all ages, that will keep you hooked and wanting more until the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, to finish, a special mention must go to the designers. of this game. The way in which each puzzle and complex problem is thought is simply amazing. While you collect items and objects during the game, you can not see how each one will help you to progress, but with a little thought and perseverance solutions are presented, and for that the designers of CMI must be highly praised. <br /> <br /> 10/10 for the best game I've played (it's not an exaggeration)
