I was born in Beijing, China and moved to the United States at the age of 9 years. I have lived in Beijing several times since then and loved it every time. One of the many things I love about Beijing is the people and the atmosphere they bring to the city. "You hau hao hao shuo" (which translates more accurately to "if you have something to say, say it right") captures that feeling of Beijing in a lovely and truthful way. I guess I should have lived and understood Beijing and its people a little to make the most of this movie, although I could enjoy it in spite of everything. <br /> <br />> The story is not complicated, intentionally a bit extravagant, and captivating. I'll let it unfold itself and I will not tell you too much, except for a few comments. Every detail, from the images on the wall to the decorations, the streets and the restaurants, feels like home. (Zhang Yimou probably fired everything "in the place"). But the most important thing is that the characters: our "hero", the girl, the "good-hearted but unlucky" laptop man, and the owner of the nightclub are natives of Beijing and adorable. in its different forms. Your conversations really capture the essence of each character. The story, for the most part driven by situations and conversations (except the brilliant bafoonery near the end) is intriguing and always interesting. <br /> <br />> Now I am 21 years old. My parents and I love this movie. We are always so surprised by Zhang Yimou's ability to transform ordinary people into credible screen characters, as in everyday life in extraordinary situations. <br /> <br /> "stay calm", different. hilarious significant.
