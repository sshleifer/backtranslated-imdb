This film shows that the system of free enterprise and the search for the almighty dollar transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately, the market determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of wise African-Americans from the street, chaired by a sensible black man who wants to earn money and believes he can sell products telling the truth. But the film shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market and the political system demand that he adapt, which makes him no different from his predecessors. Interesting movie, out of rhythm.
