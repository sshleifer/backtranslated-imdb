"Subliminal cruelty" has to be one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Still, it's extremely grim and bloody, so fans of conventionally correct horror junk should not bother. The film mixes many wonderful images with a lot of sleaze. and gore. It is extremely strange, vicious and disturbing, so weird movie fans will not be disappointed. My favorite segment of "Subconscious Cruelty" is "Human Larvae", which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The birth scene is particularly unpleasant and it is not easy to forget. The last segment "Right Brain / Martyrdom" has to be incredibly harsh and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and creepy torture. We see Jesus Christ captured by three naked women who mutilate him, tearing flesh from his chest, licking a wound in his knee and urinating on him. There is also a statue of Jesus with a projection of a swastika on it. "Subconscious Cruelty" is a really memorable movie that must be seen by extreme film fans. Check it out.
