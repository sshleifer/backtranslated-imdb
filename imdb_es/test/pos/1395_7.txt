Although the video box for many copies of this film says that it is about people who have turned around, this is a total lie. In fact, apart from the opening segment, the movie is not even a horror movie. With its sunken treasure, legions of fish people and mad scientists, it's much more like an adventure movie by Doug McClure. Obviously, this movie is not a work of art, but it's something fun to watch ... Just keep in mind that the beginning is pretty bloody.
