Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have to be one of the best friends to work together. They did a lot of movies together, I think they're both fantastic when they work together in a movie. Sea inside is a fantastic comedy movie that I plan to see. I give the movie 10 out of 10. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau will be remembered when the movies they made together go on television. They will be sadly missed. God bless you both.
