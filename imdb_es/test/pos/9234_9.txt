This is a very funny movie. There is a self-critical iconoclastic tone in the movie that is very attractive. The characters are interesting. The film flows very well and maintains its interest throughout the 1 hour and 50 minutes of the film. The quality of the film is not of the highest Hollywood standards; however, it was assumed that the original film would be made in the genre of a rough punk rock style. The documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the filmmakers is very detailed and easy to follow. The original filmmakers become the main characters of the documentary version of the film. The interviews of the filmmakers and the actors have met in a very entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in the realization of the original film, the final failure of the original project and the phoenix aspect that emerges from the ashes that evolved in this film documentary film. . In my opinion, the documentary (A Texas Tale of Treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film (Waldos Hawiian Vacation). Two thumbs up for a job well done.
