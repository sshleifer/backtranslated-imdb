This was a great movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. You get to the end of the movie and you can not move ... your brain has been removed and shaken (not moved) and returned to your head. Do not plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened. <br /> <br /> Do not come to this movie waiting for the Matrix style that many millions spent on special effects, the special effects of this movie come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they absorb you and they do not let you go during the whole movie. Good acting, great plot ... very nice movie, I can not say enough. Also a very original plot, a lot of twists and ideas that I never would have thought. The end is abrupt and leaves you hanging asking you: was it real? Is this really the end? Good ending, without saying it is bad ... it only leaves you wondering, and a little exhausted. <br /> <br /> Great movie for those who like the action, like a good plot (do not get up to go to the bathroom in this movie, you will be lost and like mental games, because that is exactly what this is.
