Absolutely, I loved the movie. I just saw it and I can not wait for it to come out on DVD. It is a beautifully drawn masterpiece. I am always surprised by the intricately drawn work of the Ghibli studios. <br /> <br /> Others have commented that Sosuke called Risa by name. He never calls his father by his first name unless he is talking about him to someone else. I did not have the impression that Risa was her mother. It was not even mentioned or implied by anyone. It is quite obvious that she is his stepmother. That's why he makes her promise to come home and why she gets so angry when she finds her car empty. His mother must have died when he was a baby because he mentions that Risa took care of her. This, together with his father who is on the high seas, is the reason why he has abandonment problems. Everyone also talks about how mature he is. This usually happens when a child loses a parent.
