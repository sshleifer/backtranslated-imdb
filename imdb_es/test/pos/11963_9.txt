In the 1980s, Savage Steve Holland released three films, two of which are classics of what appears to be a very small genre, absurd teen comedies. The third "How I got to the university" is not up to "Better Off Dead" and this, mainly due to the lack of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (except for a small cameo). <br /> <br /> One Crazy Summer is an underestimated movie, with lots of great characterizations and gags. As a reminder, Savage Steve's films were vilified for being brain dead at that time and after three films, he switched to children's television. We could use more movies like him.
