There is a "Third Man" look at the somber black-and-white photograph of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller produced by Turhan Bey, a former Universal Pictures star during the 1940s. It is a story of jealousy filmed by experts that leads to murder when A famous pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) becomes too possessive with his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and soon intends to carry out a plan to assassinate a man with whom he has an affair. /> <br /> A taxi driver (DONALD BUKA) goes to take the woman's lover to the hotel when he leaves a moment to talk with a worker who is digging in the street. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to silence the sound of the bullet placed on the passenger's head from outside the back of the car. When Buka returns to his taxi, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. <br /> <br /> En route to report the murder to the police, change your mind and decide to change your identity with the dead man who has a US Passport that means that Buka could realize his ambition to return to the United States. The stolen identity plot gets thicker when the man's girlfriend (Lederer's wife) shows up at the hotel to accuse Buka of posing as the dead man. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of plot that viewers have probably seen countless times. but it does a good exercise here, with many tense scenes while Buka and Lederer's wife plan how to escape from the authorities until a final confrontation with the murderer and the police. <br /> <br /> It is extremely absorbent, well made and keeps the interest everywhere with an excellent atmospheric photograph of Vienna that will remind most viewers of "The Third Man". <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
