This is one of the best TV movies you can see. The values ​​of acting, writing and production are first class. The performances are passionate, with Beverly D'Angelo excellent as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes just perfect as the young stallion boyfriend. However, the best part of this movie was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. He showed that abuse can occur in good families; involve good people; and the ruin lives. It is stimulating and entertaining. Congratulations to all those interested in this exceptional film. <br /> <br />
