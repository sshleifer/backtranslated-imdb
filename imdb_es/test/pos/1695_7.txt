"Landscape after a battle" opens with prisoners escaping over a snowy field full of fences, in quite funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But soon we learn to know these prisoners like a mafia, and when they (they are also treated in a humorous way) push a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but soon devotes more to finding books from the rejected camp than to worry about your neighbor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film takes place in a US camp where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi-freedom, semi-camp. A perfect scenario for the study of war criminality, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholicism, pain and human misery in general. <br /> <br /> The cinema takes an important turn. In women, and with them, the film changes light, color and genius. At the same time, it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in the Holocaust. I think a main underlying political issue of the film should be the treatment of humanity to the Jews during and after the world war, and not only to the Nazi exterminations, but to the humanity that let it go, and even forcing them out of Europe after the war. On an emotional level, the film is about the pain and the problem of letting the pain come, how the environment makes the pain difficult and how difficult it can be to share the pain for people with different experiences. <br /> <br /> But the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions, humor, irony and sudden beauty. A couple of times during the film, a gypsy prisoner plays a harp, an emotional melody brutally rejected (speaking in cinematographic terms) by the protagonist. That example picks up an important essence of the style and theme of the film. When it comes to humor, it is very funny how the protagonist loses constantly and finds his glasses, in crowds, in piles of hay, etc. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to understand Wajda's respect for Spielberg when he sees this movie. The great treatment of light can be compared with Spielberg at its best. The intermezzo of Grunwald speaks for itself. At the narrative level, he only takes the film out of the field, but, in a cinematographic way, he makes the film dream and eternal with a deep beauty. Anyway, there is another scene that I can not stop commenting. It's the Christian dinner. Undoubtedly ironic, but at the same time deeply religious, we see the moment of transubstantiation, everyone kneels, while the priest saves the protagonist of isolation to serve as a comic altar boy. His bells make fun of the scene, but they also give him emotion and love. When Nina gets her bread, the sunlight falls on her and the bells sound spherical, it is the highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> The main actors are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect protagonist of Wajda: the reflecting mind that doubts, incapable of putting all aspects of his mind and emotion in life. The beautiful Celinska is acting with a great body debuting in a character unable to express all his interior in his proud movements. <br /> <br /> Those who try to describe everything, often can not take anything into consideration. This is what Wajda handles. His films are very moving, deep or beautifully filmed, but pay attention to the particularity of life and society. A moment of joy for one, is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of pain for the third, a moment of nothing for the fourth. <br /> <br /> There are at least two reasons to pay attention. Wajdas movies from this period. First there is the remarkable free expression of profound political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. The second is the development of a cinematic and narrative language that Kusturica has increased to greatness.
