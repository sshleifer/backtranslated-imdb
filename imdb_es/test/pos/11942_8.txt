I gave this 8 stars a maximum of 10 possible. He had an excellent plot, and Peter Coyote and Michele Lee, like the rest of the cast, did their part well. <br /> <br /> Both Peter and Michele were too much in the tooth for the age their characters were supposed to be, and their children in the film would obviously have been more suitable than their grandchildren. <br /> <br /> I missed the first ten minutes of this movie. , so I do not know how that body appeared after 25 years and went back to Denny Traynor (the character of Peter Coyote), but I had no difficulty in retaking the story. <br /> <br /> Barbara Traynor (Michele Lee) is shocked when her longtime husband, Denny, is arrested for an assassination in Oregon some 25 years earlier, a state that Denny claims was never in her. <br /> <br /> However, as the evidence accumulates against Denny, his story changes. Then, her story changes again and again, until Barbara does not know what to believe. <br /> <br /> Barbara makes a decision, however, to get to the bottom of the mystery that revolves around the fateful time that Denny and A young woman named Sherry accepted a stranger named Wayne Kennedy to take him to a place that ended in murder. <br /> <br /> I found the film entertaining, good rhythm, and kept guessing what had really happened between them. three people. <br /> <br /> From what I saw during the final credits, this seemed to be based on a true story.
