The first season counted practically how all the elements of the Marine Infantry (ie, land, air, helicopters and airplanes) operated as a team. That is the season to which I give the high rating! (It is true that there are still many "freedoms" taken in season 1, but the stories were more credible.) <br /> <br /> The subsequent seasons were a horrible attempt at Melrose Place and Top Gun! <br /> <br /> I was a Marine stationed in Miramar at that time and I remember that they filmed the show in the San Diego area. I was able to talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. <br /> <br /> Rowland's character was ready. <br /> <br /> Brolin's character was good only in the first season. For some reason, he relaxed after the first episode of the second season. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a bit of how the Marine Air Ground team works, then the first season is the one you should see. <Br /> <br /> If you like Melrose Place plots and soap operas with an attempt to merge them with Top Gun, go the last two seasons.
