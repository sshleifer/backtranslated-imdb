I've seen it a few times and I've stuck completely every time. It is very suspense and intense. Describing it sounds boring but it is amazing. It is the kind of film in which you can not miss a thing, but if you absorb it, it stays with you long after it ends. Now that I think about it, I do not even know what Stone was trying to make us see. Only Alan Green's story? I do not think so. It was a look at ignorance, at stupidity, at self-absorption, and at a guy who simply lost control. Maybe he had more grip than the listeners though. I did not like Barry, but he still seemed worried about him for some reason. I was perplexed for the reason why I could not get it out of my mind when the movie ended. I wish I could see inside Olive Stone's mind for this one.
