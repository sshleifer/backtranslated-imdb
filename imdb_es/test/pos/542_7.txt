Anywhere But Here is not exactly new, but the excellent performances of the two leading actresses made it worth seeing. Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills, California, in search of a better life. The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie would rather have stayed in Wisconsin with all her friends and family, and felt that she was forced to go to California with her dominant mother. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) While it is true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give presentations that are so good that they almost make the material look new. Anywhere But Here does not cover any new land, but it has the rare quality of being able to take the abused subject and make it quite interesting. You can also see in this film the most heart-wrenching facial expression in years, seen on Natalie Portman's face when her mother leaves her by the side of the road and watches the car fade into the distance. Particularly notable is the ironic side story that Natalie's mother pressured her to become an actress, as well as a very convincing performance by Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's closest cousins ​​from home. His death is a tragic cliché that is almost always seen in films like this, but the rest of the film compensates for numerous weaknesses like this one. It's not great, but anywhere, but here it's definitely worth checking out.
