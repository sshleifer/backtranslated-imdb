It is a pity that this series has not been remastered and produced in a Warner video or some other professional movie theater. <br /> <br /> Copies of most episodes are available, but they are generally of low quality, being copies of copies of copies. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, there were 92 episodes during its execution, but only 15 are mentioned here. <br /> <br /> Some of the writers of the series, like Richard Matheson, went on to become prominent authors. <br /> <br /> Excellent series, well written, well represented and well produced. <br /> <br /> Michael Weldon, <br /> <br /> Udon Thani, Thailand
