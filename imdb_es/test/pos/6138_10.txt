I saw it on television in 1989 and I regretted not having recorded it. I was very intriguing and suspenseful. It is amazing as events unfold and this man's past reaches it. <br /> <br /> The performance is first class and the story is exactly what the title says ... "twist of fate" ... but no one could escape from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie.
