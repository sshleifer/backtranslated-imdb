One of the most sublime masterpieces in the United States, Morrissey opens the film by sexualizing Dallesandro, with his mouth open, snoring on a pillow. We ask ourselves, are you coming out of a high heroin? We only see his face, then, flash, his body, flash, his naked butt. I can not think of another movie that used this form of flash-blip editing so well to create a hypnotic and drug-addled mood, an editing method that works wonderfully like rhythm and style. After that introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent is discordant: we hope he is a kind of androgynous with a soft voice; instead, he has the voice of a street thug: Morrissey does not feel comfortable letting our assumptions not be controlled. The long opening is very sexy and playful: it is a combination of martial problems, the fascinating kisses of rubbing the lips of Dallesandro and the sexual adventures of the dawn. everything flows together, if not always without problems, then emotionally realistic. <br /> <br /> What I got from this was the same thing that I got from "The 400 Blows" when I saw it for the first time, this is like a continuation of that 20-something story. There is a sense of camaraderie between meat sellers and buyers; When Dallesandro walks down the street in search of men (to fund his wife's abortion), it feels like a secret handshake when children make deals between them. I never found it boring, although nothing happens, nothing happens brilliantly, the boys hanging around, like them, waiting for tricks. The main trick that Dallesandro finds is fascinating to observe, using Greek descriptions and only touching his back, a form of aesthetic adoration of the body by man. It's also terribly funny ("I'm not talking to an empty bed, right?"). It's one of the most revealing scenes in the movie, I think in any movie; Certainly, any movie about sex and sex for sale. When Dallesandro's eyes seem to be red and swollen, we can not tell if it's because he's drunk, embarrassed, embarrassed or all that. <br /> <br /> The conversations in the film are complicated, they do not matter. (The film is silent in some scenes, some of the most touching and beautiful that I have ever experienced). However, when Morrissey chooses to include one, the way he includes it (somehow we put it together), is surprising, like a conversation between Dallesandro and a rookie swindler, and none of them mention the word "gay" or "swindler" . What follows is a scene in which we listen to a couple of transvestites while attending Dallesandro, this only after explaining to the newbie "get used" to work. <br /> <br /> Dallesandro is a subject that deserves attention paid to him, both by his clients and by Morrissey. He is less than effective as an actor, in the sense of acting as an actor, but as far as revealing something is incredible: he is someone that we want to feel immediately, but we go through his experiences, with all its complexities, and he has to try to meet him . It's the kind of blank slate that attracts us, but we can not control it. And, of course, it is incredibly amazing: forgetting everything else, this is in part a testimony to the beauty of the male body, the beautiful torso of Dallesandro and the permanently erect nipples. <br /> <br /> The movie has a devastating scene, but like everything else you can not really master - a girl says she has been raped, and her only personal defense is to say that, if the rapist had only asked for sex I would have courted her, I would have got a better situation. It's breaking The movie has feelings for everyone, but even better than that, it's not merely comprehensive, it actually tries to help us understand human beings, and never dictate what we should understand. He does not despise the people inside the movie. It feels inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter (talks about not having passed the eighth grade at any given time), it is absolutely charming, as it stops at a word ... then it says "woteva" and continues. <br /> <br /> You can learn something deeper from the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients in terms of homosexual relationships than any other case study. Here we have the child who smiles (his upper lip disappears while doing it) when a Korean war veteran, gym bunny, runs his fingers through his hair; It is a scene that feels very deep, this adult man shares something with a younger version of himself: they are not two homosexual men together, or a homosexual man who pays a heterosexual man, is another thing you can not recognize. The questions of sexuality are next to the point. (Never before had such a loving grain appeared). After sharing something emotionally (although with Dallesandro, since he is there for money, he never realizes why he is there, although he is never so sincere, which may be his most disarming quality), "then ... can you help?" The man says sure. "I do not mean my pants!" 10/10
