A fun game ... many twists and turns! (And we were not even baked!) <br /> <br /> I did not know this movie existed until I saw the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD ... (Interestingly, it was there along with the City of Children Lost), and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen) <br /> <br /> The plot makes you think. <br /> <br /> The acting was amazing ... Hank Azaria shows his talent again, Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... (wecis?) <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
