Chicago reporter Frank Quinlan decided to go to Iowa to confirm the existence of a so-called angel. He was not alone. His partner Huey Driscoll and his new colleague Dorothy Winters also joined him. When they reached their destination, they found that the angel Michael was very different from what they expected. However, Frank still persuaded Michael to go to Chicago with them. Then he started an interesting trip. <br /> <br /> Although Michael did not look like a saint, he was a kind and funny angel. In fact, Michael had an irresistible charm for women. Even because of the jealousy of other men, he was involved in a riot. The climax appeared in the pizzeria. Dorothy sang animated country songs for Frank. That was just what Michael wanted to see. But the next day, Huey's dog crashed to death in a moving car. They asked Michael to save him. That would be used to verify if he was a true angel. <br /> <br /> Andie Macdowell shone in this comedy. She also showed her ability to sing. John Travolta again demonstrated his comedic talent. Because of it, Pulp Fiction was still his typical job. <br /> <br /> A comedy that will warm your heart. 8/10
