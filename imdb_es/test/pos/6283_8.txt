I was chosen as The Surfer Dude in the scenes of the beach. He was almost chosen as the muscular guy, since the real muscular man was really late that day. Pauly made my brother and I (the skater in front of the tattoo place) do some live vj stuff from Venice since he was still doing his thing on MTV. This movie is very good too. Would it have been my top 100 if I was not in it ........?
