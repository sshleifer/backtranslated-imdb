The music is by Stravinsky (and not the stupid incompetent Philip Glass) and was written ten years before the unfortunate birth of Glass. The staging is simply extraordinary. Narrative in Japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the Latin version does not have. cf. Terzieff's version. The giant heads and hands are totally justified by the mythical aspect of the story. The accessories and make-up used for the plague are simply a stain. It's Taymor's best work. The singers are very good, especially Terfel. Langridge is quite moving and clean, and Norman finds the right expression, and his beauty is magnified here and finds its rightful place: bigger than life. Simply a necessity.
