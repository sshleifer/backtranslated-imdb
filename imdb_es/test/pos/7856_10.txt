This movie was a surprise. The synopsis of the plot sounds perverse, and stars Clint Eastwood and the great page of Geraldine. I did not know what to expect. There is an opening scene in which the wounded soldier says that the age of 12 years is big enough to kiss and proceeds to give a child a very adult and very adult mouth-to-mouth kiss. The boy takes him to the boarding school where he lives. Take advantage of the situation trying to seduce the director, interpreted by Page, his assistant and another student. Jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue and the macabre merge in this marvelously original story. <br /> <br /> I have read the other comments here and find little to disagree. However, I wanted to clarify a point noted above that there are no sympathetic characters in the movie. I find there is one. The attractive slave successfully resists the advances of the soldier in a scene that works well because it touches the common history of black slaves exploited by white men. Even though her strength and lack of enthusiasm are the sum total of her experience, she is what I would consider a sympathetic character. She, more than any of the other women and girls in the school, has a legitimate reason to participate in what happens at the end.
