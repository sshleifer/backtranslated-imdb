Although it's not half as funny as "Chicken Run", Wallace and Gromit's new comedy "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" (*** of ****) produces more laughs than most comedies live action British director Nick Park, who created the characters of Wallace and Gromit, and co-director Steve Box are based on the old-fashioned, stop-motion animation method, known as claymation, to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough. Side scenes about a monstrous mutant are shot to devour every vegetable in sight. No matter how funny his capricious plot, the heart of hilarity lies in the imaginative way in which Park and company have meticulously constructed characters and arcades of a plasticine brand called play dough. Basically, every shot you see in "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" required patient souls who made small alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a true montage of joy. Hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation that goes back to the silent films of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. The animators of Aardman Studio managed to generate only three seconds of usable images per day. For the record, "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" took five years to be made. The bulky-looking characters, with thumbprints clearly visible on their respective clay complexions, look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and their excessively scathing mouths. Interestingly, Gromit emerges as the funniest character, a beloved dog without a mouth, but an expressively expressionless face that says more than most of the talking characters. Wallace and Gromit are, respectively, maestro and chucho. Like the human half of the duo, Wallace is an imbecile homile without a clue that somehow manages to build machines that do some pretty incredible things. One of the funniest scenes shows the teacher and the dog awakened by a system of hoppers, hatches and contraptions operated by springs that dress and feed them. Meanwhile, Gromit is the animal half. The joke is that Gromit shows more common sense than his master's genius. In spite of how good his ideas and inventions are, Wallace could not succeed without the loyal Gromit lending him a hand. Our heroes run a pest protection business called 'Anti-Pesto'. Essentially, they should protect each patch of vegetables for miles around using an unpleasant-looking device called Bun-Van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits from their soil and places them in a huge glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit do not kill bugs. Instead, they keep them as pets and Wallace experiments with an invention: Mind-O-Matic, designed to turn hares into carrot enemies. This "Frankenstein" approach meets "The Fly" immerses poor Wallace in serious trouble when he exchanges fragments of his brain with that of a rabbit. Not long after, a mysterious and awesome terror lurks the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for all as the 517th Annual Vegetable Contest of the village approaches. <br /> <br /> Initially, Wallace and Gromit appeared in the Oscar nomination of the Park, project of the film school "A Grand Day Out" (1989). Since then, Aardman has released ten other animated shorts, including "Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave" (1993) and Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers Oscar Winners "(1995)." Curse of the Were-Rabbit "differs not only because it represents the debut on the big screen of the duo, but also lasts 85 minutes.The first two thirds of" Were-Rabbit "contain better gags than the last third, but Park and company they never miss a chance to escape, in an adult joke that children will not understand, but attentive adults will appreciate. "Wallace and Gromit: The Were-Rabbit Curse" is a lot of fun.
