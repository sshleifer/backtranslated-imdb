In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and the Jackass series, having a movie made and performed by Americans that goes well, is full of charm and hilarity is almost miraculous. This set has been behind other efforts, the most recent "A Mighty Wind", which was so subtle that it seemed to be a real documentary without the entertainment overlay, but "Best In Show" hits on all the cylinders. He is superbly mingled with some of the best current actors in the United States, Parker Posey, who emanates energy even when he stands still, Eugene Levy is a tolerant man who is not anyone's mat, even when he seems to be (or maybe, 'indomitable rug'). The brilliant styles of Fred Willard, the discrete interpretations of so many others, which is a feature that is not usually associated with Americans or American actors. One of the few funny movies that I can watch again and again.
