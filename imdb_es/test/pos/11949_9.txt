This is the classic mood of the 80s. If you were a teenager in the 80s, this was a summer hit to go see. It was an early look at those super stars now. This and Better off Dead are fun and silly movies to sit and enjoy. Everyone can admit that they had a crazy summer when they were teenagers. Even crazy family and friends like these characters. To be introduced to some of these characters was fun. The guy who is crazy sitting every moment on a radio waiting to win a million dollars, the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and gave a bill to the children after dinner, the twin brothers who do not look anything, and meeting Hoopz was a lot of fun. He may not have won a prize, but it's just a fun movie to get lost in an afternoon.
