This is a very nice movie, well acted. It's funny and sometimes hilarious. The end is a bit disappointing, as it tries to wrap everything in a package too clean. The film is best remembered for its valuable vignettes: the staging of Jane Austen, the camping trip as examples. B & H does not attempt to reflect the prevailing attitudes towards homosexuality and bisexuality. Most of the characters accept sexual diversity enough. In that sense they are happy holidays of the homophobic society. And it is a celebration of a flexibility, a loosening of rigid sexual categories, perhaps a happy omen of things to come.
