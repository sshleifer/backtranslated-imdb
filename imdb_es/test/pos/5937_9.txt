I have enjoyed the two Van Dykes over the years and I was glad to see them again. <br /> <br /> Equally cute and fun and easy to see and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dick was good when I was younger, but I enjoyed it more as I grew up. <br /> <br /> Son Berry has been a great follower in his parents' footsteps. <br /> <br /> Together they form a great team and work well together. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed that I have not found another Murder 101 anywhere. <br /> <br /> I have seen the two that have shown themselves. I hope more because it really is a nice duo to watch. <br /> <br /> Surely you can tell Berry that he follows in his father's footsteps, talks the same way and has the same manners. <br /> <br /> I would enjoy everything you do separately. <br /> <br /> We will make sure to see everything they do alone and together.
