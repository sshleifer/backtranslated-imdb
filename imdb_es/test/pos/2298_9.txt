After reading more of my fair share of reviews for a lot of different movies, I have noticed a certain tendency, people judge harshly what they expect to see. I imagine that if you get into a movie with an open mind, you do not expect anything sure that you will have better feelings towards it, then if you try and look at it but you have previously created standards that you want them to achieve. I try not to be hypocritical. I saw this movie with a very clean and open slate, and I felt very pleased. As it is not a conventional title or a prize, I did not know what to expect, but I really enjoyed it much more than Ninja Scroll. The lovely animation, the deep story and the always cheerful ninja hack-n-slashing combined extremely well with one of my favorite personal animes that has never been done. It's an opportunity and you can come out with a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> - "Before speaking, make sure what you say will be more beautiful than silence" - Chinese proverb
