A year after 'Love your neighbor' he made his I.T.V. He debuted and followed the route taken by 'On The Buses' and 'Steptoe & Son' upon graduating on the big screen, in a photo made by Hammer Films. It opens with a poignant patriotic speech that extols the virtues of the green and pleasant land of England, then cuts to a shot of Eddie and Bill walking down a street, arguing furiously. This becomes a strange sequence of white and black neighbors that destroy their houses. At least the melody of the original theme is preserved (even if it is sung by someone other than Stuart Gillies). <br /> <br /> The local newspaper, 'The Gazette', is organizing a contest to find the best neighbors, the winners of the landing of a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie suggests Joan to enter. The question is, can Bill and Eddie remain friends long enough to win it? That is the main part of the plot. The film is, in general, episodic. A portion rises directly from season 1, namely, Bill and Eddie going to the Club pretending to be in a "union business". Actually they are going to see a stripper (who does not know two girls). Another part of the film has Bill, along with other workers in the black factory (in the series that he was the only one), breaking a strike that Eddie has helped achieve by various tactics (including the fact of being smuggled through the doors in beer barrels). While another (apparently inspired by Powell and Driver 'For The Love Of Ada') sees the talkative mother of Eddie (the gorgeous Patricia Hayes) befriending Bill's father (Charles Hyatt). <br /> <br /> The climax of episode 1 Season 1 reappears in expanded form. Bill, once again, puts paint and a towel to terrify Eddie, but his friends join him, and they dance around a drum containing a naked Booth, so they can pretend to cook it and eat it. Eddie then has to go home naked (surprisingly, there are less nudes here than in Episode 2, Season 2). <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Reynolds and Booths winning the 'Love The Thy Neighbor contest, and taking the cruise together, but there's an unexpected twist that involves Cyril, Joan's crazy brother (James Walk, "Private Dad's Army Walker"), who works as an administrator. <br /> <br /> This is your typical 70s movie comedy, with all the faults that usually prevail in those movies. The laughter is scattered and the interest fades after about half an hour. The cast is augmented by faces known as Melvyn Hayes (cast as 'Terry', a character from Episode 2 Season 1, played on that occasion by Leslie Meadows), Bill Fraser (as factory manager), Anna Dawson, Andria Lawrence (who it seems to have been in all the British comedy films of the 70s, mostly played as nymphomaniacs), and Arthur English. The director, John Robins, was also responsible for the movie "The man of the house". <br /> <br /> The funniest moment: while Eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, Bill paints his face black. The first thing he knows is when the manager's secretary screams in terror. The tables have been changed!
