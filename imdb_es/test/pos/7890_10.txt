I only voted excellent because this movie took two snapshots of Americana: one in 1970 and one for each subsequent year. <br /> <br /> Nothing has really changed. <br /> <br /> Actually, Joe is an imbecile, a stupid big idiot who is angry at everyone else in the world for his own idiocy. This is not really a spoiler, but the key to the film is the great corporate man "never does wrong" who befriends this semi-troglodyte Joe, and gets some kind of ... validation of his intolerance and stupidity. feeling of being wronged <br /> <br /> However, few would say that the merchant's boyfriend deserved to die. And those kids should not have ripped off Joe and Compton. And Joe and Compton were actually getting into hashish and young skin until they were ripped off. A simple movie in many ways, except that in 1970 the city of New York was on par with a battle zone thanks to the care of Nixon and all the money that goes to war in Vietnam. As I write this (2/25/2007) there is a "very long wait" on Netflix for this movie, which makes me happy because I think there are people who want to learn. This was a pretty good snapshot, not exact, a little cartoonist, but actually very similar to the then. And what is scary is that things have not changed that much. Of course, there is no more welfare, but that only means that wage slavery has won. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how millionaires will complain about not making enough money, then they complain that $ 5.15 per hour is too much to pay their people.
