It is a pity that this film has a PG 13 rating, it is really suitable for anyone, although young children may not follow it too well. <br /> <br /> It belongs to that wonderful genre of serious-comic ghost / stories of angels that would have to include everything from "It's a wonderful life" from Capra to "Wings of desire" by Wenders. <br /> <br /> The photography is impressive, the first class, and - wonder of wonders - the tone is encouraging. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the movie. The two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they work out a little too well for my taste. As the director points out in his commentary on the DVD, all the ingredients of Irwin's story are on his nightstand. The symbolism is too small for me. <br /> <br /> But what nonsense! My favorite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to have breakfast in a restaurant. This is practically theatrical in its magic, an ingenious, subtle, playful and positively rhythmic action, along with a surprising cinematography and a sharp eye for the grotesque. <br /> <br /> "Northfork" is fun, touching, magnificent to look at, magical (with previous bookings) and does not have a single pursuit of a car. <br /> <br /> It's a simple nine stars.
