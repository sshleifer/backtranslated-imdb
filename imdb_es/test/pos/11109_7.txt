I always wanted to see this movie and three quarters proved that I had not waited in vain. But what the hell happened at the end? I mean, do not get me wrong, I liked the movie. I definitely felt nostalgic for the realistic and unique city of New York of the 80 that we lost thanks to Giuliani. But another half hour is missing!
