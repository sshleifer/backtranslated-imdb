This show is brilliantly fun! I started watching in 2007 and had never heard of it before. After an episode, I was hooked. I'm never at home to see it, so my wife bought me the full series on DVD. Without stopping to laugh, do I need to say more? I wish he was still on television, because it's definitely worth it and much better than television currently. <br /> <br /> I would like them to make a movie, seriously, they would not go to see her. . Only the name of Kevin James will bring a large fan base to any movie, the guy is (make your stomach hurt) fun. <br /> <br /> It's a really good and realistic show. If you have the opportunity to buy it on DVD, do it, it's worth it.
