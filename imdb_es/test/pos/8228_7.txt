Do a title search on Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is the only movie missing from the list you've seen. One of the 4 films Scott did in RKO during its heyday (1947) the others are always easy to come by. Liberal, Kansas is just southwest of Dodge City and it is a powder keg about to explode among cyclists who drive the long horns towards Trail Street, the main street of the city, and the grass hunters who feed our bellies. It will take a strong man like Bat Masterson to stand between the two groups and put the people in order. I will not say more, except that Scott's movies usually only have one pretty girl and she has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT always played with men you could admire for their sense of honor, courage, good sense and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago, parents could send their children to a Scott movie with the confidence that they would learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN co-stars in this film, playing a good boy for a change. In real life, RYAN was one of the many HEROES OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR who starred in the US movies. How sad is what we have these days. George Clooney teaches our young people that we should sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in Munich and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 derives its moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the crazy left. I wonder how all this develops in Liberal, Kansas. After all, liberal was not a bad word 150 years ago when the city was named.
