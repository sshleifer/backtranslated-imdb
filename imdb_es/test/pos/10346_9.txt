A moving film about a talented woman who struggles with a society and a love that underestimates her structurally. The problems are subtly addressed and are timeless, since many of the difficulties described between men and women still exist in today's Dutch society. This film is a tribute to all modern women without stopping in feminism. Not only the story is well told, the performance and the stage are also great.
