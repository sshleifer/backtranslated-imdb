Charlie Wilson's War demonstrates with cunning veracity how futile wars can be, especially for the same people who spend countless hours and finances to finance them. Virtuoso performances and remarkably memorable characters combined with a sarcastic and unbridled script catapulted the film, directed by the unpredictable Mike Nichols, to the top of the best of the year. Politics has never been so fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texas congressman who is credited with winning the Cold War almost single-handedly. Around a lot of drugs, women and Scots, also has an unexpected interest in the events in Afghanistan and the terrors of the Soviet Union in the eighties. Recruiting the help of Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a renegade covert mission expert from the CIA, and Joanne (Julia Roberts), a wealthy social partner, raises money to provide Afghanistan with the rocket launchers and anti-tank weaponry they need to cause serious damage to the Russian army. . Eventually, in the late 1980s, the Cold War would end and the funds would be reduced immediately, thus eliminating all aid so that the fledgling country can rebuild and recover. <br /> <br /> The performance is exquisite, although it is to be expected of the cast more than done. However, a large part of that must be attributed to the script, which allows each character to be undeniably well developed and memorable. And a big help from that credit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilariously honest. Tom Hanks offers another unparalleled performance as Charlie Wilson, the man who did so many things for so many people and yet remains relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, a character who is vividly boffo both in his physique and in his ironic cynicism; The inimitable Hoffman, once again, shows an excellent range in the characters he plays. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the film, with her generic character and her accent not subtle enough. And then there's the "jailbait" squad of young Wilson secretaries who run around to keep him happy. Directed by the always charming Amy Adams, each supporting role has its happy moments. <br /> <br /> The defeat of the Soviet Union was not an easy task, especially considering the many conflicting objectives between the various political leaders. "Why does Congress say one thing and do nothing?" asks a dissatisfied politician. "Tradition mostly," Wilson returns. Everyone seems to want the Cold War to end, but it is turning a blind eye to the atrocities that are happening in Afghanistan. He makes a trip to the war-torn refugee camps in Pakistan to motivate Wilson, as well as his main financial source, Doc Long (Ned Beatty). Wilson uses strategic ties with committees to raise funds for weapons in Afghanistan from $ 5 million to $ 10 million with a simple command, but the president of Pakistan mocks the idea of ​​winning a war for such a trivial amount. At the end of Wilson's campaign, $ 1 billion is sent to the Mujahedin to shoot down Russian helicopters, the first step toward victory, as Wilson predicted. Beyond the scope of the film, unresolved agitation in Afghanistan led to more, less ignorable problems that Wilson presumably foresaw. <br /> <br /> During the course of the Charlie Wilson War, the main characters travel from the United States to Pakistan to Afghanistan, from Jerusalem to Egypt, but wherever they go, sarcasm always follows. There is a surprising amount of comedy in the film, considering that the political nuances are generally serious. Hoffman provides jokes with almost all dialogue exchanges, just like Hanks, with his naturally ingenious ideals that persecute women. A scene that showed Gust being continuously escorted out of Wilson's office while trying to solve a legal problem with her gang of beautiful girls ("you can teach them how to write, but you can not teach them to grow tits" ") reminds me of a Marx Brothers slapstick routine. <br /> <br /> With the press focusing on the drug charges against Wilson, rather than the important themes of the Cold War and the conflicting desire of the officials to budget His help, It is clear that by the end of the film, politicians still do not realize what is really necessary, and since the script is so smart and cunning, it is possible that some members of the audience can not keep up with all the Intensive dialogue events, but, as shown by politicians who ignore the difference between Pakistan and Afghanistan, is essentially another argument to support Charlie Wilson's point. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie
