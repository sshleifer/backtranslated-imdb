This is one of the best feel-good movies of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading a stellar cast over a small town and a love letter. First of all, the landscape is beautiful, and anyone who watches this movie and does not want to move to this location is crazy. For the cast, Capshaw is impressive as the lead actress who captivates the roller coaster's emotional role. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the "author" of the note throughout the film, and the always charming Ellen Degeneres is very funny. Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the seller of the bookstore are also great. Although it was not successful, the film is great because it is short, sweet and very romantic. 10/10
