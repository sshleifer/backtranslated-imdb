Being from Cornwall and with the history of tin mining, this film is very special to me. Filmed in and around several places in Cornwall, it shows the story of two of his sons who are trapped in a mine with a group of miners. <br /> <br /> The 'hunters' of the title refer to the 'Spriggins' - ghosts of mine children who reside in the mine and are said to bring evil to everything there. The events happen with an American who wants to invest in local tin mining, but when young local Josh is affected by the sightings of a young man's ghost, he and his American "girlfriend" set out to unravel the mystery behind his death. culminating in the rescue of themselves and several death miners almost certain when a new well opens and the Spiggins save them. <br /> <br /> Top film, although low budget and short duration, but worth seeing if you are from Cornwall and / or in tin mining!
