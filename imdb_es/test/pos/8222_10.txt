This TV adaptation was a wonderful vehicle for Bill Irwin to demonstrate his ability to perform physical humor. Against the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer / director, Bill uses his antics to show a variety of skills including hat tricks, pantomime, dance and various physical devices. <br /> <br /> Although a great blow is needed in the entertainment industry and its craft, it is fascinating for people of all walks and ages. <br /> <br /> This work was televised as a PBS special. Bill played a part in the show tonight, but out of context it did not go very well.
