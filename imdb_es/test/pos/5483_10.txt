"In the line of fire" is one of the best thrillers I've seen, it is built and built to a great climax. This movie really attracts you because your heart is beating and you're out of breath from the action. The cast becomes strong performances, in particular Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film is directed by the suspense master Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers do not improve this much, do not miss it.
