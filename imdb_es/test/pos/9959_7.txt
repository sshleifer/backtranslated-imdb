The works of William Shakespeare are classified as comedy, tragedy or history. Some of his most memorable creations, and the most read, give us a nostalgic mood, a kind poetry and a hilarious slapstick. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of convincing depth and gravity. In any case, he was able to write with unparalleled skill and inventiveness, contributing greatly to our young language. So, in what category is The Merchant of Venice? I was very surprised to discover that it is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I had never read it before or seen it, but after seeing this most recent version of the film, I have decided that it is neither one nor the other. This is one of the many questions that the viewer must try to answer by accepting what is clearly a disconcerting and deeply troubling moral tragedy. <br /> <br /> Players present themselves quickly and easily. One of them, in the first place, is Venice itself; Director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the royal city, creating an impressively vibrant and bustling backdrop to the proceedings of the play. In this scenario the young Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) enters, returning to Venice to see a dear old friend, Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems that poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father has died and left any potential suitor a sort of lottery. Waiting on the island property of the fair, there are three small trunks, <br /> <br /> only one of which contains "images of the princess". The one who can guess the correct one, using only blind intuition and the cryptic enigmas written about them, will receive the enormous fortune of the father's life. Oh, and her daughter and her eternal love in marriage, I forgot to mention. Here the light comedy of Shakespeare takes over the film. This element of absurd plot drives the story and also fills much of the movie screen time, as several painfully anxious opportunists arrive on the island, competing with humor and not winning this hand so rich in marriage. But before any of this happens, Bassanio, who lacks financial resources, asks Antonio to lend him three thousand ducats to pay for the long trip he must take to shoot the prize. <br /> <br /> Antonio, himself almost penniless, must grudgingly embrace humility seeking the financial help of Shylock (Al Pacino), one of the countless Jewish usurers who keep the declining economy afloat but are despised and persecuted until the end The jealously Christian majority of the city. Therefore, they live at the lowest point of society, and this is where the two borrowers should go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident in which Antonio insulted him and spat on the city market, and he proudly rebukes this man who, frankly, has a lot of nerves and comes to ask for help. But help him Shylock does it. He even erases any interest on the loan, probably feeling that he has no reason to worry if Antonio can pay him back within three months. Even so, Shylock's only contractual claim is a pound of Antonio's flesh, should he renounce his agreement. This is a disturbing request, no doubt, for Antonio and Bassanio as well as for us. But it seems that despite his justifiable pride, Shylock does not really anticipate such an awful act to occur. <br /> <br /> So here the dramatic bases have been laid. And while the film is going to explore its softer side with its love lottery and its erroneous identities, the grim prospect of the loan itself is still glimpsed. In the end, what will be of this ominous agreement? Meanwhile, we have turns to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has a lot of dramatic weight to carry here, and he does it with convincing firmness and passion. There are times when space is given to the theaters that we have come to expect from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are those in which he internalizes this energy, showing a conflicting personality: honest, sincere and proud, but still, melancholy, vengeful and totally ruthless. This is one of Pacino's most sincere performances to date. And while the rest of the cast plays their roles convincingly and convincingly, it is Pacino who actually owns the film, especially towards the end, when Shakespeare abandons this apparent romantic comedy with a series of a third act. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal much here; all I can say is that it involves the initial loan, a powerful shoe that one expected to fall sooner or later. And it does sometime. By the end, Shakespeare has raised a lot of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly irresolvable questions of faith, morals, law and mercy are presented to us through the final scenes, and although at the end of the curtain the position The playwright may seem clear to some, They are left completely at odds. There are winners and losers in this, but have the winners won their spoils for a good reason, or in a broader sense have they ended up losing too? Has virtue been rewarded, or has it simply been mocked? Has justice been in fact fair this time? At the end of the work, some destinations are painfully clear and are sealed unequivocally. But the audience must be the one that really decides the verdict for everyone involved. And for some, the verdict is still out of the game as well. Comedy or tragedy? The author has cunningly concealed the intense end of the court with a joyful end of light and romantic pats. Are you saying that everything is fine and ends well, or is this your final and ironic condemnation? The humor of the work serves to prepare us very well for such a strong shock. And while it is also what unfortunately prevents The Merchant of Venice from achieving the greatness of so many other works of Shakespeare, it remains attractive, fun and provocative of thoughts beyond measure.
