Surface was amazing, I do not know how many Mondays I survived in school just to think about the new episode of Surface. I loved it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mom to record it for me. I was very upset when I heard that it was canceled, I mean the way he let us hang up. So, you can have your new Fay de Tina comedy (you could not pay me to see that, I think watching the commercials made me stupider). I'm going to miss my dose of Surface Monday night, even if my sister made fun of me. Although, the kidnapped looks good and, still have L & O: SVU (I think, I still have to verify) (I only wrote the 2 previous lines, because they said I needed ten lines).
