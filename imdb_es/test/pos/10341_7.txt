This movie is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of Alan Ladd. This is good in a way because the movie has some interesting things to say, but bad of another because everyone who watches it is hoping that the tough guy that Ladd is going to continue with his usual rhythm will be very disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, Ladd suddenly enters the third roll. It is true that his role is key, but it is small and is likely to be lost in confusion. There are many key roles in the ambivalent script of former journalist Martin Mooney, which affects all political alliances and mercilessly denigrates the candidates of the Reformation. It is the charming and extremely talented Joan Woodbury who unites the various strands of the broad history. Unlike the usual Hollywood production, the plot actually takes place in a series of jumps, just like the films that were later produced by the French "New Wave", although easier to follow here, especially if you are aware of that the original title of the movie was Paper Bullets. . However, some of the film's narrative and character changes are a bit disconcerting, particularly in the role played by Jack LaRue, who has wisely chosen to play the role in a strangely uncommitted manner. One of Jack's best acting jobs, but it's likely that no one will notice, alas!
