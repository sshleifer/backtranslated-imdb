Mickey Mouse is now 75 years old. It was created by Walt Disney, a famous creator, producer, director, etc. I love Disney movies because it's so fun to watch cartoon movies. All in all, I think Walt Disney is the king of creations. Everyone has to love these creations and the Walt Disney movies. Thanks Walt for all the classic characters you made.
