I had never seen Doctor Who before (at least not in a focused way), so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (actually, I should also say "Comedy" in the description of the genre, many twists in the plot are only acceptable because of its comic value), is well written and makes a small budget advance a lot. The human dimension is very strong and attractive, which is very rare in current television programs. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first eight episodes, and # 6-8 were my favorites so far. Even the types of stories that are too easy to fuck (with time travel, saving dead parents and that sort of thing) work incredibly well here. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is a joy to see as the ingenious and carefree, though occasionally grumpy doctor, if they can find a good replacement for him, I will be surprised. But I'm willing to give the new boy a chance. However, there is little doubt that the Eccleston episodes will go down in history as classics. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Doctor and Rose is particularly refreshing. The Doc is much more a father figure to her than a romantic interest, and yet there are romantic innuendoes between them, which however are much more emotional and human than sexual. <br /> <br /> A good show. The biggest drawback is the low budget: a program like this should have better special effects. And I do not know why they do not just use some cheaper effects. In this era, SFX does not have to cost much, just watch the movie for fans of Star Wars: Revelations. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
