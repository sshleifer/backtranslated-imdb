Plunkett and Macleane is an entertaining, fast-paced and refreshing movie. Refreshing because, unlike most other films of the time, it does not strive to give the audience a history lesson or preach pompously; in fact, historical accuracy is almost ignored. This film is not taken too seriously, and seeks to entertain rather than illuminate. Plunkett and Macleane are set in the 18th century, but director Jake Scott offers a take of the 90s. There is action, sex and oath in abundance, and in the inevitable scene of the ball, the aristocracy dances to the rhythm of a disc. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are as bright as ever, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flirtatious fop, are also very entertaining. The film is visually spectacular in some places, and is a mix of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by Liv Tyler with an unstable English accent. In short, if you're looking for a couple of entertaining hours, this is the movie for you. It will not make you think, but I could put a smile on your face.
