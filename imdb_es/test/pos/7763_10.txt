A Must See! <br /> <br /> Excellent positive African-American love story. This movie reminded me to watch old black and white movies with my dad. Characters more faithful to life that seek love, are in love and lose it. Ancient history fresh view. Larenz Tate was so Cary Grant in style since the character may have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor prevented him from looking silly and like a cut cardboard. Nia Long has always been one of my favorites, she's sweet even when she's tough, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best works and shows that he is better than always playing an angry black man. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic, excellent, well-written performance, a true love story set in Chicago, and more. Can you ask? <br /> <br /> SuperB Black Love Story <br /> <br /> Amsterdam, The Netherlands
