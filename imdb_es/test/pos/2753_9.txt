The show is BIG. There are no words to describe it. Wonderful music Incredible dance The editors could not spoil it, not because they were * not * bad *, but because the program is really * that * good *. <br /> <br /> The editors are compulsive cutters, you can not see A scene without a cut for more than 15 seconds. It's okay to show several angles, but those guys worked with several cameras for the first time in their lives, and they'll remind you how many cameras they have every five seconds on average ... They manage to film the start of a jump with a camera, then cut it in half and shows the rest in another angle. <br /> <br /> No matter how much they tried, they could not spoil that wonderful show. It is a must for lovers of dance and music.
