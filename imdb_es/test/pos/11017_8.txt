Niagra Niagra certainly was not the best movie I've seen. However, I can not describe how the film made me feel as I watched it and how I felt like it ended and also how I feel about it. Very few movies have such an effect on me. I like them or I do not like them. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may instill fear or fun, etc. This movie did not leave me in a good mood. In fact it made me feel empty somehow. I guess because the lives these two people were leading were so empty in many ways. They had no address. His only address was to have no address. They had many problems to deal with and I think they had to get away from what could not have been a happy life. But on the way, things only got worse. A constant descent from where it started. It was sad because it acted so well and I think it is very likely that we have seen someone in a situation that somehow resembles the situation in which these people were. They could have had a good life if they had any idea how. But Wes clarified that they did not know what to do. So they went somewhere they had heard about. No real objective. They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how to overcome the life that was proposed to them. I felt bad but I could not stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that I would not like if someone played the parts. These two did a great job to the point that they simply did not see the performance. I am very impressed and I want to buy the movie when it is available on DVD. You know. It made me feel a bit like Leaving Las Vegas did. But again he is in a class of his own. It's not a great movie, but it's worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person who has problems, I do not suggest you look at it. I could get depressed. It depressed me and I do not have the conditions that these people had. JimmyJoeJetter
