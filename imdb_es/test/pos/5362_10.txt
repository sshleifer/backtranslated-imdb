This is the kind of movie they used to do, funny, moving, disturbing, authentic, with convincing performances of people without nose work, or tits, or eyes, in other words, real people. Shauna Macdonald interprets the female love interest, and she is so real that at least you want to give her a hug. Imagine that, a real girl in a movie, what's next? Hollywood would hate her, because her freshness is a harsh reproach to all the fake stars in Tinseltown. This story has the same hilarious feel as the classic 'Whiskey Galore' by Sandy Mackendrick, with the gnomic humor of the remote Scottish islanders playing the pretenses of outside intruders and enjoying a little drama from time to time (the real intervals between those times are often quite short). Director Stephen Whittaker shows an unusual ability to achieve this in the right way, and it is surprising to discover that he died before the premiere of his film, only 56 years old, which was clearly a substantial loss for the screen. Ulrich Thomsen does very well when he plays a German rocket scientist who goes to Scarp on the Isle of Harris in the late 1930s to build a small rocket to transport parcels between the islands. There he falls in love with the seductive girl Macdonald, and she has affection. Some wonderfully colorful local characters decorate the story, and the movie is pure delight. Of course, there is the threat of an impending war with Hitler, and we learn that Hitler executed 1,000 rocket scientists who refused to build weapons of war, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far from sight, but lips must remain sealed in a review of what happens in the end. This movie is a great example of the kind of movies that people in Britain should do. But are they being released properly? In a nation whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality TV shows, where the repulsive non-intentions have become national heroes, is there a market for a movie like this already? After all, there is no sex that growls, there are no close-ups of suppurating or genital wounds of anyone, no drugs are taken, no senseless celebrities that deserve to be observed, so one wonders if there is anything. interest an audience that has become so decadent and jaded that only the most extreme sensations can briefly alleviate the tedium of their meaningless existence. Anyone looking for an antidote to the emptiness of contemporary Britain can take refuge in this refreshing and honest film.
