I have never seen the original "House of Wax", so I really did not know what to expect when I went to a preview of the new movie. After a somewhat unstable start to introduce our young characters, "House of Wax" changes gear and becomes an excursion of extremely effective horror. <br /> <br /> The plot really does not matter too much here, I think most people know. Seeing this, these homeless children will meet an unsavory murderer and find some terrible things in the wax house holder. It's about the special effects here, and they're first class. Spectators who like their horror movies with a lot of blood will be satisfied here, but there are other horrible effects as well. The design and production sets are excellent, and the cast makes the most of their written roles. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people are probably wondering how Paris Hilton's performance is. To be honest, Hilton defends herself quite well, and does not introduce herself, as many people predict. Her character is sexy and sweet, and I think her good work will hopefully change the opinions of many people about her. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, rising from her previous film, the atrocious "The Girl Next Door". His character goes through a lot, and Cuthbert proves to be a fighting heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is nice to watch, but unfortunately he is not very convincing as the "bad boy" of the group. <br /> <br /> I predict good things for "House Of Wax" While the audience at the screening I was attending screamed, shouted and applauded in many parts of the movie. Congratulations to the cast and crew for a job well done. <br /> <br /> And a greeting to Paris Hilton for showing that many people are wrong. As she always says: "That's hot."
