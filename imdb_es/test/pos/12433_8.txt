Before watching this movie from beginning to end, I just saw the last half hour. Normally, I do not see a movie if I have not seen it since the beginning, but a friend had it on and once I started watching it I could not stop. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised This movie did not have a great theatrical premiere. This is a rather funny movie (often in a bad mood), and the monster and monster truck it contains are quite threatening. The monster makes Leatherface look pretty, and the monster truck is like a cross between a German World War I artillery vehicle and a giant coffin. <br /> <br /> A shy twenty-five-year-old virgin is on a long journey to prevent the woman he loves from marrying. His ex-best friend accompanies him and he constantly itches. They are threatened on the way by a black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck. They also pick up a hitchhiker, played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks. <br /> <br /> I also saw the animated trailer with comments from the director and the electronic press kit, and I found both interesting. I would bet that the commentary of the film with the director and the two male stars is also quite nice, but I have many other movies to see that I had never seen ...
