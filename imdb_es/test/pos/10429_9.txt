I do not understand why more people have not commented on this, apart from the fact that maybe not many people have seen it. It's an incredible cast of characters, one after another after another, all done by the guy who wrote the play. If you do not like recorded works, you may not like this (after all, the reproductions usually do not look good on TV), but it is a one man program that will make you pay attention at all times. Highly recommended
