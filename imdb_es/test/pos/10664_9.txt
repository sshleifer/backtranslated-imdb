A milestone in film history, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin' is one of the few great films that deserves to be called a classic. It was the image that turned Sergei M. Eisenstein into a film figure at that time. And today, it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema that has always been. <br /> <br /> 'Potyomkin' is a film that NEEDS to be seen as an entity, not to be chosen. Do not just watch the video programs where they only present the sequence of 'Odessa Steps' and then continue with 'Citizen Kane' or 'The Godfather', see it all in its glorious 75-minute execution time to understand and enjoy it. . However, I do not expect all the infinitesimal details to be perfect, I mean that the performance of the silent era of the 1920s makes 'Scooby Doo' look like a master of discreet realism, certain plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequences seem outdated. but it's still a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments of the film are the riot in the battleship, the body of Vakulinchuk falling from the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier, the mother holding her dead son, the baby stroller on Odessa's steps and the lion rising to roar while more killings occur. For every new pair of eyes that look at it, 'The Battleship Potemkin' comes alive once again.
