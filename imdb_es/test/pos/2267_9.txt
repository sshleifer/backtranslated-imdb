2005 was one of the best years for cinema. We had so many wonderful movies, like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A History of Violence ... Soon we also have Brokeback Mountain, King Kong ... But if this year is the only great movie that came All was lit, then no we would lose everything that this year has brought. The first film as director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a charming, touching and moving drama that also presents one of Elijah Wood's best roles. He is perfect as Jonathan, a curious man who goes to Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in World War II. Liev Schreiber, who also writes the film, directs a masterpiece, with memorable scenes and (many) funny quotes. This is a genuine mix of Comedy with Drama, which brings a film that will be discussed within a few years. A serious Oscar nominee, Everything is Illuminated is a powerful, original and, why not say, enlightened film. But there is one thing you must remember when entering the movie: leave behind the normal. This is special .------ 9/10
