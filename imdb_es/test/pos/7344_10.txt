Now maybe it had something to do with the fact that I saw this movie at a low point in my life, when I was really trying to figure out where I was going and what I needed to make myself happy, but this movie really spoke. I. Jane is a common woman: although she has many positive things in her favor, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but was tricked into reaching her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second-choice life. She seeks new challenges and happiness, desperately seeking to fill the hole in her heart. Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane. While we travel with her, we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her despair and, eventually, the strength of her conviction. The beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well launched and is an asset for the production. Allison Mackie is a thief of scenes like a spicy character with an impeccable time. I highly recommend this movie; Although it is low budget, it has large budget production and writing values. PS- Large aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. Women will love the story and the characters, but there is also something for men here. :)
