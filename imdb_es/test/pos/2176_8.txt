I guess this is the first time I've seen a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked his role (title) as a butcher. The way he moves is very funny in my opinion, for example, how he handles his knife and the way he throws a cigarette. I think he's a good actor; his facial expressions really adapt to the role he plays, for example, how he winks at the audience at the end. But one could add that that probably was not too difficult. Anyway, I think I would have deserved a longer race. As you probably know, he was ruined by greedy journalists who earned money by printing false accusations that said he was involved in a scandal. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very important. In the first half, Fatty and Alum are employees of a store and rivals for the affection of Almondine. After a heavy food fight, Almondine is sent to a girls school by her father, the shop owner. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fatty and Alum enter the school with the load, and the fight for Almondine continues. (Some of the names of the characters are different in the version I've seen, it seems that, for some reason, they replaced the original title cards with new ones.) <br /> <br /> There are many small types like fights of food and fights, but they are well made in my opinion. And there are some jokes that I really liked, for example, how they make the dog run the pepper mill (or is it a coffee mill?), Or the scene where Fatty puts on a coat but obviously it's not necessary, or when Miss Teachem, the director of the girls' school, whips Fatty, and he whips her in the back. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is also funny in this, his first movie; A good addition to the deal. In the first half he is a client of the store, in the second half he supports Alum in his fight for Almondine. I liked his acrobatics, for example, when Fatty pushes him from one room of the school to another, he does not show a simple problem but falls on his hands and his head and does a little pirouette. Beware of a scene in the fight for food: Alum throws a bag of flour, but fails and hits the owner of the store. That makes Buster laugh, which must be a rarity, since it usually always shows a neutral expression (which, as you probably already know, gave him the nickname "The big stone face"). (One more note: Al St. John, who plays Alum, was the nephew of 'Fatty' Arbuckle, and then became famous for the role of 'Fuzzy' that he played in many westerns.) <br /> <br / > I do not like this as much as I like, for example, 'One Week' and 'The Balloonatic' (movies that Buster did later, without 'Fatty'). And it did not make me laugh out loud often, but it made me smile a lot, so I gave it eight points.
