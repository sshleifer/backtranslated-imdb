Unfortunately, due to a slow start, I can not say that this is one of the best films of Hitch. It is very excellent, nonetheless. The film stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to recover their kidnapped son. Both give excellent performances, not surprisingly surprising. However, I was really impressed by Hitchcocks' amazing use of music. The climax at the Opera House was fantastic, and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was a pure genius. Absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene. Also, the use of Doris Day singing "Que Sera, Sera" was excellent. Especially when transposed into scenes at the end of the film. So, this movie for me ends up being the best use Hitchcocks makes of the music I've seen to date. Unfortunately, it had a slow start, or I could have recommended this movie a little more. Even then, it's worth taking a look. 8 out of 10.
