At the beginning of the 19th century, a young woman with a harelip became angry at the ambition of her family and the superstitions of the local community, but she meets a man who can see her differently, and who can change Pru's life forever. . <br /> <br /> Precious Bane is an adaptation of British Broadcasting Corporation of the acclaimed novel by Mary Webb. It is a beautifully filmed piece that has an incredibly high level, the story {script of Maggie Wadey} is excellent, and the period of details and use of the dialect is second to none. It is a pity that this film has not yet been released on DVD, one would have thought that with Clive Owen {great here as Gideon} rose to stardom, the BBC would bring it to light, but unfortunately not, so the only way to catching it is on the rare occasions that TCM shows it. The main performance of Janet McTeer as Pru Sarn is simply brilliant, the guts and genuine emotion go hand in hand when McTeer gives it all. Pru not only has to deal with her facial disfigurement, but also with the constant saws and pain of the ignorant villagers. This is a time when people thought that if a hare ran in front of a pregnant woman, it spelled doom, a time of Bull Baiting, a time of superstitions and witch talks. Despite the constant setbacks, Pru is strong and resourceful, even her own family makes her dreams go back without realizing it, but this road can be terribly bumpy, but hope is eternal, and Pru has high hopes. <Br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
