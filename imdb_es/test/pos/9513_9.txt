As a show, it is difficult to criticize Nihon chinbotsu. The Japanese have benefited from their intimate relationship with the sea, and the concept of the film implies that an entire world and a way of life are in danger, thanks to its volcanic heritage. From the point of view of reality, it is foolish enough to have a drama in which the whole of Japan vanishes beneath the waves; Why only Japan? <br /> <br /> So, let's suppose that we have movie reality, fed by the show (and the popcorn), and some may find this very affected. Compared to the adventures with Japanese radioactive monsters, this is revealed as more mature and with better pace. The emotional element is underestimated, and it really works. (However, he loses a bit with the exaggerated song in the climax). <br /> <br /> Is Nihon chinbotsu credible? Probably not, but the exciting eruptions, and the relaxed pace make for a more enjoyable entertainment than a night awaits.
