He took this 1969 movie on the TCM cable one night. I remember when I saw the film for the first time in Hong Kong, I really enjoyed the songs and performances of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. I love Clark better in "Finian's Rainbow" (1968) by Francis Ford Coppola, along with Fred Astaire, Don Francks and Tommy Steele. Simply delighted to know that, finally, this delicious Irish gold musical is released on DVD! Ah, "it's that old demonic moon (in your eyes)." <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - a great liberation. He may not be a veteran in the musical like Rex Harrison, but he inhabited the role wonderfully. The scene of him running across the lawn in his a-flying cape reminds me of the PBS series, "To serve you all my days": an adorable school teacher and a loving man, he is, "Mr. Chipey. O'Toole somehow gave us the right combination of spunk and circumstance.The songs and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse are catchy as usual.The songs of "You and me" and "Walk the world (with me)" were the ones that They have accompanied me all these years, and there is "What a lot of Flowers", "And the sky smiled", "Fill the world with love", nothing sweet ... Sometimes I think that if the world is immersed in songs and words of Bricusse, we will overcome all conflicts on earth and what "charming" will be all our time! Yes, "talk to animals" too ("Doctor Doolittle" 1967) <br /> <br /> Musicals are a blessing to the world of the spectators, they are somehow bigger than life, just like the music and lyrics of the Sherman Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.) who gave us "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964), who would not be absolutely delighted with just saying "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"? In the Spanish film "Km.0 - Kilometer Zero" (2000), I was surprised even by a single song and dance number. My favorite of all times is "The Girls of Rochefort" (1967), by French filmmaker Jacques Demy, with the colorful cast of Catherine Deneuve and her late sister Francoise Dorl√©ac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Danielle Darrieux, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris singing and dancing. The music of Michel Legrand. Long live musicals.
