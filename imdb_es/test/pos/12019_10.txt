Richard Norton really turns the screen on this martial arts masterpiece based in Portland, Oregon. Norton, an Australian heartthrob, plays the evil Mr. Milverstead, who runs a successful import / export business, both smuggling weapons and participating in the female meat trade. Usually, women are ripped from their favorite dance club with the help of a squad of thugs, the best known of all, which is Bolo Yeung, who plays the role of Ice. Problems arise for Milverstead when a new policeman in the city, John Kim (Britton Lee) leaves to avenge the murder of his dead comrades from the Milverstead organization. If you have time to watch only one martial arts movie this year, do not miss this classic.
