I have seen this movie twice and its subject is stimulating. I have been working with computers for many years and this film inspired me in a technological sense, as well as a new love that stoked the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of falling in love. A very original idea, a great attraction in the way it sustains it, since it tells its history to the minds that need a liberation from the daily realities of this life.
