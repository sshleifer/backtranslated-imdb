This film set the standard for African-American film excellence when it was made. I heard in several stories about the film over time, that there was a boost for an Academy Award nomination when it was released. This movie plays with several emotions, and you definitely feel for all the characters. Of course, part of the performance is a bit of wood, but fortunately, those parts are not fundamental. The music is sensational, and if you do not think the end is a tearful tear, you have no heart in your chest. If you look at "Cooley High", you will see that many, many films have copied several elements to strengthen their own films. The biggest example of this is "Boyz N The Hood".
