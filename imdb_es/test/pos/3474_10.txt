Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he treats a very sensitive subject with sensitivity, but he manages not to let the film turn into something bad. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic movie, it's fun and sad. bits and it makes you see things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see him now: FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent and Dublin has a leading role. This movie will change the way you see people with disabilities and it will also give you a very fun night at the movies. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD.
