I was surprised that I liked this movie. But it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday the 13th. There were a number of elements of cheese, but at the same time there were many great elements. The story line was good: predictable if you've seen more than one or two horror movies, but full of phrases to make it worthwhile. There are some memorable scenes that are worth seeing. Some problems I had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters. For example, in the initial scene, the scarecrows (which were human with stakes, whose blood was drained to grow the crops), seemed very real, but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows with blue masks. There were more than several gaps in the plot, and the performance was mediocre, but at least it sounded like real people talk, unlike Hollywood movies, where dialogue is really false when you think about it. The culmination of the last scene, when the main character says "I'm not a baker, I'm a Connell!" and cutting off the head of the scarecrow is satisfactory, since his friends for the most part have been killed by these creatures at that time.
