The film Haggard is one of the funniest movies of all time. It presents the cast of CKY (the movies) and also has a BIG soundtrack. If you have seen any CKY or Viva La Bam, you will notice that all (of those two) are in it. Including Bam's parents and many other people. <br /> <br /> The story is about Ryan Dunn's girlfriend, Glauren (Jennifer Rivall), who was cheating on him and trying to get her back. He does this by having Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo) vandalize his house. There are many different characters with many different stories. <br /> <br /> There is great music in the soundtrack. Bands like him and her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and the Stooges Pop, and New Order. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Viva La Bam or CKY (the movies) I doubt you like this. If you like those things ... this movie is great.
