These immortal lines begin The masterpiece directed by Jack Starret, 'The Dion Brothers'. The plot centers around two blue-collar brothers from West Virginia (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) who commit robberies in the hope of using the money to open a seafood restaurant. What follows is an adventure, and many comic events follow. The action scenes are all first class and consist of some well-done shootings. The last of which is absolutely amazing and occurs in an abandoned building demolished by a wrecking ball! The film was written by the now famous director Terrence Malick and features an early appearance by Margot Kidder. In short, an excellent hidden gem of the 70s and, easily, one of the best hybrids of comedy and action of all. Hopefully you have a decent wide-screen DVD release soon.
