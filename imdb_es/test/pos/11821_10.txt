I had seen The Cure when I was a kid and I loved it then. Now, years later, I got a copy almost by accident and I saw it again. Being a child, you really do not have the ability to get the things you want for yourself, that is usually the prerogative of your parents, but when I saw it again I felt sorry for not having done more to obtain a copy. of this movie back then, and consequently I almost forgot until today. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful movie. Tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard-edged and maladroit child, following in the footsteps of his horrible and abusive mother, and his neighbor, a slightly younger child who has AIDS. <br /> <br /> Right, you say. Another one of "those". A pull of tears. A cube movie. A tail of morality. Yes, I know, I hate that too. Only this is not. It is one of the few films among the many that I have seen that achieves a very strange trick: it transmits a truly sad story (and yes, a morality story) but without a single moment where it feels corny, forced or in any other way " hollywoody ". It shows a REAL relationship between two REAL boys, who interact as REAL children do. And through that interaction, the kind and loving character of the older boy, Eric, begins to shine through his "tough guy" character, while taking a kind of big brother care for Dexter, his younger and more positive neighbor to HIV. . Together, they embark on an adventure to find a cure, which for Erik seems to be around the corner, so that all this stupid AIDS problem disappears and they can be friends forever. <br /> <br /> The production is first class. But, of course, what this film really carries are the performances of the two protagonists: Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello, which is simply impressive: it conveys the feeling of fragility necessary for a sick child, but at the same time it makes Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. Shines in the scene in which the boys face Pony: his impulse to protect his old friend rushes on him, prompts him to say what he says, and only later, horror appears on his face when he realizes that what he himself said is true: his blood is poison ... Renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother: it shows perfectly how this male and street boy is completely frozen and numb when he confronts his mother abusive and violent. and she can not say a word to contradict it, since she forbids her relationship with the sick child because of her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also offers a memorable performance as Dexter's mother, who eventually becomes, in a sense, a mother figure for Erik as well. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie at school in the United States. , and I loved it - not at all a fact about movies of this type. But the behavior of the children in this movie was so real that I could easily relate to them. Ironically, the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still in contact with her) got into trouble for that, since a tense father complained that the scene occurred when the two children watch a Playboy. .. pathetic. Seriously, Americans will ever get over this ridiculous phobia, I do not know. There was a playboy cover image hardly distinguishable in the film and, therefore, it is not shown in the schools ... how sad. Children need to watch this movie. It's more inspiring and educational than all "after school" special offers put together. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. I know I'm rambling, but nevertheless ... The score. It's great. I'm a musician, and as such, I know Dave Grusin for his records: he's a well-known jazz pianist and record producer. Until this film, I did not really know that he also did the scores of the movies, although when I later verified it, I discovered that, without knowing it, I had seen several films in which he worked. Really, a wonderful job there. <br /> <br /> In short, a solid Ten. I would recommend this movie to anyone. And I'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings, you can use to watch a movie like this among all the standard special effects hysteria that you usually see.
