Of all the mafia movies I've seen, this is one of the best for many reasons. The performance of Pesci, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best in history (in the genre of the mafia), as it is realistic. The characters are people with whom many other people can relate. This movie is also great because its dialogue is good. He also has very realistic fights and action scenes. This film also launched the careers of Pesci and Vincent. If it were not for the success of this movie, Casino and Goodfellas might not have been as good as they were. <br /> <br /> Story 10/10 Acting 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> <br /> GENERAL 10/10 <br /> <br /> My favorite mafia movies are <br / > <br /> 1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather Trilogy 4: Family Enforcer (The Death Collector) 5: The Sopranos (I know it's not a movie)
