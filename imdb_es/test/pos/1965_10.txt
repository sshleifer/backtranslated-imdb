One of the best films of the 1980s, this fact-based film tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend, leaves his body naked on the riverbank and brags about it later to his friends . . What is equally bad is your inability to FEEL about it. <br /> <br /> A disturbing but incredibly convincing look at the apathetic and aimless children who do not respect their parents or any authority, who seem almost condemned. Live a life of rebellion and recklessness. This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget. The young cast does a credible job, even Keanu Reeves, in one of his first roles, is better than usual. Of course, there's no reason why Layne's character (Crispin Glover) is as crazy as he is, but it's just Glover himself. Veteran Dennis Hopper has an especially good role as a loner who, despite his own sordid past, is saddened by the attitudes of this group of children. I would like to point out the horrifying performance of Daniel Roebuck as the young murderer; he is an undervalued actor and, apart from Hopper, is probably the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> I watched "River's Edge" for the first time a long time ago, when it started to appear on cable TV movie channels; however, I could not grasp everything; I saw it in its entirety for the first time, several years later, and now I have seen it again in what is probably the definitive moment. <br /> <br /> Some powerfully affecting moments include that of Madeleine (Constance Forslund) breakdown where she regrets that maybe she should leave her children as her worthless father did. I also liked the scenes in which Matt (Reeves) faces his restless younger brother (Joshua Miller) and when the teacher, Mr. Burkewaite (Jim Metzler) deplores the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students seem to care. . <br /> <br /> I will never forget this movie, not while I live. It's too sad for that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
