You have to watch this movie ... I saw it, when I was 13 years old, in the theater, on my first date ... I went more than 20 years and now I'm gay (Thank you very much, One dark night. !! LOL!). This movie scared me like a child (the mausoleums still do!), But as an adult, the emotion of this movie is not in the story, but in the hysterical laughter it contains ... The highlight is to hear the names teenagers call each other, from "nerdlebrain" (my personal favorite) to "turkey." Also, keep your eyes open to see the scene in which Carol (the blonde, sister of the head) tries to hang her phone in a soda can (I can not believe they did not shoot it again!) ... Other highlights include Adam West's overly dramatic Arrebatos and sticky corpses. If you are a fan of true horror, I would suggest this movie just because, to me, it is almost a parody of horror. There def is a creepy factor and the plot is good, but do not look at it if you want to be scared (unless you're 10 or something like that).
