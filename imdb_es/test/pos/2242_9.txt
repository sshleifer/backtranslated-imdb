Okay, there was a weird hole in the plot that a zeppelin could go through, but how well were the emotional things handled? It would have been so easy to descend to cheese, but the writer succeeded. The image of the ex-cybernetic woman making crying noises when seeing her reflection after recovering her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. That's double now that the monsters have shown a soft side and have shown fleetingly compassionate, the previous was the last Dalek in the first series, but for Jove it worked. Add to that the other former woman who had been "improved" on the eve of their wedding, and Jackie Tyler recognizing her husband after she had become "cybernetic" and you have a permanent lump in your throat. Keep going!
