An absolute classic of the 80's scare flix. This is not like any other, as it faces wild-eyed young psychotic and desire to kill against all adults in the city. Bud, from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (the 80's gold again) plays one of the murderous children and joins one of the girls that Jake Blues tries to buy at BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy, but he keeps disappearing from the movie for any reason. The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly frightening in some places. The demonic gang of smiling children, though somehow possessed by extraplanetary means, look little like the Droid-ish Children of the Damned, who never thought to use guns, crossbows and shovels to kill those annoying adults. Julie Brown (not in the center of Julie Brown, the other) shows her shelf, like three times, while dancing in her room. This movie is a rarity that I can not believe I missed growing up in the 80's. This would have been my absolute favorite movie as a child if I had seen it. Where is the sequel that the end asks? This movie is simply amazing. Look for it at all costs.
