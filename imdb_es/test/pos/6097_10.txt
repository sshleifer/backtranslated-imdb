This is one of the best movies I've seen in my life. It's about true love and friendship. About changing your life and doing something good for another person. Thomas Bo Larsen can play the same role he has done in many other films, but recently we have seen him in other roles that he also does very well. But what if he plays the same role he has done in other movies? It's perfect for that role. Ulrich Thomsen also does a great job. These two "low life" criminals are the best friends of all. They share everything and do everything for others no matter the costs. When they discover that Peter's daughter is being abused, they put everything on hold (things you can not put on hold unless you have to do even more criminal acts) and take her to a better place. They do the best they can? These two men are not intellectuals, but they have their hearts in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Carsten are also my biggest heroes.
