One of the first works of Fuller's (a combat veteran) of medium quality, but accurately addresses the many conflicting aspects of life in post-war Germany. The main character begins the film in April 45 as a Sgt with C Co, 157th Inf, 45th Div, which really ended the war in Munich as in the movie. (The same unit from the previous month had fought a lot in Aschaffenburg and then freed part of Dachau's facilities). For those who are not informed, the film may seem confusing as it turns around between showing the good and the bad of the Germans. But anyone who has been there or who at least read it well would know that most of what is described in the film are things that really happened in 45-47 Germany. The only inaccuracy I noticed was minor: while on a boat cruise on the Rhine past the remains of the Remagen Bridge, he says he crossed there. But his unit really crossed well south of there, north of Worms Germany.
