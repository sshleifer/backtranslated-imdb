This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate explosions and shootings of Renny Harlin. It is the script of Shane Black and his clever delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two directors deserved a sequel. Thank God it was never done. Too much danger of damaging the original. <br /> <br /> Checkerboards 'The long kiss' of scene that can be cited to scene of action to quotable scene and vice versa. Never a dull moment. <br /> <br /> This has to be Jackson's funniest role, and the amazing thing is that he's playing one of the most normal characters of his career. He is not a Tarantino hired man, a super-cool Shaft or a border psychopath. In TLKG, Jackson is the man we identify with. The poor idiot is dragged by the odyssey of this crazy woman to discover the dangerous secret of his past. <br /> <br /> Although the story claims that Davis's character, Samantha Caine suffers from amnesia, the writer and the director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder. <br /> <br /> Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac Charly Baltimore, it is a separate and fully developed personality. The traumas suffered by Samantha in the first half hour of the film help the submerged and dissociated personality of Charly to emerge again. <br /> <br /> Materials from his past life excavated by Jackson's detective, Mitch Henessey, facilitate Charly's resurgence. It is also a good time, considering the goal that Samantha is making to herself. <br /> <br /> But Charly has to fight to remain the dominant personality. A collection of fragments of dialogue that the warrior personality (Charly) developed after his father died and was recruited by the "Chapter". <br /> <br /> In the eight years that Charly was buried in the psyche, however, she Samantha identity became the dominant personality. (It's even more fun than Charly) This was probably due to becoming a mother, because it is the reunion with her daughter that breaks Charly's fight to suppress Samantha, leading to her apparent integration at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to choose a "best quote" from this movie: <br /> <br /> "Now you are a sniper?" <br /> <br /> "I saved your ass, it was great!" <br /> <br /> "Keep dying. <br /> <br /> "I hit them on the jaw and yelled 'Pop is going to the weasel'". <br /> <br /> And a couple of a dozen more, many too risky to quote them here. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis looks great and presents herself as a heroine of action without ignoring the fact that she will turn forty. (Listen to Charley's story, do the math). <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack, too. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br /> I give 'The Good Kiss Goodnight' a 9, just because I do not believe in a perfect 10. I've seen it a dozen times and it's still fresh. A beautiful and twisted Christmas movie to place on your shelf next to "It's A Wonderful Life."
