This movie is on my list of the 20 best comedies. This is a truly unique movie. For the critic who said: "I really must be losing something": he is right. You are missing something. If you do not have the sense of humor that this movie requires, that's one thing. But do not give it a bad review because you think it's "looney" but it does not pretend to be. Loony is an accurate description of what he pretends to be and what he manages to be. I laughed much more often and much more intensely in this movie than in most of the other funny movies. <br /> <br /> Michael Almereyda brought out the best of his cast in this, his first great film, for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature Film. Crispin Glover, as usual, is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way, and some of his funniest lines were told in this movie. Glover is clearly the best comic actor that is working at the moment. Harry Dean Stanton puts on an excellent comedic performance. William Burroughs is amazing in a small role. Dylan McDermott was the ideal cast, and Lois Chiles is completely excellent. <br /> <br /> All of the above is perfectly fun in its perfect way, but this is one of Crispin's best performances, up there with his performances at River's Edge and Willard. If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, but somehow you have overlooked this movie, you must stop what you are doing and see this immediately. <br /> <br /> But remember to relax first, and maybe have a beer or something. This is a great movie, but it's very unusual, and I recommend being in or inducing an appropriate mental state before watching it.
