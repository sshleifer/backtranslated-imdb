I rented this movie without having heard (or read) anything about it. What a pity! This movie is smart, witty, hilarious, fast-paced and really ridiculous. The characters manage to develop without relying too much on clich√© and tired stereotypes. It was refreshing to see it. I could not help but think that marketing would have helped launch this not-so-conventional movie to the comedy of the hungry intelligence. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors perform a great variety of awkwardness, anguish and comedy is so rare these days. I felt that the actors must have enjoyed participating in something so rich. How is it possible that National Treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row? It is too weak in many aspects to mention it. I guess I'm happy that movies like "Watching ..." are still being made somewhere.
