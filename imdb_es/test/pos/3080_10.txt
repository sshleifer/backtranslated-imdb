I thought this movie was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the missing fragments while I crouched on my stomach! The critic who reviewed this movie for this site challenged anyone with an IQ about the size of his shoe to find this funny movie, well, my IQ is about 135. I challenge this person to ask me and then eat their own words! This movie is brilliant and if the criticism above was not so dull, you could smile for once in your life and take things as smoothly as you think. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers were so imaginative! EVERYONE when they see a movie about that period of time, they will realize what men are doing and they will realize how different today's outfit is and how funny it would be to find today's male population if they would use tights day after day! The idea of ​​dedicating a song to Butch's men dancing in tights was so recent, how can anyone not laugh? (In addition, seeing the rappers of hip-hop doing ballet is always hysterical, as a dancer too, I've done ballet and hip hop and I've danced with men who have had to do both ... it still bothers me every time !! !) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, if someone has not seen it yet, do not listen to the criticism above ... Watch it and then decide for yourself!
