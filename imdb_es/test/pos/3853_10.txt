Duchess is a pretty white cat that lives with her three kittens in the mansion of its rich owner in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old woman is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler gets angry because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and leaves them on the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start a long walk home. A wise street cat named Thomas O'Malley meets them and offers to help them. When Edgar sees them arrive home, he is furious and begins to send them to Timbucktu. But Thomas's friends arrive to help save the day. The wealthy woman decides to leave her home for every stray cat in Paris. <br /> <br /> This is a lovely movie. The songs, including "Everybody Wants to Be a Cat", are animated and optimistic. The cast of voices is excellent, with Eva Gabor (who would later play Miss Bianca in Disney's THE RESCUERS films) as Duchess, Phil Harris (Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters. Supposedly Walt Disney, before dying in 1966, gave the go-ahead to this movie. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.
