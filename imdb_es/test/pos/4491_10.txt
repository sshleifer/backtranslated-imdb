I will never forget the absolutely absorbing effect that this program had on me when I saw it for the first time. From the moment the Clown frightens the Commander, to his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation ("We are alive, we are people, we must have memories!" Quote inaccurate but close), to his intelligent intent. To improvise a means of escape, this is a fascinating drama. <br /> <br /> The little touches remain with the viewer for a long time after seeing it. The moment in which the charming dancer dances for everybody, at full volume, shouting bagpipes of the Scottish musician; The Vagabond's nebulous comment, "An error is as good as a mile," the moving conclusion of the Major that they must be in hell. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant episode, beautifully written and performed. The impressive beauty of Susan Harrison adds to the memorability of the strange and moving story.
