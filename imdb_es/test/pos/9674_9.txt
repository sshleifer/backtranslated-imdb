This is a great show, which makes me wonder why they took it off the air so many times. But I think it is now here to stay! This show can not be compared to any other. Before the Simpsons were quite "on the edge" and then Family Guy came, and they are stretching it out of the "edge". The things with which this show comes out is incredible. The clock works completely! If you like the Simpsons you will love the family boy!
