I've never been a big fan of Oliver Stone, often because I've found that his films are forced, preached and generally defective. The two Stone movies that I really like are JFK and Talk Radio, but Talk Radio takes the cake to be Stone's best achievement. Stone is a director for whom you are a fan or not, it is safe to say that before watching Talk Radio I did not like that guy and was considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry, although after watching Talk Radio. Some of my perceptions have changed. Talk Radio is a disturbing and amusing attack against what is now known as "reality TV". <br /> <br /> Talk Radio follows a self-indulgent, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, outrageous and disconcerting radio host named Barry Champlain who presents a controversial night radio show in Dallas. Quickly becoming famous for its audacious and peculiar presence in the air, it becomes a nocturnal sensation, for which depraved drug addicts, criminals, racists, sociopaths, the sick, the perverts and the imbeciles are called to be ridiculed in the air. The film shows the rise and fall of man's career, carefully making a precise representation of freedom of expression. Originally adapted from a play, the film adheres to the theatrical theme in which it was originally constructed, beautifully conveying the fierce nature of the film. <br /> <br /> With the fierce energy and the non-stereotyped air, Talk Radio brings all the hilarity behind "the rough media". It remains even more moving today than it was in the late 1980s. The film delves into the study of arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behavior, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. The film shows in a controlled manner how it is good to have a personal opinion and freedom of expression, but it is something that should be used prudently instead of shamefully. Stone tries to show how freedom of expression is a crucial importance in life, but it is something that we should be cautious and cautious about. The film raises the question: "is our main character the same as the sad people who call the show?" <br /> <br /> Stone fabulously creates the key piece of the film (the radio station) with an ambition and a cold atmosphere. Then he manages to capture the isolation, fear, ambiguity and dangerous emotions that accumulate in the radio station. Eric Bogosian is perfectly presented as the isolated, self-absorbed and complex genius, Barry Champlain. It adapts perfectly to paper, leaving aside its lines with such enthusiasm, urgency, perplexity, abruptness and, ultimately, the audacious hilarity of its offensive nature. The performance is full of sparks, which evidently stole an Oscar nomination. His voice adapts to the character, since the main element of a radio announcer and his power to act along with tragedy and comedy work brilliantly. <br /> <br /> There is a great use of editing in the Stone movies and on Talk Radio it boasts. Some of its cleanest, most rhythmic editions. It uses beautifully controlled camera techniques, which differ from calm and sudden turbulence. There is a vibrant energy behind the film, with its original and wonderfully charming script that works as a centerpiece for the greatness of the film. The surprising and virtuous cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio, capturing in the most impressive way the city at night. Without forgetting the fascinating and heartbreaking and, at the same time, dark "spiral in decline" climatic, is an extraordinary cinema. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is an essential and modern masterpiece. I'm sure you'll be surprised how great it is. . I recommend Talk Radio to anyone interested in the media or the cinema. Talk Radio is a good example of high-level entertainment, intellectual and insightful, which still has a well-deserved wake-up call. Finally, if it were not for Eric Bogosian, the film would not be the fun, charming and enduring masterpiece it is today.
