A unique mix of musical, film noir and comedy, with some sex scenes included to a large extent. The only other film I can think of with a fairly similar mix of crazy and crazy subjects and clichés is the French film Billy Ze Kick, but it has a more surreal and quirky approach. <br /> <br /> It's not that this movie would not be surreal or quirky. The humor is sometimes quite subtle, sometimes brazenly on his face and often crosses the border with the offensive. To give an example: in the conversation after intercourse with a prostitute, our hero, Max Müller, encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder, using the words "Schiess los!". Literally, this phrase means "Shoot!" in German, and that's exactly what a hidden killer does in response. In other words, this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a play on words. <br /> <br /> Müllers Büro is also one of the rarest examples of movies with funny sex scenes. Larry's romance is accompanied by the song "Ich will mehrhr" (I want more); while the song perfectly supports the action, the meaning of his words changes a couple of times, alluding in the end to Larry's inability to provide more services. The main love scene of the film between Max Müller and Bettina Kant lacks so much subtlety: this is something amazing, especially when Bettina's singing slowly turns into moans, of course, all to the rhythm of the music. <br /> <br /> Inevitable, unless you are one of the easily offended.
