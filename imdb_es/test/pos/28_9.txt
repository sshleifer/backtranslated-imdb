A fantastic movie experience. I really enjoyed watching this wonderful movie in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, except that it is a terrible shame that Sir Albert Finney is not yet accepted by the AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in films like Tom Jones, Murder on the Orient Express, Under the Volcano (to name just a few, for which he was nominated for the Oscar), The Dresser is undoubtedly his highlight, but ... <br /> <Br /> I know, the Oscars are just a popularity contest, but if Americans like British actors and actresses ("and Oscar goes to" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson, etc., and they all deserved the prize!), Why did they always leave Sir Finney empty-handed? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny). I do not know, I should laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the two tracks in The Dresser, you will not forget what the art of acting is. Watch this movie and enjoy! I recommend it to all those who love art. <br /> <br /> I give 9/10 for this excellent movie (1 point is missing for non-cinematic material, after all it is "just" a theater) <br /> <br /> Note: My criteria is much more strong that this in IMDb (10 only for the cinematographic masterpiece that should / could last forever).
