What a show! Lorenzo Lamas demonstrates once again his talent as a policeman who committed the worst crime that a good police officer can commit by being a good policeman. Then, again, it shows how sensitive a policeman can be, showing a range of emotions like no other actor can except, perhaps, himself in terminal justice. <br /> <br /> HUGE HUGE!
