I think Shane Black is one of the best action writers of all time! He gave us the incredible (at the time) Lethal Weapon, shooting Mel Gibson to stardom. Then followed with the second best film in which Bruce Willis (The Last Boyscout) has been. He stumbled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but he redeemed himself with this, The Long Kiss Goodnight. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of action movies, this has it all ... Action, Comedy, Emotions, and then head it with more Action, Comedy and Emotions. Geena Davies is great, Samual L Jackson is even older. Do not miss it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
