There is not a dull moment in Francois Ozon's "Robe d'Ete". It's amazing how much is involved in this short film. While lying on a deserted beach after swimming naked, a young girl looks for a gay young man who looks for a light for his cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. When returning to the beach. They find that all their clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover her nudity and asks him to return it the next day. He rides his bicycle back to the vacation cabin dressed as a girl. Your gay partner is sexually aroused. Early the next morning, the young man returns to the sea and says goodbye to the girl whose holidays are over. She suggests that you keep the dress as a reminder of your summer romance. It's a happy movie that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea, but maybe not for those who feel embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes.
