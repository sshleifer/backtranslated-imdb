I find it hard to put into words how wonderful this was. Every now and then you see a movie that stays with you. "You are alone" is that movie (for me). The movie is constantly in my head and in my heart. I mentally repeat the scenes every day, analyze them and repeat the emotions again and again, as if I was seeing them for the first time. <br /> <br /> There's nothing I did not like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack !!! The end was perfect. Very moving emotionally! It was fascinating and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I loved Jessica Bohl and her performance was the best I've seen. I admired the strength of Brittany (what a strong woman). <br /> <br /> The line on the label is "When your darkest moments come to life". We never know what we are capable of doing. Everyone says: Oh, I never would, when we really have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are very capable of everything and these films deepen in that subject. The honesty of the movie can be my absolute favorite part. <br /> <br /> Thanks Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art!
