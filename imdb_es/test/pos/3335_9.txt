This ingenious and small film shows the solid virtues of a time, place and type of masculine strength that we no longer have or even aspire to have. The saint is a champion with the best motives, not to mention a polished vocabulary and diction. It is not necessary to turn up the volume or read the dialogue. George Sanders is so charming and, yes, discreet, that all that talent, intelligence, physical presence and, above all, masculinity, seems, well, almost normal. Something normal! George Clooney can not begin to dominate the scene as Mr. Sanders does (and dispense with Mr. Clooney's hold-up). I could play a whimper (Witness of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Rebecca) but when it was good, it was very, very good. In truth, a man for all reasons and seasons.
