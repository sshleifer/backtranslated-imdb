I saw Borderline several years ago at AMC. I've been looking for it since then. It was disturbing: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I did not care where. I will never forget the curtain that blows with the breeze. I still remember the way he made me bow my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I did not know what happened when the movie ended, but I think life is like that. It did not bother me. The injustice of the last rejection of an innocent character seems sad to me. I loved the faces, the way the camera dwelled on them. The camera looked at the scene with the unfocused eyes of an awake dreamer. Borderline was real to me in a way that movies are not. It was exactly the lack of explanation, color, sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night. I love this movie. Someday I will own it.
