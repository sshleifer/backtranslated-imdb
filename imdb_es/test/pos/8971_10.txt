Charlie Wilson's War is an excellent example of how movies should be made. This film is of the highest quality and is perfectly designed. Tom Hanks is the leader and offers exceptional performance. In addition, Tom Hanks is complemented by the unrivaled acting ability of the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I have never seen it on a paper that suits him so perfectly. <br /> <br /> The film is witty, intelligent and well written. Julia Roberts also stars in this film, but is easily overtaken by the other two tracks. <br /> <br /> I rated this film 10/10 and I am happy to recommend this film to anyone who is interested in quality film.
