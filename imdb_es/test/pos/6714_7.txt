No, "Lifeforce" is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It is, however, an average movie with some good effects and a compelling story (and, of course, Mathilda May). Actually, it may be one of my favorite SF / horror movies for the simple reason that they try to reason through the science of space vampires. How often do you see that? Not even in "Alien" (the SF / horror movie of all time) science enters history at all. In "Force of life" they are trying to make the reason for an unreasonable world. <br /> <br /> Now, do I think it's successful? No. I think the film has the problem of a massive cast that Hooper is struggling to keep focused and on track and that viewers have to focus on more than one "villain" and there are too many road trips. <Br /> <br /> To be honest, the movie is very attractive and fun to watch. but there is great potential here for a top remake to take over what Hooper was trying to do and really create a scary / scary and terrifying movie. <br /> <br /> If the remake happens, however, I demand that Mathilda May have a cameo.
