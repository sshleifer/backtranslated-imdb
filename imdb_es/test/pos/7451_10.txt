Now, after seeing The Advent Children twice, the plot is not as superficial as most critics have criticized it, in my opinion. If you have not played FFVII or you have not liked it for some reason, it is most likely that this film is not for you. Being familiar with the original story is a prerequisite to fully understanding AC, otherwise you will only see the best CG animation in your life so far. <br /> <br /> Without really spoiling the story, I must admit that after seeing BC we have been putting pieces together with my friends who rely on our knowledge of FFVII. Seeing him a second time allowed him to pay more attention to the story and he answered most of the questions we might have had. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players / fans and honestly does not try to be anything else. There is little or no realism outside the FFVII world that serves this purpose. The music is mostly FFVII themes reconstructed with a heavier touch (TBM team according to the final credits) and works well with sweet eyes with no exceptions. I found the music improving the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that you can not put a FFVII in 1.5 hours and keep that in mind, the story really offered me more than I expected. There are two themes at hand in FFVII: AC and both stories were wrapped very well between the action sequences. And trust me when I say there's a lot of that. Action that is. <br /> <br /> I am changing my vote from 9 to 10 after seeing it a second time because I had missed some explanatory sequences that I could not put together the first time I provided some answers. As a warning, it will be easy to ignore the story and concentrate on the graphics, but try not to judge the Adevent Children for that. If you do not let the story come in, it's no wonder that it seems sloppy. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to praise the graphics because I guess we all know they are awesome, which could be a euphemism. Especially the characters speak much more than ever with their facial expressions. I hope they pay attention to the plot because it really makes sense and works well with the whole. Get ready for the trip of your life, there are no breaks.
