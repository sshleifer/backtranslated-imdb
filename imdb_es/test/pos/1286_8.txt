Great movie. There are no free tricks like in most Hollywood movies. Everything supported the suspense of the plot. B & w gave it a basic feel, no frills too. In short, it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast. <br /> <br /> The following serves as an interesting contrast with Memento. The characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. In that sense, both reminded me a bit of "In the Company of Men", also highly recommended. One difference between the two Nolan films is that Memento was a bit easier to follow, since the black and white scenes move in a constant chronological direction, and so do the color ones. I do not think that was true of Follow, where the scenes seemed to be random. If you have the option to choose between VCR and DVD, I recommend a DVD, since it gives you the option to watch the film for the second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled (albeit naive) order presented by Nolan. It also facilitates, in a second visualization, to join the order for yourself, if you wish. <br /> <br /> As another viewer pointed out, one of the best things about this film and Memento is that none of the cast was famous. They were characters, not renowned actors who brought characters developed in other films. <br /> <br /> Given certain similarities in the arguments, I wonder if Memento is a kind of Follow remake, but I was trying to reach a larger audience, as Edward Burns made Ella the only one in the mold of - and to a large extent with the same cast that - The Brothers McMullan
