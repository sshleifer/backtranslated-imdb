One of Warner Brothers best and most blockbuster films during the thirties was this charming family drama about a widower who lives with his single sister who is raising Four Daughters. But not four daughters every day. All of them have been trained by their father musician in instruments and one as a singer. They make a beautiful music together, even if it is for the long hair set. <br /> <br /> You can see the endless variety of roles that Claude Rains played over the years and still amaze you while showing you another aspect. Of his creative personality. The opportunistic captain of Vichy in Casablanca is as different as the scientist who went mad in the invisible Man, as the patient and wise Job in Mr. Skeffington. All the same man and all so incredibly different. <br /> <br /> Here he raises the four girls with seasoned love with a bit of grumpiness for his willingness to accept modern music. The Lane Sisters and Gale Page can meet Beethoven, but they are also feline and can beat Daddy eight times at the bar each time. And if Rains gets a little irritable, then Aunt May Robson can put him in his place. <br /> <br /> With four single daughters at the moment you know that will change. All sisters develop romantic interests in Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Of course, the mating process gets a little complicated and one of the sisters suffers a tragedy, but promises to work when the film ends. <br /> <br /> Four Daughters is also known as John Garfield's debut film. Apart from a small part in Footlight Parade years before, Garfield did not have other roles in the cinema. But he was acclaimed on stage in New York for his performance in Golden Boy and Warner Brothers signed with him and found the role of perfect film debut as the cynical musician who simply can not get a good rest in life. It earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1938, but he lost to Walter Brennan for Kentucky. <br /> <br /> This movie was so popular that it practically spawned a small cottage industry for Jack Warner. Sequels with cast members like Daughters Courageous, Four Mothers, Four Wives, all cleaned up at the box office before World War II. And Warner Brothers remade it with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day playing the parts that originated John Garfield and Priscilla Lane. Now those two made beautiful music. <br /> <br /> A timeless mold was still created in Four Daughters and the film remains 70 years after it was first seen.
