Do not ask me why I love this movie so much ... Maybe it came at a time in my life where I desperately wanted to fit in, maybe it's the amazing monstrous effects, maybe because I liked the novel "Cabal", but probably It's because I LOVE Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn you that the movie and the novel do not have a real resolution and, like me, you probably have a WTF moment at the end. At least two sequels were planned, but they never occurred due to the fact that the film failed for several reasons. The study made drastic cuts to the film, eliminating about 30 minutes, and did a HORRIBLE job promoting it. The ads made it look like another cheap slasher that mainly shows the Decker character "Button Face / Mask". This is a movie about monsters! About fantasy! About a place called Midian! It's a story where monsters are good. There really is not anything else out there like that! I guess it's not a movie for everyone, but it's one of Clive's great works. Sit down and get ready to be taken to Midian, where the monsters are.
