Wow, "The Curse of Michael Myers" that great movie. Suspenseful, entertaining, creative and an intelligent plot that I love. Many hate the 'Thorn' concept, I love it. I think it gives a bit of a plot to the Halloween series. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and becomes an excellent act, especially for her first film, and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are also great. My only complaint is that why was not Danielle Harris in this movie like Jamie? She wanted to go back, but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. Still, I love Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. I think the Shape mask looks better in this movie and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers of all time. Incredibly creepy and suspenseful, Halloween rules 6! <br /> <br /> I love this movie very violent, but immensely nice. The Halloween horror series: the best with difference in the genre. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
