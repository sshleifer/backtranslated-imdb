This film promises a lot but delivers little. The basic problem has to do with the inclusion of the character of Charlotte Gainsbourg in this film. The immigrants from Sicily did not need an Anglo redhead in any way: the film may have needed it, but the new citizens certainly did not need it. In my opinion, the decision to include it destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly worrying, as it seems to degrade not only the characters in the film, but also the history of immigration itself. The immigrants themselves were heroic figures, fully capable of getting along without having to satisfy what I believe is a veiled image of "the burden of the white man." I wonder if someone will make a film of Irish immigrants that will include a Sicilian woman as the main character. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of cinematographic performance, production sets, dialogue, art, continuity of the film, plot and character development, on a scale of 10 for excellent, 5 for average and 1 for needs. Both the continuity and the plot of the film have a minimum of 1. The continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealist ending. Does a film with such important historical significance deserve nothing more than a conclusion that reminds Marc Chagall? The plot is quite simple, until it seems to get entangled with too much time in the old country, too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the end. The character's acting and development are normal, since all the characters are arranged throughout the film, and the inclusion of perfect Anglo-Saxon English almost makes the film a satire. Where is Groucho when you need it? Production sets, dialogue and art are very good, each with a score of 10. The sets in Sicily, on the boat and on Ellis Island are as good as one can find. The dialogue is wonderful, and the ethical song is excellent. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Keep in mind that immigrants speak of "America", not of "United States": the ideal in the face of political reality. There are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of America, rain of gold coins and giant vegetables among the best. The average index of the Left Elbow is 5.25, increased to 7.0 when compared to the IMDb scale. Another idea seems to go through Ellis Island's experience: the tribulations of passing immigrants were exhausting; later, in 2006, one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and infiltrate the county in the dark of night. It's worth watching the movie, but it seems that what you see is problematic.
