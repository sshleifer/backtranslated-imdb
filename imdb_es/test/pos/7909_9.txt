This version of 1955 Producers' Showcase of the musical Peter Pan with Mary Martin has the advantage of showing most of the original Broadway cast, including Kathleen Nolan as Wendy, who was a more natural actress than the girl they hired for the televised game in color of 1960.

How far away the fifties look, a time so innocent compared to today. I miss him.
