I really liked that movie! He has a big heart and big bones. I stumbled upon him by chance and had no recollection, not even a hint, of this movie promos or reviews or word of mouth. I remember reading, many years ago, a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having them contaminated by the pre-trial reviews or the false receipt of promotions. And this seems to be the most common source of the negative reaction of critics to the film: it did not meet the expectations that it was a comedy, a part of life or a driven character. I had no expectations about the film, and that's why it was comical, but I only laughed once or twice, without being a comedy; it was a person, but so eccentric that it was not part of life; it was a character, but the character was so cleverly optimistic and relied on his instinct for life, that it was not the sentimental melodrama so typical of the "serious" movie of the United States, so distressed by anguish. The director Lisa Krueger managed to make fun of this enthusiastic American sentimentality in the husband! And very cleverly too! And Kreuger was able to maintain the sentimentally sentimental ending of the screen, when the wayward, non-prodigal husband returned with his tail shrunken between his legs. Bravo, Mrs. Krueger, bravo! (Now I will see this movie again, since it is getting better as I reflect on it). <br /> <br /> Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant. I loved how subtle but completely she was able to portray and convey an intelligent awareness of her commitment to honor her words and actions; she knew that by keeping her word with a band, friends or husband, she was ridiculing herself. and / or disappointment in a world that could not fulfill the commitment as she could. But even with that strength, she was completely connected with humanity, and embraced her fragility and failures with a fully committed heart. The character of Joline was incredibly well acted, and I left the film surprised to not have any recollection of nominations to the awards for it. Well, I'm not surprised, because American prizes tend to go to women in "serious" roles, full of anguish and the right amount of nudes, which this movie did not have. What she has is much better, which was the heart in this woman's discovery of herself with the help of new friends and a self-critical shaman. <br /> <br /> I admit that it's a bit of a soft touch for eccentric characters. who handle their peculiarities while remaining honest and true to themselves as they move through the minefield of what comprises "appropriate" social behavior and "acceptable" interpersonal discourse. So, if people should adjust to normal in their world, then this movie will not be to their liking. And that was, apparently, one of the common threads in criticism. <br /> <br /> And I am always an imbecile for a good word game when it raises questions of human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. Even this film had not made the emotional connection between being committed (with a cause or honesty or something) and being committed (with a mental hospital). At what point does one's commitment to the personal sense of truth and action in life become a one-way ticket to madness? This sounds like a simple question, or one that is easily rejected as being rhetorical. But is it? And yet, few of the critics, I think perhaps two, commented on this aspect of the film, either directly or indirectly. <br /> <br /> A lovely movie. 8/10. <br /> <br />
