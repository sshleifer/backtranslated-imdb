An entertaining first draft for "North By Northwest", "Saboteur" has some wonderful Hitchcockian moments (one of the best happens at a table, when a woman who has not yet seen that she wears handcuffs gives the hero her a plate; try to do that, he also throws a knife to the ground, exposing himself even more!) but he has a poorly chosen clue (whether he's delivering patriotic speeches, falling in love with Priscilla Lane, joking or trying to sound worried. Cummings is made of wood), and due to the lack of really different villains (oh, there are villains, many of them, but almost nobody has enough screen time). (***)
