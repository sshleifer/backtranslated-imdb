Although I have not seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent will take this audacious theme: a comedy about Hitler. All the great satire is based on going to the edge. Also, every great comedy deals with the other side - pathos. This movie looks like it will skirt both sides. Like Dr. Strangelove of Kubrick, The Great Dictator treats history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is to laugh at him. And with luck, through laughter, we can learn to see the world from a new perspective. Another movie that does this that comes to mind is Underground, and Fando And Lis, by Emir Kusturica. Then, let me see the movie first.
