It seems that many Europeans and Americans watch Indian films for the wrong reason; I see some people are complaining that this movie did not have any dance sequence.

Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors of India, being widely known for his choice of themes for the cinema and the strength of his scripts. 'Chokher bali' is a perfect example. A faithful adaptation of the Tagore novel, awarded with the Nobel Prize, which deals with the search for sexual pleasure of a Bengali widow, the director gives a new dimension to the acclaimed and controversial work.
