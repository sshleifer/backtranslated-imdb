The plot of this movie is as silly as a bag of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a character who might have been upset by the ridiculousness of the story. He is evil and a woman who hits. He is a character as far away from his roles as NYPD and LA Law. <br /> <br /> If you thought you had the appearance and the skills to play the role of really bad boy, it's your present. . <br /> <br /> But !!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black miniskirts and small black mini-dresses throughout the film. <br /> <br /> He has always had some of the best legs in the history of movies. This makes the movie worthwhile for this leg admirer. <br /> <br /> I will buy the DVD for this reason only if it is available.
