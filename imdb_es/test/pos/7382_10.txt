In a time of predictable movies, where violence, cheap romance and melodrama abound, it's such a lovely surprise to find such a strange movie. The plot itself is convincing, and the actors are excellent, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to see a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking the questions, a movie that will surprise you (good or bad), Dark Harbor is for you. And if you're not convinced, believe me Alan Rickman's performance is worth it ... especially at the end, ladies ...
