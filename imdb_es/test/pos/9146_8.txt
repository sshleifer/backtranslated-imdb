If you love vampires and are a fan of Gothic horror, then you may want to meet Soul's Midnight. I did not know much about this movie before I saw it, and I did not expect much, but I found the movie fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Starring Armand Assante as the leader of the vampire Simon, Soul's is separated from other low-budget vampire movies by knitting in the mythology of St. George and the Dragon in a new and fun way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the budget was for this movie, but I have the feeling that if it had been a bit more than I really could have been able to hit the house and the effects. <br /> <br /> If you get up late one night and want to have fun low budget vampire movie, then Soul's Midnight is a good choice.
