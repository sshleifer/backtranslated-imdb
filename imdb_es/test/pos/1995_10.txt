Everyone seems to compare this with The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I saw it for the first time, I would have accepted: I was expecting The Matrix and I was a bit disappointed. But repeatedly my respect for this movie has grown enormously. <br /> <br /> What you need to keep in mind is that The Matrix is ​​a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo jumbo. The 13th floor is a passable action movie with a bit more mumbo jumbo philosophical a bit more interesting. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and it is not (as many seem to believe) about "reality" or any "deep" concept. It is about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial world (both in its origin and in its behavior) of fantasy. <br /> <br /> The most spooky moment of the film is when Allegra Geller repeats it "line" script. It is at that moment that you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered in order to participate in a story. This becomes even more terrifying in the end when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of spending his life in the game. I completely sympathize with the "realist" philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the ultimate goal is, ultimately, a recipe for a soulless existence. Living "in the game" is not living at all, but it is a tempting way to spend time on earth. As Allegra says about the real world, "there's nothing here." It could also attack someone else's imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting. (Although I have to ask if Cronenberg considers this as a self-blame, considering that he himself offers worlds to experience in 90-minute fragments). <br /> <br /> When I left the cinema after watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of those movies that you could watch just to see how it ended. But after having seen it a couple of times more (thanks to SciFi Channel) I realized how deep it is. Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another visit.
