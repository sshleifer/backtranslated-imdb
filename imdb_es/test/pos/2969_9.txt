A talented high school graduate with a bad attitude is forced to play in the high school football game of the state's stars. When she meets and falls in love with an attractive local girl, she helps him to realize that he has an opportunity to obtain a "full trip" scholarship if he plays well. <br /> <br /> Too often, these dramas fall into traps of formulas and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teenager. Matt Sabo of FULL RIDE certainly fits this profile, but below the surface there is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre. Matt is the center of the action and is a realistic, confident and vulnerable teenager, optimistic and cynical in turns. Influenced by Amy, Matt becomes a man of character and heart. He, in turn, makes friends with his teammates, which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player. <br /> <br /> FULL RIDE has all the elements that we love to see in a movie: excellent acting, admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, moving drama and a love story. Still, while one may have seen these elements in other films, FULL RIDE is assisted by performances that are sincere and, at times, even moving. Perhaps the most impressive thing about FULL RIDE is its sense of reality. Although the author of the previous comment seems to disagree, (clearly a disgruntled student who, for rather obvious reasons, received a poor grade in his film class) director Mark Hoeger places the film in a credible situation and location and makes a great work to get to the grain of what life is like in a small town. These characters are real people rooted in realistic situations, which often create the most compelling entertainment. On one level it is a love story, on another it is a study of characters, and another is a simple football movie. All these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle.
