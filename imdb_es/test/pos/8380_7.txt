Operation Scorpion (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not glide at maximum speed until the last 25 minutes or so, but when the action reaches maximum speed, it offers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that require the attention of the viewer. Does not that mean that the first hour is useless? Fair compared to the last fight festival, it seems a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Yuk-Su, a talented comic artist who dreams of being a hero, like the ones he describes in his drawings When Yuk-Su rescues a young maid, Siu-Yu , who is being sold for prostitution, incurs the wrath of his evil boss, Wa. Directed by Sonny, a scorpion-style kung fu master, Wa's henchmen chase Yuk-Su and the maid. Yuk-Su's father intervenes but he is injured. After being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders, the three eventually hide in a noodle restaurant, owned by their friend, Master Yat. <br /> <br /> Yuk-Su learns to cook noodles, but also regularly escapes to build their strength in secret and learns kung fu under the tutelage of Jean, the master of the muscular helmets who rescued them. When Master Yat must go on business, Yuk-Su is in charge of the kitchen; however, he goes out to practice his skills with Jean, leaving Siu-Yu to serve the clients. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and, disgusted by the noodles they serve, destroy the restaurant. <br /> <br /> When Master Yat learns that Yuk-Su has been hiding, he tells him that he should have learned kung fu from him; It turns out that Master Yat used to be a great murderer of the Triad, until he decided to try to change his ways. Under the guidance of Master Yat, Yuk-Su improves their skills, even learning the art of kick without shadows! Yuk-Su finally has the chance to try to become a true hero when his friend, Fatty, announces that her maid has also been sold for prostitution. With Jean, they visit Wa, posing as caretakers of French brothels in search of new women. When presented with Fatty's maid, she accidentally exploits her trick and in the end the action begins with great style. Despite his best efforts, Jean is badly beaten by Sonny and he and Yuk-Su are forced to flee. Upon returning to the restaurant, Yuk-Su finds him on fire; and worst of all, the bad guys have found Siu-Yu! Yuk Su, accompanied by Master Yat, returns to the house of Wa to try to rescue Siu-Yu ... <br /> <br /> Despite some rather entertaining training scenes, the slow evolution to the final action in the house of Wa is quite Too worn out and devoid of serious fighting scenes. It is a pity that the boredom has not been destroyed by a decent means, instead of keeping all the juicy things until the end. <br /> <br /> The last fight, however, is worth waiting for in the end; Won Jin gives an amazing performance to being the kicker Sonny who slips, turns and turns with amazing skill and dexterity, and Chin Kar-Lok offers a solid performance as Yuk-Su, the artist turned into a fighter. The old school kung fu star, Lau Kar-Leung (also known as Liu Chia Liang) as Master Yat is also particularly good, proving that this veteran still has what it takes to kick ass! Although it is not a perfect movie, Operation Scorpio has enough outstanding action at its end to definitely guarantee a visualization. <br /> <br /> NB. I may have been wrong in my name. My DVD calls the characters by different names than those listed in IMDb.
