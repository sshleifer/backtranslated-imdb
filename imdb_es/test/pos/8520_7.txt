Yes, it is Sean Connery who plays Bond again, looking more alive and in his role than ever since the first time they made this film, in 1965, when it was called "Thunderball". But the tongue is so firm on the cheek that one wonders if Connery is not employing some observed tricks of his friend and more humorous successor, Roger Moore. <br /> <br /> Moore is my favorite Bond, but Connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual outing. Bond's only serious film that was not performed under the auspices of the classic Eon Bond series, "Never Say Never Again," is an irreverent return to the well. Soft for action, however, is strong in character and intelligent dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bond, clarifies immediately, is a man in disapproval. No matter how many times you have saved the world, your new boss thinks little about your fat lifestyle. "Too many free radicals, that's your problem ... caused by eating too much red meat, white bread, too many martinis." "Then I'll cut the white bread, sir," Bond replies elegantly. <br /> <br /> An early fight sequence in a spa represents the highlight of the action in the film, with Bond and an attacker struggling to make their way. a kitchen, a bedroom and a laboratory before Bond finally extinguishes his opponent, ironically, without the slightest help of free radicals. Humor is applied liberally in the film, more intelligently than most of Moore's departures, although Connery seems to be having more fun giving himself as a result of Moore's less selfish example. <br /> <br /> Was it because it was? Doing a good part of the gross? Or was he working for less stingy producers? Whatever it is, the script adapts well to its relaxed style, and the result is richer and more entertaining than the two previous releases of Connery's Eon Bond, "You Only Live Twice" and "Diamonds Are Forever." <br /> <br /> The 1980s was not a good decade for Bond, whether it was Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmers, video games and ugly sports cars are in evidence, and Bianca Jagger sunglasses that are seen using Klaus Maria Brandauer in her first scene do her no favors. Forget about first impressions. Brandauer's role as the main villain, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best in any Bond movie, with Brandauer enjoying the threat and mania of his character. At one point, it allows Bond to move freely through his situation room, with a martini as entertaining, and his dancing eyes and crazy, attractive smile make him an attractive company in everything. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film, apart from Connery, are the Bond girls, with more attention to personality than normal in Bond films, a testimony of filmmaker Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner . Barbara Carrera was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as the villain Fatima Blush, as crazy as Largo and even more pleasant to watch. She does not last the whole movie; You almost need it to focus on others. <br /> <br /> The breasts and buttocks of Kim Basinger should have had their own agents during the screen time they have in this movie, but I'm not complaining. Basinger is a rare beauty that in this first role as the lover of Largo mixes an incredible warmth with a childish vulnerability that reveals the bond that exists in me, and many others that I suspect. (His lips and cheekbones are also very sweet). <br /> <br /> It's not a well-made movie. It's an imitation of a better Bond movie with a sloppy plot, a terrible score and a flat ending. But he does have Connery, which shows that his was the definitive take on the definitive secret agent of the cinema, even if he steals a page or two from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is entertaining enough, so I'm not complaining.
