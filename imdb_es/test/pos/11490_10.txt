It is depressing that many people do not understand this movie. Getting stuck in the peripheral elements is missing the true meaning of this movie. This film speaks to the minority of people who really believe in love and truth. He points out that in today's society, very often, people say what sounds good at the moment without the intention of backing things when things get difficult. As someone else said it is evident in the number of divorces. Some people really believe that marriage is forever. Forget about stereotypes or anything else, rather, concentrate on what is important to follow your heart and fight for what you believe. I liked the ending because it would have been easy to go with a sappy, but instead, with the reality that it is compromised. Great, and you should fight with everything you have, but sometimes that is not enough. Very often people simply give up and forget about the magic of love. late.
