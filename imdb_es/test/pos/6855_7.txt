Years ago I saw Anatomy, in a house of friends, I do not remember much, and then I saw in the video store that there is a second, not very related to the first that Franka Ponte makes a small cameo. And that was fine, not as good as the first one. I'm seeing the first one again tonight, not the folded collector's edition. I really like German films like this one, it's very interesting and people and cults like the one in the movie could exist, I think, I do not know. But it is very entertaining and terrifying. Anatomy 2 is a bit different and the characters are not as good as the first ones. But if you really thought that the anatomy was interesting and good, you should see the second one.
