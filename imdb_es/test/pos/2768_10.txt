This movie is very good and the whole family would enjoy watching it. When Susie Q arrives on her big night at the prom, she dies in a fatal car accident on her way to the dance of children who are drunk and drug addicts. As the years go by Susie's house is sold and a family moves to the house she loves. Like the child who now lives in the house, he sees Susie and is the only one who can. The two teams, together with their little sister, try to save Susie's parents. Be bankrupt. Protect Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q. This movie will make you fall in love with comedy, sadness and laughter. I hope you see this movie because it is very good. But nobody seems to have it on DVD or Vh and it does not come on TV anymore.
