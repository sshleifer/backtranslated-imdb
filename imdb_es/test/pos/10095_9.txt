Three words: Piece of art. This movie is just great. It is beautiful, sad, frightening and at the same time stimulating. The score remains constantly in my head, the performance is wonderful, the stage is scary and beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> It was more by chance than by the way I saw this movie. At the time I decided to watch this movie, I got bored and read lists of Asian films, which may be good. Well, I saw the title "A tale of two sisters" that sounded very interesting. Then I read the summary of the plot and decided: "You do not only see this movie, you have to buy it". Said, done. I bought this movie and I was hooked from the first minute. <br /> <br /> The plot kept me interested from the beginning to the end; The spin near the end of the movie made me scream. I really did not see something like this coming. And the final scene made me cry ... it just made me cry. It was very sad. <br /> <br /> Well, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie that combines an interesting plot, with scenes and environments of fear. Although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is, as I mentioned before, very sad. But this fits the mood of the movie, is not it?
