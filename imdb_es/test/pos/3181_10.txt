This was an excellent show. He came to PBS in Chicago and I remember that Cindy Herron (of EnVogue) played the teenage daughter. The program dealt with topics such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. It was a middle-class black family that had a teenage daughter and a son who moved to a middle-class neighborhood in Oakland or somewhere else (I do not remember). I remember several episodes, but the one I remember the most was when her cousin had her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first saw it and I was able to keep up with the program. This was a great show. I do not remember the name of the boy who played the son in the show, but I always confused him with Kevin Hooks.
