Valeria, an elegant and pretty young woman, lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although you can have a lover for one night or if someone lives with her, there is no difference in being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take steps to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows him to answer his questions with only a "yes", "no" or "I do not know". . The way to accentuate the loneliness of the character is magnificent. An example would be the distance between both, Massimo and Valeria having a coffee in the same room, separated by subtle divisions and without seeing each other. I could mention several sequences, however, it is better to watch the movie. It is impressive to note that not a single detail is out of control on the part of the director. Although all actions are performed in slow movements, shouting is not necessary, they are not special effects, but only a good performance and a well-written moving story. I loved.
