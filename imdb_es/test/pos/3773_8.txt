So now he's a bit old-fashioned, he's almost 30 years old. Surprisingly, I have this on the BETA tape and it still works fine. If it were a DVD, I would take it in the blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> The humor of drugs is not appreciated today as it was at that time. Then it was not so 'harmful'. Like driving without air bags, seat belts and child seats. I can remember my father crying that he was laughing so much watching this. I had co-workers in the 90s who had seen it and I could get them on the intercom and saying "Iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy". <br /> <br /> Great lines, great parody of the original, and fun for me anyway. Even three decades later!
