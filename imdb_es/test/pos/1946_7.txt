Although I expected to like it a bit more, this was definitely an awesome movie. There were great performances by all the protagonists, and the story, although it was not what I would call chills, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this movie was the look of the image, as it always looked cold and damp and it really seemed to fit the film well. I also thought that the low budget was adapted to this film, because I do not think that a clear image and a clear sound would have worked so well in such a grim film. After all, I did not meet my expectations, but I'm still very happy that I finally sat down to watch this movie.
