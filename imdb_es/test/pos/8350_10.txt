Lady and the tramp ii: the Scamp adventure, I think it's a good movie, but I think the first lady and the tramp movie are better because it's the original and I think the original movies compared to the sequels are better. Lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original, but this time it is the juniors' turn, Lady and Tramp's youngster (scamp) always hates to have been treated with the things that must be done with him, following the rules of the house, bathing everything Time and the easy and pleasant things, Scamp gets angry and runs away with a group of dogs that are left loose. Scamp meets another dog named Angel, both get along and do the things that Scamp's mother and father did, and they ate an Italian meal (Spagetthi and Meatballs, etc.). Then, Scamp realizes that he is loved by his family, especially his friend, who is the baby, Scamp returns and Angel joins the family. I give this movie 10 out of 10.
