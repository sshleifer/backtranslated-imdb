I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone. Damian Chapa and Jennifer Tilly interpreted their roles perfectly. Only the lonely characters bring you closer to the movie. The address was also magnificent. The most creative shots I've ever seen. stuck to the screen throughout the entire movie, not one scene was slow. The movie also has many scenes full of action, cars exploding, etc. The movie is just a masterpiece. If you like really entertaining movies, look at this because you'll be on the edge of your seat all the time. I put this movie on my list of the top ten, because there's never a dull moment in the movie, and that's it. My kind of movie. 2 thumbs up, up to the top !!!!!!!!!
