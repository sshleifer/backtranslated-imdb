The first feature film, Muppet Movie, and perhaps except for The Muppet Christmas Carol, puppeteers from films around the world are still looking for a guide. Disney has done a dis-service to the Muppets and this movie proves it again and again. With the classic comedians and the guest star cameos, it maintains a simple but original plot, classic Muppet jokes, the genius of Paul Williams and the madness of Electric Mayhem, and comes out with an incredible movie, especially when you realize that the main cast they are puppets . Only Croft has approached the genius of Hensen with the puppets. Half of today's fun is that the actor / cameo actress is still alive ???? I can only hope that Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive Kermit and Company from the deadly reach of Disney.
