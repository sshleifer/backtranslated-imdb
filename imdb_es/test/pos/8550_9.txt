This is a finely crafted film with moving sequences, humor and best of all it's a love story. Anthony Quinn is beautifully released and after watching several of his films, this has to be categorized as one of his best performances, in addition to Zorba. The movie makes you wonder if it's filmed in Romania, which apparently is not the case. It will surely deceive even the native Romanians, with their landscape, clothing and authentic ways of life. According to IMDb, it is actually shot in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The story is convincing, which makes you want to see the whole movie to see if you've missed something. It induced me to investigate to discover if this is a film based on the truth, but to my disappointment, it is a film based on a novel, apparently fiction. It seems a bit strange that it really happened, but you never know ... The only problem with this movie is that there do not seem to be Romanian actors, and it's a film about a Romanian character. There are probably many Romanian add-ons at the beginning, but maybe not, it's filmed elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least that's all fine and elegant, in general a masterpiece in cinematography.
