I will not comment on the story as such. I agree with most of the comments from people that this is a good action movie with a well told story and a good performance. <br /> <br /> This film deserves 100% for cinematography because of its opening sequence. The opening shot is impressive and I still have not figured out how they did it. The movie is worth watching only for that shot! Therefore, it is a pity that the DVD that is currently only the movie and not provide information on the realization of the film. Hopefully someone comes up with the special edition. <br /> <br /> And best of all, the opening sequence also becomes the end, leaving you totally guessed! Good thing. A must have for a collector of classic movie moments.
