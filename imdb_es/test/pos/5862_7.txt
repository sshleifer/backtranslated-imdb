"Murder by Numbers" by Barbet Schroeder, starring Sandra Bullock, is a solid work, although not particularly convincing. I am a big fan of Sandra Bullock, and she is effective here as forensic detective Cassie Mayweather, who is not very nice and who is also a broken person. However, there is a sense of detachment inherent in the structure of the story. This is the perfect murder executed by two pampered sociopathic teenagers, Richard (Ryan Gusling) who is the genius, and Justin (Michael Pitt) who is the sympathetic geek. Basically, Richard and Justin kill a young woman, because they have nothing better to do on a school night. They are very intelligent and very arrogant, which is usually not a bad thing, but it just does not work here. The Tony Gayton script does a great job of detailing the investigation of a baffling murder, and it's true by the numbers. We have these two punk children flaunting their superiority, and we just want them to fall. <br /> <br /> This is not a great exploration of the dark side, like Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune" about Claus von Bulow. There are interesting twists in "Numbers". The movie is not so much a thriller, but a study of Cassie's characters. Sandra Bullock balances Cassie's bravery, her fear of letting people in with her, and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. His partner and loving interest type, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is more of a plot not revealing than a real character. Although Chaplin does the thing of amazement very admirably. The other nice touch is to have Richard and Justin involved in a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting of "Numbers" are Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> There are many twists and turns entertaining throughout the film. Everything is done in a very competent manner. I saw the movie about a week ago and, in retrospect, I like it a little more than when I saw it. However, it is simply not an inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve much better, and so do we.
