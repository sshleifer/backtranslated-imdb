This is the best movie I've seen and I love her so much, she's so sad and loving that I could watch this movie again and again. When I first saw it on the Disney channel, it was like I would love to see this movie again. I would love to see this movie every day and I recommend it to anyone. This is really a good movie. For anyone who has not seen this movie and is thinking about it, it is better that they go to see it because it is really good. I love the part when the boy found out about the girl and from that moment I was only in this movie. If I could watch two movies every day, I would be this and loved, those are my two favorite movies, I really love them
