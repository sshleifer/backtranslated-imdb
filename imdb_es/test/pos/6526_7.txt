A DVD of £ 3.50 can be a bet and this was a kind of reward. <br /> <br /> A decent Saturday night movie that entertains if you ignore the obvious flaws of the plot. The special effects are a bit sparse and distant from each other with some repetition (and why does it look like London is always in the 60's?) <br /> <br /> If I had the budget of, say, Armageddon, I'm sure . It would have worked better at the box office since the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> In general, Tycus is due to the history of film B, but if you see it for £ 3.50, then it's worth buying.
