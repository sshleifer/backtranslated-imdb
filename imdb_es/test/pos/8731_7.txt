I was very surprised to learn that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this movie. She seemed very dead and completely educated by Bergman, of 54 (!) Years, in the scenes where they are side by side. If it had been written today, I think Bergman and young Ivan would have ended together (Ingrid is much sexier than Goldie ...) and the two self-absorbed characters played by Matthau and Hawn would be left out. cold. But it was written in the late 1960s and feels like Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the Park. However, Matthau's phrases, Hawn's innocence and Bergman's elegant performance make it very enjoyable to watch.
