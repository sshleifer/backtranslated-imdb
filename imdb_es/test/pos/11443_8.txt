Night Of The Demons is definitely one of the horror movies of the Devils of the 80s in the same sense as the brilliant films of Evil Dead and Demons. This movie combines sexually active teenagers and demons in a hell of a funny movie. A definitive welcome addition after the 80s was surpassed by slasher movies, it was nice to see something a little different. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenagers who gather for a Halloween party in the house of the helmet that used to be the funeral home, organized by Angela. About 40 minutes of drunkenness and sex eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the oven and possessing each and every one of the teenagers. Add some elegant make-up effects, lots of blood and great demons and you'll have a sweet cheese festival from the 80's that would rank as one of the best demon-related films on the list of many horror fans. br /> <br /> First of all, I loved the setting of this movie, "Hull House" is really creepy and terrifying, the perfect setting for a horror movie and, besides, when the Demons emerge, that's when the Action really activates and becomes A night of terror and fear. This movie generated 2 sequels, the first in 1994, which was fine, but nothing was reduced to this, and the third titled Demon House was absolutely terrible. This is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a fun corny movie with Demons that is definitely worth checking out.
