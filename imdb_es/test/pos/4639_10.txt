As many of the other comments I have read have noticed, I fell in love with this movie when I was a child. My sister and I had a copy of the movie in Beta (before VHS) that we sold out. Of course it did not help when our parents sold the BetaMax at a garage sale. Since then we have been trying to find a copy. I, as another commenter, eventually located a rental copy at a local video store. The owner did not want to get rid of the copy after several attempts to beg, bribe and shout my way of owning the tape. GOOD NEWS! I bought a new VHS copy of Midnight Madness recently released for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com two days ago. Finally, Disney has withered. Now, if you just release Song of the South again ... If you like the movie, take it. If you have not seen the movie, it's worth checking: it's a totally stupid but very funny humor (Stephen Furst is very funny).
