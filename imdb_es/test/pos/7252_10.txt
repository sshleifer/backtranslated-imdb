This movie is great Elegant, fun, good acting. I had seen it described in various ways as 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Moskets' and 'Reservoir Fops', which are excellent descriptions. The plot is simple, but does not detract from the enjoyment. Carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and Miller is an excellent drunken gentleman. The ensembles and the costumes are impressive, and the music and the camera work are incredibly unusual for a "costume drama". Sense and sensitivity is definitely not! My recomendation? Go see it, sit down with a huge tub of popcorn and have fun.
