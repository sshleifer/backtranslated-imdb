This is one of my favorite westerns. What a deal! Glenn Ford plays his role in the usual way, smooth, controlled but firm. Ford plays with one of the smaller ranchers In the shadow of the powerful ranch of anchors that wants to swallow the whole territory. Edward G Robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchor ranch and Barbera Stanwyck plays his cunning and cunning wife. There is a lot of action In this western that is quite impressive, the landscape is delicious and the mailbox reaches the picture is impressive and the soundtrack is stereo! I would say that this western had a budget size It looks expensive. One of a series of great westerns by Glenn Ford.
