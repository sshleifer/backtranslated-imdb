WESTERN UNION melodramatically accounts for the laying of telegraph lines between two points to the west. Brothers Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work for Western Union, and Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for the Creightons. Indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop the progress of the United States. This sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by first class music and vibrant color photography. Scott is a bank robber seeking to mend himself, and both he and engineer Young compete for the attention of cheerful Gilmore. Many of the great character actors help the big production advance.
