This low budget crocodile film really delivers the merchandise. The fact that it was inspired by real events would mean little if you end up with a fake-looking crocodile, the evil of C.G.I. or an obvious study environment. Fortunately, none of the above is involved with this fantastic realistic movie. The crocodile is real, there is no C.G.I., and the filming in place takes place in a real marsh in Australia. The actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances, and they succeeded. You can locate yourself in your situation, which is a testimony of how black water translates as entertainment. Highly recommended - MERK
