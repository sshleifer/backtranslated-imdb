I released this movie a week after the death of Ichikawa Kon. I suppose if there is a way to mark the step of a great director, it is to raise a glass of wine while watching one of his best films. Ichikawa had one of the best careers in the Japanese film, but since he never had a distinctive style or theme, he often seems to be overlooked in comparison to his close contemporaries, such as Ozu and Kurosawa (he was a little younger than them, but not by much). He is one of those directors who defies author theories: it is likely that his wife (who wrote the script for this and many other films) was as responsible for the quality of the films as he was. But at his best, he was as good as any Japanese filmmaker at the time. In particular, he had great technical skills, which allows him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner. But in terms of theme, this movie could hardly be simpler: war is hell. No, seriously, it's hell. <br /> <br /> Fire on the Plain does not follow the normal rules of the war genre. There is no real start. We begin as the unfortunate Tamura, who is a regular private (although it is implied that he is more considerate and polite than most others). At one stage it is shown that he understands English, but he is silent when the others ask him how he knows) he is ordered to the hospital, since his unit is already in an atrocious state. The soldiers are defeated and starved. They are no longer an army, just a group of rag bag refugees, hunted by the locals and quite ignored by the Americans, who have larger fish than they fry. Hunger and despair are taking the soldiers to the edge and beyond the madness. <br /> <br /> In typical Ichikawa style, not everything is grim, it is strangely funny in some places (a very dark mood, of course). <Br /> <br /> For me, the highlights of this film are the excellent performances of the drivers and the vivid photography. The characters, in all their humanity, but also their complete loss of humanity, are too credible. This is a rare movie, one that will refuse to be erased from your head, even if you want to forget it.
