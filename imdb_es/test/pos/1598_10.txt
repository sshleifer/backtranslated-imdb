His music, especially what we hear here, is very slow. From the time of Bach's death, composers had been working on ways to make music progress at a slower and slower pace: more than a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are almost as slow as they are. possible for music. -Of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying a tempo of, for example, semi-file = 1, but that tempo would not be the correct tempo. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that plays CORRECTLY at a snail rhythm. Since the slowness in no sense sounds too slow, the "snail rhythm" is the incorrect expression. One critic wrote about a famous director of Wagner: "He does not exceed time, overcomes eternity." As far as I know, this was done as a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have the feeling that in the early 1970s, the directors decided to make the slowest possible films: there is "Death in Venice" and there is "Solyaris". "I much prefer the first one, on the one hand," Solyaris "passes over the line, or some line, and becomes soporific," Death in Venice "is exciting from beginning to end, not much happens, but everything happens in the correct sequence, at the right pace, with the picture you can get lost <br /> <br /> Another way to cheat with music, by the way, is to write something that does not, I do not really have a tempo at all. music sounds slow, but in reality it is not very musical, like many movies feel slow because they lack rhythm and form. "Death in Venice" is not one of them, beautiful in all aspects, it will remind you of timelessness and lack In the context of quality, he does not need theoretical knowledge to respond to Visconti's expertise, as he does to respond to the incompetence of a minor director.
