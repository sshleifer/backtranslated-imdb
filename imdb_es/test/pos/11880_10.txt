Critters 4 is a good movie. A bit of a twist to the series, as it takes place in space, not in an earthly community. Good effects and acting make this film a must see. I would recommend this to Horror / Science Fiction fans from around the world. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of Horror movies like this should visit Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp, Slumber Party Massacre and other Full Moon Pictures movies .
