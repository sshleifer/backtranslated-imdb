The Grand Champion is a bit old-fashioned at first glance. Andrew Morton at Fort Worth Star Telegram said it was best that "If Walt Disney had been from Texas, he would have been a Grand Champion." <br /> <br /> The film does not have the video and the special effects, but it has heart and soul. The kids are great and the variety of stars is amazing. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their children can really see :) (G rating) <br /> <br /> This is a small "simple" movie masterfully crafted in Texas by Texas Barry Tubb. Take your children, take your children to friends, take your grandmother too ... everyone will enjoy it and you will too.
