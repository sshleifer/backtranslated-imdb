This is an entertaining, fast-moving film from the early 1930s. When you have James Cagney at the helm, these "pre-code" movies are even better: just fun things to watch. Usually, when the films are "dated", it is negative, but not in the movies of 1930-1934. Yes, with the jargon and attitudes, dress, hairstyles, etc., they are outdated, but that's a big part of the fun. These movies have an advantage that they are almost always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> They also have a corniness that is attractive and fascinating. You see people, like the juvenile delinquents that you see in this movie and your dumb parents, that you do not see in any period, except in this one (early 30's). At the beginning of this movie, the children go before the judge and you sit down and laugh at these crazy characters who appear in court on behalf of their children, one after the other. Yes, we get the stereotyped emotional Italian father; the Jewish father the Anglo-Saxon mom and some other moms who, in a dramatic way, claim that theirs is "a good boy". Even though things are predictable in some cases, you do not care because everyone here is very fun to watch. <br /> <br /> This also teaches you that children were also punks 75 years ago, stealing, stealing, assault, lying - hey, that's the human condition. This movie debunks the theory that "people were better in the old days." No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was helped by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here, we have a group of "Dead End" children that end up in the School of Reforms. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous and stupidly liberal story has children acting immediately as angels once they direct the show at the reform school; not punished in the least for causing the death of a man and setting fire to the institution (the explanation: he was an evil man and he deserved it.) So far, real justice and reform); and "Patsy" shot a guy who never had to be questioned by the police because he's the good guy. Observe the subtle anti-religious excavation in which the only man seen praying is the evil "warden". That is not coincidence, it is not coincidence. That kind of negative partnership thing has been going on since the Hays Code was canned in the late 60's and it was seen, as seen, in the Precode of the early '30s. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges, by the way, is outstanding in his "bad boy" role of "Mr. Thomson." Especially his voice was very effective and I could see him playing one of those very evil roles as head of an institution in a film adaptation of Charles Dickens. Cagney played his normal role, the tough guy who does not take off the ball and who gets the pretty girl, "Dorothy Griffith", played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro was also effective as leader of the boys, "Jimmy Smith." Only the expression on Darro's face only made his character credible. Something that he was the true star of the film, but I will continue with Cagney. The rest of the reform school, the boys were not too credible and they were really ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to watch. <br /> <br /> I thought the most interesting part of the movie was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these children were and we witnessed good and bad parents and stereotyped in court after the children were arrested. Those scenes are pure things from the 1930s of Dead End Kids. They always showed the kids bad news at the beginning of the movie, but when the story ended, everyone seemed to act more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver, just rude "criminals". It is very unlikely, but it works, in terms of entertainment. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very entertaining but very entertaining film, typical of the Cagney films and the early thirties. Almost all of them qualify at least eight stars for their entertainment value.
