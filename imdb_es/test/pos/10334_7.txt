I have not seen this movie in 30 years, so I do not know if I would like it as much as when I was 12 years old. At that time, however, I loved this movie. This is a great "home movie" for young pre-teens. But be careful with the end. There are tears and harsh emotions. <br /> <br /> Looking back from a 2008 perspective (with much more knowledge of child psychology, politics and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to look again. The carefree and abusive father of Patty, his indifferent mother and his favored sister contributed to make her vulnerable and hungry for company. Patty was sad when Anton left. She was disconsolate when he was killed. The anger that was directed towards her later was shocking. After all, she was only 12 years old. <br /> <br /> What I most hold back is how this movie taught me that even "enemy" soldiers are people as well. Not all German soldiers were hateful Nazis. When I was older, I watched TV shows like Hogan's Heroes and The Rat Patrol that also pointed out that "regular" German soldiers were not the same as the Gestapo. <br /> <br /> The "regular" soldiers were recruited. The Gestapo was chosen among volunteers for their special attitudes of hatred. I think one of the privileges of being Nazi was that they had special assignments and, therefore, they did not go into battle. Interrogation and torture. <br /> <br /> Later, during the cold war, I would think of Russian soldiers and remember SOMGS. They taught us that the Soviet Union was "evil". But the reality was that the Russian soldiers were not willing to destroy the United States. They had a job. His government probably told them that our government was willing to destroy their way of life. What, in a certain way, was true, since EE. UU He fought to end communism. <br /> <br /> The lesson is still applicable today. The German soldiers were not the same as the Nazis, just as the Muslims are not the same as Al Qaeda.
