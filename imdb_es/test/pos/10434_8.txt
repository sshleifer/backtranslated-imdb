The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few comedies for teenagers that I really enjoyed. The theme and performance were well above the usual guts that Hollywood was (and still is) developing these days. But for a time, the smaller studios produced movies about teenagers that were not toned down or softened for the kids. The men behind this production were your friends from Cannon. <br /> <br /> Three teenage friends are trying to lose their virginity while still in high school. They will do anything or anything to achieve the goal of their dreams. The sensitive one of the group (Andrew Monsoon) is to find the right girl, while his two best friends will take everything they can. One day, the boy finds his perfect girl (Diane Franklin). But fate would play one of his bad tricks. Her best friend moves and removes her from her feet. After beating her, the sensitive girl helps the girl get up and pays for her abortion. He still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile, her best friend has a very violent fight to have the dreamy girl pregnant. Still, he does everything he can to make her love him. The night comes when he asks the question. But her heart breaks when she sees her dancing with her old best friend. With tears, the boy left the party. <br /> <br /> What I enjoyed about this movie was that it did not hit anything. Instead of being full of false situations, he was very realistic, honest and brutal. The movie is full of funny moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this movie to fans of teen comedies. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
