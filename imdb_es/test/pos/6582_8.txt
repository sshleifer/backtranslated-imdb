Imagine the most depressing winter you will ever experience: gray instead of white, without battles for snow and, certainly, without wonders. This is the Finland represented by 'Frozen Land'. This film follows a group of people whose lives are strangely linked to each other with results beyond anyone's nightmares. Yes, most of the characters are defective in the way that only celluloid characters can do it - completely annoying and frustrating to watch, however, for some reason, you want your luck to change. <br /> <br /> With a bit of humor placed at random and a cast that brings together the somewhat traditional faces of Finland, Frozen Land offers a glimpse of the Finnish mentality that, despite its depressing downward spirals, manages to restore something of faith in humanity. More than Kaurism√§ki, to say the least.
