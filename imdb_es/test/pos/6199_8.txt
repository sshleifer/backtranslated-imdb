* BE CAREFUL OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> A friend told me to review this series, and I'm glad I accepted his words. <br /> <br /> I read the synopsis The cover of the DVD and it intrigued me immediately. The main protagonist is the Muslim? No way, this is the first time! It is an agent of the FBI that is under deep cover to penetrate a possible sleeping cell in Los Angeles; And get this, he is a practicing Muslim. At first, I was a little skeptical, half expecting some hero or antagonist to tell us that maybe it's more foolish, gratuitous and senseless than fanatics fans ... let's be honest, many of the shows have been guilty of this . <Br /> <br /> But then I saw the first three episodes, and I thought: Well, this is good. It was not until episode four ("Academic") when he was well and really impressed. I would like to congratulate the great writing and also, excellent performances of the actors. I love the complexity of each of these characters: they are not two-dimensional cardboard cut types, good and bad. Michael Ealy offers a wonderful and credible performance as the FBI's Muslim agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed, treading the fine line between being a good Muslim and being a man with flaws. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth: Farik is not the typical oily stereotype of the Middle East, but simply someone who really believes in his cause and does not see himself as a fanatic, but a man willing to do any Extreme measure to justify your beliefs. He is very charismatic and authoritarian. But I would say that it was Alex Nesic's performance that clearly left an impression on me in "Academic." His depiction of his character's emotional struggle was staggering, divided between the soft words of a Muslim scholar who encouraged him to return to non-aggressive form because it is the only acceptable form in the eyes of God and Farik's persuasion to believe it. contrary. <Br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing more shows like this one, and not a series of one-man shows of a ridiculously high octane rating. He is intelligent and open-minded.
