When I was a child my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I admired Dorothy Dandridge very much and wanted to be like her. I fell in love with Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And Sammy Davis Jr. was as great as Sportin Life. The music was fucked. When I had my first child and the movie appeared on television, I let him see it, and to this day he has never forgotten this movie. He loved it. I will always remember Porgy and Bess. It has a special place in my heart then and now. I really want to restore this movie, because it was one of the best movies that has been with a "Black Cast".
