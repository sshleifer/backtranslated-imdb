The lives of three different and distant individuals intersect with the brutal killing of one by another. The one-hour movie only reveals the event that brings the three people together only after half of the film is over. I have seen other segments of the "Dekalog", but this seemed the most scarce in dialogue and, nevertheless, the most fascinating in its structure. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a law student who practices a false defense plea. for a man accused of murder. Obviously, the same arguments must have been repeated by man as a full-fledged lawyer, but this is never shown on the screen (at least in the 1-hour short version of Dekalog 5). We are made to imagine that this must have been the case. A taxi driver who is a misanthrope, has two facets in his character: the good side feeds an old dog, cleans his taxi meticulously, picks up dirty rags pulled by people who lack civic sense and remembers his wife as he dies; the bad side scares the little poodles, refuses to take a drunk, probably worried that he vomits in the taxi, and he glances at the pretty girls. The repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy, throws stones from the bridges on the fast moving traffic and pushes the strangers towards the urinals without any provocation, is also a person who can make innocent girls laugh. Kieslowski's film and the script present the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> However, the film does not deal with capital punishment but rather as a treatise on murder. The Fifth Commandment "Thou shalt not kill" is explored theologically ("Even God saved Cain ..."), sociologically, the tenderness of the brutes towards the children and the poor abandoned dogs, and psychologically (after the effects of a night of drunk with a male friend) that led to the accidental death of his sister, whose photography he carries with him, which makes ordinary people become murderers: this is never fully explained, but the suggestions are innumerable. <br /> <br /> In Kieslowski's world, there is a pattern in which events and people are interrelated in a cosmic sense (note the similarity of clown with the killer, as it hangs from the mirror in the booth). and the idealistic young lawyer seem to ask us to look at the Commandment literally and figuratively: why do we kill? Are the legally murdered people really bad? Is there a force beyond society (the night of drunkenness that led to the life of a girl) that makes us abominable killers? <br /> <br /> It would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two murders in the film, both without mercy. The film invites the viewer to contemplate why God asks us not to kill. <br /> <br /> I understand that Kieslowski made a longer version of the film. But even this short version of 1 hour is magnificent with its gloomy and sparse script, intelligent editing, interesting cinematography and first-class direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> This segment anticipates the healthiest Dekalogs 6.7 and 8.
