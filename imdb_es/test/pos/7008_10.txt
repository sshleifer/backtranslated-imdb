While most of the films that pit humans against terrestrial extraterrestrial terrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the 'Aliens' series, Pitch Black is presented as a good piece of science fiction and an excellent movie for everyone. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is lighting. This film uses beautifully different colors, shades and intensities of light that create the environment and give a unique feeling to the film itself, something different from the "normal" film lighting to which we are generally subjected. Vin Diesel gives life to his character in an excellent way, skilfully avoiding the routine portrait of the hardened criminal. After all, the film is about the personal journey of Riddick (the character of Diesel), so fortunately Vin does not drop the ball. The rest of the cast (with the exception of the talented and beautiful Claudia Black) was unknown to me, but they all became wonderful performances, animating the various characters with unique quirks and manners. Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a great movie without the resources of an excessive budget. Special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are not the only focus, as in many high-budget "box office successes". It's a great movie because it uses science fiction as a means to tell an engaging and provocative story, instead of telling a mediocre story to use the science fiction flash.
