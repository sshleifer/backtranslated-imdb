A varied team between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot and the guy who plays Bana in Seinfeld, go up to a research post in the Arctic where all the members have died killing each other or killing themselves. They discover that there is a worm, a virus, which is parasitic to the point of madness and death. The problem is that, after a certain dog lashed out, anyone could get infected, but who? This is not only my favorite episode of season 1, but also one of my favorites of the program. The atmosphere of the Arctic encloses the characters and, of course, as Carpenter 's The Thing, it is very fun to see these temperamental characters suddenly begin to appear in dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy, I did not care at all. The drama between the characters ends up working more than normal due to the tension and because all the actors (including the boy Bana) understand what happens in the story. And, as usual, I loved the ambiguity of the ending. Highly recommended
