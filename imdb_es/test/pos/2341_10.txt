A truly accurate and unpleasant look in modern life. It could be established in any city in the United Kingdom. <br /> <br /> I live in an urbanization in Glasgow and I can relate very well to this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the situations and the characters are too realistic but not predictable. <br /> <br /> The actors are terribly believable, I felt like I was spying on my neighbors. It was an intimate immersion in the lives of frail and hopeless people. I was moved by some scenes. <br /> <br /> I loved the way this movie was shot. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a must see.
