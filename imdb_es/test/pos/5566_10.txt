This series is very underestimated. Like many others, I ran into Farscape after the series had been canceled. He bought Season 1 and I was surprised to find a written drama with a balanced mix of suspense, romance, wit and, of course, science fiction. From the beginning, he got a 10 for being the first series or movie that satisfies us the way our hero, and all the aliens he contacts, speak English. Well, some others have avoided the problem, but Farscape did the best they could. The point is that the writers pay close attention to the details to make the show as believable as possible. <br /> <br /> With so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that such balanced and entertaining series as Farscape do not. Get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. While we enjoy the four seasons and, fortunately, the four-hour miniseries, maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
