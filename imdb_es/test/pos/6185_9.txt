Ernst Lubitsch gave us wonderful movies like Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop Around the Corner, Being or Not Being, and other wonderful movies. But people often consider Bluebeard's eighth wife as one of Lubitsch's weakest films. <br /> <br /> But I consider this film as an important film. This film began the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for Ninotchka by Ernst Lubitsch. Of course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the process of creating scripts. After that, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. Together they wrote the script for famous movies like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd. <br /> <br /> There are many fun moments in the movie. I thought "The Taming of the Shrew" was very funny. There is a famous expression called "Movies are parts of life". And here is a great example of the eighth wife of Bluebeard (1938). <br /> <br /> In the first session of the writing process, Lubitsch raised this question: how do the boy and girl meet? Billy Wilder quickly suggested that the opening scene should be the men's shop of a department store. "The child is trying to buy a pajama", improvised in an imperfect way. "But he sleeps alone at the top, he's thrifty, so he insists on buying only the top, the employee says he should also buy the pants, it seems like a catastrophe, then the girl comes into the store and buys the pants because she sleeps. only in the pants ". Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were delighted. It was not until months later that they discovered that Billy Wilder himself is a tops sleeper and that he had been taking care of the idea for months, waiting for the opportunity to use it. <br /> <br /> I received this information from a book. I think this film can be considered as the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Right after this movie, he made wonderful movies like Ninotchka, The Shop Around the Corner and To Be Be or Be Be. <br /> <br /> I think Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitsch threw Gary Cooper out, probably because Gary Cooper played with Long Fellow Deeds, who inherited Frank Capra's fortune. Mr. Deeds goes to the city. But this is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> As for me, I really enjoyed the movie. I rate this movie with 9 out of 10. Lubitsch's films are different, because his films are part of life.
