Many people are making fun of Steven Seagals' acting skills. And I really see why if I remember fire down. Well ... well, his other films are acceptable (in relation to his performance). <br /> <br /> After reading reviews about The Patriot, I did not expect anything from this movie. I just got through Fire Down Below and read a lot that The Patriot was even worse. So I was really surprised by this. In my opinion it is one of his best movies. If I had more action sequences and a couple of fight scenes, it would be THE best. I liked the history of the direction and the actors. Cammilla Belle was simply amazing. She will have a great film career in the future. The few action scenes were very well done. And Steven Seagal was very credible in his unusual role.
