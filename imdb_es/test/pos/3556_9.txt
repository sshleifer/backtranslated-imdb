I almost did not see "Hi-De-Hi!" I think it must have been the title that discouraged me. In those days, the Welsh editions of 'The Radio Times' were only used to print titles of certain programs without imparting a piece of information about what they really were. 'Hello-Of-Hello!' He suggested a bad questioning program organized by Leslie Crowther or, worse, an inane import from the United States. But I managed to capture a later episode and I was surprised to find it written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. <br /> <br /> As was the case with 'Dad's Army' and 'It Is not Half Hot Mum', Perry based it on personal experiences, in this case his time at a Butlins holiday camp. Before cheap air travel appeared in the 1960s, these camps sprang up along the British shores, providing entertainment for working-class families and earning millions for their owners. <br /> <br /> (As a matter of interest, I worked at One of those camps in the 80s as a chef: Barry Island, South Wales, is known by all as "Shag Land" for reasons in which I will not go in. "<br /> <br /> At the end of the years' In the 1950s, it began when university academic Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell) took over as entertainment manager of Maplin, a job for the He was not prepared, his staff included resident comedian Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his partner Spike (Jeffrey Holland), the miserable Punch and Judy man Mr.Partridge (Leslie Dwyer), the ballroom dancers Barry (Barry Howard and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves) Diane Holland, and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc), who coveted Fairbrother at every opportunity, Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show, though it was cleaner than Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose driving ambition was to be a 'Yellowcoat' (all the important members of the person they used them.) A number of sexy girls also occupied these coats, especially "Sylvia" by Nikki Kelly and "Betty" by Rikki Howard, sculptural. We never saw Joe Maplin, the owner. He communicated to his staff in the form of non-grammatical missives, that poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. "Hi-Of-Hello!" It was the greeting of the campers, usually met with the equally inane 'Ho-De-Ho! <br /> <br /> One fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognized most of the real-life characters. <br /> <br /> I always found Bovis as the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic, like Archie Rice, was the comedian whose great opportunity never came, reduced to cracks for the fun of a drunken nightly audience. He took advantage of his position to enjoy some benefits, and in a memorable episode, Fairbrother's patience broke down and told him: "Lies, Ted! All the lies!" <br /> <br /> As with all the other Perry / Croft series, the cast was excellent, particularly Cadell and Shane. The rush of Ruth Madoc 'Gladys' got nervous (it's no wonder that Anne Robinson hates the Welsh!), But the misanthropic 'Mr.Partridge' by Leslie Dwyer and the 'jockey' Fred Qulley of Lesfix Dowyer are more than compensated. <br /> <br /> The visual gag everyone remembers is a Mr.Partridge drunk watching a pantomime mounted on a real horse along the beach. Looking at the bottle of whiskey in her hand, she decides to stay with her and instead throws away the banana she had been eating! <br /> <br /> With its frothy mix of 1950s nostalgia and cheeky banter, 'Hi-De'Hi' was a huge success for BBC-1 in the 1980s, which resulted in a massive increase in the reserves for Butlins and Pontins. However, it was downhill when Cadell left to go back to the theater. I never accepted his replacement, squad leader Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse still, the death of Leslie Dwyer stole the show from one of his best characters. Kenneth Connor was hired to replace him as 'Uncle Sammy'. <br /> <br /> Period adjustment sometimes caused problems; In one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy, who for some reason was dressed like a shark. The revealing disguises they wore were wrong for that time. They still looked great in them, so who complains? In another, Ted sang the success of Tom Jones 'Delilah' to the campers. It was not composed (by Les Reed and Barry Mason, by the way) until 1968. <br /> <br /> Maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was that of Peggy (now a yellow coat) alone in the camp . , jumping in the air and screaming (what else?) 'Hi-De-Hi!'. <br /> <br /> I do not rate it as well as the other Perry and Croft programs, but its popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British comedies to generate a tremendous public affection, mainly because it presented nice characters in a recognizable environment. Good evening campers!
