Even an old and cynical DOCTOR WHO fan like me can run out of breath when watching an episode of my favorite show. It happened earlier during the Eccleston finale and it happened watching this episode. However, this does not happen often, but The Impossible Planet is an example of the program and television at its best. This is an amazing television. <br /> <br /> The doctor and his partner land in a mysterious place where they see strange writings on the wall and the audience (many of those who will move behind the sofa) will be instantly paralyzed. A door opens and horrible monsters begin to stalk the travelers of time. This could have taken a full 25 minute episode in the original program, but all this takes place in the pre-title sequence. It is possible to miss the most extensive format of the original program, but at least this new series is well drawn and if we give away a disappointing story, at least it is only for a week <br /> <br /> There is nothing to disappoint a spectator here. It is the DOCTOR WHO at its best. Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong have struggled to create a story that will be considered in the coming years. They do it by building a narrative loaded with doom. The doctor and Rose lose the Tardis and are trapped with the protagonists in the very distant future. It is interesting the amount of stories that never present this type of plot point where the Doctor and his colleagues no longer have access to the Tardis, which makes it a more intriguing type of story. Undoubtedly, the highlight is the scene in which Scooti goes to find Toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and invites her out. Everything, from the performance, makeup and music of Murray Gold, makes this a scene that really surprises your audience. <br /> <br /> I imagine that immediately after this episode, the BBC switchboards received a tsunami of complaints from anguished parents who said how traumatized their children were. were . It took them several hours to get them out of the family's couch and they now refuse to sleep with the lights off. To make this complaint would be to deny the magic of DOCTOR WHO. Yes, it can terrify and yes, those images burn in the mind of a child, something they will never forget, even if they live to be a hundred years old. But I bet my life that these same "traumatized" children would have spent the week pleading that it does not matter what allows them to see the next episode.
