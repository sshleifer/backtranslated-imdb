I saw "9 Souls" at the 12th Athens International Film Festival (September 2006), where Toshiaki Toyoda, the director of the film was also present and answered many questions from the audience. This road movie is about 9 fugitives, all characters very different from each other. They decide to stay together traveling with their red truck through Japan. Each time the van stops, we see these 9 fugitives trying to escape from their past to build a new life or fulfill a dream. However, no matter how hard they try, it seems impossible and their violent past goes after them and leads to their final destruction. <br /> <br /> Although it is a very pessimistic movie, it is not a dark movie. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful images, surreal elements and elegant humor. The heroes of Toyoda can not escape from their "prison" and face divine punishment (?) For their "crimes". They are small pieces of a beautiful painting, where the tower of Tokyo, represented by a huge knife in reverse, prevails!
