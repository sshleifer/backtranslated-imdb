I've been waiting to see this movie since the first time I saw the trailer, and I'm very happy now that I've done it. It is really a wonderful movie. The actors are excellent, the writing is fresh and real, everything was very successful. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can not wait to see him in the movie "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" this December. Romola Garai is also wonderful. Be sure to visit her in "I Capture the Castle" or "Nicholas Nickleby", two of my favorite movies. In general, I think I liked this movie because it did not fade. It is a difficult subject to tell a story, since it is very likely that you offend many people or you go bankrupt and become an excessively sentimental-sugar-sweet love festival. But they avoided doing it completely, and instead made a film that is real, honest and moving, yes, but never exaggerated. Very well done. Surprisingly well done. Go out and see it, and you'll know exactly what I mean.
