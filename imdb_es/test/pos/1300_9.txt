Let's face it. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly clich√©, since the dramas and movies of the Korean romance go. In the first place, there are a couple of brothers lost a long time ago, one of whom falls in love with the other. Secondly, there is a not very popular girl and two beautiful and popular boys who fall in love and fight for her. In the third place, one of the characters suffers a tragic illness that, finally, takes away his life. <br /> <br /> However, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But as the actors fit perfectly into the roles, the film is fascinating, I honestly could not stop seeing. Kang Dong Won, despite her pretty face, offers an amazing and heartbreaking performance, not to mention Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun, in addition to all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. .
