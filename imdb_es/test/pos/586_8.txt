A delight from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Muppets, then I just have to feel sorry for you. This excellent film is not limited to taking advantage of the popularity of the Muppets, but is a well conceived and well written film in its own right. It has excellent songs and that thread of melancholy melancholy that was always present in the creations of Jim Henson and that is more personified in the character of Kermit the Frog. I always responded to this as a child, and that is what makes the Muppets still pleasant to me as an adult when other material directed at children drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> A huge cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this movie look like a children's version of "Around the World in 80 Days," except it's 80 times better. <br /> <br /> Grade: A
