This is a movie that I love above all others. I try to revisit the main places of the film in Oakworth and Oxenhope whenever I can, which helps to restore those magical qualities that this film seems to embody in such a unique way, recalling a more friendly and educated time, with its unspoken affirmations that People really do. It matters, that family life is not just another disposable, and that life is really worthwhile (although sometimes, we can doubt that). In short, a film that soon brings tears to my eyes, perhaps helped by the deeply evocative music, some melodies are cheerful (like the Perks' melody, played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the touching melody when the family started for the first time Off for Yorkshire does not know what is coming, and the little disturbing melody that plays on a clarinet alone (or is it an oboe?) that precedes the sudden changes of fortune felt by children. <br /> <br /> This is both a film for adults and children, appealing to the eternal child in all of us, a key that reactivates without effort those values ​​and deep feelings and apparently lost a long time ago, that are normally swept by the demands of modern day-to-day life. This is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we spectators must make it what we want, and there are well-received touches of humor that are sometimes added, such as the arrival of the aunt or, in a different way, Earthly level, the room scene on Perks' birthday: "Okay, Bert, how's your birthday!" I must know every scene, every line of this film, and yet, so great is the magic that every time I see, it is as if I am opening a box of delights for the first time, savoring every moment, sometimes with humor, sometimes ... .. well, very different As Peter says in the movie: "It's perfect, more perfect than you know". And so it is!
