Most families will recognize the similarities between their own family and the one created through the brilliant performance of Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates an image on the screen that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and one worthy of a Golden Globe nomination. The control of her emotions is so intact that, at any moment of the movie, she can take advantage of them and launch a unforgettable scene. Susan is also amazing in this film, since once again she chose a role that is very different from any other and takes it with a true professionalism. <br /> <br /> Any Natalie fan would have seen the movie based on her past. Successes, but you should also see it because of the emotions that are released during the movie. It is a truly humiliating experience.
