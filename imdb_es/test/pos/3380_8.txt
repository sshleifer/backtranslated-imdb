I just saw this movie on its first night out of curiosity and pure nostalgia. I liked it (I did not love it) "Mork & Mindy" when I was a child, especially because of the crazy and energetic performance of Robin William. This movie reminded me why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised, and I was not expecting anything more than a chronological numeral painting that retells the show (which somehow was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from the fighter street buffoon to the star of national television, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his wife, who suffers so much. And I take off my hat to star Chris Diamantopoulos while portraying Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity and heart; Not just a nice impression, although it was even dead. (In an unrelated note, I realized that Robin's struggles were, in a way, similar to those of Andy Kaufman, who was unappreciated by the television network and held back creatively, but that is the " Taxi "behind the biographical scene). <br /> <br /> In short, this was a very nice movie, in which I felt I had to know a little more about the man behind the Orkan. The performance was solid for everyone, never melodramatic as he suspected, and the story went well. The performances that were particularly good were those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi bothers Robin was a scream!). It's not a great masterpiece by any means (I would have liked to have seen a bit more about Pam Dawber), but you can definitely see it, especially for fans of Robin Williams and "Mork & Mindy". Nanoo, nanoo!
