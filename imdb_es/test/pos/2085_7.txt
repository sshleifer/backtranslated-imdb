Zachary Scott does what he does best, that is, plays a worm, in "Danger Signal", a 1945 B film also starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he receives his money. Following his latest murder, he rents a room in the house of the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and his mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself at Emerson, and she is dazzled. In the middle of the romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home after medical treatment. When she mentions that she was Uncle Wade's favorite and he left her $ 25,000 (a lot of money by 1945 standards), Scott loses interest in poor Hilda and makes a play for Anne. Anne looks like Rebecca from Sunnybrook Farm until she starts sneaking around with Scott. During the night, she is 10 years old and becomes completely unpleasant with her sister. Finally, receiving the message that her tenant is not good, Hilda calls a psychiatrist (Rosemary DeCamp) to take him out and advise him. <br /> <br /> Psychological dramas were in vogue during and after World War II, and Scott does an excellent job as a mild sociopath. This was his forte: as a weak-willed sheriff on "Flamingo Road," he exhibited no real presence. As for two times, we saw him do that in "Mildred Pierce", where he proved to be particularly good at that. Emerson is a stenographer of books, with her hair pulled back from her face and big glasses, but after hours she is charming and gives a great performance. DeCamp was always an underestimated actress: here, she has a soft German accent and is charming. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining movie, although it is a very routine story. Acting really elevates it.
