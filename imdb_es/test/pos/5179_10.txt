Seeing Gary Busey in a G-rated film was the first and a good one at that. I do not know much about the director, but obviously he knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them. Where did Jillian Clare come from? My children love her! The only thing I remember about Christopher Atkins was Blue Lagoon. Disney needs to see this movie and put it to work. The wife thinks he is very cute. I liked what he did with his character. It seemed so real. What we liked most was the message that this movie sends. Greed stinks and faith, love and family wins! This is the first low budget DVD that we bought and that has many things. The producers did this for kids and the kids loved it. They liked the music and all the extras on the DVD. The director probably will not stick to family movies, but I hope he does, because he really knows how to get the most out of kids, animals and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was great and seeing Gary Busey acting like a dog was even more fun. There was not much we did not like about this one. It's hard to find a family movie without all the raw humor, and Quigley was pleasantly surprised.
