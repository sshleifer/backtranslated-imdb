There's only one racist joke in this short by Daffy Duck, which is basically when Daffy rides Black Beauty, she's a black woman. In part, I can understand why this joke was included, since at that time few people did not know how rude it was to be a racist and it was not yet illegal to discriminate against blacks. <br /> <br /> Apart from this point, "A Coy Decoy" is basically a fun and interesting short film where Daffy meets the characters in the books and does things in the books. I really liked this short (despite the other reviewers here). The way Daffy is so enamored with the mechanical duck is vaguely disturbing, but very funny at the same time. Porky is a good edition of the episode, although it was not vital for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves also in those days, terrible animals thirsty for blood, which of course have never been (unless they are very hungry). I also liked the animation style used and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For people who are totally interested in Daffy Duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist jokes in cartoons, enjoy "A Coy Decoy"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
