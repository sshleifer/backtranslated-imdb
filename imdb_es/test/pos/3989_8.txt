I've always liked this movie, I've seen it many times, but I've always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I do not think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what it was: P They do not look like that in Romania ... Anyway, going back to the story, Ghita Muresan played quite a lot Well, but as someone said before me, your English needs to improve. <br /> <br /> And there were also some funny moments and some tragic / sad parts. It's worth being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love. I have recommended it to everyone. It's not the best movie of all, but it was nice!
