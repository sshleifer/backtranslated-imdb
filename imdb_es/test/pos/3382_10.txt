This is the best movie I've seen in my life. It has all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that even war can not destroy. <br /> <br /> The most splendid casting I've seen in my life. Patrick Swayze and James Read were the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you see part 1, you will want to see everything. Some of my friends saw part of the movie in my house and then they went out and bought it. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of civil war, but this movie made my grandchildren take an interest in history. Any movie that can make children learn history is great. I have Books I, II and III and when the girls come from Florida every year, they want to see North and South.
