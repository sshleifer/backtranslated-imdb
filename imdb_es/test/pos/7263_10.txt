I usually hate period movies. Living in England is a nightmare at this time if you are allergic to period dramas, what I do. However this is the best. He does not take himself seriously, and Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are very well together, Liv Tyler is also good, although her English accent is unreliable! <br /> <br /> The movie has everything for someone who just wants to go to the cinema to have fun. It has action, adventure, drama and comedy. I'm not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean, but I hope they do. It would be a shame if the American public misses this movie. It shows that English filmmakers can produce something that does not involve oath and constant sex. Both have this but in a balanced format. Iain Robertson's portrait of good for knighthood is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class group are hilarious. <br /> <br /> As the trailer for 'The Spy Me Shagged Me' was ported to say ... "If you see another movie" ... this spring do Plunkett and Macleane. It's fun, action and, of course, Jonny Lee Miller with an English accent for a change!
