This is one of the funniest television shows of today. It hits the brand 99% of the time. Usually, after seeing a comedy after a few years, the actors become cartoonish, as if trying to become the most beloved characters they perform. These actors in my opinion have remained faithful to their roles. The chemistry is still there, the writing has not diminished and I'm still looking forward to seeing it. The family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so far away as to make it appear that the writers are reaching into an empty bag trying to keep the program for another season. It is one of the few programs that I see without the remote control in my hand for a quick change.
