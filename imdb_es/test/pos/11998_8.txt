This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite episodes of Columbo. The performance is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is witty and the direction is fabulous. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, who acts brilliantly in every episode of Columbo, acts particularly well in this episode. <br /> <br /> Also, excellent performances by Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp. <br /> <br /> The ending is absolutely brilliant and I love the way Columbo describes it. <br /> <br /> This is a Columbo movie that DOES NOT WANT, go wrong.
