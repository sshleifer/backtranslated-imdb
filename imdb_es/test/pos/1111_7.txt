John and his wife Emily, accompanied by their son Edward, venture from the comfortable surroundings of the suburbs to the village where the husband spent part of his childhood. There has been a death in the family and John must begin the procedures to take control of a dilapidated old house, located next to the sea and once inhabited by an old man who apparently has committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Skeptical about the In the circumstances of death, John divorces his family and reality, puts his own life in danger and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead. <br /> <br /> The movie now changes, nothing is what it seems - people from his past appear, in full Gothic / mountain glory - his wife worries about his mental state - and his son disappears into the reeds. <br /> <br /> John discovers that the old man did not do it. Do not commit suicide, that his death is much more mysterious and strange. In a chilling finale, we learn that the events of the film never really happened and that the little boy, Edward, who is struggling to come to terms with his parents' divorce process, imagined the whole narrative. <br /> <br /> Modern Love is a macabre piece of high art cinema, a perplexed and perverse work, full of vague suggestions and unexplored tracks. He has no humor and apparently does not care about the current trends of Indie, which validates its creators, but also leaves him stunned. <br /> <br /> But the weaknesses of this Australian film are totally surpassed by its pure cinematic muscular vision, its blood precision mental and uncompromising and its extravagant Euro horror. The bastardy of the script rules and the lack of slippery dialogues become insignificant in a context of noir and a leading performance that must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressively strange Australian films in years.
