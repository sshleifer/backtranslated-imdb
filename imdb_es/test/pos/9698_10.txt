Everything you could hope for if you are a Jackass fan. As always, Knoxville and his crew risk life and limbs just for our visual entertainment. If you are a fan of the series and the first movie, you will not be disappointed as most of the sequels do. The jokes that are deceived are twice as funny, cruel, raw as ever and the tricks and challenges are twice as difficult as any other episode of Jackass you have seen. If your fan does not waste time, check it yourself because, by Jackaass standards, this movie is a simple 10 out of 10 only for the initial credits, I can not go into details without the spoilers, but you have to see to believe.
