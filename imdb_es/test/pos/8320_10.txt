"Walking with dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in all aspects. Kenneth Branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen. The script for the documentary really sounds as if the researchers and writers had done their homework, it's very insightful and it hooks you up and never lets you go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it should be. But the visual effects and the stage are what make this documentary work so well. The scenery is impressive, and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to the simply amazing effects. This is very informative with such a good concept and appeals not only to adults but also to children. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a must see. Not only did I love this, it's probably the best documentary I've ever seen. In any case, it could have been longer, apart from the fact that this is perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
