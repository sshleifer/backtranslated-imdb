A study of one of those universally familiar, physical and / or emotional states: isolation. I think the movie also comments on cultural displacement. <br /> <br /> The film presents the experiences of two Turkish men (cousins). One has money (and the comforts that are obtained by having it done with a stable income); The other has none and goes in search of work. They are not happy either. Do not wait for life to be celebrated here: this is loneliness, warts and all. <br /> <br /> The film offers a powerfully sombre journey through the "lowlands" of the human condition. Brave filming. From my point of view, well acted and well filmed (the outdoor shots at the port are my favorites). A film that should inspire gratitude in anyone who is not alien to happiness and fulfillment in life (not to mention employment); Everyone else will find a partner in this movie. A film with all the heat and rhythm of an ice floe. Expect a bitter pill, not a "happy pill".
