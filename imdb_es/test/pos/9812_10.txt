Simply an amazing bittersweet film that portrays a side of life that is often skipped by feeling good movies. I saw this as a child and I went back to that very recently and fell in love again. <br /> <br /> As a child, it aroused my interest purely by the construction of an airplane, as an adult I was captured in the dark world and a young man escaped from that world. <br /> <br /> The representation of the King was excellent, the style of the camera chosen with shots and low shots focused on the actions and movements of the hands. It seemed to me well done, personally I can not remember anything done in that style and it adds to the character and presents it as an almost non-human force (which may not be very far from reality) makes interesting developments <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing them any day
