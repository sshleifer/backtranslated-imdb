I really do not have anything to add to all the other comments, except this: for me, the movie looked like a silent movie that slowly adapted to the sound. The text boards that bring history throughout reinforced that impression, I suppose. Along the way, the actors were allowed to leave the performance as if it were a theater; Marguerite Churchill looks a lot like a heroine from the first silent film at the beginning of the film, but in the end she is allowed finer expressions. Gus, the Swede ?, reminded me of the comic characters of Shakespeare's plays, and Windy sounded like an early Donald Duck. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised that everything was filmed outdoors, in the location. Even though the dust of all the cars, horses and cattle darkened the view, in reality it must have been true for the true ones colonists! It also became clear to me that many of those Indians must have been real, and I did not detect any overt racism towards them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a true Wayne fan through John Ford's cavalry trilogy, and thought that the stage coach was Wayne's first star, this movie was a revelation. The plot is very simple, again it reminds me of a silent movie, but the truth is very real! An incredible movie that has been made with that technique and in those conditions in 1930.
