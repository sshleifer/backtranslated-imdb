He brought Philip Larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the best performances of all time, and not just those that are measured by popularity. It shows a crude description of Larkin's life as the best unrecognized poet of his time, which is exactly as he would have wished, such was his disdain for cankers and medallions. It dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of Philips' observations of our relationship to our own mortality, and puts it in a way that seems to have missed even the great philosophers. For anyone interested in deep observations of our relationship with life, love and death, this is a necessity.
