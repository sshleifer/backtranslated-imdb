After spending five years in prison, Dr. Thomas Reed, played by the incomparable Vincent Ventresca, exiles to Purgatory Flats and ends up at the bar. Soon he meets the delicious Sunny, with the face of an angel (Alexandra Holden). "You are evil." he says to her. "You have no idea." she responds while taking a few sips of her Slo Comfortable Screw and drags languidly her cigarette. Reed is intertwined in the violent problems of his family and the story of the fatal woman develops against the desolation and despair of the western city that drains of oil. Great performances Excellent work of entourage. And some scenes of lust that sizzle like the sun in purgatory.
