This was an excellent return when it came out. He had some of the best talent available and a funny story. Between Candace Cameron and Tatyana Ali, it was hard to choose who is cutest, and to add Carlton from Fresh Prince and all the other big names, and you get a blockbuster. Ok, made for a television box office success, but anyway. If you can find this movement, do not miss it. <br /> <br />
