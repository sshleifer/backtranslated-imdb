Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but from time to time he can have a klinker. The beginning of this begins almost basically with one character after another. You have Cary Elwes who is charming and talented, but she can not do comedy. His expressions on the camera show that even he can not believe the inanities in the script. Richard Lewis looks bored and distracted without much to do and Amy Yasbeck is stuck in the acting mode of high school. Dave Chapelle shows a wide variety of comedies and hamming for the camera, and Mark Blankfield is largely repressed in the role of the blind man, but still manages to show a wide variety of comedies. Eric Allen Kramer does not have much to do, but the few scenes he has are binding. The best roles are those of Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks for when it appears. Dom DeLuise has a funny turn as a Mafia Don employing Clint Eastwood, but on the downside, some of the jokes are not very funny, while some of the really fun ones seem stolen from Mel's other movies.
