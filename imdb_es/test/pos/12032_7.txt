Hollywood has turned the mafia into a production line that goes from the banal to the excellent and, in spite of its good acting and a reasonable script (many of which are, for a change, true!) This effort of "entertainment" Domestic "has to fall slap bang in the middle. <br /> <br /> The script is not only obvious (all checkboxes are marked), but you spend a lot of time trying to create a pastiche of other people's best work. . The Godfather is the most obvious, but there are also other references. I will not bother to name them. However, it is a good taste borrower! The producer seems to set a quota for shootings and murders (one at least every twenty minutes?) And the end is weak and "so what?" I have been told that there are several versions of this production, so maybe it's just the version I've seen. <br /> <br /> Gangsters do not make money but they take money. Normally because of fear. Some seem to be more related to the murder and the business side than to make money. They were the first to leave (in real life and here). "You can not make money with a gun in your hand," says Charlie 'Lucky' Luciano at one stage. One of the most intelligent mobsters, although all things are relative. He was a skilled trader of white slaves and a drug dealer before being taken to Italy. <br /> <br /> The old school of "Pete's mustache" was eliminated by new bloods who wanted power and money for them and to free themselves from the straight jacket of Italian / Sicilian power (rarely doing business outside of themselves). The young Turk knew that they needed to be allied with other groups (especially the "Jews" who knew how to launder money) and at least this is mentioned and recognized. What is not so clear is that most of the immigrant groups had their own mafia, but most of them earned their money and became legitimate. And why not? Who wants to die in jail? <br /> <br /> Joseph Bonanno was a ruthless man prepared to kill if necessary, but not unfair or stupid. His story was tragic as he could have won money in the earthly world and showed a special ability to avoid being killed. With a little luck, of course. <br /> <br /> Despite the variety of respectable names and three actors in the lead role (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi) there is no charisma or talent to bring us and feel something. We are simply passive observers in a life that we are glad to have no lead. The people shown here were born in a cruel world, but their only mark was to make it more cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can not get enough of the gangster genre, it will be better than seeing Godfather 1 and 2. for the tenth time and it is even better, as basic entertainment, than the horrible fire failure that was the Godfather 3.
