All the shorthand for supposedly being more conscious in this strange moment is that you are "blue". The mentality of the blue state. This is supposed to get us out of trouble for what is happening in recent years in our country (USA). It does not free anyone, but it makes us feel better, as if we were not benefiting in any way by living here and getting all the good things that a US citizen does. UU Get just for being a US citizen UU <br /> <br /> But I'm sick of complaining about this. It does not do any good. I have not taken much action lately and I wonder how many people have done it. Maybe I just fell down because my job was "outsourced" last month and now I'm looking for work in the declining technical assistance field, where most of the jobs are going quickly to India and other places abroad. I'm thinking that soon it will not be worth it to be a citizen here with the infrastructure ruined and the labor market in decline and the obsession with war. These days, it seems that anyone who speaks skips and is asked about "patriotism." Anyway, let's get back to this review: United States. The movie is a dark DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken action, be it through politics, protests or the arts or the media. The filmmaker is obviously passionate, well informed, willing to get out of the norm, frustrated, unique, astute, etc. <br /> <br /> I checked the entire site that is linked to the DVD and I got lost in all the articles and essays. etc. that are there. The DVD does that too, it has references to different times, views and historical points. Sometimes someone does something out there.
