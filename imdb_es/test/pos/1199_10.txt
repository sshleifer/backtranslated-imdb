The musical "Anti" of the war is my number one cult movie. I do not know how many times I've seen this movie in cinemas and on VHS, or how many times I've listened to the CD with the impressive soundtrack, and now, this masterpiece was finally released on DVD in Brazil. <br /> <br /> The pacifist and moving story is still amazing, a hymn of freedom, friendship and freedom of elections, and represents the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70s and their dreams, since the current world is probably worse than in the 70s. I do not remember who won the Oscar in 1979, but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved the minus one nomination for his impressive performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely beautiful in the role of a spoiled hypocrite teenager of the upper class. I have seen "Hair" probably more than twelve times, and my eyes always get wet while Berger walks towards the plane singing "That's me, that's me", and I start crying with his gravestone in the cemetery. I think this is one of the most beautiful, sad and moving conclusions in the history of cinema. My wife, daughter and son also love this movie; therefore, I can guarantee that "Hair" is timeless and recommended for any audience. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hair"
