Recently I saw Blind Spot in Coyoac√°n, where it attracted a large crowd and a pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and the visual approach. The action is terrifying and the atmosphere of solitude that the film projects is incredible. There is a lot of beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not only in the desert but also in the city. My best scene was after the boy discovered his friends in the apartment and then walks his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this boy. I had never heard of actors before, but I liked all three. I think they did an excellent job on their journey towards self-discovery. All in all, this is an amazingly great suspense thriller. I still carry many of the images in my mind.
