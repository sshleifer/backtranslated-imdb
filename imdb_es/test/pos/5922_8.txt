Billy Wilder continues his great movie career during the 1950s with a biopic of Charles Lindbergh, the young American pilot who became the first man to fly alone across the Atlantic in 1927. Jimmy Stewart plays Lindbergh, and although It could be a bit old. For its part, it still brings the sincere warmth and confidence that is needed, as well as its characteristic feature that makes it an iconic movie star. Wilder leads solidly, balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what Lindbergh was up against when he decided to take on this challenge. It's certainly not his best work or Stewart's, but it's a jewel of a movie. Raise your spirits with the plane and take pride in being American. In general, it's just good.
