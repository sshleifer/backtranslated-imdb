In 'Hoot', Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the new kid from the school who just moved from Montana. But Florida is very different from Montana. Despite the problems in the mix, Roy discovers a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant is coming to the city and owl families are in trouble. Can the new child, a tomboy (Brie Larson) and a fugitive (Cody Linley) prevent big business from destroying the house of these owls? <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty good. The children (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the true stars of this film. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) is fine, but he does not really have a very important part. Robert Wagner (Mayor) or Jimmy Buffett (Mr. Ryan). <br /> <br /> However, this was a fun movie that the whole family will enjoy. For a producer for the first time, I thought that Jimmy Buffett put together a quality work. Also the owls were really cute.
