Oh my God! This was one of the best science fiction movies I've seen, and frankly I can not stand sci-fi movies. <br /> <br /> Vin Diesel and his co-workers made this movie really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I must also say that Vin diesel is by far the sexiest and most talented actor I have ever seen. Keep it up Vin! you are doing great! As for all the other good work. I thought that the drama and the suspense kept the audience really intrigued. again, good job, everyone and I'm encouraging you, Vin. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> Alexandra
