I'm a fan of burning Vijay. I have never seen another movie of his that is as good as this one. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual clich√©s that one can expect from a commercial artist. A hero who is bad in studies, but a star in his fort, that is, Kabbadi. Your friends to complete the comedy fee. A heroine in a life or death situation. A villain, which I say, is the best ever represented by the protagonist. High-octane pursuit and action sequences. Music that can make dance. And, above all, a perfect plot to keep all the above factors within a pleasant circle. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The director does not give any opportunity for the audience to relax. It simply goes from one nail in the head to the next. And one can see the lighter side of Vijay in this film that he rarely executes. <br /> <br /> Everything said ... This movie was and will be perfect for many years to come ...
