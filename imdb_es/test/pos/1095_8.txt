This movie is amazing, although it is not perfect by Hollywood standards, it embraces a soft look at the wide divide between rich and poor, black and white that is true in many parts of the world. Handle the audience with children's gloves while providing a truthful look at social problems. The children are beautiful, take special note of the young man who plays Sipho. The friendships that develop are universally true, anyone can relate to the choices that these young people have to make. The influence of adults is interesting: it seems that it is taken from real-life experiences, as there are unforeseen conversations and conversations, as a child would remember having experienced. I would highly recommend this movie.
