THE GREATEST GAME THAT HAS BEEN PLAYED (TGGEP, 2005) is an unsuccessful and infectious, incredibly stimulating movie that never (really) turns into sappiness or heavyhandedness. Yes, several liberties are required, like most Hollywood movies, but those freedoms are forgiven because they actually contribute to the enjoyment of the film, not to the detriment of it. In fact, there are many truthful moments in it. You can really say it's a "Rocky" type movie from the beginning of the movie, but who cares? Directed by Bill Paxton (I know, right?), It's made by experts and is immensely visible. <br /> <br /> TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, arrogance and class by superstar Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer of an Irish-French working class living in Brookline, MA, a early twentieth century. Ouimet qualifies to play in the United States Open in 1913. Included among his competition is the legendary Harry Vardon (played with immense class, dignity and ferocity by Stephen Dillane). Ironically, Vardon is the second loser in this movie! The film begins in the 1870s in Scotland, where land developers tell the young man they are building a golf course at home and that golf is not a game for people like him. Francis suffers some of the same prejudices as a child in the early 1900s at Brookline. The stories converge at the 1913 Open. <br /> <br /> The irony is that even as an adult and multiple champion, Vardon remains an outcast of British society because of his education. Francis learned a lot about golf by reading Vardon's books on the subject and Vardon is his idol as he grew up. Unbeknownst to Vardon, they actually met in 1900 in Boston after Vardon, who won the Open that year, was on tour when Francis was only 7 years old. <br /> <br /> In addition to Francis and Vardon, participants in the 1913 Open include Vardon's friend and champion, Brit Ted Ray (bustling Stephen Marcus), and two-time defending champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver) ), who has no class and hits his chest. The movie really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men. <br /> <br /> The redhead Marnie McPhail is incredibly serene and dazzling, as the support of Francis' mother and veteran Francis, Elias Koteas, offers a taciturn, reserved and taciturn performance. like his French father. In addition, the young and brave Josh Flitter (like Francis' 10-year-old caddy Eddie, almost steals the procedure. <br /> <br /> Paxton presents many modern details, such as the special effects zoom. show the positioning on the scoreboard of the players and CGI for a lot of golf shots to keep the film exciting and at a good pace so as not to make the film a piece of the period, but the film still convinces us of a time and a specific place. <br /> <br /> The interesting thing is that, although Rocky, everything is based on a real story, so the ending is satisfying on many levels.An entertaining movie about the game of golf in the early 1900s. .. Wow!
