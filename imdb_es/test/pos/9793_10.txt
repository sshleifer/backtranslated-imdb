This is a very sad and moving movie! It deals with the subject of child abuse. It's really sad, but it's mostly a real story, because it happens every day. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play the two children or Lorraine Bracco, a single mother who only tries to make a home for them. While living with their parents, a man who likes to be called "The King" enters his life. Hit the youngest boy, Bobby, but the two brothers promise not to tell their mother. But finally she finds out, after Bobby gets hurt badly. The end ruined it for me, because it's totally incredible. But, except for that, I love the movie.
