Irene Jacob is fascinating in this latest installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it manages to unite the three films. I am simply amazed at the amount of talent it takes to make one of these stories, let alone all three. Everything seems to fit so precisely, all elements of the cinema are executed so eloquently and the final result is much greater than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs to any list of great cinematographic achievements. Simply brilliant!
