I think that sums up this movie. Look at it and you will discover why. The performance of the main character, John Keem, is really bad and has no charisma on the screen. It is very funny because of this thought, since it is the end where Keem beheads the bad guy even though he is unarmed and has surrendered. Sparkly!
