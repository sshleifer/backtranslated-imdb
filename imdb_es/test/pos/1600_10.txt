<br /> <br /> The Philistines are saved, especially the Americans! This has all the elements that it will hate: a langorous approach to film language, a pictorial sense of composition, an intense homoerotic approach to its elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music and, what is worse, it is based on a story that you probably would hate too ... If, however, you feel that the movies do not have derivative plot lines, they are full of action and crappy dialogues, you do not need the visual grammar of the MTV / TV commercials, so look at this . . It's one of my favorite movies, and it's perhaps the most perfectly formed work of Visconti. It is sublime, like the movement of Mahler that he uses insistently throughout the film.
