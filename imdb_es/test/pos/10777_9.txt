Oliver Stone hits the bull's eye with this film, helped mainly by the presence of Bogosian's electrifying screen and bright and biting script. Each moment creaks with a tension in constant growth, culminating in a truly memorable experience to go to the cinema. If ever there was a hint of the ability of a writer and a director to fuse two highly volatile temperaments into a perfect union of creativity, here it is! The result is a powerful achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of the fascinating fascination of our culture for celebrity, and its distorted interpretations of fame. for the next big emotion. <br /> <br /> A film that is not easily forgotten. I recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature.
