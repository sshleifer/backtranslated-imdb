This was very good, except for two things that I will mention at the end. The animation is excellent, highlighted by Nick Park and the trademark of the company of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. The color was also magnificent. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the movie is the intelligent comedy woven throughout. This is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many presentations to catch all the gags. It's just a funny and exaggerated look at the strange "Wallace" and his silent and intelligent dog "Gromit". Along the way, he pokes fun at people who get carried away by his orchards, something akin to how obsessive dog lovers were photographed at "Best Of Show." <br /> <br /> My only complaints were two typical features of today's movies, animated or not: 1 - let the clergyman of the film look like a total idiot; 2 - Exaggerate the final action scene with the predictable but exaggerated result. Apart from that, this is still a very funny movie that should provide many laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy it several times.
