As a big fan of Dostoevsky, I have always been disappointed by Hollywood's half-hearted attempts to enter Russian romantic aesthetics, for example, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I had thought that the whole problem was a bad launch decision, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When he was provided with a clever script to work on, it suddenly came to life and was as noble, sexy and conflictive as you could wish it to be a Russian Neurotic Officer. So he was a better Dmitri like Major Surov than Dmitri. But that's because the writer Tabori actually gave Yul, like the Russian officer in conflict, the kind of Russian officer lines in conflict that are worthy of real literature, and that have real meaning and pathos in them. . For example, a proposal of folk music, says thoughtfully: "You hear a man crying in the dark, and if you listen carefully, you know why he cries." You seem surprised, Lady Ashmore, regardless of what you have heard. tractors and Marxism are not the only things the Russians are interested in. There is always time for music.
