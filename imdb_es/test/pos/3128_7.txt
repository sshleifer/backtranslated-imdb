The Western can be divided into many subgenres. One of the broadest divisions is that between Town Westerns and Plains Westerns. Most westerns are a mixture of both, but at one end of the spectrum have images like High Noon and Rio Bravo that take place almost entirely in a settlement, rarely venturing outside. At the other extreme, there are some like Wagon Master, where there is hardly a country house in sight in the middle of nature. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford used to thrive in the "little of both" westerns, shooting the interiors with an emphasis on being small and confined, and then contrasting this with the open exteriors, which seemed exciting and dangerous . Wagon Master has a typical Frank Nugent script, with some interaction between experienced elders and young greens, but still presents Ford with new challenges. In this image, the dangers do not come from the hardness of the landscape, but come from within the group in the form of the Cleggs. In addition, the absence of real interior scenes means that the outdoors could lose its impact over time. <br /> <br /> However, Ford was a true master when it came to manipulating space. Take scenes from the camp or the wagons so that the frame is surrounded and we get the same feeling of fencing that we would have in a genuine interior. Also, in comparison with its other westerns, it does not really open up too much space, since the road of the car makes its way through canyons and passes instead of crossing the desolate and empty plains. One of the few moments when the landscape opens is when the Indians are seen and there is the possibility of a threat from outside. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master presents some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief, and some great contributions from the quirky cast. Harry Carey Jr. was becoming a good actor like his father, and this is one of his best early roles. Joanne Dru was disappointing in She Wore to Yellow Ribbon, but she seems more comfortable as a character with a bit of cheek, and she's actually pretty good here. Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar in Grapes of Wrath, directed by John Ford, a decade earlier, appears here with the sole function of making a current gag in which an old and weak horn sounds. Still, with its great synchronization and movement makes the piece work. Francis Ford, in one of the many silent drunken roles he played in his little brother's pictures, is at his best. <br /> <br /> And now we come to direct the man Ben Johnson. Although he was not in any way a bad actor, he would never become a big star like John Wayne. And yet, with his easy riding and easy padding, he was one of the most authentic players in the "West". And this brings me to my final point. Apparently, this was one of Ford's personal favorites, even though it seemed simple enough. Wagon Master does not have a great theme or a dramatic intensity, it is simply the genre that develops. I think this is what Ford loved. It's a picture for the Ben Johnson and the Harry Carey Jrs, not for the John Waynes or the Henry Fondas. Small in scope, but worthy in its class.
