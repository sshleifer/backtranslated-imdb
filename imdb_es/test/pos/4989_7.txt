Too much added and too extracted from a great western written by McMurtry about the Texas Rangers against the Indians. This script removes that only to fill this mini series with many warm and diffuse relationships that, in truth, were secondary to the main story. It ends with a totally incredible and indifferent ending that is not written in the book and that makes us question how we should be transported to Loneome Dove. <br /> <br /> Actually, the main characters of the series expressed themselves very well, the filming locations. They were excellent, but this mini series should have stayed true to what a great book is.
