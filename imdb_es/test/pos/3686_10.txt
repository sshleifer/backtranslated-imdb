I wonder why I have not heard of this movie before. It is really a magnificent comedy (I would say it is a farce, but it is very well acted and I hate to denigrate its quality). A humorous study on the tribulations of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can not make their long-standing unions known and the general differences of people who do not fit well in society. Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should make another movie together. The daughter-in-law of Maudie (Meredith Eaton), harassed and outrageous, full of anxiety, is a truly wonderful character. If you liked Tales of the City movies, you would like this lovely charmer.
