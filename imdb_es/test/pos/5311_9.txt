- Only a few can understand the character of Leland, and to do so it is very likely that you are innate to see both sides of life, and facing this reality is very difficult and can lead some to bad acts (as does the character of Leland), but it is so sad and real reasons that his intentions were good, in the sense that he intended to save another person from physical or mental pain (in this case) for a long time. And it's really sad that most of the people in this movie make mistakes, but the only character that makes one with good intentions is killed for it. The lesson of this film is for the single person to see, realize, face and do the right thing in the real life situation that they see and do well, or inspire someone who can correct the problem of an incorrect situation. but before that ... you have to see the two sides of something and rationalize it for the sake of peace and tranquility of all human life. Do not be ignorant
