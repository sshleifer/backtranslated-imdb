I love Ln Chaney's version of "Phantom" and I appreciate Webber's version if only because of the growing interest in the book, I wish it seemed more of a horror mystery to me with the romantic aspects minimized. I do not approve of the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber made the relationship between Raoul and Christine less moderate. <br /> <br /> Luckily, since this is a short comedy with only Erik and Christine, this version does not even have to do it. bother with other characters. <br /> <br /> I thought I would still be waiting for another version to match Lon's performance. I was completely wrong. Leslie Nielson is fabulous like Erik, however, of course, this is a parody. It's still brilliant. <br /> <br /> I especially appreciated the fact that Erik looked more like a living corpse than a victim of an accident. I still have to see a Phantom like that, apart from Lon's. <br /> <br /> However, I do not recommend this short film if you do not like parodies. Because this should not be taken seriously in any way.
