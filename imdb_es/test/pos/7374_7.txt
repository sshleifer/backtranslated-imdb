Definitely not just for fans of urban legends, Campfire Tales is an often terrifying and always fun ride through several popular stories. It is also a film that exceeded the (low) expectations that it had. A horror movie that I had never heard or read before, a direct release to the video (granted, the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise, but with today's horror films it can be all or nothing), a cast almost unknown. .. well, I leave the mathematics. <br /> <br /> The film proves to be an entertaining, suspenseful and generally very enjoyable experience. The four stories are of good rhythm and satisfactory. The only one I felt was a bit weaker was "The Locket", for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the actions of the characters; However, I still loved the story, its atmosphere and its ending. My favorite was the third story, "People Can Lick Too": the suspense is not only palpable, but also educational. <br /> <br /> I discovered that Campfire Tales is one of those gems of terror that you discover by chance, and then continue to recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
