Paul Naschy, as a ghostly security guard in this, scares more than most of his werewolf costumes of skin and shoes. The story is not unknown, a group of children go to an abandoned school. The point is that one of the parents of these children did the same thing years ago, but now he has passed away, and the last group of children seems to be reliving an event of 23 years ago. This is pretty well done for movies of this type, and there is an air of mystery in what is happening because, apparently, what happened to children before is something of a mystery and perhaps the truth was not revealed. So no, not just your slice and standard dice. This progresses at a good pace and does not let you lose interest like many movies do, and the strange story is convincing enough to keep you interested too, and there is something suspense missing in many movies these days. The ending is quite abrupt and I suppose that it is largely left to your imagination, but it is not better to be welcome either. 7 out of 10, take a look.
