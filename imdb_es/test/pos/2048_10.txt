When this movie came out, I had seen Geena Davis play only soft and feminine roles ... This movie was anything but soft and feminine. Great lines, great action ... she and Samuel L really clicked. Too violent for children, but if you and your partner try to agree on a movie, try it on size. See Geena! See Geena!
