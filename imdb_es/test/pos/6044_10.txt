I went through training camp at MCRD on Parris Island in 1953 and this film is such a precise description of what the boots went through in that era, even to bury that sand flea. Many of the "actors" in the film were marines on active duty. This movie may be more entertaining for Marines than for others, but I think the movie itself is very well made, and Jack Webb made a "good DI." Semper Fi!
