Well, I arrived a few days late but what the hell ...! Anyway, the word that best describes my reaction to "See No Evil" was ... SURPRISE. The movie is pretty good. There's definitely a lot of blood, blood and action in the movie with a modest amount of suspense. It goes back to the good days of the late 70's and early 80's. Think "Madman" meets Leatherface with a touch of Norman Bates and you'll have a good idea of ​​this movie. While SNE is thin in the plot (most horror movies are), it makes up for it with violence / killing methods, gore, suspense and the fact that Kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed Jacob Goodnight. The title of the film comes from the fact that Jacob rips the eyes of his victims with only his fingers and stores them in large jars. Why?? You only have to see it and see (play on words). There are certain cinematographic elements extracted from other horror films, especially Psycho, TCM and Madman, but they are not obvious. Finally, SNE does not really enter the territory that the qualifiers we have not seen before and granted, SNE is not a "Pyscho" or "TCM 74", but it certainly deserves an imo aspect. <br /> <br /> Blood Stone recommendation: see a matinee of "Do not see evil" Blood Stone Score: 7.5 / 10
