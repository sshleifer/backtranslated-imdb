Remember: before Sidney existed, there was Dudley. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges is hardly remembered today, because his heyday as an accessory in sound films was in the late 1920s and into the 1930s. Except for one important performance: good character Of the ship, if he is a fool doctor in the MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY of 1935, most of his films are hardly revived. More is worth it because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931 he played Casper Gutman (the original actor to play that villain) with Sam Spade by Ricardo Cortez in the first THE MALTESE FALCON. Similarly, at about the same time, he played the recording angel in Leslie Howard's version of OUTWARD BOUND, the same role that Sidney Greenstreet tackled BETWEEN TWO WORLDS a decade later. <br /> <br /> Digges could be nice and kind (the doctor of that ship again), or detestable (in CHINA SEAS, as the first critical officer who makes fun of poor Lewis Stone, but then proves that it is so coward in a moment of crisis). He defended himself against Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter who works with Gary Cooper in THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN. Digges could do anything. <br /> <br /> Here is Mr. Thompson, the hypocrite and thief director of a reform school to which Frankie Darro and his friends are sent for committing a robbery and injuring a Greek-American store owner (It is the last incident for most of them). Digges is as bad here as in CHINA SEAS, but it's very similar that he does not like it totally. He is able to somehow transcend their roles ... later on that. <br /> <br /> Darro has a gang of urban criminals (including a Jewish child and "Farina" from "OUR GANG"). As noted in another review, it is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see them shaking the owners of cars to pay them to "watch and protect" their cars. When a man does not do it, they calmly destroy his car. The robbery for capture and robbery in the Greek-American store is also shown graphically: his skull fractured when he was pushed. <br /> <br /> The boys are arrested and brought before the stern but decent Judge Arthur Byron, who realizes that he can not leave the children with their parents: the parents can not see them or are incompetent. Unfortunately, there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: a Jewish father who is more concerned about his business than his son, the stereotype of Farina "Yassum", and the Italian father whose willingness to cooperate causes his son to get out of the reform. school. <br /> <br /> Once there, the boys find the regime oppressive. Occasionally, one of the guards or the nurse (Madge Evans) tries to speak for them. But Digges does not have time to pamper himself. His is a regime determined to break the boys to behave. Unfortunately, Digges and his accounting partner are greedy. They have been serving inferior food to the boys and they have saved the benefit. <br /> <br /> One day a new official comes from the state to see the reform school. It's Jimmy Cagney, who is a hacker corridor whose gang got the vote of Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he could not get the position of Park Commissioner), Cagney was appointed assistant inspector of the school. He is supported by his suspense and factotum friend Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother movie). <br /> <br /> The irony is that if Digges were a little more careful, Cagney would probably have let him keep running things. But Cagney gets to see Darro taken to Digges to fight. The director and Darrow have had problems regarding respect before, and Digges now tries to punish Darro who flees, but is seriously injured by Digges' barbed wire fences and his free use of a whip. Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans treat Darro's injuries. And he explains the reality of the situation to Cagney, and his own idea of ​​a real reformatory reform of children by creating trust in them responsibly. <br /> <br /> The film follows this to the end, showing that Cagney and Evans are on the right track, making the reformatory a "republic" for children to run correctly. This leads to a conflict with Digges, whose speculation is reduced as he no longer receives supplies. But the plan derails when Cagney himself discovers that he may be in serious trouble with the law. Digges sees his opportunity and makes the most of it. But then it goes too far ... much more than I expected. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s there were many films showing children taking steps to correct mistakes and change things. Darro appeared in such as WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did THIS DAY AND AGE, where the children teach a lesson to a gangster played by Charles Bickford that scares him very much. This was the case in the 1930s. THE MAYOR OF HELL reaches a similar intensity of revenge and the search for juvenile justice. But that's the only problem with the movie. The character of Digges is a scoundrel and hypocrite, so we never encouraged him, however, if he was not a thief, we could agree with his point of view (even if it is counterproductive). The scenes at the beginning of Darro and his gang that take advantage of people make the toughness that Digges would follow seem quite understandable (even if their thief forms are not). He also has a moment when he is justifiably angry at Cagney, at that moment hiding from his own crash with the law, giving orders over the phone from a long distance to a stunned Digges. When Digges finds out what really happened, he is justifiably furious with Cagney for teaching him a lesson about proper behavior. It's the closest thing to having Mr. Thompson sympathize with this good movie.
