During the Second World War in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers die of hunger, die, weaken and become increasingly crazy. A small group of soldiers, who try to stay alive, have eventually resorted to cannibalism. This film perfectly portrays the madness that beats people in extreme conditions. There are some humorous parts in this movie, but most of it is just a very slow and realistic movie. Follow these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and finally to death. A very interesting film, showing the death and horror of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen.
