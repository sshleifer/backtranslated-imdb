This is a wonderful old-fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to capture on television every year if I can. It revolves around a journalist named Martha Stewart named Elizabeth Lane, played charmingly by Barbara Stanwyck. However, unlike Martha, this lady is a fake without domestic skills. The other cast members complete the story effectively and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan) and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a housewife happily married to children. Actually, she is a single woman who lives in an apartment in New York City and can not boil an egg. His recipes are borrowed from his Hungarian chef chef, Felix. Elizabeth escapes with her disappointment until the publisher of his magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides that she wants an old and pleasant Christmas Christmas, and invites herself to visit it, bringing with it a war hero, Jefferson Jones, a sailor who had been shipwrecked. Yardley demands total honesty from his employees. To get out of her predicament and save her career based on deception, Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut cottage from her former architect architect, John Sloan, a bored and demanding guy who has always sought marriage. She also borrows a neighbor's baby (actually, several) to pretend to be his and her 'husband' Sloan's. <br /> <br /> Of course, this scenario is very fun. It is a meaningless comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a Christmas atmosphere. Every time I think about this movie, I imagine how the snowflakes fall, the tree beautifully decorated, the fire that roars in the home, the roast of turkey and the baked Christmas cookies. <br /> <br /> Why did Hollywood feel compelled to do a redo? I understand that there is a 1992 version, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and starring Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation nor do I want it. This old favorite is perfect as it is and a vacation that "must see" along with It's a wonderful life, white Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street and, of course, all versions of A Christmas Carol.
