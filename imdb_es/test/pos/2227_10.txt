Since 1972 I saw this movie and I still remember it as one of my favorite movies of all time. I would like to buy a copy if it was on a DVD and it is a pity that it is not. One would think that anything starring Peter Sellers would be returned. Much better than "Being There" and as good as the Pink Panther series. Uschi Digard had a small part for such a well-endowed artist. She is extra in this movie. I think that the field of medicine may not appreciate this movie, because it really makes fun of the profession and also makes one appreciate that Sellers was never available to treat them when his side of the bed sucked, as well as his analysis of the samples urine.
