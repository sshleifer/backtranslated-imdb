It happened that I was able to capture this on community television a few years ago and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice a movie was. <br /> <br /> Although a little cheesy in certain aspects, as its main function of being a mystery thriller works. magnificently, thanks to a script that invents an ingenious plot; He kept guessing me and the resolution is inspired. <br /> <br /> The cast is a full star, containing a mix of those at the end of their careers (in fact, Richard Long died the same year it was made), or those who were on the verge of stardom in the hit television series (Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley). Everyone does a good job, with the exception of Cesare Danova, who walks by his role. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
