I saw this program until my puberty, but I still found it to reflect many situations that concern us when we are teenagers, although it was a family oriented program. Until the mid-1990s, he focused more on young adults and their situations. <br /> <br /> That's why I loved "Step By Step". I mean, it offered situations for all ages and, unlike many shows of this kind, it met expectations. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest; This was not an extremely funny show, no, but I had some situations with which you can feel related, but more fun. <br /> <br /> There was an extremely good charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy rocks! Sommers was cute and really funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was extremely sexy (loved her legs) and witty. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with her character from Cody. It was the man back in the day! Oh, the memories. Today, this show was not able to adapt adequately to the new generations and that is why it must be kept in the vault of memories. That's all, just memories. <br /> <br /> Thanks step by step for making my puberty more fun.
