It was surprising that a silent movie was so easy to see. The economy with which it has been edited and the structure of the films are the main elements that contribute to this. <br /> <br /> The film really captures the spirit of the revolution you're dealing with: you really sympathize with the sailors and citizens. Of course, this film has its own agenda, but as it is a practically redundant cause, it can be seen as entertainment in a much clearer sense. <br /> <br /> The tension created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself, and then moving towards the continent. Things are scaled in a credible way and for a movie of his time, it is really quite inflexible in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> This is really worth sitting for, (that's if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90mins).
