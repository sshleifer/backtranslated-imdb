This episode so far is the best of the series. The story was told perfectly. I especially liked how the writers did an episode of Desmond; It was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved Emmy for his performance. <br /> <br /> We had some of our questions answered in this episode, but since the series is called Lost, we know there will be more questions. raised too. First, the answer: Walt finally met his father Michael, second, Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurly, and because of this betrayal, Kate, Jack and Sawyer are captured by The Other. This was a great way to end the show. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island we see Locke going through a mental crisis with the button. This leads to another question answered about how the plane really fell. However, there are some unanswered questions: first, what happened to Locke, Eko and Desmond when Desmond activated the security key and what was the deal with scientists in the Arctic looking for electromagnetic anomalies. I guess we'll know next season, even if it's a great ending to the best television show.
