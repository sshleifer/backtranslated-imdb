Better than the "who-dun-it" average of the Second World War era with Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway, who helps police and criminals they want to go directly. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who may have some mental problems. The link with "value" is not particularly clear. <br /> <br /> This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson, whose two previous wives have mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide, but the Dr. Ordway labels the murder. Hillary Brooke plays the role of the widow Kathleen Carson who is involved with Anthony Caruso, a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes her sister who disappears on stage. As a mystery novelist, Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor, as is Lloyd Corrigan as a crime aficionado. <br /> <br /> Creepy houses with squeaky doors, chests in the basement and suspects that are never seen in daylight. In the air of suspense. The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music is very good. They emphasize the direction, the design of production and the photography. Outside shots and costumes suggest more wealth rather than what is normally found in the average "B" detective thriller. <br /> <br /> It is strongly recommended.
