This movie was so good that I do not think it actually blinks while I watch it. One intense situation after another kept me close to the set. However, I would have liked to have seen much more Corey Feldman in this image. He simply steals all the scenes in which he finds himself. This could be my favorite performance of Corey. The ending was clever and, unlike other films that move away from separating body parts of nice supporting characters, this movie goes for that! I liked that it was not about graphic blood and blood, but that it was left to the imagination of the spectator. Bravo. I literally had to wipe the sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter. Ultimately, the movie works because of its cute main character and the amazing presence of my favorite bad boy of all time, James Remar (48 hours, remember?) I recommend this movie to anyone looking to sweat. <br /> <br />
