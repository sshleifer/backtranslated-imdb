This was the first cartoon of Mickey Mouse released and the first caricature with sound. In the cartoon, Mickey still does not wear gloves. He does not talk yet either. All he does is whistle and play music. The song he plays is "Turkey in the Straw" using various farm animals as musical instruments. For example, touch the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pull the suckling piglets like an accordion keyboard. I recorded this caricature of the Disney Channel and I think it's wonderful. It was based on a silent film starring Buster Keaton entitled "Steamboat Bill, Jr."
