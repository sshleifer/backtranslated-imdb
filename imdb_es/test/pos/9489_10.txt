Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard this double DVD come out, I was understandably excited. I just got to the point and say that if you're a Zeppelin fan, you should run and buy this immediately. It is absolutely spectacular! Blows "The song stays the same" completely out of the water. Why this material was never published before is beyond me. The images presented here really show Zep at the top of his game, which I never felt "Song" did. Undoubtedly, Jimmy Page is the best of all, and these performances make Jimi Hendrix look like a fool! Watch out for the jam 'White Summer' ... whew! <br /> <br /> Live Jimmy Page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> 11 out of 10
