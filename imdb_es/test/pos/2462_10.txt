The era of the Vietnam War is certainly far from my time, but it has always interested me, and I have seen many films about it. All the others I had seen had dealt strictly with the first line of battle. When I read a description of "War at home," I found the concept intriguing. No film of the Vietnam War had heard about what happens to a soldier once the fight is over. <br /> <br /> One night, while flipping through the channels, the movie aired on The Sundance Channel. I lowered the remote control and settled down to see it. I did not move from my seat for the full two hours; It is one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there is no way to predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This movie made me a big fan of Emilio Estevez. I had enjoyed it a lot like Billy the Kid in the "Young Guns" movies, but I never saw anything of what he did afterwards. Emilio proved to be very talented to write and direct, as well as to act. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film is extremely well done. I find it hard to think of a point where it crawls. <br /> <br /> What surprises me is that it did not get an Oscar or any real recognition when it came out. It's a dramatic story about parents trying to deal with the fact that their child is no longer who they used to be and probably never will be as they remembered it again. Definitely worth seeing.
