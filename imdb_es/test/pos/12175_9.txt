I enjoyed Erkan & Stefan ?? A fresh and fast story that did not get stuck in detail. Those two guys are great to see and can bring new ideas all the time. The high quality of the image and the cut support the film a lot. <br /> <br /> Erkan and Stefan show that the German film industry is capable of transferring successful Hollywood concepts with local satire to our cinemas.
