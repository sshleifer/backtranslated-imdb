I caught this movie on the science fiction channel recently. Actually, it turned out to be pretty decent when it comes to the horror / suspense movies on the B-list. Two boys (one naive and one noisy **) make a road trip to stop a wedding, but have the worst luck possible when A maniac in an improvised tank / truck hybrid and with change of turn decides to play cat and mouse with them. Things get even more complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and horror really works in this movie, unlike many others. The two boys are quite nice and there are some good chase / suspense scenes. The good rhythm and comic timing make this film more than acceptable to the horror / slasher aficionado. Definitely worth checking out.
