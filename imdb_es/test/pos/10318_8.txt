A short of Three Stooges, this one of Shemp. Of all the related Shemp I've seen, this is my favorite performance of him in a Stooges short film. The basic plot is that Shemp must marry before 6 pm that afternoon, if he wants to inherit the half million dollars that a rich uncle left in his will. So Shemp proposes to get a girlfriend, but finds that it is a more difficult path than expected, that is, until they learn about the money of their inheritance. The best parts here include Shemp Shaving, Shemp and Moe in a telephone booth and Larry on the piano as an accompaniment to Shemp's voice training session. Also the sequence in which Shemp is confused with the raw basil and its result is very funny.
