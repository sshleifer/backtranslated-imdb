This is a good enough movie and you probably will not be disappointed, but again you have Roy Scheider, right after he made "French Connection", playing a cop with the name "Buddy". They also use the same memorable "Bullitt" helmman. At first, you'll think you've seen the car chase before if you still have your face in your memory. The car chase is excellent, but like many scenes in car movies, it has some technical and editing errors. See "Puppet in a chain" and "French connection II" to learn about other good, long and intense persecutions.
