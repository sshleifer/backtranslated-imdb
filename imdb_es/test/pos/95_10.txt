The animated shorts can not be better than this wonderful Canadian film. This short feature is full of Canadian references, so this film will probably be appreciated by Canadians, above all. But the basic story is universal, and the writer Roch Carrier tells it with love. It's a hilarious story I've known for quite some time, and recently I was lucky enough to see her again, so I just HAVE to write a heartfelt recommendation for her. This is a masterpiece, and you have to see if you are Canadian or not.
