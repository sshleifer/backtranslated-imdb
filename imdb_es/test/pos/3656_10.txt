Between extraordinary and extraordinary scenes in a lot of places in India and a plot inspired by Bollywood but based on reality, this moving film is a must for lovers of a good romance / adventure. And with this, I mean "good", not an easy and artificial happy ending of Hollywood or Bollywood. East meets the West in a different version of the friends movie. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the epic cinematography and the plot are entertaining, attractive and moving without a trace of discomfort or a cheap pull in the heart. HARI OM is a sweet movie that will not rot your teeth. Look at it!
