this program is the best, it is full of laughs and Kevin James is the best, so if you want a good program, I recommend the king of queens and it is a disappointment that they have canceled it, so in the end this program will make you forget your concerns and problems cause that if you have a cast with Kevin James and Jerry Stiller you can not go wrong. so I do not know why I canceled the program, if anyone knows, please tell me. Nowadays you can not find many programs that meet your needs as a public. After Seinfeld and the King of Queens, the only program worth seeing is prison. Break and if that stops I do not know what to do. In the end, if I had to recommend a show, I would be the king of queens.
