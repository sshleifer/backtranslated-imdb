Can a young black man with mental problems be a catalyst to unite people in a city in South Carolina? The answer seems to be that, despite his disability, James Kennedy understood much more than he had been attributed and became an element in the sports scene. In addition, the film tells how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if we only have the patience that Coach Jones showed the young man because of his own guilt in his heart. <br /> <br /> "Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formula film inspired by a true story. However, the film is not a complete failure due to the inspired performances that the director could obtain from his wonderful cast. <br /> <br /> Coach Jones is fundamental in getting the young man, who is called Radio because of his passion to collect them, participate in sports, a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has only had hard knocks in his young life . Radio, from a poor environment, lives with his mother who protects him and questions the coach's intentions. The radio is seen by the children of the school as a pet, at first, then, its sunny disposition beats everyone because it is a good person without an ounce of malice in its body. <br /> <br /> The film owes a lot to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr., who make up a great couple as a coach and radio. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our time is never bored in anything than grateful for his presence. He gets the essence of the principles coach who sees the possibility of amending something that bothers him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also in his best image of the young man with a mental disability. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does an interesting job as the mother of Radio. Alfre Woodard, another good actress, plays the beginning of high school in style. Debra Winger, only has some scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> "Radio", although it is sentimental, will warm everyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people in our society that we know nothing about how fast we are to judge them. Michael Tollin puts many ideas in the right perspective for us.
