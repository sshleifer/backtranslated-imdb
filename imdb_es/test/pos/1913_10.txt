Dolemite is, for me, an object of my deepest affection. He has it all: a gang of prostitutes fighting karate, Dolemite punching his fist through the stomach of Willie Green (director Martin), tall pumps and 100 gallon hats with Dalmatian print. Moore's only comedians, actually toasts, are close to the roots of hip hop. No wonder Dr. Dre mentioned "Dolemite" 3 times on his classic album "The Chronic". Add the best list of characters to decorate a movie, such as the horny preacher, the burger pimp and, of course, "the one no one knows until the time". Director D'Urville Martin should give him credit for the style, a guy who smartly does not get as much attention as he should in movie fan circles (I've been looking for a copy of his films and those of Fred Williamsons since beginning 70 years for years and I can not find them). <br /> <br /> Many people are really depressed in this movie and they say it's really bad, and it's true that you can see booming microphones that appear everywhere (look at DP Nicholas Josef Von Sternberg, for whom I think this it was a very early effort), there are many things for this movie. Number one, there's no other movie like this. Number two, you can watch Rudy Ray Moore do a cinematic version of his toasts (everyone who has NOT seen Moore's outrageous live act will have to use his imagination), in addition to living the life of his comic book character. come to life. The action scenes are quite poor, but the dialogue of the characters when they speak is trash, more than makes up for it. It's full of weird little details (like the fact that the Hamburger Pimp is wearing a Dolemite shirt the other way around, was this intentional or did the guy just pick up the shirt that was on the set and put it on?) You come back to see it and again. <br /> <br /> At least I have. <br /> <br />
