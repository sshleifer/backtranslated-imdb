This movie may be the best of all if you like to watch movies and laugh and then submit your friends to watch those movies as well. If you're like me, and you probably are, you'll laugh for the next few years of the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus takes money from a boy with children and then the boy takes those kids to the forest like Hansel and Gretel, then he and his wife go home with them. The kitchen of the soup scene is full of buffoonery comic genius: "Inspection officer, here!" and the lines to follow will remain in my mind forever, probably. When I've shown this movie to my friends, they usually say "What was that?" so if you're in the mood for one of those types of movies, yipi! This movie is so OOP that it's not funny anymore, so probably the easiest way to get it would be in an online auction. The first time I saw it was from a rental.
