As part of an initiation joke, Julie (Meg Tilly of Psycho 2) has to spend the night in a mausoleum, but Karl Rhamarevich, a master of telekinesis, has recently died and been put there. When the sisters of Julie's sisterhood desecrate where he harbors true terror begins. <br /> <br /> This little movie had a good atmosphere and I enjoyed the accumulation, and the last twenty minutes are just great. Anyone looking for a lost gem from an 80s horror movie does not have to search anymore. Very underestimated. Also, Elizabeth Daily is adorable. <br /> <br /> My degree: B <br /> <br /> Extras of the DVD Media Blaster: Disc 1) Comment with the director Tom McLoughlin and the co-writer Michael Hawes; and trailers for "the Being", "Frankestien's Bloody Terror", "Just Before Dawn", & "Devil Dog" Disc 2) Alternative cut of the director (which can hardly be seen due to a bad impression) and the detail behind the scenes
