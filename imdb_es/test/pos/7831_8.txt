Ladies and gentlemen, we have really won here. Actually we do not, but this movie is often hilarious and always entertaining. Poor Alma (when looking for Julia Ruiz) suffers from an ancient Mayan curse that causes lethal poisonous snakes to grow inside her body. Alma and her deranged shaman, the Brujo husband (Alby Castro, who acts feverishly with a delicious intensity that rolls his eyes) on a train that goes to Los Angeles. Naturally, a lot of deadly vipers are lost so they can terrify the varied variety of passengers. The Mallachi Brothers, working from an absurd script by Eric Fosberg, treat the ridiculous premise directly, creating a deliriously wonderful piece of cheese. The raw CGI effects, the pathetic Gardner variety snakes (there are rattlesnakes of fearsome rattlesnakes added to the soundtrack to imbue them with a slight sense of nonexistent threat), the slow pace, the total shortage of any tension or moment, the game of Obvious and messy trains, and especially the amazing "you have to be kidding!" The most absurd and exaggerated ending is frankly amazing because of its amazing astonishment. Better yet, we also have a game (if it's lame) that acts from an unnamed cast, a nice fragment of tasty free female nudity, a funky hum'n'shiver score, and a lot of extremely gross and grotesque makeup f / x. The extra points for the fact that the little girl, irritating and shabby, is devoured by a great reptile and by the expert engineer who is caught smoking crack of a hollow bulb (!?). An absolute ripper of a kitsch howler.
