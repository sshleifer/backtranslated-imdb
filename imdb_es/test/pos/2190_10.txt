Watch the story of Sweeney Todd ... The strangest, most unpleasant but most wonderful Broadway musical. It is chilling, fun and moves at the same time through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and his excellent performances. George Hearn is unmatched in the lead role, with a loud dead voice (no pun intended) personified by the legendary demon barber, while Angela Lansbury provides comic relief while she cheerfully kills her victims in meat pies. If you only allow yourself to enjoy it, "Sweeney Todd" is a real pleasure.
