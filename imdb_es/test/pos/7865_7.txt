This strange and hypnotic drama of Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood was set aside in 1971 and it was a shame. A fascinating study of characters with some great women for Squint to treat. Geraldine Page was one of our supreme actresses and is perfectly chosen. The young Jo Ann Harris is a coy minx, and Elizabeth Hartman (who died very young) is, without a doubt, repressed. <br /> <br /> A 7 out of 10. Better performance = C. Eastwood. Launched the same year as DIRTY HARRY, this was not a problem, besides getting some good reviews. Look for this unless you're alone in the "Explosion" movies. Very subtle and terrifying, this piece will stay with you.
