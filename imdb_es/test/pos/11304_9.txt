I should say that in general the Barbie films have impressed me. I have a 5 year old Barbie fanny niece and she watches them all the time, so it goes without saying that I have seen many pictures of Barbie during these parties, but I am not fed up with them. <br /> <br /> This film, visually, has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie. One thing I noticed in particular was a great improvement in the animation of Barbie's hair in this movie. It has a great variety of classical music extracts and I think this is great, since it exposes a new generation to the classics. This movie is worth a long time ago, especially if you have young relievers. They will be entertained for hours!
