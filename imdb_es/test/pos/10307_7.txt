The theme of the film is moving and very real. It happened. One can debate some artistic freedoms taken by the director and the screenwriter. The theme is what makes the movie work, nothing more. I saw the film for the first time after the real Phoolan, was shot dead in New Delhi and had served for several years as an elected member of Parliament in India. By the way, she was not the first untouchable elected to Parliament, as some critics claimed. The so-called "untouchables" have been elected to the Parliament of India for decades in reserved circumscriptions. <br /> <br /> While Shekhar Kapur as a director is a hero to many Indians, because he made commercially accepted international films. - "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and a tolerable children's movie called "Mister India", which was accepted by the average Indian audience) --- and they even got Oscar nominations for Elizabeth, I do not put it as first class Film director of India. He fails in all the departments as director, except perhaps that he manages to obtain some performances superior to the average of his actors. The subtlety, the delicacy, the charm are not easy to find in his films, melodrama overflows in them. <br /> <br /> His idea to use the vocal performance of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's song in the first parts of the film, was perhaps his great achievement in the soundtrack without distinction of "Bandit Queen". And then perhaps the squeaky doors during the sequence of gang rape. Otherwise, the movie looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence, without the great music that one associates with them. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good Indian film director who makes realistic cinema of international quality, it is not the film of Shekhar Kapur that you should see; They are the later works of three Indian filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen and Girish Karnad and, of course, "Umrao Jaan" by Muzaffar Ali. It is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that Kapur had to give them and their films an international audience. For example, the "Oka oorie katha" of Sen made in Telugu, or the "Sadgati" of Satyajit Ray, based on the "Kafan" of Munshi Prem Chand, are more complete as films for an intelligent viewer that deals with the state of the untouchables in India. Sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence, but simply suggested them. Of course, Sen's nugget did not make headlines, while Kapur's effort took them over. <br /> <br /> For Kapur credit, he is articulate and used his limited talent and modest resources in Mumbai's film industry to take his products beyond the home. audiences For that effort, I greet Kapur. But "Bandit Queen" will remain a big issue awaiting an accomplished director to deal with that.
