I do not have much to say, this is a great end to the story. Most people have said that there is not enough plot and that it is simply a treat. However, think about it, everything was explained in FFVII: you can not add more plot to a story so big that it would ruin it. They did the best they could and I think this should be taken more like A Final FMV ... the last fight. <br /> <br /> Graphics - 10/10, Absolutely amazing <br /> <br /> History 8.5 / 10 - I do not think they could expand it much more. And what they could put there was smart enough as I thought. <br /> <br /> Characters 9/10 - Well, most of them have already been explained during the game, but still could not be placed in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10, since I'm a metal fan, I loved the music of the fight ... and the piano arrives right there ... it's a great ST and it did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Tilt / Reproduction 10/10 - Always nice. <br /> <br /> General: 9/10 (Fan view of FF 10/10) <br /> <br /> Personally, I think this is what was needed, a fight to end everything ... The plot was already in place. The action was necessary as much as people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII just one last time. <br /> <br /> Just remember this ... most of the movies that have been made of a game have been directed by film directors, I think this is pretty good for a team of game directors ... I do not think I've seen a better game to watch movies ... <br /> <br /> Thanks, Square, I think you did it right!
