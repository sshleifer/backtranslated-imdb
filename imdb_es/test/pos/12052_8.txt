I had never seen a Bollywood movie before, but I caught the first ten minutes of this, I giggled and pressed the R button on Sky +. I am happy to have done it !! I hope not to insult anyone (because, basically, BF and I loved it!), But we could not take it as seriously as the actors did, especially the obsessed one (who, I understand, is a great Bollywood star. Because we've seen him on the cover of many DVDs since then and I even saw a doll of him in Hamleys! The boyfriend keeps talking about this guy, I'm starting to think he's obsessed! He goes on saying it's weird for the traditionally handsome to to be the anti-hero of a movie, but we like movies that are not his predictable Hollywood food). <br /> <br /> It was completely exaggerated but very funny. If all Bollywood movies are like that, then we are seeing more. I've had that bloomin song in my head all week and I can not say a word of Hindi! PS any recommendation would be appreciated!
