I still can not believe that computer graphics can create 3D images. The moment I heard it from my friends in a forum, I swear to myself that I'm going to let me see it. <br /> <br /> I managed to see parts of him at a mall where they had many DVDs from Advent Children and showed them on some laptops for sale. Obviously I was very happy, but still not enough. Then I went to YouTube.com to find the movie. All I could think of was music video dedications. Until that fateful day ... I found it. I saw it despite all the distractions because I knew I had to see or else they will call me a loser. <br /> <br /> Enough about me more in the movie. As if Final Fantasy VII was not enough, they made a movie about it! My favorite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. Cloud OmniSlash could not be better. But it would not completely ruin the show for you. You have to look at it yourself! Get the DVD now!
