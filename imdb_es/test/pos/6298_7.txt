I have read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration for The Consquences of Love is that he was simply left alone in a business hotel in a Brazilian hotel and speculated about what he might be doing there. The film unfolds in a similar way. We see the existence of Titta who has lived alone in a hotel in Switzerland for 8 years. It is reserved and avoids friendship. His life is dominated by order and regularly. Gradually, the truth of his existence is revealed to us until, finally, his world begins to fall apart. <br /> <br /> The mystery of Titta is fundamental for the consequences of love and works largely thanks to Toni Servillo's excellent performance. His character becomes increasingly intriguing as small details are revealed: he injects heroin once a week, which has no imagination. Although some here criticize the dialogue for not being naturalists, that does not matter in my opinion, it's not that kind of film, and I think the script is great. The work with the camera is also excellent. <br /> <br /> If you have to criticize, the movie loses its way in the last scenes as it reveals the mystery of Titta's existence and his world begins to fall. apart. However, the final tragic scenes are as good as the previous ones.
