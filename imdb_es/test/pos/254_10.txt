I just returned to see 08th MS Gundam for the second time. It's much better than Gundam Wing. I can not wait to get the DVD and see what was edited from the series. This is great to see the Gundams actually move awkwardly around the earth. Someone really thought about writing this movement script. <br /> <br /> Look at this today,.
