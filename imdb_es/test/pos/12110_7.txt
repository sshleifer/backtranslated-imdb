A rare and long function of Kinski has the role of Crazy Johnny, a crazed outlaw by sex that is wanted in San Francisco. Kinski's character is obsessed with raping women from a sexual predator in the old west who has nothing more to steal, rape and kill in his mind. This film can be a big disappointment for many fans of Spaghetti Western, but not for many Klaus Kisnki fans. In general, there were two things in his favor: a great performance by Klaus Kinski and great music by Stelvio Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another story line that required a lot more work to be shocking but still fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It would be nice to see this film remade in the future. Since most of the old movies are being remade today.
