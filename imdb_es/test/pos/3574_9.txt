An intelligent and well obtained film that is worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this exciting and really smart movie filmed in its entirety in Bogotá, you can feel the full meaning of the word "Bluff" (although it is a Colombian film, the title is presented in English); ! <br /> <br /> The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who finds his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; After this, Nicolas is left without a girlfriend and without a job. The revenge of Nicolas to Mallarino consists of following him and obtaining photographs of him with his new adventure, Alexandra (Carolina Gómez), to blackmail Mallarino and obtain money in exchange for not showing the photographs to Margarita. <br /> <br /> The story is really intelligent and is well related, to the point that you will fully understand the meaning of the title, the film shows a thriller with many scenes and comic characters, resulting in a real pleasure for someone who enjoys films focused on a good script. <br /> <br /> I stress here that this film is different from the typical Colombian films that show a dark and violent image of our beautiful country, which is something really refreshing. Some critics say that this story does not show the typical way of life of Colombia, so it could be done anywhere in the world, I do not agree with this: (1) the film is totally filmed in Bogotá, so you can see streets , and images of the real Colombian capital (I hope that some Americans and film producers see this so that they stop showing the Amazonian jungle or the small Mexican cities in Bogotá as in some Hollywood movies), (2) the characters, dialogues, Accent (with the exception of Nicolás who is from Argentina) are totally from here, Rosemary (Veronica Orozco) has a typical Cali accent, (3) she can also see the social and cultural differences of ordinary people in Bogotá. I hope that all this, plus a title in English, will move people from other countries to see this masterpiece by Martínez. Excellent performance by Veronica Orozco, Luis Eduardo Arango (detective Wilson Montes), Felipe Botero, outstanding as a detective. Ricardo Pérez and the good performance of Mallarino, Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A film that is worth exporting, that people from all over the world will surely understand and enjoy. Do not miss this movie 9/10!
