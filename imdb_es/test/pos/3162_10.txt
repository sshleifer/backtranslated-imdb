Much of the USA The film can be summarized in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country against the war and a kind of Hollywood falsehood that glorifies things that should not be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the opinion of the filmmaker about recent events (although, honestly, I can not always say exactly where he is), but I admire the unusual and artistic way of conveying the message. The audio tracks of the speeches, the radio interviews, the poetry, etc. they play a role as important as the images. Most of the time, the visual elements of the story are accompanied by these audio elements with good results. I'm a kind of radio aficionado, so it was satisfying to hear the way the radio integrated into the rhythm of the movie. In fact, most of the dialogue takes place over the story, rather than the characters talking to each other. That does not mean that there are no "characters" (real people), but with the exception of "Jim", the protagonist (a kind of abandonment of the 60s with an erratic state of mind) the others come and go rather quickly. A few make a very powerful impression, especially a taxi driver similar to a guru who seems to be the very voice of wisdom. When he breaks into a spontaneous prayer song while driving Jim to the subway, it's a very powerful moment. On the cover of the DVD is the quote "The danger is clear," which has been taken from the speech of President Bush that paved the way to our incursion into Iraq. In retrospect, listening to that speech at a climactic moment in the film made us see how we live in a historically charged moment that will always be remembered.
