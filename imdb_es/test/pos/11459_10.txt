I must say. This is easily one of my favorite movies to watch on Halloween. The Halloween party, the horrible performance, the dressed guy and extra Miami Vice. GREAT GREAT BIG !!! <br /> <br /> ******************** SPOILERS ************** ****** ******* <br /> <br /> I have a huge place in my heart for 80's horror movies at random and this spread and pulled the strings of my heart. I always pass this movie on Blockbuster and I always laughed at the top of the box. Now, every weekend I took a random movie that I had never seen ... a weekend was Angelas' turn. It seemed to have been provoking me for months. So I took it home, put it on and spent most of the movie under the blanket. <br /> <br /> For me, it was scary and disgusting. And not just the performance! Some of the things that came to mind for this movie were INCREDIBLE. I can honestly say that the best part for me was seeing Suzanne (played by an iowan partner) passing a tube of lipstick across her nipple. It was random and I loved it. Seeing the spooky Angela float down the hallways and hear her creepy demon voice was enough to wake me up ALL NIGHT. <br /> <br /> It's not one of the smartest or best-acting horror films. But its 80's cheese and its all the elements you need. Creepy Goth Kid, Virgin, Slut, Naked Girls, Scary House, Bad Acting, oh and did I mention Naked Girls? All the elements were there and they came together in such a way that they made for one of my favorite movies. Congratulations to the filmmakers.
