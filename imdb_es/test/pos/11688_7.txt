If you liked this movie, make sure you visit other people led by Hrebejk: a whim awaits you. Unfortunately, this is not your best moment, but it is still millions of times better than an average movie in conventional cinema. Explore relationships, especially abusive ones, have some powerful moments as well as sweets and a great performance. Some inconsistencies of the plot, clich√©s and hollow moments spoil the general effect. For the previous critic and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I do not see this film becoming a Czech box office success. These people are pretty spoiled by the creators of their films (check out the things of Sverak, Gedeon) and this is delayed a bit.
