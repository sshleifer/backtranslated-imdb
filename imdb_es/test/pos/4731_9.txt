Many people remember the Waco confrontation that happened a long time ago. What most people have probably ingrained in their minds is the "cult leader" David Koresh and the images of the compound that burns in the ground after a long confrontation. Many people believe that Koresh was a kind of madman who thought he was God. He was accused of being a child molester and was credited with the collapse and death of his followers. In addition, many people feel that the cult committed suicide en masse when the FBI broke into the Mount Carmel Center and when the building was on fire. Most people feel that the cult was to blame for not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people feel that Koresh washed the brain of the cult and followed everything he said. Nothing could be further from the truth, due to strong evidence after the nightmare ended, and this unique documentary proves it enough. <br /> <br /> This documentary is one of the most balanced exams in the situation that occurred. It is much more complete and detailed than anything that most people have received in traditional media. To the surprise of many people, this documentary will reveal that it was the ATF, the FBI and the highest levels of government in the United States that were the unjust, cruel and deceptive, and not David Koresh and his followers. What Korseh and the Davidians were doing was simply protecting their constitutional rights, and the higher powers violated and completely violated those rights. The AFT had no reason to assault the complex; It was the AFT that fired first and fired from the helicopters from above men, women and unarmed children! What is even more shocking are the actions of the FBI when they entered Mount Carmel. Look at it for yourself and you will develop a new perspective on the government of the United States. There are infrared images that clearly show that the FBI was firing machine guns at men, women and children in the burning compound. It will boil your blood. It will make you very angry. It will make you wonder what kind of people run this country. Finally, it will make you wonder as to what they tell you in the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This video is scary and I recommend it highly if one can find it. This documentary does not need to be purchased; You can watch it for free in google video!
