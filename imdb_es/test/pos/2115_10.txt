This is the kind of movie I grew up in. It is a great family fun, that children love and parents also enjoy. I would like more movies like this one to be made. It's a great story about a boy who raises a Bull with his mother and sister, and shows him up to the Grand National Championship, where he wins! Then he is afraid that someone will roast his bull, so he kidnaps him and goes home with him. I was very excited when I saw this movie for the first time in the theater and I was surprised to see George Strait, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little movie. The music was great with all kinds of names from great countries like Willie Nelson and the Dixie Chicks. Anyone who does not enjoy this movie, has no children or was never a child.
