This film was presented on channel seven, Australian television, today. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was a very interesting insight into how the Nazis treated Russian Jews mercilessly as everywhere. <br /> <Kellie Martin did a great job, and her tears and frustration as "Frusia" were quite convincing. <br /> <br /> The Holocaust is a part of our history that we MUST NOT FORGET. The list of Schindlers was not the first, and will not be the last, the account of survival and value in that nightmare of five years. My family is Dutch, and I will always applaud all the filmmakers who want to keep the candlelight alive by telling the courage of someone to get up and help those who were abused, raped and killed for being "a Jew".
