In a nutshell, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were notable. The film is less about the raw science of Darwin's beliefs, and focuses a lot on his relationship with his family, mainly his wife, Emma, ​​and his daughter, Annie. <br /> <br /> Toby Jones takes a wonderful turn as Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast, is in the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly. <br /> <br /> But it's those two who carry the movie. His true chemistry is evident from beginning to end, but he develops transcendence when Darwin struggles with his demons. The scene in which Darwin relates the end of Jenny's story, the orangutan, with his dying daughter, Annie, is absolutely gripping. The world premiere audience at TIFF was fascinating. Bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the best of the year in a short time. Equally magnificent is the work of Connelly playing the religious wife of a man who, in the words of Huxley, "killed God." <br /> <br /> The movie moves slowly through the full spectrum of Darwin's grief, enjoying every detail of Bettany and Connelly Acting. <br /> <br /> Brilliant.
