In the final credits of "Shadows," after reading "directed by John Cassavetes," you can see some white letters on the screen: "The movie you just saw is improvised," they say. I always pursue the fact that words are so important in movies since the filmmakers started using them because, basically, there is no film without a script and many other reasons. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes pursued the same goal, and he believed in the freedom of words; "Shadows" is the perfect example. It is a movie without real main characters, without real main plot lines; They are mostly people in different situations, speaking. Yes, some of the situations are connected, but Cassavetes, apparently always rushed to talk, uses a fast-forward technique when the characters go somewhere or escape someone and do not speak. <br /> <br /> Appearances are everything in this movie. For example, there is a brilliant score, full of jazz influences and many fantastic solos, and there is a character who says he is a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (Ben, all the names of the characters are the same as those of the actors). However, we never see him play the trumpet or play a band; He does not even talk about music and he simply walks with his friends around the city. They talk a lot, and about anything they have in mind; going from how smart each of them is to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture. <br /> <br /> "Sombras" is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the previous one, because these friends are not educated. The only important female character in the film (Lelia), however, wants to be an intellectual. But, again, she has a very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about a book he's trying to write and about how to face reality; But nothing to do with being intellectual. In that same party, a woman is actually making an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and asks a boy next to her: "Do you agree?" "Yes," he says, but you can say he does not know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Another character, a singer (Hugh), talks about his glory days at times, and we see him perform only once. But there are no references to the music industry there. Cassavetes' approach is the singer's relationship with his manager (Rupert), which most of the time involves talks about trivial things and not real "musical" conversations. So the trumpet's important agreement in "Sombras" is the time he spends with his friends; The aspiring intellectual is her way of handling romantic relationships (one of the film's strong points) and that of the singer is the link with her manager. Appearances. <br /> <br /> The reason why performances are not important in this movie. it is simple. Cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation, regardless of whether they were really good. I think some of them are not, but surely they know how to improvise in a scene, and you can notice how well they do it. "Sombras" is not about artists; It is a way of making movies, based on the magic of conversation; and there you could say that the performances mean something. <br /> <br /> That's why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker, constantly in the eyes of each character, constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech. There is a scene in which the trumpeter and his friends are trying to pick up some girls. There are three, so each of them sits next to a girl (the girls are three two) in three different tables. Everyone talks at the same time and the camera shoots through the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other, while saying what they say, it's natural.
