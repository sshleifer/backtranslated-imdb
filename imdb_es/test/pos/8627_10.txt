The duo of Abbott and Costello live in this version of a classic of history. In "Jack and the Beanstalk", there is everything to see, music, magic and comedy in one. Costello plays with Jack after hearing the story that a child told him once. We know that Jack was a poor boy who sells his "Dolly" for 5 magic beans. Well, he planted those 5 beans, and in fact they were magical. Go up to heaven, see a big castle there, and sing a song, unaware that you would meet the giant (Buddy Baer). Not only him, he would dance with the woman who was also a giant. She hit Jack with her elbows during the dance. That was fun! You have the harp you play, who knows how to make the giant so easy. The goose that lays golden eggs. And my favorite, the way Jack gets rid of the giant. He takes the ax and started cutting the stem. Another funny thing is that the ax got stuck during the cut and the final celebration happens when people dance around the footprint where the giant fell. Lots of fun and fun for the whole family too. Highly recommended! 5 stars!
