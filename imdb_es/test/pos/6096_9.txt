This must be one of the funniest Danish films ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are fun, as they cross Sweden. I do not know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he can become a madman in a very healthy way. BUT if you do not understand Danish (I do not mean your pastry here), do not waste your time on this? I do not think it works with subtitles.
