The late director John Frankenheimer directed his first feature film, The Young Stranger, after starting directing live television dramas in New York City. This film was produced shortly after the success of Rebel Without a Cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his film debut as a teenager with problems with a father film producer, played by James Daly, who does not establish a sufficient relationship with his son. Kim Hunter plays the mother, who tries to close the gap between her husband and her son. The film uses the popular juvenile delinquency angle of the time to tell its story. MacArthur gets into trouble at a movie theater with an overzealous theater manager played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur, in turn, has to deal with a police sergeant, James Gregory, willing to teach him a lesson. The material could easily become exploitative, ridiculous and sensational, as did so many others of the time. However, under the safe guidance of Frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive portrait of the dynamics of teenagers and parents. The dialogue is realistic and most of the scenes are surprisingly good. Some of the scenes with Bissell, as the theater manager, and Gregory, as the police sergeant, are a bit heavy and dated. However, the performances are uniformly good, which is necessary for a film of this nature and on this subject to be successful. This is an impressive film debut for both MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.
