In recent months, I have seen many comments on The Italian Job, many of them negative. The essence of almost all these pessimistic critiques is that, despite all their modernist bravado and high-budget technology, the film does not have much substance in what counts. Look, people, it's just a funny movie. This is the kind of image in which you are supposed to sit, relax and enjoy the constant rhythm of the movie. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can focus on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to think much (luckily for some of us). Of course, "Ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot may have some holes (there is a huge one about 3/4 of the way), the action may not be as rewardingly free as the trailers made it possible, and part of the dialogue may seem pointless and corny, but again, a Who really cares? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What else do you want? I think it's time to leave the fake Roger Ebert with the act of Gene Shalit and have fun for once. Oh, and another thing, whatever you do, do not compare it with the original because, to reiterate what F. Gary Gray has told the press a million times, THIS IS NOT A REJECTION! My advice is that, if you are interested in choosing yourself through a funny and humorous movie, do not even bother to watch The Italian Job. But, if you do not have a serious inferiority complex and / or want to see Ed Norton being kidnapped by a group of Ukrainians, go ahead. The Bottom Line, my movie companions, is: Enlighten and have fun, damn it.
