Maybe the best movie ever made by director Kevin Tenney (well, his Witchboard is not on the list of the best in my history), this is a strange and fascinating mix between Pin and Child's Play, both better than this, but not so better Of course, the plot is designed and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good, Rosalind Allen is very nice to look at (and also CanDance McKenzie, God bless her for the shower scene!), the child actress is very Good acting The disturbed daughter and the puppet of Pinocchio are terrifying enough to give you some chills down your spine. For a B movie it's not bad at all.
