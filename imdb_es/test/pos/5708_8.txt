THE STUDENT NURSE is not a typical sexploitation movie. Of course, nudity and sexual openness are there, but it's not all to laugh at. Stephanie Rothman wrote a script for a socially compelling and well-written tits and ass movie that addresses issues of racism, socioeconomic inequality, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, war of Vietnam, free love, LSD and drugs. experimentation. Four sexy schoolmates are taking their nursing practices at the same time. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to the terminal care room, Lynn (Brioni Farrell) to the public health administration, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh) to gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) to psychiatry. These four beauties have ample opportunities to undress and fornicate, of which they take advantage, to the delight of male spectators. These are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution, after all, and they are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful. The visceral but low budget action sequences are interspersed throughout. There is a very bloody shooting in the headquarters of the resistance movement in which two policemen are shot to death, along with several members of the group. A protest against the war (in Vietnam) that consists of young people of all races and ghostly dresses painted as skeletons becomes violent, with policemen beating the protesters. The sequence of effective travel on the beach consists of beautiful, strange and confusing sensory and memory mounts with hyper-sensual insinuations. In summary, THE STUDENT NURSES is a reflective and convincing reflection of the times, expressed through real perspectives of women (since it was written and directed by a woman). But, it's still fun and exciting, despite its sober treatment of the subject.
