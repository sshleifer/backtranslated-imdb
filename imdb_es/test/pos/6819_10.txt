I looked at this a few moments ago on the website of the Sundance Film Festival, and I must say that it is absolutely amazing. I expected it to be entertaining, like all Sundance shorts, but I was not prepared for such deep sadness and yet also a sense of passion and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen any of this year's festival entries, I suggest you go to the site and see these mini masterpieces. I've seen them all and I can honestly say 'The Youth In Us' is the one that has touched my heart the most. I'm not the weakest member of the audience when it comes to romance in movies, but my eyes flooded so much I'm surprised I could still see the screen. <br /> <br /> I agree with 'addicted2you', it's truly a masterpiece of management work, and cinematography will take your breath away. <br /> <br /> I can not think of a better way to spend an additional 12 minutes.
