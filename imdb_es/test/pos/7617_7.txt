Very sad, I can relate to this movie, since I am 17 years old, and I have not yet been kissed, so I really feel for Josie. It's been a while since I saw this movie, but to write this review, I saw it again and I remembered everything that I loved. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is a great actress, and this role went very well. at the time. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good, and Michael Vartan was an excellent actor in this. <br /> <br /> I also loved the story: as I said above, I could relate, and it is rare that you find a movie that you can relate to completely. <br /> <br /> Everywhere, I loved it. 7/10
