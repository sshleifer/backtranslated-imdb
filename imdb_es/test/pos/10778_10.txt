<br /> <br /> Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine, a rude person, with boundless energy and uncompromising vision. host of the face conversation radio. He is a natural for this type of role, and he tunes one of the most impressive and interesting radio personalities that I have seen on the screen. The moment and delivery of their insults to their various callers are blows of genius. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry's boss. It shows the same explosive cynicism that the Glengarry Glen Ross of 1992 would later show. But the supporting role that really stands out is the seemingly brain-dead, stoned teenager, played by Michael Wincott. Must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a great job with photography, which is almost totally limited to a single broadcast room. The claustrophobic sensation of the film perfectly reflects its tone. After all, one of the main points of the film is to exploit the private moments of the people to attract an audience. Stone shows that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is a film with a strong emotional and cerebral impact, like the one rarely seen today.
