The first time I saw this movie was when I visited my uncle in Arizona about 3 and a half years ago. The VHS print was a bit discolored, but I was very obsessed with what I had seen. Everything makes sense? Well, honestly, no, he did not. However, this is a film that requires more than one visualization to understand all its aspects. The beautifully tragic score chased me and the strange images left a quiet impression. <br /> <br /> Well, when I discovered that Anchor Bay had released this weirdness on DVD, I detected it immediately. I felt very satisfied with the transfer, although I felt that the extras were missing. Although the film refers to the characters of "O" and Sir Stephen, it really has nothing to do with the original novel by Pauline Reage or the 1974 film The Story of O. However, the film pays attention to the artistic details and to the symbolism of an almost mystical form. . "Or" decides to prostitute himself for Sir Stephen in the violent Hong Kong of the twenties. His mission is to demonstrate his endless devotion and love for his master by surrendering his body to other men. Naturally, Sir Stephen enjoys observing her during her unpleasant sexual adventures and even finds herself as a lover. However, the tables change when "O" actually finds a kind of love with a young admirer. Suddenly, Sir Stephen feels the threat ... <br /> <br /> I feel that the deep meaning behind the film (including the tragic score and the artistic direction) really makes this film a classic. The viewer is presented not only to the lives and pasts of the "O" brothel buddies, but also to the turmoil of the 1920s in Hong Kong. Like the political scene, prostitutes are all in need of belonging. No one is happy in the movie, even if they think they are. (However, "O" finds a sense of happiness with his young admirer). A prostitute remembers with tears how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk, which naturally leads to a fetish for making her customers act like a dog. Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. She can not let go of that vision. She treats her clients as co-stars and even swears that she listens to a piano on the river. <br /> <br /> As for "O", she has a memory that her father left her in a chalk circle. When he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. Of course, in that same flashback, Kinski suddenly becomes his father. I was very, very disturbed by this image. I really felt for "O" at this point in the movie. She almost never smiles and this scene really explains why. His fear of abandonment is so great that he sees Sir Stephen as his father and attends all his obscene demands in the hope of showing his love. <br /> <br /> Another curious aspect of the film is the little boy (who ages at the end) who sells fortune in a box. It is a very random character, but somehow adds to the feeling of loss and emptiness in the film. At one point, the director even uses cardboard figures painted to represent people. Now, if that is not symbolism for you! (Laughter) <br /> <br /> In general, I love this movie. I feel it is a very profound and somewhat moving experience. It has erotic scenes, but the scenes are not really meant to awaken. Like the lives of the characters, sexual acts are empty. They are motions, but they lack feeling and tenderness. (Once again, the only tender scene is between "O" and the young man). "Or" believes that she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor, however, in the end she discovers she has options. She can also be her own person and pursue her own happiness, however, she also has the option of staying in that circle that her father drew. The director leaves many questions unanswered, however, some things do not need answers. The viewer will make the judgment that works for them. <br /> <br /> I must say that I want a special edition of this DVD that has comments from the director to be released. I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion about the film and its message years later. It's a pity that the soundtrack has never been released. This movie has a truly disturbing and heartbreaking score. There is something about the persistent voices that send a chill down my spine. I can really feel the feeling of loneliness in the movie just by listening to the music.
