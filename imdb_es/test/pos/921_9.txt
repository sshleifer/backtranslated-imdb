This is a classic continuation of Bleu, the excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as the main star, in addition, it is an appearance here, in Rouge, just for a second at the end. But this film, truly red and very sweet, although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by the always brilliant Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full and active life, only obscured by her traumatic relationships with her strange friend Mike, who is in England. By some luck, she befriends the old judge, who spends time listening to the private telephone conversations of her neighbors. The story begins to weave even more, and we see it in court, condemned almost universally by his pastime. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute puppy Rita and her puppies, and for all the people around them. We also witness the breakup of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their dispute is also driven by that phone scandal ... But the film is not about this, even. It is mainly about loneliness and deep divisions between people, distant and close. When she sails to England on a ferry, with that lawyer as a traveling companion, as well as the aforementioned Binoche who starred in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of The Judge when he sees the news trying to Guess if he survived. He did, and we still feel very heavy at heart. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a grandiose and subtle story about loneliness, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep and dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. Bright movie
