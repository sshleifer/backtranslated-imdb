RENDITION is a film not to be missed with a strong writing by Kelley Sane and with the direction of Gavin Hood that takes us to a story that is a journey through the journey of a man through hell. Once again, Meryl Streep in a convincing role of the CIA today and great performances by a cast of superlative actors in Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin, along with actors of Middle Eastern descent who join the reality of the story . <Br /> <br /> In the SURRENDER, we see how "terrorism can breed terrorism" and, as the film progresses, relating the story to what is developing in the Middle East, reality is presented on the screen. The external shots increase the intensity of the story and Peter Sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an assistant in the way American politics is carried out. It's a pity that there is not a bigger audience for this film, as with THE VALLEY OF ELAH and LIONS FOR LAMBS, the SURRENDER plays an important role in showing the audience how the struggle and the protection of democracy can be seriously deviated.
