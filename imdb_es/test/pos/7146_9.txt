This movie was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing scripts ever written. It is well executed, acted and directed. The cinematography is a bit dark for my taste, but I'm sure it was meant to be that way. The script is like poetry in parts of the film, throughout the film I found myself pausing to reflect on the comments we have just made on the screen. This is a wonderful piece of cinema and I can only hope that more people will find it and add comments. Fair warning though this was a 6 fabric movie for me. Very touching. Very sincere actions.
