I had never seen the original Death Wish in the book Death Wish I (film). However, Death Wish 3 was the movie very interested. The well-known watchman, Paul Kersey, tried to visit his friend, Charlie, but only visited him for a couple of minutes before he died, because Charlie did not pay protection to the huge and infamous underground gang led by Manny Franker. After a bit of altercation during his stay in prison, Kersey learned that Franker, with whom he fought in prison, had his own agenda to turn the city of New York into hell (and also its influence) by sending his henchmen to commit the crime each time. Everywhere and every day. Due to the possibility given by the insp. Richard Shriker who knows his profile well and likes him a lot. Kersey decided to start the war with Franker and his gang. <br /> <br /> I accepted that Death Wish III was one of the most violent and extreme violence action movies I had seen in the past. This movie used the very simple way to tell the story. Without heavy narrations and less unnecessary scenes, that was the only merit of the movie. In the next issue, Violence was used widely in the film. I thought that many of the viewers might like the action scene of Death Wish III because it showed the raw, extreme and explosive action for every minute of the movie, especially the climactic scene of the film and the death of Manny Franker, which I thought. It was the scene of maximum action. <br /> <br /> For the cast, I think they were all good and exceeded their role. Charles Bronson made everyone believe he is still as good as Paul Kersey. He did not look like the "big old cat", but the great vigilante. Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very well. His main villain role in the movie made him look unpleasant and look like the big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this film was pathetic. She did not look like the main character. I thought she only appeared in the scene two or three before Franker and his follower killed her to warm Paul Kersey. She could have more paper to appear. <br /> <br /> For my comment, the rule style and extreme violence made this movie a great opportunity for fans of extreme action movies. Fast paced, with style of back and style, this film was very interested in seeing it. However, this movie had a silly scene and a plot hole. First, the scene in which Insp.Shriker faced Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very corny because you attacked your favorite guy before you wanted him to help, it's similar to how you hit a guy before trying to lend him some money. LOL! That's like a joke! Although I liked the plot twist when Insp.Shriker was shown later that he helped Kersey because at first, Shriker looked a lot like the villain because of his performance in Kersey, but when the movie climaxed, everything became clear That I did not have a hidden agenda with Kersey. <br /> <br /> In another case, the final scene of the film made me back down. You stumble on everyone's feeling because it ended too easy. The members of Franker's gang seemed unbelievable after discovering that Franker was dead, before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to leave his city before the police caught him. I thought that this style of final scene could be found in many Cannon Film films, but I do not like it. <br /> <br /> For the summary, I'm fine with Death Wish 3 because of my explanation that I wrote first. The cast, and the action was very good and extreme, I even had a scene that I do not like. The rule and Extreme of Violence could be the best brief description of this movie.
