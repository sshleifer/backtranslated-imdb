Satisfy the fantasy with the ships that sail through the clouds with cannons, evil conspirators, strange landscapes, manipulations of time, great scenarios, without reality, maybe like Never Ending Story or something of Merlin. If you like that, you will love it. Christine Taylor is beautiful. The fight with swords is false. Music is a delight. Good victories, they kiss, everything is fine, and the cook is happy.
