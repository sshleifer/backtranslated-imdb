Despite all the negative reviews, I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not saying this lightly. I love movies and I am quite demanding with them (my home DVD collection has more than 9,000 movies, some are great, others are fine, some I do not like at all). And, to all who criticize: this is a comedy. I just love this movie. It is light, fun and very quiet. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies, but I love it. The comedy talents of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are taken advantage of (totally - for this type of film). Do not compare it with other movies with these star actors, just enjoy it. The cast is great and, I think, the purpose of this movie was completely fulfilled. If you want a really "quiet" and very quiet night, watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy just had fun doing this movie, we should also (see it). And, please, do not be so negative. Do not expect the performance of Godfather or Meet The Parents by DeNiro, do not expect the performance of Murphy's comedy hits ... It's a completely different genre, and it made me relax after a hard day's work. It is possible that its sides do not separate from laughter, but it is still VERY funny.
