One of the enduring classics of MGM came out in the last years of World War II, is the film that made the young Elizabeth Taylor a star. She had made some films as a child actress before National Velvet, but when she left her place in the cinema she was insured. Ironically, biologically, it would grow fast enough after National Velvet left and her next fight as an actress was to get important adult roles because the casting directors only saw her as the innocent little Velvet Brown who loved her jumping horse. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this would work because the horses of the obstacle course have to have confirmed the bloodlines and the Pi are a subject that is not dealt with in National Velvet. All we know is that he is a reckless and inexorable horse in the hands of Reginald Owen and after being freed and causing considerable damage, Owen gets rid of him for a nominal price to the local butcher Donald Crisp. <br /> <br /> At the same time these things happen, Mickey Rooney delves into the lives of the Brown family, which consists of Crisp, his wife Anne Revere and their daughters Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley and Elizabeth Taylor and their younger brother Butch Jenkins. Rooney is a former rider who is now on the open road and is addressing the Brown family, where his father was once a horse trainer for Anne Revere's family. It is he who sees the potential of Pi (abbreviation of pirate) as a jumper and it is Elizabeth who convinces Crisp not to let this opportunity pass. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and innocent at National Velvet. The Good Book says you must have faith as a child and she has to skimp on herself. She infuses Rooney, to have faith in Pi's heart and ability and to leave it a little for himself. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere won the Best Supporting Actress Award for National Velvet. She is a very wise mother who has hidden depths that the public does not suspect. It turns out that in his youth he had a little taste of fame and glory swimming in the English Channel and his cash prize, which he has kept for all these years, which he gives to his daughter. That scene is probably what earned him the Oscar. National Velvet also won another Academy Award for Film Editing. <br /> <br /> More than 60 years after his National Velvet debut as a family classic he has not lost anything. His depiction of life among the world wars in Britain remains a highlight. And National Velvet released a legendary film. You can not do much better than that for high esteem.
