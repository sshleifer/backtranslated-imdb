A jewel of a British comedian. The poor American club Pinky Green (Richard Jordan, who plays another bad guy, but this time an adorable one) leaves a British jail and tries to go straight, but his job as a maintenance man in a bank is too attractive for his friends criminals never reformed, headed by a really nasty Ivan (David Niven in one of his last papers). Pinky resists, but the appeal of all that money is too much for him. Things unravel and happen again and it's a pleasure to see them. Jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same twice, this one is too worthy to hate. Niven never played a bad guy, with oil everywhere. Two good actors that we have lost, I wish we had returned.
