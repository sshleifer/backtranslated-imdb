WOW, a masterpiece of a movie that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what this movie was when I started watching it late at night. I did not realize it was a Stone movie until after the movie when I went to IMDb. Seeing him, I was hypnotized. The cast, especially Eric Bogosian is simply excellent. One of the best scripts and the best camera work ... The film attracted me and it kept me fascinated until the end ... I did not dare to blink for fear of missing something ... It's amazing how a low movie can be budget. So absorbing and well done, while big-budget movies that feature tons of action and special effects generated by computer can be incredibly boring. Do not miss this movie ...
