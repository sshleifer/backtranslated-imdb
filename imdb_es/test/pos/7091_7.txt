Sometimes I wonder if maybe Meryl Streep has been as accepted as the most impressive and versatile actress since, well, maybe about the beginning of the era of sound, maybe her talent is now taken for granted. There are probably around three tics that she trusts constantly throughout her performances (most notably a pinched lip), but other than that, her performances are incredibly variable, original and new expressions of inner workings. Even though "Sophie's Choice" and "A Cry in the Dark" and "Silkwood" may be more striking, their work here and in "Bridges in Madison County" is also extraordinary, just more subtle. In "One True Thing", she is sweet and in love with her domestic life, and Streep makes what could be routine, even boring, look attractive and charming. I think she should elaborate these mini-theses for each character and find out what things make this person real and interesting. She works from the inside out with each character, and perhaps it is this essential quality that has evoked the main criticism of indifference or self-consciousness. I do not think he's cold at all, but he has thought about the unique qualities of his character. I think his critics confuse self-consciousness with intelligence. Not many other actors would be so complex and creative as to make Kate Muldrun light and carefree within her beloved and homely environment, only to reveal an unprecedented depth due to her genuine attachment to that homely environment. Their performances are of an insurmountable consistency, rarely do something bad. I wonder if it is possible that some of the Streep photos do not seem to diminish due to their presence ... Anyway, Kate loves her home and her affection for her "family life" is as endearing as her new conflict within the home is discordant. When all this comes together, Kate begins to recognize that she can no longer function in the same way, she breaks the cake and screams that she is not disabled, it is painful to see him because she has not been someone. prone to emotion. Streep is smart enough and generous enough to recognize that everything works better because she has felt the dramatic validity of Kate and is really the only scene in which she allows her character to leave. But it's really encouraging to see a character that can really surprise you by showing something you would not have thought possible. Once again, the Streep character has at least three dimensions ... God, this sounds like a thesis itself, but as an actress, Streep has only a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy and great expressive skills. The movie itself is probably something mediocre. I suppose William Hurt is destined to be an unpleasant jerk, and he does the pomp very well. Although I think Hurt is really a bit creepy. The script is quite standard, another tribute to Streep for being as moving and credible as her.
