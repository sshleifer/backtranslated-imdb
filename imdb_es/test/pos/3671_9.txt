Find the killer among the homeless in Chicago. <br /> <br /> The whole cast sings at various points in the search, and it's excellent, especially. The talented Bates and Price. This unlikely story, funny and strange, is one of the most decentered films. The cameos of Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow and Sally Jesse Raphael should tell you how strange this movie is. Strange, funny and off-center, but with a good perspective on people with all kinds of differences.
