"Distant" is a film of Turkish life that follows the mundane activities of two adult cousins; one a photographer and the other an unemployed person. There is little doubt that author Nuri Bilge Ceylan is a work in progress with considerable talent. However, this small foreign minimalist artistic drama is so full of empty fillings and so devoid of stories or of anything attractive or provocative that it probably attracts only the most avid devotees of the cinema and the general public. Personally, I got bored quickly with the slow pace of the movie and found myself moving quickly through the empty spaces, and there are many, between the dialogue, the development of the plot and the outcome. "Distant" is a bit of esoteric very well done. (SECOND-)
