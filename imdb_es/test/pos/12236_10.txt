In the changing world of CG and what not of animations of cartoons, etc., Faeries was a warm welcome, at least for me. I think it's important to show this kind of movies from time to time, to preserve them and help us remember where the originality and fun of the cartoons come from. People talked about how boring it is for graphics and those things, but hey! think of the films that will be considered boring if all the films resemble the new and avant-garde that everyone and his mother are doing these days. Call me old-fashioned but I liked it. It's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings and all you really need from your audience is your imagination.
