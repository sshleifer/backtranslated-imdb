A large bed possessed by a demon eats people, among other things. I'm not making it up <br /> <br /> Completed in 1977 and not officially released until it reached the DVD in 2003, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a film whose plot is impossible to describe. Chances are that you know thanks to the excellent part of Patton Oswalt, as well as the essential book by Stephen Throwers "Nightmare USA". As he looks at it, he asks himself the following. <br /> <br />: Who is George Berry and what drugs he smoked / injected / snorted before writing and directing this film? <br /> <br /> -Is this a horror comedy? A combination of a horror movie and an art movie? A strange joke in the audience? <br /> <br /> - What the hell am I seeing? <br /> <br /> "Death Bed" really defies explanation. I know, that term is overused, but it could not be more true than here. This description really begs. It's a horror comedy, as well as a hybrid horror / art movie. But everything is so surreal, you have to see it. The score sounds like the electronic bits of an old album by Candlemass, the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything, the direction is surprisingly competent and the film sometimes looks like a Jesus Franco movie, that is, if his films were intentionally funny . <br /> <br /> In the end, there really is not a proper way to describe this movie. God knows I've tried, but in reality, few movies are so strange, unique or incredible like this. See it ... but it has been warned. This is also the only movie that George Berry has made. Definitely left its mark on the genre of exploitation with this, I'll tell you a lot.
