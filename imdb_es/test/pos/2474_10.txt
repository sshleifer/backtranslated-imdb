The most incredible movie I've ever seen. I did not read the programming and I bumped into the movie by accident. I thought it was a real documentary and I felt sick because of what I saw. I only discovered that it was a movie after it was finished and I searched the web for more information about the "punishment park" in the USA. UU It felt incredibly real and it's easy to believe that this really happened in the USA. UU of Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-American after watching the movie and before discovering that it really was not like that.
