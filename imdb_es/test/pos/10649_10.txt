"Potempkin" by Eisenstien, (Bronenosets Potyomkin), is among the best films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era. Eisenstien was a pioneer of the cinematographic form and his use of editing editing has influenced the films until today. The footage of the Odessa step massacre is as powerful today as it was when it was first seen more than 70 years ago. Do not miss the opportunity to see this movie!
