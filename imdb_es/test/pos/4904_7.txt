Designed with love and terribly interesting to see the great performance of Garfield (introducing a new type of rebellious acting style that would move to Brandos and Clifts and so on after the war), but all that brotherly affection is a bit suffocating. Priscilla Lane is a bright and attractive artist, but the other sisters do not really register (although all are allowed to be tarts and witty) and it cost me a lot to buy any of the other male characters, in addition to Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a very nice actor, but he lacks the weight of a movie star to match Garfield's bad luck, Mickey Borden, and that makes the movie get out of control. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or someone on the paper). Furthermore, he was not convinced that Garfield would make the final (at least) fundamental decision he made. The film needed another half hour of execution time to better explain that action; He feels terribly rushed and unmotivated. <br /> <br /> Even so, it is not difficult to understand how someone who grew up with this image would remember him fondly. It does not become a classic, but it does contain some classic moments. The two revolving scenes of the door are pure magic of the film.
