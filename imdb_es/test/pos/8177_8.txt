This movie is excellent (I saw the French version). There are many subplots (which usually detract from the whole), but they develop and agree with the main theme of the "discovery of the real self". In fact, the whole movie (apart from its background) is the journey towards discovering oneself (or someone else's). Is the King really a "good pacifist monarch" who tries to wage a "war to end all wars" or is he just a troubled and bloodthirsty thug? Is he a true king, after all? Is the Queen Mother's assistant just a non-profit, lustful, race-driven sock puppet, or rather, a bold and intelligent person? Will the lady / concubine realize who the king really is? What is between the king and the old chancellor? What is the secret that everyone knows but will not count? What is the real reason why the murderer abandoned his "job"? Secondary frames (something I do not like very much) are handled well and kept under surveillance until the end. The scenes are well designed and the CGI fits perfectly, without going overboard. The suspense is maintained properly and the actors are up to the task. There are many smiles with brain damage, but this is how one was supposed to behave in the king's court (as the lady / concubine complains). Realistic movie without moments of superheroes. This Chinese movie really puts to shame the colossal cardboard Hollywood (Gladiator, etc.).
