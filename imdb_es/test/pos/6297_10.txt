From the foreground of the conveyor belt in the bank, you could say that this would be a great movie. <br /> <br /> A minimalist touch with a retro touch. This film oozes style: the bright camera. - the work, the acting, the script and the way in which the protagonist's secret life unfolds complement each other to make the best Italian film I have ever seen (until then with La Stanza Del Figlio, although it is different). <br /> <br /> Shame for the people sitting behind me who made it obvious that they could not see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes created by the camera. Do not miss it
