As a Czech, I am very happy when I read these comments here. I am absolutely sure that this movie is great. And what you may not know is that the story was written especially for Mr. Brodsky. The man you can see is him and his typical attitude: live and resist death. He was one of the best actors and we are very lucky that we have done so many beautiful movies during his life. You are lucky to see at least one of them. Enjoy.
