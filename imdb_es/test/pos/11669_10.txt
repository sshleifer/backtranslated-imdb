I am surprised that a filmmaker famous for his political fervor on the left can make such a subtle and unholy image. If you are for capital punishment, you will still be after seeing this. If you are against capital punishment, you will still be against it. But whatever his position, this film, at least, will make him reflect on why he feels the way he does. There is not a false note in the movie.
