Until today, I thought that only three people, including me, considered that Heaven's Gate (1980) was a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western (since 1970), after Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972). ), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). <br /> <br /> I was surprised and pleased to see that 22.5% of those who voted in IMDB rated this movie with a 10, like me. A recent book, The Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate. Through its production and release, it was vilified, since there is no film since Cleopatra, almost twenty years before. There was a time when it was considered the most expensive movie of all time, surpassing even Cleopatra. He was blamed for the fall of his studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw that all the studios were falling. Michael Cimino, fresh out of his glory with the Deer Hunter, was hated and despised for his success and the excess film, but clearly, that was a small envy at its worst. <br /> <br /> Cimino ended up creating one of the best Exhibitions of the American experience. This movie can not be missed, but any serious student of American cinema.
