This movie was a pleasant surprise for me. In all honesty, the previews seemed horrible, to the point that Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented it with a reservation, but I really enjoyed this movie. He had a great performance, some good plot twists and, of course, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. Definitely worth checking out.
