If I assume you know what this movie is about, I am also forced to assume that you have come to this review knowing that you will probably see it regardless of what you say. If all this sounds true, read on, you will probably find some consonance with at least part of this review. If you are undecided, or are not entirely sure of what happened in the late 70's and early 80's in urban and suburban youth music culture, you should probably read one of the criticisms that purports to be objective instead. <br /> <br /> Although I did not grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I really lived in. At the height of the hardcore I was immersed in from 1979-1981, everyone had a band and only the common denominators between the bands and, in fact, the members of their audiences were: <br /> <br /> * the rejection of compliance <br /> <br /> * tolerance and enjoyment of the difference <br /> <br /> * desire to have fun, hard and fast <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, the disgust of authority figures and violent dances were not an integral part of what I experienced, although there were certainly gangs or factions that tended to be intolerant of those who did not dress, speak or act "punk" enough. And often there was a certain amount of unearned credit that extended from some of these cliques to those who really struggled to follow the fascist paradigm of young people who hate anarchic, self-mutilated and angry police. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews with the audience punks in Penelope Spheeris's excellent Cal-Punk documentary "Declination of Western Civilization" present a very narrow view of the subculture that some of us enjoy, the interviews with the bands, the owners of the clubs. The promoters and even the security people are much more representative of at least my own perspective and memories of "the scene". however, it is possible that those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is, experience this film without their preconceived ideas being questioned. Unfortunately, the fault lies with those who only promote, believe or feel comfortable with the stereotypes, not the filmmakers. Do not blame the messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here will not be for everyone, not even for the majority. It is not the crudest material there is, but it is noisy, unpleasant, fast and less concerned with technique than with raw energy. <br /> <br /> For me, seeing Black Reyes with Ron Reyes singing, X, Fear and the Circle Jerks was worth much more than the cost of this hard-to-obtain movie. As much as I like germs, see Darby Crash for the mess, and the good guy, who left me a little cold. However, scenes of Darby playing with his pet tarantula while "Shut Down" continued to sound beautiful. The X interview is also great. <br /> <br /> The simple documentary style of Spheeris is complemented by silhouettes and zoom during the musical segments. During the interviews, the framing is used very well to provide a context for what is being said. Considering his experience and budget, Spheeris did it as well as anyone could have done with this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended for those who appreciate what this film is about and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun. , honest, without direction, rebellion before the americas punk became a new flow within the musical mainstream and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy.
