Forget about Donnie Darko. I start with this because it seems that a good part of the criticism I have read in The Box is based on the simple but weak argument that it is not a candle for Darko. It's not that I necessarily disagree with that, I just feel that this movie is a completely different animal and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each film is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. In The Box, the driving force of the narrative comes from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say that I understand the inclination to compare the films of an innovative filmmaker looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as an independent entity first, and then expand my look afterwards. <br /> <br /> The Box is one of those movies for which you have mixed feelings because it seems to be in some kind of identity crisis. It is not always sure what you want to be. The turns are numerous, but easy to follow if not to predict. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a couple of relatively credible newlyweds who find themselves in a difficult financial situation. A box containing a "button unit" arrives at your door and a horribly burned man informs you that if you press the button it will cause the death of a person you do not know and you will receive a million dollars. One of the things that The Box achieves is to evoke this invisible fear that somewhere our actions have moral consequences. Before pressing the button, it has a mysterious and seductive quality, seductive but sinister. Once it has been pushed forward, events are set in motion that cause the two leaders to question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision. <br /> <br /> The notion that the box is an experiment is interesting because for me it gives the film a paradox. If there are external beings who develop a "coefficient of altruism" based on data collected by couples who press and do not press the button, then as the conspiracy unravels, we notice that it is ultimately a forced altruism: being disinterested or the species will be eliminated. I guess couples do not know the consequences of their actions when faced with making a decision, but they have no reason to suspect that The Box can do anything, why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care when a problem presents itself in our own lives? <br /> <br /> The psychological obstacles in this movie are everywhere. Press the button or not, it is likely that someone is playing with you. Take the money or not, nobody gives away anything for free. Find the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your disappearance. <br /> <br /> I propose that The Box is an ironic job because it offers the false choice of free will and reveals that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. You can only choose to be free at the expense of another person's life, is that freedom? No, it's just another box because then you get caught up in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another Box. This is precisely the reason why the external beings in the film are antagonists. They demand that we conform to the moral standards that rob us of our freedom. We arrived at Mars, they burned us and we became slaves in a sick game. <br /> <br /> References to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point quite well. "You can only enter the final camera for free, or not for free." Sure, but it does not matter how we enter the camera, however, it's a camera. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemeth
