SOME MAIN SPOILERS, YOU'VE BEEN KNOWN <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Venice Film Festival, and I must admit that, as a fan, it was really AWESOME. Excellent graphics, excellent music, excellent dubbing, excellent action sequences and so on ... BUT there is a but. ALL the film was thought EXCLUSIVELY for the players who have loved it, and therefore, can enjoy each reference, character, internal joke (should see a joke with winning music that is particularly comical) etc. A poor man is not in the world of FF will obviously see the magnificence of the technical part, but CAN NOT capture the inner satisfaction of seeing, for example, appear Barret and shoot Bahamut TOTALLY OUT OF NOW. He will ask himself, "WHO IS THIS MAN?", And I can not blame him. He can not even understand what a player feels when in the OPENING SEQUENCE there is opening music of the game, Nanaki running in the canyon with his two puppies, howling in the ruins of Midgar, and then "498 years ago ...". Almost all the characters have made an appearance or a date (including Reeve, Tseng and Elena), and Reno & Rude were really funny to watch, but the final impression that the movie left me was "the final dream of an unconditional player, but a lot less". a fan of the movie ... "
