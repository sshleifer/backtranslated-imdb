You know, this movie reminded me of so many people I know, I think that's the reason why I loved this movie. I was alone on the floor laughing because I had such a serious and documentary feeling, but the dialogue is so funny that you can not help but have a good time. Basically, the film is about these owners of crazed dogs competing in a large dog show to see who is the best of the best. So it seems that it should be the dogs that take this competition seriously, it turns out that the owners are just as crazy. Megan, one of the dog owners, kills the serial psycho killer with the hotel manager because she can not find the special bee toy for her dog. <br /> <br /> There is another couple that is great, Gerry and Cookie. , this complete nerd and attractive woman who are so adorable. At the beginning of the film, Gerry describes how many boyfriends Cookie had. Throughout the film, her "lovers" see her and beat her even in front of Gerry. It was great and fun to see Gerry's looks. This whole movie is just a scream, and you can not stop with the recognizable faces that keep showing up. It's a great movie, it's fun to watch, I recommend it a lot! Now, I have to find a good way to show this to my friends who are like these couples so they can see the reflected image of themselves. : D <br /> <br /> 8/10
