I should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art, because they are human beings, and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature. That said, the simplistic notion that Ingmar Bergman's great 1968 film, Shame (or Skammen) is simply an anti-war movie, does a lot of damage to the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film. Compared to its more dazzling predecessors, Persona and Hora del lobo, Shame is apparently a more classic film, in narrative terms. But, the key word is apparently, since while it lacks Persona's psychological bravery and the flashy horror film tributes of Hora del lobo, it is one of the best movies ever made about the war, and not like a movie against war. , not a war movie. As such, he has to classify himself with Wild Strawberries as one of his best films, as well as one of his best scripts, if not the best. <br /> <br /> Although apparently a film psychologically more exterior than the films that Before that, it really says much more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. In it, Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman play Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a gesture of greeting to the infamous American spies, which many European intellectuals considered innocent), two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before it exploded war. and they retired to live on a small plot of land on an island, content to work in a greenhouse. The country they live in has no name, just like the island they live on, although the film was made on the small island of Farman, in Bergman, just at the northern end of the Swedish island of GÃ¶ttland. It seems that his nation has been at war for some years with an invading country, or perhaps in a civil war with rebels from another province. All this is left deliberately confused, since this war symbolizes all wars. This is reinforced as the film begins with several war quotes on the screen, as credits accumulate. These include quotes from Hitler's American military figures to the Vietnam era. After the first scenes depicting the prosaic nature of their rural life, and then the arrival of the war, where even old men are recruited, an air strike ravages the land of the Rosenbergs, while the enemy planes fly overhead, launching pumps and what appears to be chemical. Weapons of an agent orange as nature. An airplane is hit, and a parachutist jumps and ends up hanging in a tree. Jan, who starts the movie as a crybaby coward, refuses to go help, so Eva goes alone. Jan joins her and they discover that the pilot has been shot. It seems that it is, in fact, part of the invading force, or possibly rebellious. A group of government soldiers soon stop at their house and ask questions about the dead pilot, then advise the couple to leave their home, as the invaders are nearby. There are misinterpretations of the film at the micro level, such as that of the Bergman scholar Marc Gervais, who provides the comments of the film on the film's DVD. Like many other critics, he states that Jacobi is a Quisling, who has collaborated with the Invaders. But, this is clearly and demonstrably incorrect, because Jacobi is with the original fascist government. As proof, in the first place, the invaders are rejected after invading the land of the Rosenbergs and firing their agitprop interview. We know this because the government that later questions them about the false interview, and the words that are put in Eva's mouth, see the film as a supposed proof of her betrayal, and Jacobi is clearly working with them, the fascist statesmen of the Big Brother. Secondly, Jacobi is in charge of deciding which village population is sent to concentration camps, to collaborate with the Invaders, and the Rosenberg, once again, are among those who were saved. Third, in his seduction of Eva, Jacobi tells him that his son is absent from military service, and clearly, if he were an invader, he would not be talking so happily about his son serving in the state. In addition, the rebel forces are not official armies, and do not grant official license. Finally, Filip is clearly with the rebels, or Invaders, of the Organization, and why would he have killed a colleague? <br /> <br /> That Gervais and other critics so blatantly misinterpret and disapprove such a clue and the manifest point of this film casts doubt on his ability to discern any and all aspects of all Bergman's films. This is a wonderful and great movie, and very high in Berman's canon, but it is disappointing to read how few critics and spectators have really understood its complex message, instead of opting for the cheap, lazy and easy pretense to be. Simply against the war, and a fairly simple movie compared to its two most colorful ancestors. And that, in the long run, is the true shame of shame.
