It is hard to believe that this was directed by Fritz Lang, as he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries. This film has a cast that includes Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight, leave his old gang and end up saving Jagger's life. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs in the west. Jagger hires many men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about the attacks of the Indians and the bandits. Scott is in charge of the men and Young is a telegraph expert who can not shoot a gun but can ride. Scott meets his old gang that wants to stop them, but Scott can not tell anyone. It's a pretty good western and Lang should have directed some more westerns.
