I was surprised that I liked this movie since I'm from the film school "check your brain at the door and have fun." However, this movie touched my heart. I have friends like the mentally retarded Emily. I have friends like Evie without socializing. And I've been in Evie's shoes, driving away opportunities out of fear and out of devotion to others. <br /> <br /> The disappointment of Amy Madigan for her daughters was almost palpable on the screen and the uncomfortable moments in which she tried to overcome the gap with Evie was raw and painful to watch. And maybe it's denser than most, but I never saw the turn with the arrival of Evie's father. Usually, I do these things pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> My reservations are similar to those of other people posted here. I thought that the wonderful and charming character of Christopher Lloyd (a very different role for him, I thought) was underutilized. What happened to him once he realized what was happening with the poetry? Would he, like James, try again? Secondly, the end, as it was, did not seem to solve or achieve anything. I did not expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends tied neatly, but I felt that I disagreed with the characters, that no real healing was taking place or that there was no real effort to heal. br /> <br /> Otherwise, exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and, for some, very, very true.
