Footprints is a very interesting movie that is difficult to categorize. "Psychological Thriller" is the most appropriate description I can think of. The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, discovers that she remembers nothing of the last three days. The only clue you have is a torn picture of a hotel. She is also obsessed with a recurring dream, very vivid, about a science fiction movie she thinks she has seen many years ago. In his search for the truth behind his amnesia, he does not trust anyone, but little by little it becomes obvious that he has visited the city where the hotel is located. This is an exciting movie whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how events will unfold and, in particular, how they will end. The unusual loneliness of the main character and the lack of reliability of all the others ensure that the good paranoid feeling is present throughout the film, while the beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually appealing movie. The important part of the unique and only Nicoletta Elmi, the childhood star of the favorite red-haired Italian horror of all time, is an additional advantage.
