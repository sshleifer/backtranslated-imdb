I'm surprised there's confusion about the title of this movie. Obviously, it is an investigation about the nature of modern love. It is suggesting that love is love while the march is good, but one in which people reserve the right to put themselves in the first place, and if the going gets difficult, they go out and put on something else. <br /> <br /> This observation has generational implications, since it comes from Generation X, comments on Generation X, and ultimately is directed to Generation X. It expresses the disappointment that love has been transformed from what the Baby Boomers, the fathers of Generation X, had spawned their marriages and family lives, and that gave Generation X the innocent and generous childhood that he finally enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The attitude of Generation X towards love is, of course, frivolous, but as decisions are made and commitments are broken, the greatest victim is the children of Generation X. It is clarified at the end of the film and it was so spicy that it took me a week to recover from the impact I received from this epiphany.
