Brighton has a traumatic drama in the bosom of her family: Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) of twenty years is delayed due to a fall when she was one, and her overprotective mother Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose), seventeen years old, loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. His father, Harry Brighton (John Savage), a banking investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities that are rejected, and teaches her poetry to Emily. When Martha listens to Emily repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to the English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd), who believes that Emily has had a moment of genius. When Evie's only friend, James (Fran Kranz) reads the notes, he immediately reveals the truth about the authority of the poems. But when Martha realizes it, she finds the reality of Evie, which triggers a series of revelations. <br /> <br /> "Admissions" is a very powerful drama about the need for love and the guilty complex. The performances are impressive, and this is Lauren Ambrose's first work, "Six Feet Under," which I see and which is incredible. This independent film is an excellent choice for viewers looking for a refreshing story based on the cast's performance. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
