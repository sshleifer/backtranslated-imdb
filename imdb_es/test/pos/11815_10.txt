I remember when this movie came out and I saw it several times on VHS. I was very happy when it was finally released on DVD. I waited for the widescreen, but in that moment I would take what was available. I love how they used the color in the film, the outdoor scenes are very alive with the color. The trees are the greenest I've seen. Most of the film was shot in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful city located on the St. Croix River. They must have really explored the places to shoot, because they did a great job. The story is well written and directed. I would rate this as one of Peter Horton's best. I am also surprised that Andrew Dintenfass (the director of photography) has not done more. He did an incredible job. The performance also qualifies there. It's amazing to see two actors of such a young age get this kind of movie. Annabella Sciorra did a great job as Dexter's mother. Who would not want her as a mother.
