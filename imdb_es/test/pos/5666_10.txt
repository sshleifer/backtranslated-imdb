<br /> <br /> Giorgino is a strange, obscure and obsessive object; The casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, it reminded me of the stories of Edgar Poe. Probably not a masterpiece, but it leaves us with the memory of strong images, good music, fear, sadness, confusion and a phrase that says it all: the wolves are coming. GIORGINO is pretty forgotten now, and when he was released nobody seemed to appreciate him. It is a pity. If you ever have the opportunity to see this, well ... try it.
