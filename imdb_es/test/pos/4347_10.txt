Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion, this is by far the best movie of the series and my favorite movie. This film does not take itself seriously, because the filmmakers knew that all the social comments that were necessary were exposed in the first film. Golan and Globus made this film for Bronson fans, not for critics, and it works. DW3 has been unfairly criticized as "garbage" and "a tired entry in a worn out series". These statements would be true if the film was taken to be taken seriously or to spread a statement, but it was not. If you take it for what it is, DW3 is just a fun and action-packed game, with Charlie doing with street punks what we all wish we could do. The action is uninterrupted, the atmosphere is excellent and the film is the best Bronson film ever made. It can be said that the group of Cannon Pinch of Cannny spent a lot of money on this. It is believed that Bronson thought that this film was too violent, and that was the reason why Winner did not direct any of the following entries. I can understand your concern, but as always is the case of the sequels, you have to push the envelope even more to pass a previous entry. In any case, this film was not more violent than any other film made during this time. What makes DW3 the best of the series and my favorite movie (not the best, only my favorite), is the action, the presence of Charlie, memorable villains, and his ability for spectators to get on the bandwagon. The first film may be the most technically well done, but this is the most fun. For once, Charlie actually has some smart lines (although he does not say much) and an interesting half story, photography, action and direction to back him up. Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than this one. Yes, it is exploitative, maybe it promotes stereotypes, and maybe it's the same story as before, but Bronson's films have always defended the common man and give his audience what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates its audience, my answer is that the movies do not manipulate us, the fans are the ones in charge. We demand that Bronson remove the debris and, in turn, Winner and Co. deliver the products. And for those of you who still want to leave it, remember some things. DW3 was the number 1 movie in the United States when it was published and was among the favorites of millions of people in video and television because they realize that not all movies have to be epic, they just have to be fun. ********** / 10 You can not improve anything.
