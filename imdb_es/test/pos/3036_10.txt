I'm going to make this short and sweet. No wonder you did not have use for this movie. This is a story about the power, beauty and possibilities inherent in meaningful education. Based on his pathetically composed comments, I can see that his own education has been woefully neglected ... or, worse, completely wasted. Your comments are those of a truly ignorant person. I would advise you to do something about this condition ... but in your case, I think it's probably too late. My hope is that you yourself do not intend to enter the teaching profession (especially in Film Studies) because you could only do harm. Oh ... one last tip. In the future, if you intend to write more opinion articles, you should really review your work. It will make people take you more seriously.
