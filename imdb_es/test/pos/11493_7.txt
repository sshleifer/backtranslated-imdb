Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred days later, Carl is very depressed and abandons her, hoping to "clear the fog" in their lives. Joline confronts her marriage as a major commitment to the end of her life and decides to look for Carl in Texas. She is very supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her on the Mexican border. There, Joline meets the confused Carl and realizes that he can not change his decision, while Jay meets Carmen (Patricia Velásquez) and starts dating her, and in the end "life goes on." This movie is very unpredictable, it has a very different story. I think it's an independent production. In some parts, it's a bit slow and boring, but there are certain dialogues that make this movie worthwhile. I liked it, and my vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Rebels Até or Fim '(` Rebels to the end') <br /> <br />
