Located in a California detention camp in an indistinct future, an English film crew captures the proceedings when young students and political dissidents are tried under a fictitious 'Law of Insurrection' that allows the United States government to suspend freedoms civilians for their own citizens in cases of emergency without the right to bail or the need for evidence. In such cases, the government is authorized to detain and detain any person who believes that they may participate in future sabotage activities. The group in trial includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk singer. <br /> <br /> People convicted by a conservative court have the option of a long prison sentence or three days in Punishment Park, where they can achieve freedom by attaining a US flag in the desert. They must achieve this without food or water. They must also be persecuted by the armed National Guard and the police that can return them to the camp if they are captured to face the criminal sentence attributed to each convicted person. The reality is different; Those who choose Punishment Park are hunted down and killed or mistreated without any hope of obtaining their freedom after a policeman is found dead in the park. The park seems to be a training ground for police and guards who need to master these acts of suppression so that they can be used in open American society. <br /> <br /> Filmed in 16 mm and in the documentary style developed. of Watkins, in his famous Culloden and the controversial The War Game for the BBC; he interacts with the prisoners and guards and observes the unconstitutional judgment, interspersing between them to create a totally convincing political film that remains vital and relevant. Utilizing his knowledge of the medium, Watkins has produced a cinematic, implacable and, ultimately, frightening portrait of a completely fictional US political detention camp that would not convince if it were not for its impeccable construction. Many of the actors are amateurs who improvise with broad characters. The sparks fly in the test scenes in which each case is heard, in part because Watkins kept the courts away from the jury until the filming of those scenes. Watkins also claims that actors often express their own opinions, which undoubtedly explains the ferocity and credibility of their performances. <br /> <br /> The film has been strongly criticized for polarizing the opinions of those who see it. It has been claimed that the film is reactionary and represents unequivocally that conservatism and war are the root of the social problems of the United States. While these criticisms may be valid, it is important to keep in mind that the film is working on a fictional, metaphorical level and perhaps it is the realism that the film constructs so intelligently that it fosters such a heated opinion about its content. In fact, the most important theme of the films is the problem of polarization itself. The "conservative" judges and the brutal officers of the law are on one side and the "liberal" convicts are clearly on the other, without concessions made by both sides. This seems to be what the movie is really about. The new law and the park itself is the result of a situation in which mediation between the two political positions has been lost. <br /> <br /> It was done during and in protest of the Vietnam War and the treatment of those who opposed the war. In the United States, films, the main themes of the government's persecution of their own citizens and the conservatism that affects civil liberties, continue playing the same chord in the era of the Patriot Act and the identity document. It also hits a disturbing chord with the images of Guant√°namo Bay and the treatment that Iraqi prisoners receive at the hands of the Allied forces. <br /> <br /> The threat of internal "terrorism" is such a volatile topic that the film can not fail to connect with current attitudes towards the subject. Not surprisingly, the film has had a history of check distribution, which has been marginalized to the extreme due to its content, but the disturbing fact that this film may still be so relevant today suggests that the wait does not it has been in vain. Punishment Park is a film that has had to fight to be seen anywhere and demands your attention.
