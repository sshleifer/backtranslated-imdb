If you want to watch a movie without weapons, blood, sex, cries of angry people, hero, bad boys or girls or even awkward love words and want to see a movie in which each shot has the meaning of "LOVE", this One is a movie that has to be seen. For me I've been waiting for a movie like this my whole life.
