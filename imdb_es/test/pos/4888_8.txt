If you are a fan of the series that inspired it or not, there is no doubt that this is an irregular job. But in the best possible sense. Eager to get away from the trappings of old comedies that made a difficult transition to the big screen, Messrs. Pemberton, Dyson, Shearmsith and Gatiss have taken a different path, addressing the problems of dealing with their success and adding other creations and, inevitably, repeating some of his most beloved characters. It is a pity that they were not limited to a more consistent League of Gents film, since, however ingenious it is to be included in the script, it weakens the finished film. Well worth renting though.
