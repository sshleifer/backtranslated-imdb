Any movie that has a line of dialogue that says something like that ... "Judy is getting ready for her date, Butthole!" It has to be good! I found this on DVD without qualifying, without editing and I was pleasantly surprised, it took a lot of work to make this movie. I really enjoyed this more than many 80s movies I've seen. Great addition to my movie collection. <br /> <br /> The accumulation was excellent, it created fear for the rest of the movie. I loved the GORE and the T & A. I never thought that the eyeballs were ripped out like bursts, the color of the eyespray was disgusting! I still think that "Rog" looked like Tiger Woods but more black, does anyone agree?
