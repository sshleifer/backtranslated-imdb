The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is far from the Paul Kersey of the original film. If you remember the 1974 film, then you will remember that Kersey was a "Conchie" during the Korean War and that he was physically ill after he committed his first execution. Ten years later, Kersey seems to have learned the unarmed combat and how to handle anti-tank weapons in his spare time. But I'll overlook that oversight because DW3 is the best of the aftermath, the trash bags of the low life are shot dead, burned alive, their teeth crushed and thrown to their death by middle-aged housewives armed with toothbrushes. swept. Yes, I know that gang members are multi-ethnic and that's why they deserve some credit, but even if they're not racists, they're still slaughtering scum who deserve everything they get from Kersey and innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy when you have Paul Kersey, an anti-tank rocket and a group of pensioners of old age to claim the streets of criminals? Paul Kersey, I salute you, sir
