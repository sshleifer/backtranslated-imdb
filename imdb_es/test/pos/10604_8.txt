The first time I saw this movie was in a video store and, since I am a Bam Margera fan, I had to rent it to see what it was about. Since I have a huge and stupid sense of humor (notice the stupid word), I found this movie absolutely hilarious. Some of the parts are useless and random, but that's what makes them so fun. You will have to think that things like receiving a slap in the face and a blow to the head with a watermelon are fun to appreciate this movie. It impressed me a lot. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by the performance. These people really did a good job. Nothing worth Oscar, but good enough to pass the amateur level. Teens and young adults will probably find it more entertaining due to the modern lingo and situations used. I would not suggest seeing this with your parents and vice versa. <br /> <br /> In general, the performance was excellent, the script was hilarious and the story is really something you can relate to.
