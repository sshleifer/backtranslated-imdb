After seeing the Skammen of Ingmar Bergman, I had many feelings, but most notably, I felt dissatisfied. I have heard many exaggerations about this movie, but I found that it was missing. Do not get me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but in terms of depth and emotion, it did not impress me that much. The characters seemed unpleasant and unrealistic, which detracted from the dramatic effect. Also, the fact that the war was false made me feel that the emotion was not real. Dramatic war movies, in my opinion, are much more effective if the events (not necessarily the story itself) really happened. I find that of all the films that try to show brutality, it falls in the middle in terms of effectiveness.
