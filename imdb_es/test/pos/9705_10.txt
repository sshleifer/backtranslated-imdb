Johnny Knoxville and the Jackass guys go over "Jackass Number Two." At a press screening, the laughter was so loud and scandalous that it was difficult to hear all the dialogue. The maneuvers are exaggerated and the jokes are more fun and more extravagant than ever. <br /> <br /> All the kids risked their limbs to make a great movie, and they succeeded. If you like this genre, you will love this movie. If not, do not bother. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest bits are the jokes that the boys play on themselves, and do not take into account what happens to them. They will do anything to do a trick job. <br /> <br /> Many critics criticized Johnny Knoxville for a less active role in the first film, but do not worry, he is in front and at the center of Number Two, and they have enough images in the can as to be halfway. a Number Three. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for fans of this kind of humor. <br /> <br /> Chris Sansone, Entertainment Editor, Fort Bend Herald
