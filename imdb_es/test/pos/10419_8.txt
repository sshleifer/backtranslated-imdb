After a recent trip to New York, I put this movie in the queue on a whim, and I could not believe I'd never heard of it anywhere! It has all the ingredients of a cult classic, starting with the characters. They are archetypal roles that we recognize in each section of everyday life, but they were very nuanced and they realized the actors who played them (the performances of Peter Stormare and Bai Ling were particularly strong). Their interactions are moving and rooted at the same time that they overflow with a subtle and peculiar humor that, unfortunately, is very rare in American films these days. Screenwriter and director Ramin Niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes into a funny and moving portrait of a city from the past. Highly recommended!
