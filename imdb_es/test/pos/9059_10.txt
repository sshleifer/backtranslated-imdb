On a scale of 1-10, "Suicidal Sweetheart" got an 11 from me and from everyone else in this presentation. The photo was incredibly fun. I told my wife: "It's obvious that this man walks on water but through a bed of fire, that's too much." This is one of the best mixes of comedy, satire and insinuation uses I've seen since the "Frankenstein Young" by Mel Brooks. I can not believe that this image has not been captured by an important study. <br /> <br /> This audience of the "Film Festival" was sophisticated and could capture every comical insinuation, be it visual, spoken or implied. The characters are real and the combination of a great script and a great casting was evident. Max and Grace are real people with real problems that are treated independently of the probabilities of success. He keeps it smiling while being taken seriously and laughs with all the indirect humor brilliantly integrated into this production. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is an image that "must see".
