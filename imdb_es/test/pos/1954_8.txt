I'm not sure if I like this movie or not. I think it's creepy and completely weird. Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of the best, but I do not like the character at all. The performance of Keanu Reeves was really good, and I really felt for her character. In general, I think the whole cast gave excellent performances as if the characters were real. I did not like some, but I really felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if that was the original ending that was supposed to have the film, since it did not end as I expected. I was disappointed in the end and I do not think he has done justice to the rest of the film. If you like spooky, rare and really different movies, go for this one. If you like things that are normal, stay away.
