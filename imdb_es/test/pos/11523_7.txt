An interesting film with Jordana Brewster as a young woman traveling to Europe in an attempt to discover what happened to her older sister (Cameron Diaz), who mysteriously died years earlier. Brewster is very good and keeps you involved despite some unrealistic plotting, such as making him find amazingly and start an affair with the much older boyfriend of his dead sister (Christopher Eccleston). Still, especially good. GRADE B
