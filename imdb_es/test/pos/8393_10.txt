This is almost as good as the wind was. I love this movie. I could see it again and again. Scarlett always gets what she wants regardless of the cost. Try to really forget Rhett, but he can not. do it. She loves him so much. This is a story of true true love. It started with the wind and ended in this movie. The only real way to end this movie for true true love. In the end, Scarlett and Rhett would be together again. the way he ended up with them again together with his daughter. What more could you want? There is no better ending to this great love story than this. What else can I say about this great movie?
