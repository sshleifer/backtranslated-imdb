"Sir" has played Lear more than 200 times, but tonight he can not remember his first lines. Sitting in front of the mirror, his eyes reflect the madness of the King. His dresser gently encourages him, pronouncing the words. There is an air of despair towards these two men. The great actor, knowing that his powers are escaping, his valet cum major domo cum conscience cum surrogate wife, aware of the decline of his boss in madness and knowing that he is powerless to do more than facilitate his step. "The Dresser" is really a love story between the two. Over the years, they have become mutually dependent on each other to the extent that neither can conceive a future without the other. Set during the Second World War, it refers to the fortunes of a Shakespeare company that travels frankly in the second category and that has an equal number of has-beens and aspirants led by "Sir", a theatrical gentleman of what could be called "The Old School". . Whatever part he is playing, he takes over the center of the scene and bids farewell to the lights of his feet, harassing his audience in applause. But, somewhere inside it, buried most of the time under the ham that regularly distributes, there is still an occasional glimmer of its former greatness. It is to glimpse this that his audiences fervently await. Mr. A. Finney concentrates very skillfully on the ham, often to the point of caricature, and, just when he is ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluff, will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that will make him account of which great actor is playing a great actor The same goes for Mr. T.Courtenay. It is easy to dismiss its interpretation <br /> <br /> from Norman as an exercise in stereotypes. Here we have a middle-aged effeminate instead of a theatrical theater sideboard that makes its way into life. , enjoying the company of "The Girls" and loving the evil Insider Gossip that abound in "The Theater". There was, and I suspect there are still, many men like Norman in The Profession. Imminently kind and patient, who knows more about the game than many of the actors, run behind the scenes with wisdom and affection. I think the vast majority of them would shout with approval of laughter at the portrait of Mr. Courtenay. I saw "The Dresser" on the London stage where, against the perceived wisdom, Mr. Courtenay's "Norman" was rather dimmer than in the movie. "Sir" was played by the great Mr. Freddie Jones with great acclaim from the audience. it was a memorable performance that overshadowed Mr. Courtenay's, reducing him to a "also ran" rather than a level actor. The idea that "Sir" and "Norman" could be almost incomplete without the other. window. "Norman" was reduced to being his puppet, which I'm not sure of what Ronald Harwood intended, but it was an impressive theater. Messrs. Finney and Courtenay correct the balance in the film, restoring equality in the relationship. Both men have come a long way since their first appearances in the images of the British "New Wave" when they became the favorites of the vaguely leftist movement, "middle class and ashamed of it". When British cinema practically engaged Hari-kiri in the 1970s, they quietly concentrated on the theater, aside from some papers to keep the wolf out of the door. With the rebirth of more important films, they reappeared, blinking in the bright light that she was not used to. <br /> <br /> "The Dresser" marked his return, still with energy and talent, shouting to the world in general "We are still here". It is not a great movie, but it is surely an excellent one.
