This little-known comedy of the successful work of Ruth Gordon is a delight. The script, based on the game, is spicy, rich and completely undated. The same goes for the cast, but I must underline the work of the protagonist, Irene Dunne. Irene is simply magnificent, as usual, and illuminates the screen with every frame she is in (and she is very, thank heaven). In addition, director Vidor has given him some unusual close-ups that are fascinating. What gal I do not know any other Hollywood actress of any age who has his versatility and is so convincing in every movie. Why it's still so little known is a mystery. I have seen most of his films and this was a surprise, even for an identification fan like me. See it all!
