I was impressed when I saw "The best years of our lives". The performance, screenplay and direction of Master William Wyler (winner of the Best Director in 1946) is Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This film is about three veterans of World War II returning home from the war and reunited with their loved ones, but I have to deal with the difficulties of returning home after the war. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (Fredric March Played by in his Oscar winning role) returns home to find his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy). ) and the children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are bigger and different than before going to war. <br /> <br /> The second man, Fred Derry (Dana Andrews played by) have to find a good job and go home with a wife who had been married only 20 days before going to war. He begins to discover that she is not the same. <br /> <br /> Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his Oscar winning role) has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family and his fiancee 'Wilma's (played by Cathy O'Donnell) reactions the hooks he has instead of his hands. <br /> <br /> All these men and their families meet in the film in different scenes. The stories of these men are beautifully woven together. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines the meaning of a "Classic". This unforgettable drama (winner of the best film in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If they asked me to choose a favorite movie, it would be this one! <br /> <br /> Out! of 10 would give "The best years of our lives" A 10. <br /> <br /> So the next time you go to your local video store rent this movie, you will not regret it! <br /> <br /> NO objectionable material a good family movie.
