This was a very interesting Halloween movie. I was not thrilled with all of Thorn's theory, but it's still a good movie. I liked seeing Tommy Doyle back, but unfortunately Donald Pleasance died right after firing. The film had a director REALLY very bad that did not give a turn on the series, reason why I heard that they treated badly to Donald, and that would not allow that Danielle Harris returned like Jamie. It's like I'm just trying to bring down the movie, but I still liked it. There were many cuts and changes of music and, if you're lucky, you can get Producers Cut, which includes more than 40 minutes. of scenes never seen before. With those scenes it becomes a completely new movie. Take a look if you have the opportunity.
