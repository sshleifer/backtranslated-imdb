1904. The North African nation of Morocco clings to a tenuous independence, since the different European powers (France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States) compete for influence in the region. The Sultan (Marc Zuber) is a weak puppet; His uncle, the Bashaw (Vladek Sheybal), who is being manipulated by the French and the Germans, is the real power behind the throne. Enter Berber Chieftan Raisuli (Sean Connery), the leader of the Rif tribe and "the last of the Barbary Pirates", who kidnaps an American missionary, Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen) and their two sons, and takes them hostage . Back in the United States, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) threatens to go to war over the issue: "Pedecaris Vivo or Raisuli Muerto!" - See the topic as the perfect way to exercise your diplomacy "Big Stick", although Secretary of State John Hay (John Huston) is not so sure. However, the Raisuli has less sinister plans for the Pedecarises, who are more than capable of handling themselves in any case. <br /> <br /> The great historical film by John Milius, based very lightly on a true story (ie, Pedecaris was a middle-aged man), is a wonderful little piece of escapism. It has some amazing action scenes, an ingenious and well written script, an excellent cast that has fun with the material, and does not stay too long as, for example, "Pirates of the Caribbean" or the films of "The Lord of the Rings" " It's not really an "epic" movie in the strictest sense, but it's one of the best pure action movies ever made. <br /> <br /> While the historical context is unstable, the story is interesting and, as some critics point out, it is even more relevant today than it was when it was made. As President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear": fierce, strong, but a little blind and reckless at times. At the time of the movie's scenario, the United States has just been launched on the world stage as a superpower, after its overwhelming victory in the Spanish-American War, and Roosevelt takes advantage of this incident as a way to demonstrate the value of the United States. In real life, it did not work that way, but allegorically it works well. Although written from a right perspective, Milius's script is quite accurate in assessing the United States and its place in the world. He admires Roosevelt and his "big stick" diplomacy method, and correctly recognizes (in Roosevelt's words) that while the United States can be feared and respected, he will never truly be "loved" by the world, no matter what he does. . And there are some scenes, such as Roosevelt's European target shooting and the almost comical surprise attack by the Marines in Bashaw's palace, which show the violent and reckless side of the United States, while others, the confrontation climate with the Germans, show their heroism. br /> <br /> The historical / political context of the film is, of course, merely flesh in the bones of what is essentially an action / adventure film. There are some brilliantly done action scenes, such as the rescue of Raisuli's pedecaris to members of the double-crossing tribes, which presents some of the best swordplay in any movie. The opening entrance to the Raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack by the US Marines. UU They are brilliantly made pieces of bravery. And the final battle, which combines elements of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Wild Bunch", while one of the main historical fantasies (a three-way battle between Germans, Americans and the Rifs), is a superbly organized action and full of adrenaline. sequence. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast gives some wonderful performances. Everyone seems to be having fun with the movie, and it shows. Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as a Berber with a Scottish accent, but manages to get ahead his interesting, well-drawn and gentlemanly character who comes to respect his hostage and hates modern and uncivil war. Candice Bergen, an actress I've never liked, has an excellent performance as the fighter Eden Pedecaris, who is as hard as his captor. Brian Keith is an incredibly convincing TR: you really feel that he must have been like that, an athletic, misty man, at the same time practical and intelligent with an admirable sense of himself. Roosevelt's boxing and target shooting scenes while discussing foreign policy are some of the best "bad" moments in film history, and who can forget lines like "Why ruin the beauty of the thing with legality? ? " John Huston provides solid support as the tired and cautious Hay, which acts as a perfect blade for the much more impetuous Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Among the excellent supporting actors, the best are Geoffrey Lewis as Samuel Gummere, the cynical Ambassador caught in the middle of political intrigue, and Steve Kanaly, as the Captain of the Marine Corps who openly defends (and carries out) "Military intervention!" As the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation. Other faces known as Vladek Sheybal, Nadim Sawalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty also do a good job, no matter how small their role. Spaghetti Western fans will recognize Antoine Saint-John ("A handful of dynamite") as the German general and Aldo Sambrell as one of the members of the Raisuli tribe. <br /> <br /> "The wind and the lion" is, on all sides, A wonderfully made adventure movie. It has something for everyone: a wonderful game of weapons and swords, a lot of humor, a tough and fierce heroine (and her two beautiful children), a good romance (if it is not consummated) and an interesting political / historical context. It's not a masterpiece, but hey, I was not trying to be master. I give "The wind and the lion" about nine moving stars and my highest recommendation.
