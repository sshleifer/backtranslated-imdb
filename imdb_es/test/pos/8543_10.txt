The first time I saw this movie in Papua New Guinea was in 1967 and I remember it since then, although I have never seen it since that first time. <br /> <br /> With the ease with which the life of good people can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and there is still a memory that will persecute me forever. <br /> <br /> The film is funny and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by Anthony Quinn is excellent. <br /> <br /> This film should be in all the university studies on the inhumanity of man towards man.
