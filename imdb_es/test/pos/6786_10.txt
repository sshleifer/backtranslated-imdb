I just wanted to say that I'm watching National Velvet on TV, now it's February 2006 and I was reviewing the details of the dates, etc. Surprising to see that it was done in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old, while Liz Taylor was only 12 years old. a successful English actress that she is. <br /> <br /> To make clear to some US taxpayers: There are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are supposedly taken on the south coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (County of Sussex). There is no such scene now unfortunately. As in many other places, roads and buildings have been built on hills and beaches. <br /> <br /> So please, all of you, lovely Americans, do not confuse Ireland with England, ever! We give you a great exception. How to confuse Texas with Coney Island.
