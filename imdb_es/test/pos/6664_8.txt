The 'war movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been made and remade so many times that clichéd dialogue, reinvented plot and over-the-top action sequences seem inevitable for any large-scale combat-related conflict. From time to time, however, a war movie appears that goes against the grain and gives life to a truly original and compelling story on the big screen. "Cold Mountain", from the Civil War, starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger, is a movie of this kind. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, calling Cold Mountain "a war movie is not entirely accurate." Truly, the film begins with a fast and dirty battle sequence (literally) that puts the director of the film to shame. "Glory" Edward Zwick However, "Cold Mountain" is not so much about the Civil War as about the time and the people.The story centers on the unhappy Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who gets angry with the Terrible war and nostalgia for the beautiful village of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful Southern beauty that she left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman.At first glance, this configuration seems to be a formula since the romantic interest at home It gives the audience enough sympathy to encourage the tribulations of reluctant soldiers on the battlefield.In fact, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even s However, "Cold Mountain "soon takes a drastic turn, as the intrepid hero Inman becomes a deserter (saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to take root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey back home. Meanwhile, back on the farm, the cultivated forms of Ada proved to be of little use in the fields; Soon she becomes a kind of wild beast. Ada's rescue camp is the tough Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada rebuild the farm and, more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation that the war seems to have brought on Ada. <br /> <br /> Within these two configurations, a vivid, convincing and sometimes very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South is displayed. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by the wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's father, Ray Winstone as a "man of the law" from the unrepentant south and Natalie Portman as a young mother deeply concerned and isolated All have been greatly affected and changed by "the war of aggression of the North," mostly for the worse. The dark and penetrating message against the war, accentuated by an effective and disturbing score and scary shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by the gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and the traumatized people why the war was fought Although the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed a lot in the last century, its infernal effect on earth is timeless. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this grim mood for most of the film, but unfortunately, the atmosphere is denigrated by a rather warm climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is added to the beginning and end of the film, although the intrinsically distant, abstract and even absurd nature of their relationship fits the somber nature of the rest of the plot. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, "Cold Mountain" does not have the traits of a romance to feel good or an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that will surely not only entertain but actually absorb the public in the lives of a people torn by war and completely desperate to rid themselves of its terrible repercussions.
