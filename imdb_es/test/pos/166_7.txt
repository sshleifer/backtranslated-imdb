Story about three eclipsed children (maybe even Indigo, ha) who begin their love for murder. Oh, and the people who are "hot" on their way. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday, a pretty mediocre title for the movie, was a pleasant surprise. No way was I expecting a movie about bloodthirsty psychopaths. And I can say that it is also one of the best movies I've seen with children like villains. At the end of the movie, I really wanted these children to die horribly. <br /> <br /> It's a really solid horror movie of the '80s, but how these kids are going with all this chaos and murder is just something you can not not think about. Even the smallest research could easily discover these problems like killers. But it seems that there are only a couple of policemen in the city, well, by the end, only one, and he looked like an imbecile, so I guess they could have got away with it. Haha, yes, and I am a Chinese pilot. <br /> <br /> However, this film offered some guys from Evilass more than entertaining, a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of piqueros. No kiddin! If you do not like the less stellar title, jump out of your mind and give this movie a chance. It is a highly recommended and underestimated horror movie from the 80s.
