"Meat" is hard to describe with a solid summary because, well, basically there is no plot. The movie practically shows the day in the life of a con man named Joe (Joe Dallesandro, who is in the underestimated image of Louis Malle "Black Moon") while he makes his rounds, sleeps and models to collect the money he has to pay. for the abortion of his wife's mistress. <br /> <br /> Not much, and since the film lasts eighty-nine minutes, you would think that "Flesh" would be a slow and boring hour and a half. You think badly The film is made up of improvisation, not film script and the angles of the film are also quite on the spot, however, there is some truth under each frame that gives the film a vibrant fun. Everything makes sense and serves for what happens to Joe on this day. He meets a regular John who obviously lies when he says he wants to see Joe again, a photographer who talks so much that bores Joe, two drag queens read in newspaper magazines while Joe receives the head of a mousy voice addict. who later mutters about how he wants to have a breast lift, an old friend of Joe who reads stories of rape from man to man, and then a final scene with his wife and her lover that echoes the scene at the beginning of the movie (one of the best openings of a movie I've seen in quite some time)? and explains completely what the film is about in philosophical terms. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how the messages and styles of the film feel almost timeless, even though it's set in New York City in the 1960s, in real time, in real place, and It is filmed as an obvious independent film from that era. Certainly not a film that could be made today, which adds to its delicious mystique. <br /> <br /> Powered by unexpected jump cuts; And in the absence of a score to advance their images? "Flesh" is so crude, like a movie about male prostitution in the 60s that can be obtained.
