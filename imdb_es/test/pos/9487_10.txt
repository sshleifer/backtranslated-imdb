This set of two discs is incredible! If you're like me and you've never had the chance to really see the band live, then this is the best option. Jimmy Page, who, in my opinion, is the second best guitarist to walk on the face of the earth (second only to Slowfingers), presents an incredible show in each piece of the film. John Paul Jones, although not as advanced as Page, presents an incredible show. Although in the live environment, its rhythm bass lines are not as defined as in studio recordings, except, of course, in songs like Dazed and Confused, or What is and What Never Never Be), but its wide range of Instrumental talent is well displayed on these DVD's. John Bonham is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, their rhythms stand out like no other, and this DVD is a test. Last but not least, Robert Plant laments how no one else can cry. If you've ever read Hammer of the Gods, you'll be wondering what Page was when he met Robert Plant, why the hell is not this guy already famous? And so I conclude my criticism, apologies and misspellings or grammar, Zeppelin mola.
