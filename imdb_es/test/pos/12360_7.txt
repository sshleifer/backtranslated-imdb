Victor Sjostrom, who is the grandfather of Swedish cinema, directed this austere and existentialist film about atonement, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption and the darkest moments of the human condition. It stars David Holm, a handsome man who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, and then having to negotiate his soul with the driver of the ghost car: death. <br /> <br /> Unlike many silent films during the period, the film is almost absent in over-acting scenes. The rhythm becomes tedious with his too familiar Dickensian narrative. However, to examine the film in retrospect and in comparison with others of its time, is a very daring and unique film. The audiences of the time were not exposed to that subject, and the cinematography is tremendous, symbolic, and is accompanied by effects of double exposure and multi-layered flashbacks. Without a doubt, it's a really scary and terrifying movie for young people. <br /> <br /> Watching the film, it is easy to see the later influences that this film had on the Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of Bergman's great themes are here in full screen. Sjostrom, of course, later starred in Bergman's masterpiece of alienation and loneliness: wild strawberries. This would be the final performance of Sjostrom as an actor. Sjostrom based the script on a novel by the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.
