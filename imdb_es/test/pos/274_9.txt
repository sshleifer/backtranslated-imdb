The Stepford Children is the second best Stepford movie in the Stepford series. I saw the original The Stepford Wives movie at the cinema when it was released in 1975. I was absolutely impressed, it was amazing. I've seen all the Stepford movies. and I like them all. I think The Stepford Children is such a fun and funny movie. I recently saw her in a recording recently, and I enjoyed it very much. The cast of this movie was really good to watch. Barbara Eden did a great job as usual. All the roles he has played have been very good. Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles in which she is a kind and educated person. Don Murray as husband and father was just perfect in this movie. He was particularly effective in being the irritated father of his two teenage children. I made sure to have the whole Stepford movie on the tape to enjoy. If you have the opportunity to see this movie, you should do it.
