A surprisingly beautiful movie. Beautifully conceived, beautifully directed, beautifully acted, beautifully acted and beautifully photographed ... the cinematography is nothing less than splendid. It is a war movie, but it is epic in scope and combines romance, tragedy and comedy in a story as heartbreaking as it is provocative.
