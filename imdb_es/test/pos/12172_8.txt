First of all, I'm from Munich, where this movie takes place, and believe it or not, there are guys like Erkan and Stefan, including the silly dialect! I knew his comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was that the movie was just a compilation of his well-known jokes, but it is not! The jokes evolve throughout history, and give meaning to their special way. But if you do not like Erkan and Stefan, hands on this movie. Everyone else - it's worth seeing them!
