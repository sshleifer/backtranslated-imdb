While I completely agree with the drvn below about Mary McCormack throwing a bag of milk on television, the rest of the show is fantastic! Phil Hartman was great in the form of a teacher, teaching celebrities the pros and cons. Foley is a nut, but in a good way. You never know what mood you are going to unfold next. As for the game, it is entertaining, full of witty jokes, and great for any newbie who may even have a passing interest in the game. Too bad it's no longer running :( I just checked the program until August and it does not look like it's scheduled for any time in the future ... Bad bravo! You deserve a beating!
