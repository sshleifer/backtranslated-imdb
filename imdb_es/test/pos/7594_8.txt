There are worse ways to spend a night than watching this movie, although it is a bit predictable. Drew Barrymore does a very good job being the nerd sidelined in this movie, excellent casting choice. What I found a little hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept it. In my experience, that crowd has a memory longer than that, and knowing how awful the Drew character was (ostrich feathers?) At the beginning of the school year, He kept them miles away, regardless of the rumors that his brother drumming. (And "Kole Slaw Food" really makes it so popular? I doubt it). As for encouraging the character of Drew to win big as a reporter, well, I would have expected her to tell a story long before the prom. A little devised. Having said all that, it was a short fluff that will be entertaining as long as you do not expect too much.
