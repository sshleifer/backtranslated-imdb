I did not know much about this movie, but I discovered that Kane was a fighter, which did not excite me, but I liked "Santa's Slay" and he had a fighter, so, what? Hell. The story begins in a very strange and promising way, but after a while it does not become much more than its typical teen horror movie, although the setting helped some. A group of young criminals are arrested and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace, but now it is a garbage dump, to clean it up and prepare it as a shelter for the homeless. The driver is a man with a prosthetic arm, being a veteran of the initial scene of this film in which he meets this great galote who had just killed his partner and blinded another woman. Of course, the teenagers, they are all punk imbeciles, they all object to having to do a real job, but they are part of a unique mixed work program, yes, what a great idea it is, of course. Little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking in the hotel who, in their own way, will save some money to the taxpayers of that state. Of course, he's the guy who likes to collect eyeballs, and has a whole collection going. There will not be much here that horror fans have not seen before, but there are some brutal scenes and enough blood to satisfy the fanatic. The configuration of the old hotel is also a perfect place for a slasher movie, and there are few secondary stories, such as the search for a supposed safe filled with money and the search for babies, since this mixed work team is even. Most teenagers are deservedly killable too, so it works well. It's not great, but it's much better than Silent Hill or When A Stranger, and maybe better than some of the other crap that I would not bother to see. 7 out of 10
