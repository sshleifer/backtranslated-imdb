Magnificent, original, beautiful movie. The performance is excellent, the settings and decoration are magnificent (Paris at its best, but then the real Paris, not the famous setting) and the music will also work. A brilliant story, very detailed, that I love. <br /> <br /> The best French movie I've seen (and French cinema is very good)!
