I recorded The Morrison Murders on the Lifetime Movie network and watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I'm glad that Walker got his brother Luke confessed to killing his parents and his brother Bobby. I enjoy watching real stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. The next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv, I'm going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is at The Morrison Murders. I give The Morrison Murders a ten because it's a good movie about Walker trying to find out who killed his parents and his brother Bobby and, in the end, Walker discovers that it was his brother Luke who murdered his parents and his brother Bobby.
