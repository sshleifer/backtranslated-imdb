I have to say that this is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it more than 100 times (actually I had to buy a new copy as a result of excessive tracking). This is how the eighties were and what a romantic story with some morals. I recommend it to anyone who wants to relive High School Days again. Buy a copy now is a classic !!!!
