Sex is a comedy, although it is not driven by a fantastically imaginative plot, it focuses effectively on the relationship between the film director and the team during the shooting process, while successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and, more specifically, the problems and problems faced by the actors. Participate in the filming of sex scenes. The director, 'Jeanne', occupies a prominent place in everything, since it is she who carries out the plot, instead of a narrator, and gives us many pearls of wisdom to think about. She is a social commentator, in relation to her assistant and other people, the problems she encounters with her new male protagonist when associated with a masculine stereotype. Does your ambiguous relationship typify something about human nature? The tendency to be fickle. On the one hand, the two seem to be close; When he is not in sight, she says she hates him. Jeanne also addresses her male pride, perhaps in a feminist take on things. <br /> <br /> The taboo of what constitutes obscenity is lifted: the content of the sex scenes is not considered obscene but beautiful, because it is the falsehood that constitutes obscenity - that is the director's justification. However, this is doubly ironic, since the film we see is itself a construction within a construction. <br /> <br /> There is more to this movie than just relationships, of course. Seeing this movie is not simply a matter of analyzing it in order to extract some kind of meaning. One can revel in the natural lighting that permeates the film. This makes it realistic and credible. Sometimes a static camera is used to capture a heavy composition and sometimes the camera appears as a home movie. If you are looking for something fun to watch on a Sunday afternoon that is not too heavy but that leaves you thinking: this is it.
