Little by little I have been collecting the movies available on DVD of Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut. Both the actress and the director have done some stinky in their time; Fortunately, Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Next to "The soft skin", casually looking at the sister of Deneuve (the last Fran√ßois Dorleac), this I have to be my favorite movie of Truffaut. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Truffaut also wrote the script. Something that always calls my attention to Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when a story is presented, one could almost say that he is naive. <br /> <br /> There is a scene towards the end of the film where Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon. With the remains of the booty. He rings the doorbell and Deneuve responds by wearing a robe. In the time it takes Belmondo to get to his room from the street, Deneuve puts on her dress, puts on her best pair of socks and shoes, lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep. It is a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child, but it is Truffaut for you. <br /> <br /> Seeing Catherine Deneuve in her films of the late 60s is a sensory pleasure. She is so extraordinarily beautiful that it is almost painful to see her. By the way, for those fans, there are a couple of scenes of her topless in this movie, in fact, a sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the previous posters. I do not see anything 'Hitchcockian' about the movie at all. As for the "look" of it, I love the look of old movies used in the 60s. Without a doubt, it gives the films of this period a unique look. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for fans of Deneuve and Truffaut ...
