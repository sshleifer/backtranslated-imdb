Simon Wests thriller pg-13 about a babysitter who gets annoying prank calls while sitting in a mansion is not original enough or exciting enough to call it a good movie. Although there are some elements of suspense, good eyes and decent characters, the movie is just another. I know what you did last summer, since you do not take it seriously. The performances were good, but nothing special with this movie. I say do not do it, unless you're looking for a mediocre movie, sometimes you can find better movies than this in a lifetime, well, maybe not for life, but at least in the United States or something, haha. ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
