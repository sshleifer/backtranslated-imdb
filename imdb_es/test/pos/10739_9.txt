Kramer vs. Kramer is a film to retain and not forget. It is not one of the most popular movies ever made and it is without a doubt one of the best weak film films, but it does not mean that it is not important. I thought the movie was well made and I made you want to see more and more. The performances were the best positive for the film and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles he has done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son, as his wife separates from him. Billy, who is the son of Hoffman, had another great performance along with Meryl Streep, playing the depressed mother of Billy. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the best movies and it's not a perfect 10, but it makes the film worth watching and worth worrying about. Certainly, one of the best films Hoffman has done. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hedeen Perspective: 9/10 *** + A-
