This movie was made thirteen years before I was born, but I still think it's the most ingenious, daring and harmless piece of fun that has ever been made. It just can not fail with the cast of the magnificent actors of British characters that he owns. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Alastair Sim-peerless; Margaret Rutherford-idem; the wonderful and innocent Gossage, interpreted to perfection by the imperious Joyce Grenfell. The caddish Victor Hyde-Brown (a special of Guy Middleton) and the rest of the staff summarize the postwar middle class of England in a T-shirt. <br /> <br /> The humor is sometimes obvious, but it is of that special variety of "Ealing" and it is never offensive. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie more times than I'd like to remember and I still laugh all the time. The assault on the dormitories occupied by the girls' school, the twin visits of the school magnificently planned, but finally condemned, and the chaotic ending that implies the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy, are priceless. <br /> <br /> It's an old clich√© I know, but in reality they do not do it that way anymore. How I would like them to do it. If you have not seen it, please do it, you will not be disappointed.
