Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller star in the story of two of the women in the life of Dylan Thomas. Knightley is the childhood love of Thomas with whom he meets again during the Blitz. When meeting in a bar, they reconnect, however, things get complicated when Thomas brings his wife (Miller) the next time he finds her. The women collided and things progressed until the trio was joined by the man who will become Knightly's husband. This complicates things even more as jealousy begins to show his face. <br /> <br /> Beautiful to look at, extraordinarily written and beautifully acted (all disappear completely in their roles) this is a sumptuous banquet for the eyes and the ears. It's so good to see a movie about adults who are adults. On a purely visceral level, I really enjoyed watching the movie because the film is artistically pleasing. I have rarely seen a movie so beautifully designed. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that I'm not completely sure of everything that happened. It seemed that something was missing and a couple of times I had to replay the movie to see if I lost something. Not bad, but it is not completely satisfactory as a result. (I tried to search online to see what part of the movie is true, but I could not find anything). Still, I think this is a movie that is worth seeing. It is a beautiful film for adults with probably the best performance that the protagonists have done.
