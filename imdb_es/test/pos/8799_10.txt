Human Traffic is undoubtedly the most original and compelling film I've seen for a long time. It documents 2 days in the life of a group of young people, bored with their daily existence and their jobs with no way out, and they take ecstasy in raves over the weekend. It's hilariously funny and extremely moving, and sometimes very sad. In the same genre that "Trainspotting" has a great soundtrack and presents young British youth and hot. The film was made on a minuscule budget and I hope to receive future offers from writer / director Justin Kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the main filmmakers.
