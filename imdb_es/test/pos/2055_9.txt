There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that your movie will not shoot many cheap punches. It takes place in a train station full of people and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons. They make a break for that and only manage to get out in a rain of shots. The main hall of the train station is now full of corpses of innocent people who were caught in the crossfire. Some would call it too sad and / or gloomy to put it on what is supposed to be a nice action movie. I call it honesty. Most action films tend to lean towards the "safe side" of showing violence and elements of the plot. This means mainly that, in spite of the massive shootings, innocent people tend not to die or at least we do not see them die. Violence is purely the good and the bad, mainly with the bad guys dying. A little common sense clearly shows that this is absurd. <br /> <br /> Renny Harlin showed a hint of this in his first (and sadly only) hit, Die Hard 2. The villains intentionally collided with a plane full of people to get their point of view. The scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people on board going down, but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used. However, to adapt to the spirit of the first film, Die Hard 2 was mainly a "funny action movie". Here, that grim and more convincing edge is widespread. The violence is bloody. The phrases are fun, but with a certain style that echoes natural human sarcasm more than clich√©d films at key moments of action. The plot is also full of more malicious intentions than most action movies. The villain is not just a rogue in search of revenge or a mad seizure of power. It's less ridiculous, but also more terrifying than that. Of the recent films, the trilogy "Bourne" almost arrives with its style of action film less corny than usual, but this film is from 1996 and 7 years before "The Bourne Identity" with Matt Damon came to the big screen . <Br /> <br /> Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine. And this is long before the film version of "Tomb Raider" became a hit. What's more, is that this heroine really looks like she could knock John McClane down and then take her cigarette still on. This movie marks the second role of heroine of action of Geena Davis and still failed to score a blow. While Angelina Jolie stars in "Tomb Raider" years later and scores a hit. The reasons are beyond me. Completely. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is not completely dark. There are many scandalous and spectacular pieces that can only be seen in an action movie. The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of pyrotechnic films, with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break. So, here's a formula, but it's the Anti-Formula for Hollywood's everyday action movie formula. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BSCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, blasphemy
