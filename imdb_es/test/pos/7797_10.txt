This movie is an incredible comedy ... the script is too funny ... if you see it more than once, you will enjoy it more. Although comedy is sometimes silly, but it really makes you laugh !! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their roles. After 1994 I have not found any Hindi movie that was as fun as this one.
