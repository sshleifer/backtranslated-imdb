This movie gets a 10 because there's a lot of gore in it. who cares about the plot or the performance. This is an Italian horror movie, so you know you can not expect much from the acting or the plot. Everybody knows. He took pictures of other movies and added them to it. Since I have never seen any of the movies from which he took pictures, I did not care. The Italian gore-out godfather made himself with this movie. This is one of the most incredible Italian movies you'll ever see. Without gore hound you should be without this movie in your horror movie collection. Buy this movie no matter what a Horehounds dream come true.
