Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers that he needs to take some time off, as everyone around him trusts him a lot and stages his own death. When he discovers that the ones he loves and the one he still loves are needed, he gets Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina) to help them. In search of his own past, of his own desires, this fabulous film by Claude Lelouch is the search for a man for himself at a mature age. <br /> <br /> Built like all Lelouch movies, the beginning of the movie with constant flashbacks can be confusing, especially the scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks a lot like his father) is playing a young Sam Lion while Sam Lion is in the same room, a flashback sequence that takes a second to understand. <br /> <br /> One of Lelouch's most elaborate works, L'itineraire d'un infant gate is a story of self-fulfillment that must be seen.
