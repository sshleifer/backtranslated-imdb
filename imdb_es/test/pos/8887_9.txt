Today we live in sad times, in which it seems that all comedies and television shows are painfully funny and inflicted with cheap, rude or poor humor. Most people do not know what it really means to laugh at a comedy, and these people desperately need to see "Launch the mom from the train". I say with little doubt that this is one of the funniest movies I've seen, from start to finish. The comedy is so unpredictable and so twisted enough to make us laugh out loud many times. Do not be fooled by the murder plan. The plot is not serious enough for us to worry or worry about what will happen. The story involves a young man (Danny DeVito) who wants to get rid of his annoying and moody mother (Anne Ramsey, Oscar nominee in a role that was completely impeccable, in my opinion) and does so by killing Billy Crystal's wife, whom Crystal wanted dead for stealing his novel. I do not want to spoil the jokes and jokes in this movie, but all I can say is that you should watch this movie if you want to laugh. Fast-paced and genuine, a real pleasure for lovers of comedy, and the kind of movie you do not see today. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
