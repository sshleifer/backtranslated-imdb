After having read the book before seeing this adaptation, you would think that it would have lost some emotion. However, the story is so intelligent that I could never tire of it. <br /> <br /> Sally and Elaine really put their hearts in their roles and drew a lot of the characters. I fell in love with history and women again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful to see thanks to the direction, the configuration and the clothing. Despite the speed of the television plot, I do not think anything important has been lost in transit. He had me on the edge of my seat with many wonderful moments of stomach tremors. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This is the kind of television I've been waiting for.
