Lucio Fulci's Cat in the Brain is an inventive and somewhat selfish story of a decent director in madness. The director in question is Fulci himself, who stars in the film. Fulci has come to be known by fans of horror everywhere as "the godfather of blood", and for good reason, since he has provided us with some of the most unpleasant and frightening films that have honored the silver screen; from the violence of the eyeball in movies like 'Zombie 2', to a man murdered with chains in 'The Beyond', to the maximum in the gore festival known as 'The New York Ripper'; If you want gore (and let's be honest, who does not), Fulci is your man. However, all this supply of gorehounds like you and me has made a dent in Fulci's state of mind, and he is rapidly sinking into madness, provoked by what he films. Fulci's problems also do not end in his mental state, since his psychiatrist who has gone to see his problem has committed to assuming murder as a hobby, using Fulci's films as planes for the murders! <br /> <br /> I have to say that the acting in this movie is absolutely atrocious. There is a particular scene that involves a prostitute, and is only worth laughing, both for his performance and for his stupidity. Fulci assumes the main role of the film (obviously). He's not an actor, and it shows, but his acting is actually the best in the movie. It's even safe to say that, in general, acting is bad for an Italian horror movie. Of course, no one gets into an Italian horror that expects a good performance, so it is forgivable, but I think Fulci could have hired some better ones. The bad dubbing does not help exactly. However, something that does help is the fact that the terrible performance is counteracted by a large amount of gore, and it is extreme to say the least. People cut their heads, a woman is murdered in the shower (and, unlike Psycho, we really see her here), people are pirated, fed to pigs and there are many of the best melee weapons in the world. Cinema: the chainsaw on display. What delighted me endlessly. The amount of blood is massively exaggerated most of the time, which gives the movie a "parody" feel, but Cat in the Brain is obviously a tongue-in-cheek movie anyway. <br /> <br /> It would be hard to make a movie about yourself and not seem to be a great boss, and Fulci is presented as a great boss in this movie. His name is mentioned often, and is on screen almost all the time; It is not very different from 'New Nightmare' in ego gambling, but it is obvious that he had a good time doing this, and for my part, I have fun observing him, so we can forgive him a bit of selfishness. The end of the film disappoints him: I saw him come a mile away, but then I did not seriously think that the film would take that route, but I was wrong; He did, unfortunately. The end left me cold, and the movie is a better watch if you turn it off just before the last two minutes. However, despite the fact that his ending and his acting are terrible, Cat in the Brain is very fun and will please the endless Fulci enthusiasts, and that is why it is recommended.
