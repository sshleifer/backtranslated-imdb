I think I was one of the people who found this other pearl of Roth. His performance, according to the award, was impressive. The story that Francis told so eloquently 25 years before, Coppola, really develops gradually and leaves space for the characters to develop. Roeg returns to prove that it does not have to be a war adjustment to be interresistant. In a more wonderful place you will find a story of contrast. Impurities and beauty go hand in hand, while loneliness must become your best friend. It shows a more sinister past of a small kingdom of the golden age that lands on a coast full of wealth for a first world country, if you send the right men. In short, a beautiful film directed by Nicola's roeg wih to sublime cast.
