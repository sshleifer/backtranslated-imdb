The brilliant thriller, which deserves much more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are amazing in their leading roles, like the entire cast of cast. A true black cinema with some wonderful images and a great dialogue, at the bottom of all this is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel about homophobia, this film attacks the post-war antiemism and all intolerance and hatred, with considerable power. Although the parts may seem a little favored to the modern public, it still has the power to impact and works very well as a thriller in its own right. A credit for all involved.
