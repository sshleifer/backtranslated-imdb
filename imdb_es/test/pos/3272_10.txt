I remember capturing this film in a C4 show a year ago and I was completely impressed by all this. I thought that the film managed to represent a diversity of genres; The supernatural, a love story, the intrigue of crime and many more. <br /> <br /> I was hooked on all this after about a minute and I was really worried about the characters. It made me feel terrified in a second for Jimmy, and then he made the gangsters laugh in the next ... and all the time I had my fingers crossed to make things work for Jimbo! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are excellent, Bryan Brown is of an absolute quality and made me lash out, along with David Field, which was fun and also an evil git. <br /> <br /> Ever since I saw this movie, I've been able to order it on DVD and, as a result, all the people that I show you have been hooked in the same way. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy evening, and it's one you can really appreciate with your classmates around.
