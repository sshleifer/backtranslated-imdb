I just saw the wonderful film by Jean Renoir, French Can Can. It is a visual delight and great entertainment. The recently produced Moulin Rouge pales in comparison. I did not receive all the accolades that the recent movie received. Now I am more convinced than ever, that my assessment was correct after seeing a film teacher like Jean Renoir, the version of the same story. He managed to get excellent performances from all his cast, and the great French actor, Jean Gabin, was in a weird way. The dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting I had ever seen. It was long, but I did not want it to end. This movie deserves to receive more recognition than it has.
