After 66 years, "Flash Gordon" still has an attractive sci-fi / adventure feel that many of today's sci-fi adventures strive and fail to deliver. The only way to fully enjoy this series is simply to lie down and not choose anything (hokey effects, dialogues, why Flash does not bet on Princess Aura, etc.). And as for you, the older people who saw "Flash Gordon" again on the series screen or on television "back in the day", if you want this excellent series to remain attractive to future generations, have your children / grandchildren see this when you are young It worked for me (Man of 18 years or less). 9 out of 10
