I saw it last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything you would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. It's campy and very fun. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely silly. The plot is extravagant, an American businessman goes to Bulgaria and dies. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves / returns Bruce Campbell to life by implanting half the brain of a former taxi driver turned into a member of the KGB. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between him and the KGB agent. The film has all the great cane and humor of Bruce Campbell. The movie is predictable, I knew that once the wife was killed she would share a brain with her killer. However, I did not go to see this movie because I thought I would have an Oscar-winning script, I went to see it because it was a science fiction film by Bruce Campbell and it did not disappoint me in the least. I recommend that you go see it on your book tour or wait and see it on the science fiction channel next month. Although before the movie, he said that the science fiction channel cut part of the film to be compatible with television. If you are a Bruce fan, I recommend it.
