Sometimes it is difficult to watch movies with subtitles (in this case in Danish), but the observation is worthwhile. As the story progresses, the reasoning for the choice of two sisters, to take care of their father, is questionable, but their society is different. His choice leaves them alone until a Frenchwoman arrives. There may be a question about why the French woman came to her place to stay and this is never fully developed. The party that occurs later as a result of unexpected funds from France is an unusual source of pleasure for all who attend and something they have not experienced before. Provide an appropriate thanks for the kindness given to the guest. Filmed with a dark aura and the exhibition of poverty, it is a beautiful experience for the viewer.
