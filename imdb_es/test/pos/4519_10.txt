I just watched this movie in an advanced screening. I had not read the book and did not know anything about the story, but I went because the book was voted "Book of the Year" by two local universities. So I can not compare the book with the movie as others have. <br /> <br /> In summary, I thought this was an incredibly moving story. The performance was credible, and the understanding of Afghan culture and political history was interesting and impressive. My oldest friend is Iranian-American, so I felt an affinity for certain values ​​and traditions of the Middle East that were described in the film, as they reminded me of the times I spent with your family. <br /> <br /> The themes of friendship, family, human values ​​and courage under fire are universal and well developed in the film. I will not list the details of the plot, since these can be obtained elsewhere. But based on the technical aspects of the film, the acting and, above all, its heartbreaking story, I would definitely recommend this movie.
