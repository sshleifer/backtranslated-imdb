Some will say that this movie is a guilty pleasure. I loved this movie but I do not feel guilty about that. It can be said that the entire cast and crew had fun making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 will not go well with some people. From the beginning, you can say that this movie will be corny and definitely has an amateur look. Well, if you have the privilege of seeing this movie, after seeing it, remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now, because I can not fill ten lines, here are some great scenes: <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The three women on the beach had a great death. The first had Jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them. He was still missing so he dropped an anvil on it. The next woman fell on an icicle bed. The last one was stabbed in the eyes with tweezers. <br /> <br /> The other big one was where two surfing marauders are hanging near a frozen pole. One of them sticks his tongue (of course). Jack Frost removes it and tears his tongue out while saying "COWA-LANGUAGE-A KIND!" Well, you have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the snowball kids kicked the ass. <br /> <br /> ** FINAL SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> endless stars
