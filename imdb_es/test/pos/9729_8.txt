And she was really beautiful (that is, Laraine Day), herself, her part and her performance. An attractive story of selfish love vs. disinterested, for the same man, the rich beau and the dipsomaniac Robert Cummings. One of his drunken fits leads to an incident that infuriates the local community and tests the mettle of the two sisters (Jean Muir and Laraine Day) who are close to him (and each other). Their comfortable and somewhat superficial environment is completed when the two girls face the resulting crisis and respond to their conflicting demands for prudence, integrity, loyalty and love, with consequences that are profoundly different for each of them. With the old vanities and subtleties abandoned, their real characters reveal themselves in a fascinating contrast. <br /> <br /> A wonderful discovery at TCM!
