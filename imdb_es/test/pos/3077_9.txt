This movie was amazing, if you want a movie with word games and non-stop laughter, then this is for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and turned it into something that the whole family can enjoy and laugh at. The first time I saw this movie was when I was about 10 years old, and I got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything that implies: "By order of the financial secretary of the kings H and R Blockhead?" <br /> <br /> Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes (Robin Hood) in life, whether or not. It is not your liar Liar with the "Claw" or Sierra. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing
