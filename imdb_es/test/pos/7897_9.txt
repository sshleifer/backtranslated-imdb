Caution: possible spoilers ahead? ... I just saw 'Joe' for the second time. The first time was more than 30 years ago at an Air Force Base. It reminded me of the Air Force coat with technology. Sergeant stripes worn by the groom / merchant; We aviators laughed a lot the first time he appeared on the screen because that is a range of 'life'. Over the years I have taken several other images of the film. The main one was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone else commented, you could not take your eyes off her. I did not realize until now that this was a 20-year-old Susan Sarandon in her first movie. What a loss that he did not make more movies when he looked like that. I also remember the irony of having a counterculture hero like Peter Boyle play the leading role of a right-wing madman. Not unlike George C. Scott playing generals in Dr. Strangelove and Patton. And, of course, the shocking end caused a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> More than 30 years ago, it was the most commented movie ever played on the base. We thought it was a great movie then and I was reluctant to see it again because I was afraid it would be as disappointing as Easy Rider. But seeing it today, I was surprised at how well the film has been maintained. It is a very solid script with few holes, although you must ask yourself if the boyfriend will get out of the bathtub immediately when Sarandon enters with him. <br /> <br /> Seeking an explanation of why this movie is still so entertaining. I have to think that it has something to do with the perfect physical cast. Boyle was physically credible as Joe (as others have pointed out, his performance would inspire the character of Archie Bunker a few years later). Ted Knight modeled his 'Caddyshack' character, Judge Smails after Dennis Patrick's advertising executive on 'Joe'? They look and sound the same. Patrick was totally credible as the middle-class executive, too tight. And the innocent Sarandon with the Raggety Ann doll still evokes a protective response from all male viewers: the perfect casting. <br /> <br /> The scenes of nudity and drugs actually remain (they were very provocative for their time) and are as explicit as anything that can be found in "Thirteen". The only thing that dates from this movie is that the violence is not realistic or graphic. 'Joe' was about the same time as 'The Wild Bunch', and the tone of the violence in the movie had barely begun to change. <br /> <br /> Another reason why this film is held is that events over the past two years have returned the relevance of the theme and context of this film. In the film, both types of "conservatives" are portrayed as full of fear and hatred towards unconventional forms of counterculture; And full of envy for his free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counterculture is described as mocking the right culture; and although paranoid towards conservatives (legitimately, since this was only a couple of months after the state of Kent), they can not resist flaunting their lifestyle in an attempt to antagonize. The political landscape is not so different 30 years later. I am not sure that conservatives envied young people as much as liberals until 1970, but they fear and hate them more. <br /> <br /> An excellent film that, surprisingly, is as relevant now as it was in the early 70s.
