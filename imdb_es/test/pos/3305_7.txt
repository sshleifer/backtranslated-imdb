This is the drama of a fascinating woman that men can enjoy. The plot follows a young woman (Hope Lange) who goes to work for a publisher after college. We can forgive the jump from secretary to editor (well, it's Hollywood) and some other flaws. Here is one of the few films in which the great producer Robert Evans appears (here, which beautifully represents a rat with women). It also has a mature Joan Crawford and an excellent cast. Check it out.
