ManBearPig is a pretty fun episode of South Park. False to Al Gore and his speeches on global warming, which only replace global warming with ManBearPig (a fictitious monster that has parts of a man, a bear and a pig). He tells the children about a school assembly and Stan feels sorry for him, so he and the children decide to hang out with him. Eventually he traps them in a rock cave where he thinks he is manbearpig and they are trapped for days. Meanwhile, Cartman finds treasure but wants to save everything for himself. ManBearPig is a good parody of global warming and, in general, it's a fun episode of South Park. <br /> <br /> 8/10
