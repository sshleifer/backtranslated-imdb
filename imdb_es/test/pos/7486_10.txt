This movie is excellent. Not because it does something special or new, but because it is consistently great in all its parts. No part stands out as "innovative" or "stellar", but all parts are far above the mediocre, and for me, it is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> I have several copies of this movie, and you can buy it from DVD or Blu-Ray collectors, one day (delaying now due to high Blu-ray prices and, of course, the face of I do not have a Blu-ray player ... but that's next to the point of this review). <br /> <br /> He stars in a fairly ordinary way, but quickly becomes a drama full of tension, some action, strongly portrayed characters and a well thought out plot that keeps him interested until the end. very final. <br /> <br /> Wait, no, it does NOT begin in an ordinary way. <br /> <br /> Start as something like a Qun. Tar. The movie I WANT could be. With an incredible scene in which an attempt to buy coffee and some donuts comes out ... very, very bad. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, nothing was as it seemed and some people are dead, and a few people are very rich. I will not tell you who ... look and enjoy! Overall rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
