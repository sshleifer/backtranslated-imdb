I've seen this movie maybe 100 times, I never tire of seeing it. I saw her for the first time when she was 7 years old, and she has left a mark on my memories since then. It is a lovely love story that brings out the sun in most people, even in the darkest moments. I think this is a movie you "must see" and one of the best performances of Anthony Quinn. I only wish that TV channels send this movie more often. It has inspired me in a good way and, surely, it will be done to many others. If there is an actor that I would like to know, it would have been Anthony Quinn. There will never be a taste of him on silver screens, ever. I wish Anthony Quinn was alive. May God bless your soul.
