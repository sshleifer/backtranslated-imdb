What we have here is a perfect movie for anyone who participates in the world of post-industrialism: those who sit in their privatized home, earn money buying and selling products without sensations and perpetuating a system that values ​​little more than car preservation. <br /> <br /> The beautiful filming (I always appreciate the arrangements 35 and the soft boxes) makes it an even stranger place to travel, both pleasing to the eye but frightening to understand (maybe that's too dramatic, but it is true). <br /> <br /> Andreas's journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic. Your search is honorable, praiseworthy and precious. The conclusion is necessary and we are not sure if it is better, which is the perfect conclusion. <br /> <br /> Brief! Highly recommended for all people who see your world with a critical eye and especially for those who do not (perhaps encourage a reflection or two).
