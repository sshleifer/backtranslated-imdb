Puzzled medical students play chicken with a process that simulates death, in an attempt to obtain a vision (hopefully temporary) of future life. Certain twists and themes of the plot are a little out of place, and the performance occasionally goes over. But the underlying message, about the forgiveness of God and others for our real or perceived sins, is positive and unique in the movies, and the cast is very good. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is so effective that, years after seeing her, I still feel chills when thinking about her. Highly recommended
