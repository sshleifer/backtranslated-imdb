I saw Conrack on a night that I could not sleep and I was never so happy to have insomnia! This story of a young white teacher taking a position teaching poor black children on an island in Carolina is a great announcement to teach, and simply to help each other. Established in the early 60's, with the problems of civil rights, Vietnam and everything that came with the 60's, it is forgotten that the Peace Corps and many young people stood up to make a difference by helping the underprivileged . With his open style of teaching, Interrack is interested in these children as people and encourages an honest interaction in their class that scares the power. The best part was that Jon Voight said they had a 20-year meeting and that 18 of those children became teachers. It's enough to make you think that, as humans, we may have the chance to survive ourselves, maybe, with luck. Watch this movie
