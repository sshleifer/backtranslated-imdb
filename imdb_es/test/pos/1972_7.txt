The film eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game in a pod system that is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when an attempt is made to assassinate the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and the 38 million dollars spent on development will be lost. However, the only way to repair the game is to go to the game with the only person you think you can trust (Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but it does not really take up until very late in the movie. The best thing about this movie were the turns towards the end. Definitely worth seeing. 7/10
