This movie makes me laugh even for just thinking about it. Such a smart comedy! very precise but easy. The casting can not be better. All the actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best, and there are no stupid laughs or shouts in the whole movie. The layers and the progress of the story work perfectly together and the rhythm flows smoothly. the biggest of all is when the Village People's YMCA is singled out, it highlights the importance of the status of India that was only mentioned briefly in the film, which makes it the most intelligent and funny climax of many comedies. I give it a ten, especially many times the comedies are so underestimated.
