He kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story and, perhaps, deeper with regard to political invocations. But, again, most of these are not directed by Peter Watkins. Perhaps the only real British film genius genius that emerged from the 1960s, Watkins has made a lot of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outside aesthetic world: the world of political events, social problems and government solutions. Therefore, their work is probably less "filmic" than, for example, political, what some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality. Then, again, why should not art be allowed to compromise? Watkins dares. And he gets it. You will not feel good with this one. You will not feel happy Actually, you're not going to like the movie; He is intransigent, honest, direct, without shame; A blow to the face, anyway. You can not help getting angry, you can not resist letting the things you see touch you. That's what makes Watkins movies so rewarding.
