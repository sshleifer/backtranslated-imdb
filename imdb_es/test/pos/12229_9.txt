A tender film that represents how our daily life is a catalyst that makes us change our thoughts, behaviors and emotions in people we are not. This story is a love story where true emotions arise. I give credit to Malcolm Jamal Warner (Win) and Challen Cates for their outstanding performances. A film that is definitely worth seeing, a holiday trip that turns into an emotional turn. I suggest to see it.
