The story was well drawn and interesting by itself. However, it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you. To avoid that, I'm not going to talk about the story here. <br /> <br /> I consider this film as a good adaptation of Sarah Water's book, compared to the previous one "Tilting Velvet". First I read the book and then I watched the DVD later. The film retained most of the spirits of the book's main characters. Of course, due to the time limitation, the film in the last 30 minutes seemed in a hurry to cover part III of the book. Therefore, he could not illustrate the scene well when everyone met in the kitchen of Mr. Ibbs' place and the ones that followed after that (even the book seemed like a hurry in that kitchen scene). Despite that, the film really did a good job of representing the story. It's really worth seeing. It is not yet clear when BBC-America can broadcast this movie. It's a shame. <br /> <br /> PS: noticed that the ages of Maud and Sue were going to be 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the second is more reasonable, while the first is closer to the ages of the actresses.
