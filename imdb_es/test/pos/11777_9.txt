I just received the Hardware Wars DVD, in a shiny new package, with an irresistible look. I was stuck on my DVD player to find a lot of extra fun things. The additional content on the DVD is even longer than the movie. For those of you who (shame!) Have never seen Hardware Wars, it's a fantastic parody of Star Wars (from Episode IV, of course). Household appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners and a waffle maker) represent the wrestlers of Ty, X-wings, R2D2 and the death star. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid, complete with the Cinnabon hairstyle. You get the point, I'm sure. A crazy and fun trip for any Star Wars geek (like me!) <br /> <br /> Now, the DVD - wow! A comment from the director in which, basically, it goes off in the movie, making fun of himself and the project at all times. An interview with Fosselius in Creature Features (do you remember that?) And the "director's version" and the "foreign version" of the film (all jokes, of course). Anyway, this is great. I loved Hardware Wars in the theater, and I am very happy to have the DVD in my collection, embedded between MST3K: the movie and Thumb Wars!
