I rate this as an 8 due to the premise of the movie. The performance was good, there was no one who stood out as surprising or frightening. It is disturbingly true that intelligent people have fewer and fewer children, or choose not to have any at all ... while ass supporters "W in '04" are procreating like rabbits. And, although I do not believe that the Earth really exists in 500 years, I can see that the parodied prophet Mike Judge becomes an art that imitates life. The world is being driven by idiots, and it will get worse as free thinking intelligent people become a minority and the "git 'er done" fanatics will outnumber them. The test is our farce of a choice. <br /> <br /> But I'm rambling. If you are lucky enough to play in your city, go and see it. I have paid my $ 7.50 plus popcorn to see the trash MUCH MORE than this (Movie date or Napoleon dynamite? Someone?). There are laughs, there is havoc, but in general this is entertaining. If you have half a brain, you will think how this movie, although funny, is accurate (accurate) and a bit tiny * strange. I'm not at all surprised that this movie is almost completely unknown, since Fox was the one who distributed this, and they did not want any of his sheep to see this and think, "Maybe I'll READ a book and not watch." Next 'o' Cheaters', or 'Ow my balls'. "If our society does not stop the hindering of everything and the bastardization of the English language (ahem, Mr. Bush), then it really is where we are going.
