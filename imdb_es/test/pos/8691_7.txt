Why Jessie Matthews, one of the leading British musical stars, was in this film between her brilliant "The Good Companions" and the classic "Evergreen" is a good question? When I saw it for the first time, I was really disappointed. He wanted to see her sing and dance, they told her it was "Millie, the girl of the non-stop variety", but there were more stops than variety. <br /> <br /> Now I see it as a little drama. <br /> <br /> It is about a bus accident and the stories, prior to it, of the people on the bus. <br /> <br /> Aside from Jessie Matthews, who's great as Millie - Sir Ralph Richardson plays his girlfriend (yes, that's right). <br /> <br /> Edmund Gwenn, who went to Hollywood to co-star in Lassie movies and also with Natalie Wood in "Miracle on 34th Street," plays a grumpy businessman. . Gordon Harker is your very annoying partner. <br /> <br /> Emlyn Williams, who wrote "Night Must Fall", was the villain of the emails and Frank Lawton, who went to Hollywood and appeared in "David Copperfield" and "The Devil Doll" is the young in trouble. Sonnie Hale, who was married to Jessie Matthews at the time, was playing as a bus driver.
