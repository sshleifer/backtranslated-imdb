This movie is the best kung fu movie of all time. Although there is no cable work or special effects like those used in Crouching Tiger, this film uses the ingenuity and creative work of the camera to create memorable moments of struggle, and the fight scenes are well choreographed and adjusted. There is a lot of action in this movie with many scenes of great fights, but the story is also very good, with many twists and turns. The characters are well rounded and have a lot of depth, since the motivations of their actions and personality are revealed in much greater detail than most kung fu movies. There is a great camera work in the film, with my favorite shot beginning as an approach to the face of our hero that shows his reaction, then he quickly withdraws to reveal the scene before him and that is the cause of his appearance . Originally, I bought the movie hoping to see some scenes of great fights, but after several presentations I learned how amazing the acting and the story was. In general, a great movie.
