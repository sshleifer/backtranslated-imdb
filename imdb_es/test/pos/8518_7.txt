1983 was "the battle of the bonds". That year, both Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond films, the first (Octopussy) was produced by the "official" creators of the Bond films, while the last (Never Say Never Again) was produced "unofficially" "by a group Directed by Kevin McClory who held the film rights of Thunderball. Surprisingly, it is the "unofficial" movie that is best despite the obvious flaw and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> Never Say Never Again has the distinction of wearing one of the best molds ever assembled for a Bond movie. It all starts with Sean Connery, who returns to Bond for the first time since the Diamonds are forever 1971. Connery might be older than he was then, but he looks better here and then he did it in Diamonds Are Forever. The Bond of Never Say Never Again is the elegant and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love, only a few years older. The delivery of Connery from a line and the dialogue is as suspense as it always was. The only downside of Connery's age is his credibility, especially when it comes to the ladies of the movie. Let's face it, even Connery, despite being in the best physical shape, seems as strange as Moore when he's putting women half his age to bed. However, despite this credibility problem, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his best Bond performances and a definite improvement in his two previous Bond performances. <br /> <br /> Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of his first film roles. Bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a newly arrived relative and she makes the character credible. Bassinger holds up against his co-stars and also has considerable chemistry with them. In fact, it may well overshadow its Thunderball counterpart played by Claudine Auger. <br /> <br /> Then there is the villain Maximilian Largo, played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is all that a villain in the James Bond movie should be: soft, charming, evil and, above all, credible. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap in which many other Bond villains have fallen by passing over. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent threat and charisma that is not seen in many adversaries of 007. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast also extends to the cast. Barbara Carrera becomes an excellent woman in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she appears. Max Von Sydow has a good appearance as Blofeld, although his appearance is more like a cameo. Rowan Atkinson appears as Bond's clumsy contact that makes some of the best scenes in the film. With all the highlights of the cast, comes from the MI6 staff of Edward Fox's M, which makes a great contrast to Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem that makes moneypenny and the icing on the cake with the wonderful Q Alec McCowen. The cast has a couple of flaws, though in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi, who both lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise, this film shows one of the best molds ever assembled for a Bond movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to an excellent cast, the film has several other essential ingredients. From the initial sequence of Central America to the fight in Shrublands to the underwater sequences and the pursuit of motorcycles, this is a film in which the action sequences are not only excellent, but also serve the plot for the most part. The film also presents good special effects in terms of models of cruise missiles, explosions and all the things we expect from a Bond movie. Irvin Kershner, who has just started with The Empire Strikes Back, gives a strict sense of direction to the film, especially in sequences such as the substation of the nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of Bond's oldest films with its intensive use of computer games of 1980. While the technology dates from any movie after a while, the film's heavy reliance on it, especially in the The hijacking of the cruise missiles and the Domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated a quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer predictability due to the fact that it is a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> However, for its predictability, the screenplay for Never Say Never Again is pretty good. The script shows good scenes of dialogue, not a single sentence worthy of compassion (how many of the scripts of the era of Roger Moore can say about that?), Some humorous situations and, however, are visible and tense for the most part . Once you look beyond the fact that it is a remake, there are many good things in the script of the movie. <br /> <br /> Music is, in fact, the biggest weakness of the movie. Due to the "unofficial" state of the film, the James Bond theme could not be used. That said, he could have shown with the right composer that a Bond score without it could work. Unfortunately, Michael Legrand's score is far from adequate. Legrand's score is totally out of place in a Bond movie and there are only one or two places where it really works. To make matters worse, the film also has one of the worst sequences of titles in the history of James Bond. <br /> <br /> Despite being very old-fashioned, somewhat predictable and having a bad score, never say never again is still a good Bond movie. With one of the best releases of any Bond movie, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction and excellent dialogue, this film shows that "unofficial" is not a bad thing. In fact, it's better than Octopussy and the winner of "the battle of the Bonds".
