On Monday, earlier this week, sometime in July, I came across the influence of the sweet leaf and, since I'm a terror fan, I wanted to see something that scared me. I was thinking about The Ammityville Horror 2, but I got something much better. I was at my friend's house, and he had the VHS Evil Ed edition. Without coverage or anything, he did not even see everything himself, but he told me that he was "a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people" . Well, this movie was very shocking, I had never seen the true brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie buries Ted Bundy and Ed Gein! It's also a lot of fun, with references to The Evil Dead trilogy (and the Evil Dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie too!) The film is about Edward, an obsessive-compulsive and nice guy, who happens to be a movie editor. Then it is lent to another department in the building, and sent to the elegant but violent world of Sam Campbell, the department of Splatter and Gore. Sam Campbell, the new boss of Eddy, is telling Eddy about the great opportunity in his films, the dreadful series Loose Limbs, and he needs Eddy to make the film a little less violent so they can be seen all over Europe. Eddy will soon regret it, since the images and scenes that are shown him from the lonely suburban house in which he is sent to work, and then, what happens from there is really a nightmare. Imagine yourself instead! The acting is excellent, the overdubbing is not very funny (Sam Campbell's voice is often funny, just like with the other actors). However, the overdubbing work was done quite well, I give this movie a 10/10, and it's a good introduction to the subgenre Gore of Horror. Very good, Nightmare, bloody ... You just have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Movie quote: "Where in the f ** k is my Beaver rape scene?"
