I remember that I really liked BATMAN RETURNS when it went on sale in 1992, but now I think this is the best of all Batman movies (even in the fabulous BATMAN BEGIN of Christopher Nolan in 2005 and definitely on the overrated and oversized 2008! THE DARK KNIGHT! ). Originally I remember thinking that the 1st BATMAN with Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love it). But I think this movie really hits the nail in the head. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman and Max Shreck) are all vivid and memorable. You can really see what Batman / Bruce Wayne is about in Keaton's excellent characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, not even the promising Bale, who was exceptional in BB and could have stolen Keaton's top honors if his character had not been destroyed by Nolan's hacking in TDK. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito as The Penguin is disturbing, frightening, hilarious and lethal. DeVito is great and does not need to chew landscapes to get great performance like the Nicholson Joker. The viewer can really sympathize with this disfigured marginalized and difficult situation to fit into normal society. I had never really been a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this movie, but this is definitely my favorite performance of her. Selina Kyle of Pfeiffer is ridiculous and strange at first, then, when she becomes Catwoman, at the same time she is sexy and terrifying, a total and deadly sexpot! Also, I think that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from BATMAN; They form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> BATMAN RETURNS, more than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. It ensures the making of films from start to finish. The way Burton presents the heart-rending story of the penguin catches you from the start. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings of any movie: Danny Elfman's music sets an ominous tone of foreboding that defines the rest of the film. It is a modification of the original and excellent BATMAN! <br /> <br /> Then, it advances 33 years to this day in Gotham and we introduce the powerful businessman Shreck who wants to build a new power plant in Gotham. During the same scene we meet the humble, harassed and unsafe secretary of Shreck, Selina Kyle. And not long after all this, it's the exciting opening action sequence by Batman, who must fight the gang of the red triangle of The Penguin, a fun but lethal group of marginalized and circus artists. Penguin launches a plan to attack Gotham's Christmas celebration, kidnap Shreck into chaos and force him to help him re-present him in society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shreck's criminal plans and that's why she "kills" her out of her high-rise office, then the cats revive her. <br /> <br /> Sound complicated? Yes, but Burton never claimed to be raising a realistic story. He has created a world in which the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a dark, noirish world, composed of marginalized abused and mistreated who basically want acceptance and fit. Safe narrations if you ask me! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are few and far between, but they are all exciting, entertaining and exciting. They are not there just for the show, as some are in BATMAN. And they all make sense. The climactic scene with Penguin's "army" marching towards downtown Gotham with Batman concentrating on Penguin's hideout and butler Alfredo (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) Helping Batman is succinct, solid and fun! br /> <br /> I also love Christmas, the winter environment, which adds to the super dark and cold feeling of Batman's world of Burton. I also love the way Burton slowly introduces us to Batman's "toys" without pushing them down our throats. Each "toy" is appropriate for that moment in the movie and we are obligated to accept them for their purpose. And although dark, RETURNS is still a funny movie. The DeVito penguin has many fun lines. So does Walken Shreck. The exchanges between Batman and Catwoman are also extremely stimulating and full of humor! A great set! In general, BATMAN RETURNS is a tale of the dark forces at play in the fun world of Tim Burton comics.
