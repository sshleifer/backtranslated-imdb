Beautifully filmed, acclaimed director Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire) creates a story that brings the entire legend of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke and Tarzan of the apes to life with reverence and dignity, and with a scope never before seen in movies of Tarzan. Christopher Lambert makes his star debut as the young Lord, raised in the wild by a female gorilla after his parents died in Africa. Later, returning to what for him is a strange world, that of class and privilege, feels totally out of place. Once he finds out what has happened to the apes that raised him and his world, he realizes that he must return. A sad but triumphant story told in a context of fantastic views. This is one of those movies that is a must for all Cinemaphile collections.
