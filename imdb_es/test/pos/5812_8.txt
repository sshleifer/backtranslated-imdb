This was my first look at this short horror series on British television, but I had seen a couple of horror films from Hammer (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and I believed enough to take a look. br /> <br /> This first episode was shocking, not because of the horror but because of all the nudity. Was this "regular" television in England in 1980? If so, it showed much more skin than we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, a scene in which a man put his hand in one, and another scene with a man on top of a woman pretending to have sex. Hey, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a witch who disappeared in the seventeenth century returns to her old home and makes a married man's life difficult. The last one, Jon Finch as "David Winter", was not a great actor, but his wife was not bad and she was really beautiful. She was being Prunella Gee as "Mary". The husband suspected that she, rightly, had an affair and that it plays a role in this story. <br /> <br /> Patricia Quinn was entertained as the laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup", who returns with a bad spell. She spends it well tormenting the couple until things go wrong in the end. As a man, I would say it was particularly fun to see the two women who do it! This starts slowly but once "Lucinda" starts to stir things up, it becomes very entertaining.
