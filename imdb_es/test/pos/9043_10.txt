An unfairly neglected classic, "Intruder in the Dust" is one of the great films of the 1940s that, unfortunately, has fallen into obscurity. Based on a story by William Faulker, and filmed in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, "Intruder" tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hern√°ndez), a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man . and a white child (Claude Jarman, Jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt with Beauchamp. Fantastic performance, especially by two actors of great characters, Porter Hall (as the father of the dead man) and Elizabeth Patterson (better known as Mrs. Trumbull in "I Love Lucy") as an old woman willing to confront the townspeople for see that right. It's done. This direct, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more.
