This movie is without doubt the best I've seen in my entire life. The cast of stellar stars is only an additional advantage over the incredible special effects, deep history and sublime choreography. The film is about an ancient love story that unfolds in the modern world. Two lovers in heaven incur the wrath of a great sage and are cursed. Later the woman is born again on earth. While she is in college, she is raped and commits suicide. The rest of the film focuses basically on the hunting of people related to rape, for their lover who possesses superhuman strength and mastery of several languages. Sonu Nigam offers a very mature and profound performance in this film, and all the other actors do it too. The action scenes with Akshay Kumar are amazing, and should not be missed. You just have to watch this movie!
