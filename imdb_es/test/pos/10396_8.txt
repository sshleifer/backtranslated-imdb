This is a special movie if you know the context. Antonioni, in his eighties, had been paralyzed by a stroke. Silent and half paralyzed, his friends, who by the way are the best in the world of cinema, made arrangements for him to "direct" one last important film. The idea is that he can conjure a story just by looking at it. So we have a movie: about a director who evokes stories by simple observation. And the theme of the (four) stories is about how the visual imagination defines love. <br /> <br /> The film emerges by giving us the tools to carry it out through our own imagination. The result is pure cinematic world: each person (except the director) is charming in appearance or movement. Some of these women are ultra light, and exist in a world of dream and dreamy haze. There are no nuances, there is no indication that there is more than what we see; no other desire is at work more than what we create. <br /> <br /> I do not know of any other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual longing for us to create the world we see. He understands something about not touching. No one understands Van Morrison visually as he does. The music of Morrison's Celtic space is based precisely on the same notion: the sensual touch that implies but does not physically touch. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's red-haired wife appears, appropriately as the merchant, and also runs a dazzling farce 'film that is on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of Ted - 3 of 4: Worth seeing.
