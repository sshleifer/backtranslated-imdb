Based on the 1952 autobiography "A thing of many splendors", "Love is a thing of many splendors" (1955) tells the story of Han Suyin, centered on the romance that Han, a Eurasian medical widow in 1949 in Hong Kong , had a married American correspondent named Mark Elliott. "I do not want to feel anything again, ever," Han tells Mark shortly after they meet, but the two soon develop mutually irresistible for each other, and who can blame them? Mark is played by William Holden at the height of his hunky period (the "Picnic" the following year would be the highlight) in this, the first of three films in the next seven years that will find Holden in China ( 60s "The world of Suzie Wong" and "Satan never sleeps" of 1962 (the others being) and Dr. Han is played here by Jennifer Jones, who, although not Eurasian (unlike the delightful Nancy Kwan and the beautiful France Nuyen of those other exotic Holden films), makes a credible job of passing as one.Whether dressed in cheongsam, European dress, surgical gown or swimsuit (hubba-hubba!), Jones looks ridiculously beautiful here No wonder East meets the West in this film so dramatically! With its two attractive main stars, the stunning scenery of Hong Kong, the beautiful CinemaScope and color, the Oscar-winning costumes and the classic song Oscar winner that flows through the film like a lovely incense, "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" tour It came out to be the whole winning and romantic contest. Supposedly, Han herself did not care about the image, so I can only imagine that they took great liberties with the original material. Still, I enjoyed it. And if the end of the film causes a tear to reach your eyes, just remember Mark's wise words: "The greatest tragedy of life is not being loved."
