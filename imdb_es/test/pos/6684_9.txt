I was very surprised when I first saw this film directed by Iain Softley; It differs greatly from Hollywood's usual mass production. The plot itself is simple: Kevin Spacey plays a mental patient, Prot, who claims to be from the planet K-pax who came to Earth with a beam of light, while Dr. Powell played by Jeff Bridges tries to help him solve his delusions. First of all, I must admit that the cast is perfectly chosen: Kevin Spacey is really brilliant in the representation of Prot's intriguing character, always walking in the fine line of convincing us that he is real and then making us wonder if he is delusional. or not ... Some of the gem scenes include that in which Prot innocently eats the whole banana (even the peal) while in session with Dr. Powell; or the observatory scene where he confidently shows his knowledge of the K-Pax system to astounded astronomers ... Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, is the subtle and rational side of this film, and he offers it to perfection. There is a cast of other excellent actors (like the convincing performance of Saul Williams as Ernie) that make this movie really work. <br /> <br /> K-pax has it all, elements of comedy; Science fiction, even psychological thriller (in relation to the identity of Prot), but the most important thing is that it can be classified as a touching drama. The main premise of the film is quite complex, but the director never lets it loose, it always keeps it credible and, nevertheless, interpretable in two senses. The camera and photography have almost a crucial part here, continuing with the main idea of ​​light travel, there is a lot of focus on the play of shadows and lights, one of the memorable scenes where Dr. Powell has a crystal figure in his office that refracts the light in a beautiful way, while all the time suspects that the idea may be true? <br /> <br /> K-pax, subtle and slow, intriguing and pleasurable, is really a jewel to watch, one of the kind movies that may not be for everyone, but those who see it, may fall in love with that.
