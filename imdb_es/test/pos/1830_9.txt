This movie is sweet, not cloying, just warm and friendly. I found it only slightly funny, and the premise * is * incredibly unlikely, but the characters are so charming (especially Minnie Driver's) that they had my full attention from the beginning, and soon they also had my affection. <br /> <Bonnie Hunt has done a great job on her directorial debut, and also a good job with writing. I recommend this movie and I'll see it again, I'm sure.
