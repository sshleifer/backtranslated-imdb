Established in Los Angeles in the 1970s, Christopher Boyce has just left seminary school and returned to his home where his father gets him a job supervising intelligence documents. His old friend Daulton Lee is a rooster drug dealer, he is caught in a situation and must choose between becoming a drug dealer or facing a long jail term. When he is released on bail, he jumps and goes to Mexico City. Chris offers Lee in an association to be his messenger to sell secret documents to the embassy of the Soviet Union in Mexico City, due to the misfortune that he feels about the control of the United States government over the weakest countries for his own benefit. But over time, the two begin to collide with their motivations and find themselves in something bigger than they had originally thought. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger has broadcast such films as the respectable "Midnight Cowboy," "Marathon Man," "Sunday Bloody Sunday," and "Locust Day." While "The hawk and the snowman" do not hold up so high, there is no doubt that this dark drama of espionage (inspired by a true incident) is a character portrait unfairly overlooked. All about this, it is a rather tenuous matter without qualities of real grandeur that reach a massive mark. The determining factor of the film has to be the admirably versatile performance of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as the two young and ambitious boys Chris and Daulton. Penn is especially good with his uncomfortable intensity, which works well with Hutton's extraordinarily cool spin. What starts as easy, we see how the situation gradually falls apart, as the two fans are really out of their league. The highly detailed and symbolic plot (predatory behavior) focuses mainly on the relationship of the couple and their reasoning for their actions, which finally shows us the gnarled developments that led to their fall. The plan opens like a wound that never heals properly, due to Daulton's drug addiction, which really makes him go overboard and leaves Chris to recover from everything. The searing political aspect is there, but it focuses on the themes of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to express their point of view. Both do not mix and the results are shown. The suspense is justified through its stimulating cooking pot sequences and the interactions of the characters that of any visual trick. The action is very small, but there is still a style induced by the pressure in the safe and dark direction of Schlesinger. Most stimulation is handled well, although it seems that some sequences accumulate for too long, but nevertheless, it catches you as it reproduces in its authentically paranoid tone and slowly builds up until it reaches a final extreme. Adequately incorporated into the technical production is an incredibly heartbreaking music and a professionally moving cinematography. The cast is exceptionally good with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also look for Michael Ironside in a small part as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> An outstanding spy film mostly benefiting greatly from the performances of talented leaders and from not playing the usual stakes. It is more an emotional walk, then a complex of turns. Recommended.
