I think this movie is different from most of the movies I've seen. In a way it was exciting, and no matter what others say, I say, I was surprised by the final solution. I certainly did not see it coming! Although it's sad, it's worth seeing ... I can not think of any movie that is like that! The actors knew what they were doing. If you say that this movie sucks, you probably say what most people would say. But, if someone says that this movie is normal, I do not agree. And Norman Reedus should be more noticed. <br /> <br /> It may be a phenomenon, but I liked it a lot. It was kind of a disaster, but who cares? I'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
