A group of cats seeks to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler. <br /> <br /> Aristocats is considered one of Walt Disney's best 2D animations with its charming script and great characters, but it does not. It has all the magic that Snow White or the Jungle Book created. <br /> <br /> The slow opening will make the younger viewers raise their eyebrows, but once the cats settle into the story, the fun and entertainment begins. <br /> <br /> Young cats create the greatest enjoyment with a charming and lively rivalry, the special kind of bonding that any brother or sister of any age can associate. <br /> <br /> It's not the funniest Disney image there, but there are some great comedic moments, especially with cats and dogs. The representation of gangster cats is very impressive and equally fun. <br /> <br /> The story, after the boring start, is very entertaining and is exactly what a family movie should be. There are almost no lapses or boring moments. The trip to find a home is interesting and you have a feeling of exploration, not to mention two very strange British swans. <br /> <br /> With Disney, you always receive a significant and meaningful message. With the Book of the Jungle is where you belong, with Bella and the Beast you explore the importance of inner beauty. However, with this image of 1970 it seems that something is missing. The film has the importance and relevance of the home, but it is not sufficiently consolidated; It seems very outlandish and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My sister and I found it very strange to see this when some of the central characters were expressed by the cast of the Jungle Book. <br /> <br /> Despite This is a bad start and confusion of your preaching message. This is a very fun family movie with a good musical score and some cool and crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to.
