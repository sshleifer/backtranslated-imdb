I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and I watched it countless times. Every time I see it, I can get something else out of that. It is a true testament to want to cling to a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you do not have to be older to keep the past, even young characters, like Charlotte, do not want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with stars such as Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And it's fun to see the next stars before they reach more recognizable movies, like Kevin J. O'Connor (The Mummy) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black and Law & Order: Criminal Intent, one of my favorite shows ). It's just one of those movies that stays with you.
