He plays straight but with a calm intensity that makes him one of the best cops in the history of cinema. Roy Scheider stars in the French Connection of a poor man who has a bit of the same gritty appeal. FC is a better movie, but I prefer to watch it because 1) I think Scheider is great and this is his best movie, and 2) this is the best car chase, one that makes Bullitt look like a cable production (thanks again to Bill Hickman, who actually plays with the driver). It does not hurt that Tony LoBianco stops (again) to play a bad guy. Please, enjoy.
