Thank God, not all the Dutch are so ruthless. I think Jason is being judged that way by most people, simply because he has a famous father. Maybe it's not as good as some of those actors, but it's definitely not as bad as suggested. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie a few years ago, and I really loved it. I met Jason from other movies and, of course, Robin from Sherwood. But I must say that I really liked his performance from this movie. It was really good! <br /> <br /> During the movie, I forgot that I was the son of. Sean ... who? <br /> <br /> And if you are a lover of Shakespeare, I can recommend this movie. I'm sure you'll enjoy it!
