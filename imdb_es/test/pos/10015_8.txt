Even if you are a fan of the idiosyncratic work of Jean Rollin, this exceptional foray into the territory of science fiction will surprise you. For once, there is not a single vampire in sight! True to tradition, the budget proved too tight to fully understand the director's vision. However, this is largely compensated for by his evident love for genre films, dedication to his craft and pure ingenuity. The atmospheric cinematography of Jean-Claude Couty takes full advantage of the follies and Philippe Bréjean (a / k / a "Gary Sandeur") provides a surprising soundtrack that, fortunately, does not look like any of the sappy things he composed for hardcore . <Br /> <br /> Shot in and around a block of Paris offices before and after working hours, the film was largely screened with the film's regular customers Rollin was already quite familiar with his efforts of XXX "Michel Gentil", especially in French The cinematic royalty of ck Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding leadership. Playing Elisabeth (pretty well, I might add), one night she picked her up wandering on a nearby highway by Robert (Vincent Gardère), driving home at the end of a long day at work. Barely able to put together the chain of events that took her there, Elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after the events, even forgetting the name of Robert and the role of heroic savior before he finishes his night flight in his apartment. Before making love, she describes herself as a virgin (more credit to Brigitte's theatrical abilities than she can handle the line so convincingly, being after all one of the most active adult actresses of the 70s) because he can not remember a single touch. preceding his. Due to this ingenious little context, the relatively long sex scene that follows completely avoids the gratuity of other "commercial" interludes that Rollin had to include in other works to ensure financing. <br /> <br /> When Robert goes to work, it is unavoidable erased from the weak mind of Elisabeth. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau actually launched against the guy) and his menacing assistant Solange (porn star Rachel Mhas) approached her during the absence of her protector and took her back to where he seems to have escaped. Here we get one of the film's strongest scenes when she is presented again to her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner to / k / to the unconditional performer "Cathy Stewart" in a silent and devastating turn), both girls They desperately supply fictitious shared "memories" for each other in an attempt to overcome their inevitable fate. That deterioration is not limited to the fact that the mind becomes painfully clear when lunch is served and Catherine can not control her movements when trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It is also Catherine who expresses the filmmaker's commitment to the demands of commerce, since she exhorts Elisabeth to undress and embrace her because sex is all that is left now that both the mind and the physical faculties have abandoned them. <br /> <br /> Several quite explicit sex scenes, if not quite hard, make up the central section of the film and French film fans should recognize people like Alain Plumey (a / k / a "Cyril Val "), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage, together with the blink of an eye of the future porn princess Marilyn Jess, whose rape on Plumey's hands, mouth and member was only present in the XXX version of the film, rarely projected , FILLES TRAQUEES. The fundamental part of Véronique, a girl that Elisabeth almost seems to remember and with whom she tries to escape again, is very well handled by the exquisite Dominique Journet, in her unforgettable debut, which would continue to play an important supporting role in Franco's LA Zeffirelli. TRAVIATA. The six feet below the end reveal that the deteriorated condition is the result of a nuclear spill, quarantined "patients" that finally leave an empty shell that barely breathes and that is unceremoniously eliminated in a furnace of fire. The final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation in relation to Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth, who is approaching full fusion by now, and a wounded Robert stumbled along the railroad bridge, clumsily clutching his outstretched hands to each other.
