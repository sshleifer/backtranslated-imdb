I recently bought "The Big Trail" {1930}. It is an incredible movie, incredible. I knew it by reputation, but I never expected it to be so magnificent. My version is the only one in 35 mm and I'll talk about that later. When one thinks of the western myth in the movie, the names that come to mind are John Ford and John Wayne. Well, you only have half the team here, but the whole Myth is present. Raoul Walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the real argument is the struggle of the westward expansion of the nation. <br /> <br /> There is a plot centered on a romance between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill} with the main villain, Red Flack played memorably by Tyrone Power, Sr. But this has almost an Incidental Quality while the train of wagons fights incredible obstacles, both natural and human. Some examples are crossing the river, the battle of India and crossing the burning desert. The consequences of the battle receive a somber touch when a doll is placed in the grave of a dead child while a faithful dog lies down in the grave of his master. <br /> <br /> Magnificent panoramas are full of energy and activity. The opening scene as the train of wagons prepares to depart, the interlude of Square Dance and the large herds of Buffalo are some of those that come to mind. It makes a wonderful use of location shooting throughout. Another feature of this splendid film is the fact that men and women are given the same credit for their parts in the great struggle to the west. Women work, struggle and face the terrible difficulties with the same strength and strength as their male counterparts. The ending has a powerfully uplifting experience when Coleman and Cameron meet in the giant Sequoia forest to start their new life. <br /> <br /> The acting is quite acceptable at all times. I have already mentioned the stealing performance of Tyrone Power scenes. Tully Marshall is excellent as Coleman's partner, and Marguerite Churchill portrays convincingly a woman who develops an inner strength when she finds her own problems, as well as those external to herself. The comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are not common and are involved in the tremendous sweep of the film. <br /> <br /> I've read a lot of criticism about Wayne's performance? even going so far as to blame his "wooden performance" for the failure of the film at the box office. I think this is unfair. Wayne was in his first major role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in "Stagecoach". But he still does useful work in a role that will undoubtedly play a secondary role in the grand overall theme. After "The Big Trail", Wayne played in a large number of low budget B Westerns. I have several of these and one can see the actor developing in them. When "Stagecoach" arrived, he was ready for it and "The Big Trail" was an important part of that learning. <br /> <br /> I mentioned earlier that my version is the only one in 35 mm. It's still impressive, but to get an idea of ​​the effect of the 70mm version, I set the TV screen to 16: 9, which does not cause distortion. While it did not have the full effect of the Grandeur version, it was good enough that he wanted to get the latter. {In addition, the film shot on 70 mm has some additional scenes that are not made for ordinary theatrical shows}. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie deserves to be on any list of the best Westerns ever made.
