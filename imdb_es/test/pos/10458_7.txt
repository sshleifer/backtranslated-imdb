The film begins almost painfully, a "romance" (yawn) that seems to wander in the course (the whole part of the plan ...) Then, about an hour after this solemn movie is The Feast. It is worth paying attention to that first hour. The party is still solemn, but humorous. Suddenly, the retired and slightly petty characters come alive, and everyone (you and the characters) is feeling enriched by the experience. <br /> <br /> Women will love this. Christians of all kinds will enjoy the deep faith demonstrated by the characters. It's not my favorite movie of all time, there are no dinosaurs or lasers, after all, but it's definitely a movie that I'm glad to have seen. You can not lose this. <br /> <br /> Jim
