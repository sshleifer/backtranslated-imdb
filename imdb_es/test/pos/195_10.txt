Unlike the many that have posted here, I am not understood in movies. I stumbled across this movie by accident (navigating the channel), and could not navigate far. This is a really incredible movie, worthy of all the praise that the critics and those on this site have fulfilled. The actors are great. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. His fianc√© Boris is sweet and patriotic. He could not help but feel the exasperation and pain of Boris's father when he rebuked his son for nonsense like volunteering to serve in the great war. <br /> <br /> Others have summarized the film so well, so Solo mentioned a couple of scenes that moved me more. When Boris's brother reveals to his family that his trust with his brother has been broken and he "has to marry" Tatiana, Tatiana's crooked mouth shows her repulsion at this betrayal (although her part in infidelity may have been a violation). You fear that the rest of the film could correct this error by visiting Tatiana and her brother, or, worse, Tatiana, destroyed by an immoral descent to the decline of cigarette smoking. As this is not the "French existential cinema", the latter does not happen. Thankfully! <br /> <br /> Another scene that tears your heart is when the anonymous "musician" soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris's father about the death of his son. He, without knowing it, gives the news to Tatiana. I can not describe the pain of this scene ... Even so, Tatiana finds that there is something to grab and wait for Boris to return home. The musician never really saw Boris buried, after all. <br /> <br /> I will not mention more scenes, but I want to note that the touches of Soviet political correctness did not affect the film at all. Boris's brother is revealed as the piano playing a Soviet bum that someone who steals the future wife of his brother would have to be. There is no doubt that you get at least one "tenner" at the end of the movie! The end, when Tatiana finally learns with certainty that Boris is dead, still manages to finish with joy and hope for the future. You do not even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept the theater when the survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, saw this movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Incredible. Go see it.
