The evil Professor Moriarty plans to gain control of SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE ARMA SECRET that could win the war for the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return to the screen as the beloved detective and lord Arthur Conan Doyle Comrade Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in this entertaining and small mystery. Universal Studios did not waste money on sophisticated production values ​​or a sensible script, knowing that its two stars would be all the attraction that an audience would need. In fact, Rathbone, like the cerebral ego, and Bruce, like clumsy identification, seem to really become the characters they're creating, happily keeping their faces straight while engaging in absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as the stubborn Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard; Together with Bruce, these two good-hearted but pedantic friends actually manage to save Holmes's life intellectually superior twice. Lionel Atwill, a master of the sinister who deserves more recognition for his talent, does a good job as Moriarty, making the evil rogue an enemy worthy of Holmes's steel, enjoying the scenes in which he can inflict torture and pain. <Br /> <br /> William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne play the Swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are at the heart of the mystery, but do not have much to do. The sweet Mary Gordon makes a symbolic appearance as the lady of Holmes's house, Mrs. Hudson. <br /> <br /> Rathbone spiced up his already classic interpretation of Holmes by appearing three times in disguise during the story, revealing to the viewer that The Great Detective was a ham actor in the heart. <br /> <br /> This film, which is based very loosely on elements from Sir Arthur's short stories 'The Dancing Men' and 'The Empty House' - followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE OF TERROR (1942) and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON (1943).
