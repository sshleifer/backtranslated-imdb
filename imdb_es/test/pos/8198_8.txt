This is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of China in the third century BC. What makes it interesting is the tragic fall of the king and all the palace intrigue that happens around him. It reminded me a little of "King Lear" and some of Shakespeare's other works. <br /> <br /> The king begins with noble ambitions, to unify the kingdoms under a single ruler and stop all fights so that the people can prosper and lead a better life. He and his childhood girlfriend, played beautifully by Li Gong, invented a plan according to which she intends to go into exile in a rival kingdom to recruit a murderer to kill the king, thus giving her a pretext to go to war. But while she is absent, the king becomes sadistic in his desire for power and goes on a wave of murders. <br /> <br /> There are numerous side frames that hold the action. There is the Marquis, who pretends to be stupid and stupid, but who is really very smart and wants to become king. He begets two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it a secret for years. Then there is the Prime Minister, a political rival of the king, who happens to be really his father. <br /> <br /> The killer is a complex character in itself. An adept swordsman and murderer, is undergoing a reform when the king's lover comes to recruit him. He does not want anything more to kill, but he is finally conquered by Li Gong (who would not be?) When he sees how cruel and cruel the king has become. <br /> <br /> A spectacular cinematography, especially the battle. Scenes that are carried out on a large scale, as they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally. The acting is fine, nothing special. It is the story that is interesting, although in more than two and a half hours, it pushes the limit. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
