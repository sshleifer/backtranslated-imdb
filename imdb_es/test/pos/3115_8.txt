The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: Henry King's 'The Gunfighter' and John Ford's 'Wagon Master'. 'The Gunfighter' was historically remarkable, as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist Westerns. <br /> <br /> However, personally, I find 'Wagon Master' superior to its contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece does not have much to do with telling stories; it should be thought of more as a poem describing the conceptions of the old west. Although we are optimistic and warm of heart, we are deserved by our naivete because it is completely free of pretentious underlining. The border landscape is very used because it perfectly supports the poetic narrative. Add naturalist camera work and we will transport ourselves among Mormon travelers to witness Western folklore explained in film media.
