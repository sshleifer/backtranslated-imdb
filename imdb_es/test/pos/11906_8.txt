The movie was better than I expected. I was working on the set of the movie for a short period of time when Damien was making this movie. The firearm, the trick and the acting went pretty well on the editing board. Better music would have this movie. Some of the sounds of music are like those of the hippies. Damien remembers that you have gang violence, some gang members or hip hop would have done it. It was more realistic than blood in blood. The cast was chosen very well. The viewer did a good job in this movie. The film brought back a lifestyle that I usually live. But in the end you do not always win. And in my story, that's how it was. I adapted to the movie the first time I saw it. Damien Congratulatoins in this movie.
