This is a Hollywood movie. The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. This movie will not change the world. However, it is well done, well laid out and well acted, which counts a lot. <br /> <br /> It's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former CIA assassin who feels betrayed by chasing. a Secret Service agent who protected John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. The agent has been understandably worried about this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the film begins in 1992, or indeed in contemporary America, this would-be assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich on a spooky force tour where he gives a transformative performance) has been consumed by frustration and anger and decides that he will assassinate the President. He imagines that he has a common cause with Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood for his coldness, calmness, moody good humor) who believes he should hold a grudge like he does because the Warren Commission blamed Horrigan (unfairly) , Leary believes that For the assassination of President Kennedy. The tension is increased through some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary that want to keep Horrigan close but not to betray their location and their plans. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is excellent as Lily Raines, a fellow agent with whom Horrigan develops an adult relationship. It's nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Russo is considerably younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm and capable agent who can go face to face with the Horrigan of quick intelligence in friendly jokes. It's a good part for Russo, which allows her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the older man's predetermined romantic interest. The performance of the protagonists, the competent direction of Wolfgang Peterson, the careful use of music in the development of the plot and the excellent photography make this a film that I can see again and again.
