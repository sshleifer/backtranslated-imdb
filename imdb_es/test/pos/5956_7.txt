Recently I saw him at the International Film Festival of Palm Springs in 2007, where he ended up being one of the favorites of the audience. This is a parody in the French industry of the OSS 117 movies of the 50s and 60s. The first OSS 117 movie based on the Jean Bruce novel was shown on the screen in 1956, long before the first James Bond movie , starring Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six action espionage movies and subsequent adventures were made until 1970 Luc Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven take turns as Oss 117. Jean Dujardin is in the lead role in This comedy of the series. When the film begins to be released in 1945, he has a French mustache and looks like Desny, but when the movie starts, it is set in 1955, it really looks like Sean Connery. Jean Fran√ßois Halim wrote this hilarious script of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It is inspired by the stupidity of Naked Gun, Get Smart and the Pink Panther and uses fresh humor in current events in a charming combination that international audiences will enjoy and I am sure that this will be the first of the most out of an OSS renovated. 117 reworked to adventure comedy. Michel Hazanavicius directs. I would give this a 7.5 and I would recommend it.
