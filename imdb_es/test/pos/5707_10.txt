As a resident of Western Pa for a long time, I have an intimate knowledge of this subject and I thought it was ENCANTO that it was captured so authentically in the film. Congratulations to the producers of this epic! And what a great legacy for the children of the school in the coming years. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail and the realistic description of this complicated network of events make it a unique production. <br /> <br /> Spectators will be fascinated by the story and captivated by the narrative. <br /> <br /> Grahame Greene is great as a presenter. <br /> <br /> BRAVO !!!
