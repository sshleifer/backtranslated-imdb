I must say that one big reason why I thought AristoCats was so cool is because I love cats. I love cats, which probably gave a great score to this movie, but not only that, it was definitely a good movie. well, and I love where the movie set is made. This is one of my favorite animal films, although it is animated, and I really love how the actors and actresses did not sound so unprofessional behind the animal voice. For me, this movie seems a classic, but I think that for IMDb it is not, because yes, I think I think it's too low a grade. Take a look at all the other "ORIGINAL" movies from Disney and have a much higher rating. But AristoCats is one of the best animated films that exist and I could enjoy them again and again!
