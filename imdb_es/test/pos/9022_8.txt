I love this movie. I saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and I had to rewind it so my sister could see it. This movie is very funny. There are two times that I laughed so much that my sides hurt. I did not expect to see such a funny movie; I really just wanted to see him because Laura Fraser is in him. I saw her for the first time on Titus, which is also an impressive movie. <br /> <br /> As other critics have said, many people expect a moving film. You will not get it. What you will get is humor, goodies and the opportunity to ask yourself exactly what your perfect partner would look like if you could create them. You can also ask yourself what it would be like to be trapped in the body of the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> A hilarious sequence implies that Justine sees herself as a naked man. I was laughing. <br /> <br /> I swear, this movie is the most imaginative teen movie I've seen and now it's my favorite. <br /> <br /> Just remember why the movies were originally created; As entertainment, not philosophy in movement. Remember this and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality.
