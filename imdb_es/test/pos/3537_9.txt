Obviously inspired by Se7en and, sometimes, even more frightening; More bloodshed and very graphic details (a little too much for my liking). Great script and acting (Ken Stott impressed me especially and there were no weaknesses in the cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen for years. Although I was scheduled on the BBC in three parts, I saw the Messiah on video in one shot. A point of criticism; The villain's motivation was not very convincing.
