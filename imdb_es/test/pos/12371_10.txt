The masterpiece of Victor Sjostrom's silent film, The Phantom Carriage, has recently been released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL. The duo, composed by American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian portable computer artist Peter Rehberg, has created an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original images of the 1921 film. An ominous sound hits every act and a mix of drones, guitar chords. and the feedback comes and goes as the dramatic drama unfolds. <br /> <br /> Despite how impressive the new soundtrack is, the film remains the true star with its timeless interpretation of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this account, the last person to die before midnight on New Year's Eve is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the ghost car of the same name, picking up the souls of the dead. This is the fate of the film's anti-hero, David Holm, who is subjected to a painful scrutiny of his life after his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the car driver. <br /> <br /> This film is often referred to as a horror movie and although this is a proper label, the real horror here is not in the supernatural elements, but in the representation of human suffering at the hands of others. Sjostrom offers a remarkable performance as the drunken, evil and threatening Holm in life, and the miserable and frightened Holm, who looks back from the land of the dead and withdraws from his past deeds. <br /> <br /> Surprising images abound throughout The Ghost Car and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. The bad omen beginning at midnight is illustrated powerfully through the image of a clock face floating alone in the dark sky like a second moon. Equally shocking, the dead are depicted through pseudo-semitransparent images and the scenes of the phantom chariot traveling by land and sea are still chilling to see. <br /> <br /> Sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent ones. The films of all time and the new soundtrack of KTL is an excellent accentuation of their themes. This is a must see.
