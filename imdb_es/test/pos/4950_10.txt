The classic "top gun" or "independence day" is not too important when it comes to the excitement of the fighter plane. Yes, the film from top to bottom is based on a truly fictional example of how someone can achieve a rescue, but it's great because it breaks all the traditional rules. The child doing what he wants to do in a jet the way he does. <br /> <br /> I can not really say what I love about this movie, but others I know who saw The movie feel the same as me. I think it's basically very funny, but maybe too unrealistic for some to buy it. <br /> <br /> Again, in spite of everything, I loved it, the people I know saw it, I loved it, so it's definitely worth it. See to make your own decisions about it. Put in this way, I thought Top Gun was one of the best fighter pilot movies in history and I like this movie as much or more than Top Gun. Do not miss it, yes you see it, a really inspiring movie.
