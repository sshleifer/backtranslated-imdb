First of all, let me say that I am a big fan of the original Lonesome Dove series and the book on which it was based. I have stopped seeing this sequel for most of the 10 years due to the bad reviews I have heard about it. If Tommy Lee Jones was not playing Cap. Call, I did not see the point. If Larry McMurtry was not involved, why should I care? How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> This is, in many ways, a fitting continuation of Lonesome Dove, perhaps even more than the dark humor of Streets Of Laredo. History, acting, production, cinematography are first class. Of course, the script is not as colorful as Lonesome Dove but it has its moments. And, to my surprise, there are fragments of Lonesome Done in this series; The relationship between July and Clara, completely discarded in the prequel, is presented here almost identical to the book, a very welcome surprise. The story is not all roses, it has its surprises too. By far the biggest surprise is Jon Voight's portrayal of Capt. Call. While it is not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones, his is true and unique to Voight's credit. The cast is fantastic in all areas, and I do not think Rick Schroeder has done a better acting job than in this series. Oliver Reed practically steals the show here, is excellent in a role that makes you worry about his character and you hate him. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you have not done it. Bad reviews, especially because the DVD is so affordable (I have the set of 2 discs for $ 10.99, I can probably find it cheaper). It is not in any way the disappointment that was the Dead Man's Walk (well, it was for me). And MCMurtry was involved with that!
