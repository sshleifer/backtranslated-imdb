This film has a brilliant soundtrack and an excellent performance of some pretty unknown faces. I especially like the bad guy characters from the Welsh port areas who stand out as American rappers who act with force. The jokes between Jip and Koop are great, since they are considered better couples almost as if they were true in real life. I have experienced some of the things in this film and let me tell you first-hand that these people are not acting (especially what you see with Jip and Koop talking and snoring coca cola). Danny Dyer is priceless like Moff, the seller of "party recipes", and he has the funniest lines of the film ... <br /> <br /> "I'm happier when I'm out of my feelings about the music, you understand me ... Yes, I knew you would not disappoint me, I knew it! "
