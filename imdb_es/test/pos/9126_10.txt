Le Cercle Rouge, by Jean-Pierre Melville, follows the lives of two criminals: Vogel (Gian Maria Volontè), a murderer who gives the police the slip while being transferred from one city to another by train; and Corey (Allain Delon), a thief who just got out of jail. Fate decides to join these two men to achieve a spectacular robbery. In the background there is Matei (André Bourvil), the detective Vogel escapes, implacable in his search and, sometimes, ruthless in his methods. Throughout the film, the viewer encounters other minor but fascinating characters, the best of which is Jansen (Yves Montand), an unfortunate ex-cop and an excellent marksman. <br /> <br /> Melville has a unique style that one does not have. I need to see many of his films to capture. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge are clearly made of the same fabric: the symmetrical angles; the long shots the silences the coats and hats and cigars; the appointments at the beginning; The incredible robberies, fatalism; Criminal life without glamor and without glory. Everything that is great in Melville is present here at its best. <br /> <br /> And his defects did not bother me so much this time: the illogical, disconcerting behavior of his characters and the confusing storytelling, which impaired my enjoyment of His other films, are almost invisible here. Since Le Cercle Rouge preceded Un Flic, that does not mean that it improved over time; maybe I'm just getting used to it more and arrive at a mentality in which it no longer bothers me anymore. <br /> <br /> Melville made unique crime movies. No matter how old they are, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than the modern techno-thrillers in which the great thieves use computer systems and James Bond-esquire devices to perform impossible crimes. Melville's criminals are not great: they are alone, they are socially clumsy and they are probably aware that they are not good for much more than the planning of thefts. They are not wanted by society, they live in the night, always one step ahead of the police in a game that they know they will eventually lose. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly for a movie of this kind, the cops are not complete idiots either. Matei is intelligent, astute, patient and even compassionate. He's not a nasty villain or a cliché, he's just an old man who does his job and does it well. He knows when to use force and when to use brains. Many movies could learn from him. <br /> <br /> It is this simple and unromantic style that makes Melville's films a joy to watch and places him on a special pedestal as one of the great masters of crime.
