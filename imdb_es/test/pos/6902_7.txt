This movie was fun, though on the whole board. <br /> <br /> Basically, it follows the comedy of two grave robbers in the 19th century in England, who go from the conventional outburst to the traffic of vampires, zombies and the dead Roswell. aliens (I have no idea what the Roswell alien was doing there, and neither are the producers, I think.) <br /> <br /> But was it funny? You bet even Ron Perlman, who is often the kiss of Direct to DVD Death, was pretty good at this as a priest who turns out to be the ringleader of a rival gang of body snatchers. <br /> <br /> A real joy to see this small and funny movie, and a good example of what you can do when you do not have egos bigger than life on both sides of the camera.
