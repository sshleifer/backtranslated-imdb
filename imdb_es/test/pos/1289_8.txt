The first director's effort of Christopher Nolan, a year before he did "Memento", and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. He uses time differentials in a similar way to tell his story, and he is very intelligent. <br /> <br /> Bill is this young writer who starts following strangers to see where they live and what they do. all about. One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who changes the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks and confesses what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Cobb is a thief and he takes Bill along in some jobs to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs of some kind and a bond begins to grow between the two. <br /> <br /> But there is a further reason for Cobb to feed this relationship, and everything is linked very intelligently in the end. No, I will not spoil it, but this is a very good movie and I'm starting to think that Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies with surprising endings, this is a must see. watch.
