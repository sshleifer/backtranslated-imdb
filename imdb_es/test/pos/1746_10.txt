Wow. I saw this movie and "Up" the same day with an hour difference in different theaters. I saw "Mr. Bug" first, and then I was totally disappointed with the "Up" tracking. What a beautiful and moving film! The movies of the 1930s and the 40s for us today can be irritating with their melodramatic performance and dialogue, but as an animation, the same melodrama and whining humor can be wonderful. And the soft "organic" lines of the 1930s drawing And the music puts you in a good mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, bugs, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, crickets, and more each with their own nice idiosyncrasies (but not overwhelming). The interaction with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, tall heels, innocent children who play with cans) to those with a good heart and unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. You worry about insects, and Dick and Mary. The protagonist Hoppity is not a perfect superman who comes to "fix things", but a starry-eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path (literally!), And every time you think he'll happily end up in the style of the 1930s, the time comes Another barricade ...! I was on the edge of my seat much more than with "Up." I left the cinema smiling and laughing: something that has not happened in a long, long, long time!
