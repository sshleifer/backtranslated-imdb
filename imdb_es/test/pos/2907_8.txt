It came before "the ten commandments", "the land of the pharaohs", "Ben Hur", and it is overlooked today. How unfair! Based on the gigantic novel by Mika Waltari, it does not cheapen her! Waltari's novel was so huge that only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it's done one day). Waltari, whose message is essentially Christian, remains intact (another of his books, "The Secret of the Kingdom" (first part) takes place after the death of Christ in the Holy Land). <br /> <br /> "The Egyptian" is the emergence of a monotheism close to Christianity long before Christ: the Pharaoh (Wilding) is a kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the real kingdom is not in the material world: ask that it be returned well for evil! And he has disciples, who will eventually become martyrs (the scene in which Simmons and the other worshipers of the Sun God are killed is visually stunning, it looks like a pagan ballet). Priests, on the other hand, this new religion would mean the end of their influence in the population, and that is why they are looking for a strong man (Maduro) who can lead the army against the Hittites, as well as against their dangerous compatriots. Another religion, or no religion we should say, is Sinouhé (Purdom), who for two hours do not believe in anything (the sequence of the grain of sand is absolutely sensational and elevates the whole film well above the average peplum!) <Br /> <br /> There is another fascinating side: the film looks like an extravagant melodrama. only for the script (notably the final revelation of the sister of pharoah (Tierney) that precedes "the ten commandments" for two years), but also the splendor of the cinematography: Viviani, in her book about Curtiz, speaks of an atmosphere Baudelairian, blue and gold. , especially in the scenes that involve the prostitute (Darvi) who contemplates his reflection in the water of his bath, the supreme narcissism. Around the hero, all the characters appear, disappear, reappear, but when they reappear, they have followed their path and all the subplots are combined with an accomplished skill. In addition, as such is often the case in "modern" melodramas, the story is a long flashback, framed by two short sequences that show Sinouhé an old man who is remembering. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful sword and sandals, which had a great influence, not only in America but also in Europe, particularly in Poland, where Jerzy Kawalerowicz directed a fascinating "pharaoh" (1966) that He owed Curtiz a lot.
