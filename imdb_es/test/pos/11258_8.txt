I was not planning to see wasted when I saw the preview of MTV, but since I had nothing better to do or see on a Sunday night, I saw it. <br /> <br /> Wasted was not a Requiem for a Dream, but it was a very good movie considering it was made by MTV. One thing that led me to see it was that Summer Pheonix, the evening sister and wonderful River Pheonix, stared. I guess the talent runs in the Pheonix family because she was good and so is Jaquien although niether is River. Nick Stahl also gives a great performance as a junky jock. There is not much more to say about wasted. It was a dark, depressing, insightful look into the lives of three small-town addicts. I recommend it to those who like the subject. 8/10
