Spunky journalist Holly Hunter produces research news reports for a major news network. She is a crazy nonconformist, dazzlingly good at her job and with little time for romantic relationships. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men competing for your love. <br /> <br /> Brooks is an old-school journalist who adores Holly because he represents all the good things about journalism. Both believe that the means exist to test the gods, educate the public and fight for the truth. Children of the sixties, embody hippie values. They are defenders of the public good. Gentlemen fighting bravely with pen and camera. <br /> <br /> William Hurt, in contrast, is a much more complex character. Initially clumsy, clumsy and self-depreciating, he gradually reveals himself as a great sexy and manipulative winner, expert in climbing the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, it is a symbol of the values ​​of modern media: news as a show, journalism as entertainment, news presenter as a celebrity, truth as the theme of the editing board. We want to despise him and his junk food journalism, but we can not handle it. He is playing the game by his own rules. Do we condemn it for lacking a moral backbone? Do we condemn the game? Can the game exist if its rules are disobeyed? How have these rules evolved? <br /> <br /> This is not the "Network" of Lumet and Chayefsky, so the film never bothers to answer or pose these questions. Content to keep things at the level of light comedy, ends with Hurt being promoted to the London Division and Brooks to a small community network. Holly, having rejected both men, is trapped between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this brave reporter remembers her roots, regrets the loss of Brooks and warns herself to be in the guard of the future William Hurts. <br /> <br /> It's a nice ending, but compared to "Network" The film seems positively trite. Chayefsky's vision is one in which global media, despite their ubiquity, offer less meaningful information. It foresees a world in which globalization has homogenized cultures, information is subject to corporatization and a handful of monopolies of the media control all international news. This is a world in which the truth is subject to meetings of shareholders and economic interests. A world in which the ratings of the viewers determine the content and opinion polls dictate the main stories. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is the reason why "Broadcast News", which yearns for the glorious days of journalism, ends with such a bittersweet note. Know what the future holds. Made in 1987, he has been living for at least a decade. <br /> <br /> But today, in the digital age, things are even worse. Mergers and acquisitions have left a very small number of massive companies that dominate the communication landscape. With this the hyper-commercialization of content has arrived, the barrier between the creative / editorial side and the commercial side has almost collapsed. Nowadays, everyone can start their own blog or website, but these are basic issues. As the communication reach of the individual increases (due to technological progress - email, internet, electricity, air mail, etc.) the size of the individual's world increases in the same way. He must project his voice farther and louder, futilely combating that deafening white noise, the incessant verbal static that is the global community. <br /> <br /> Then, ultimately, you need two things according to the democratic theory. In the first place, it needs a rigorous arrival of people in power and people who want to be in power, both in the public and private sectors. Second, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all the important topics of the day. In a democratic society, the media system as a whole should produce this kind of culture. Unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the needs of democratic journalism and a democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? This is something light, but an ingenious script, some funny moments and a brief cameo by Jack Nicholson, raise it above most other movies about journalism. Interestingly, unlike most films about the media, he never submerges himself in satire and, instead, reproduces things as a love triangle. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
