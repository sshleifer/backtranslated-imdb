"Porgy & Bess" was the first movie my parents took me to see. Even at the tender age of 5 years, I was so moved by the drama that I cried aloud on the screen "Corona, PLEASE, do not take Bess!" I was lucky to see the only TV broadcast of "Porgy & Bess" so many years ago and now all I have are the great memories (and the recording album) to remember this wonderful and wonderful movie. I have been waiting, hoping and hoping that some day I may have a copy of "Porgy & Bess", but it does not seem like it will happen. What is the delay? Obviously, there is enough public interest in this film to justify a release. After all these years, I remember it and it seems that I'm not alone. This movie is full of human emotions: jealousy, lust, anger, courage, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a buried gem that deserves to be brought to light for a new audience to admire and an old audience to enjoy.
