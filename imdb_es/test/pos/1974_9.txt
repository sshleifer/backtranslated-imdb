Yes, I've noticed that there are another 347 comments, I think it's a good sign for a movie, even if some are negative. I've seen this movie 2 and a half times. I adore it and I would see it again. He is very intelligent, but I can understand why some people would hate him. They do not get their appeal. Yes, I have a strange taste in movies, but this is a great movie. Some of the lines are so fast, like the whole scene in the Chinese restaurant. I started to die laughing. That and when I was on the assembly line talking to the contact. Jude law was wonderful, although it was funny, he was trying to hide his wonderful accent. Anyway, I do not consider myself the goddess of the movie as some critics of this film and if you have nothing better to do than write reviews of pseudointelectal films about movies you hate online, I'm sorry for you. Why do not you write about movies that you like, like me? I love how everything comes together, it keeps you guessing, even if you guess wrong. The ending was interesting, and not exaggerated. It was purely intelligent. I would not compare it with the matrix, because I think people have the wrong idea. I entered this movie without expecting anything except Jewish law and science fiction. I was amazed. I have no idea of ​​any other Cronenburg movies, but I love this on its own merit. Another smart thing was the omen with the dog. Definitely watch this movie.
