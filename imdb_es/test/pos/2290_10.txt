Remake the 1992 Oscars, and this film could be nominated, or even win. It was SO good at capturing his time and dual cultures that he belongs to the American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what life was like here or there, this movie will show it to you. As an American, you will feel like you are accompanied by a long vacation in Japan, and at the end of the movie, you will be a Dragons fan, as you accept the injection of Japanese tradition and culture into your baseball. , just as we have done with our culture in our own game. <br /> <br /> Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a slugger of the Detroit Tigers who is falling and getting old and is being traded to the Dragons, a perennial runner up to the Yomuri Giants dynasty, Japan's response to the Yankees. The Giants are admired for their success, but that success also makes everyone want to overcome them, something that is rarely done. The manager of the Dragons recruits Jack as the final piece of the winning pennant puzzle, and we are left with what could have been Gung Ho on a baseball field, but instead it was much more. <br /> <br /> The casting was outstanding: Selleck proved that with a good script and a character that adapts to him, he can take a movie like he did with his television show, and the Japanese cast was just as good , even Mr. Takagi from Die Hard as the conscious owner of the image. The other actors, including the one who interprets the love interest (also the daughter of the manager), are strong and independent, but at the same time they believe in Japanese traditions, beyond what was imposed on them. She is a suitable and supportive girlfriend for Jack. Even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathizes with Jack for what he endures of her, and a little relieved that he at least knows the man she has chosen to love. <br /> <br /> The baseball scenes are great, immensely reinforced by a pre-famous Dennis Haysbert as another ex patriate American and Jack's western mentor. The usual elements of fish out of water are there, and you can almost feel stumbling with Jack to adapt to a country that does not speak our language and does not practice our ways, but copies everything we do. , including our national pastime. One of the funniest scenes happens when Jack, grabbing a magazine, informs his manager that he has learned the tradition in Japan, where you can get drunk and scold your boss, and can not be used against you, and exercise that right. with much humor The plots and subplots are well tied at the end, but not too neatly, and nothing concludes unreal. <br /> <br /> Call this a comedy is wrong: it is a pure comedy-drama, or even a drama with good humor. The plot is too deep to dismiss as critics did as an actor outside of their league who was trying to carry a lightweight film. The situations were fun, but instead, in a much more serious, profound and precise details, resulting in one of the best movies I've seen in my life. The cinematography of baseball competes with that of For Love Of The Game, for realism. <br /> <br /> Some say the movie is about baseball or about Japan, but more than anything it seems to be about the workplace and how people come to work from totally different backgrounds, with different agendas, and from Somehow you have to set aside your differences for the good of the company or the team. <br /> <br /> A really great movie that should never have had to apologize for itself as it did when it was in theaters.
