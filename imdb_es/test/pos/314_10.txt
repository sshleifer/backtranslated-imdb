I've lost count of how many times I've seen this movie. I have never tired of that since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and performed on many levels. they just do not make movies like this anymore. <br /> <br /> After recently watching the fascinating documentary about the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness: a journey of filmmakers to madness), I am even more amazed that this film was even finished, but by itself alone is so fantastic. <br /> <br /> The fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungle of the Philippines is the biggest asset of the movie. You really feel like you in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> All the actors are fantastic, with my favorites being Robert Duvall ("I love the smell of napalm in the morning!") Martin Sheen, and the great Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> Many people complain that the film becomes too cloudy, weird and cerebral near the end. Well, remember what Coppolla said about this movie: "This movie is not about Vietnam, it's Vietnam!" What he means is that this movie is about madness and not about war. <br /> <br /> This film is based on the story "Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad and opposes the Vietnam War instead of the Civil War. War as in the book. I think it was a brilliant combination in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect, challenging, dark, violent, sometimes humorous and well done film in every possible way. <br /> <br /> a true classic <br /> <br /> rating: 10
