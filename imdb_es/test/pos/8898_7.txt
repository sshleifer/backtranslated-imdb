I do not pretend to be a big fan of Asterix, I had only seen another adaptation of the movie and read only two of the comics, but this was an excellent movie, anyway. I only saw the English version, and I found that the voices combined perfectly with the characters: Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin as Justforkix especially. The story itself was interesting and really fun (especially the names of contradictory names: all the names of Vikings end in "af", while all the names of the Gauls, of course, end in "ix"), with a little of romance thrown in that (However, I did the story, even though it weighed on the overall production with unnecessary clichés. <br /> <br /> The plot is this: the Viking boss, Timandahaf, is fed up of going to He then consulted his "wise man," Cryptograf, whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs, and Cryptograf tells him that "fear lends wings to the villagers." Taking this literally, Timandahaf believes. that fear actually allows people to fly, and embarks on an expedition to recover the "Champion of Fear", an expedition that, of course, takes him to the village of Gaulish where Asterix and Obelix live. <br /> <br /> The couple is currently You are very frustrated: you have been entrusted to the cowardly and pacifist nephew of the Vitalstatistix boss, Justforkix, so that they can train him to be a man, and the boy is not progressing. When Justforkix confesses without knowing that he is "afraid of everything" in the presence of Viking Olaf, he is believed to be the "Champion of fear" and is kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix are sent by Vitalstatistix to go rescue Justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son home. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is a great movie with few defects in addition to clichés and, sometimes, faulty dialogues. I enjoyed it very much, even though I was not faithful to the comic.
