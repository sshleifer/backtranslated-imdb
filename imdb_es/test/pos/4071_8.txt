If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you almost know what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. And even if you have not seen the previews, it will not take you long to discover what awaits you, specifically, a good time and lots of laughs, from this clever satire of 'Reality TV' shows and films' Buddy Cop ', `Showtime', directed by Tom Dey, starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a detective from the Los Angeles Police Department, and he's good at doing it; But one night, working on a case, things go south when another policeman, Trey Sellars (Murphy), intervenes inadvertently, a television news team appears and Mitch loses his temper, resulting in a demand from the television station that will cost the Department a few big dollars. Except that they may be able to get around it, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what he sees in Mitch, enough to present an idea to his boss for a police program "Reality". that would be nothing less than Mitch Preston, whom Chase sees as a "dirty Harry" in real life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Your boss likes the idea and gives Chase a green light. Now all he has to do is convince Mitch to participate, which should not be too difficult, since the station has agreed to abandon the demand if he is going to do the show. But Mitch is a policeman, not an actor, and he wants nothing to do with anything like that, that is, until he has a sincere relationship with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who puts Mitch's future in the shortest perspective for the And so, the show is on. Oh, yes, there is one more thing; For the show, Mitch is going to need a partner. And who do you suppose that will occur to you? Let's put it this way: Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects. <br /> <br /> This is Dey's second film as a director, his first is "Shanghai Noon", also a comedy, and he's definitely showing an inclination for the genre. From the initial frames, it establishes a rhythm that makes history continue to advance, and allows its stars to take full advantage of their respective personal strengths and talents, including their impeccable timing. With stars like De Niro and Murphy, Dey, of course, had an advantage in this project, but he is the one who keeps him on track, showing that he knows what works, achieving the right combination of physical comedy and Action, and employing the subtleties of dialogue with great effect. <br /> <br /> There is no more natural actor in the business than De Niro, and he gets into Mitch's shoes as if he were born. And after years of hard and cutting dramas (in which he achieved a remarkable performance after another), with films like 'Analyze This', 'Meet the Parents' and now this one, he has firmly established his ability to do comedy, too. Mitch is not an especially complex character; it is, in fact, something like a "normal" type, but that is the challenge for the actor: to make him credible, to make him look like the guy who could be his neighbor and just another member of the community. And in all aspects, De Niro succeeds. He is Mitch, the guy you meet at the grocery store or the bank, or say "good morning" to go to work; Who likes to watch the game on television and has a life, like you and me, who makes a living as a policeman. It is the character that Mitch has to be to make this movie work, because it makes the "normal boy in extraordinary circumstances" angle credible. It is one of those roles, and work, that is often discarded in the wrong way because it seems very easy; and, of course, this is what makes De Niro so exceptional: it makes it look easy, and he does it with ease. <br /> <br /> While Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy becomes a winning performance, like Bueno, and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove. Trey is a cop, but he is also an aspiring actor, and a bad one, and gives Murphy the chance to play the overly exuberant side of his personality (however, Dey reigned long enough to prevent it from firing). -the top in the territory of Jim Carrey, which works perfectly for this character and this movie. From his melodramatic interpretation of a part during an audition, until his expulsion of a single line, delivered looking directly at the camera (which, as far as he is concerned, is not even there) while filming the reality show. Murphy is a mutiny. And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, since this is one of De Niro's many talents - his ability to connect and get the best out of his castmates, all of them: the evidence the support is better in his craft after working with him, including Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, just to mention a few.Most importantly, this is a part that allows Murphy to excel in what he knows best Do, and certainly make the most of it. <br /> <br /> Russo makes the most of his role as Chase, a character that artistically is not a very large stretch, but who she presents deliciously, with a strong and credible performance And William Shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals a couple of scenes as director of the show. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday ( Camera Man.) Well designed and delivered Ado, 'Showtime' is a comedy that is exactly what it should be: pure entertainment that provides lots of laughs and a couple of enjoyable hours that will make you laugh for a while. It is the magic of cinema. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
