I saw this movie purely by chance. He was very late, or more accurately, very early one morning on television. I woke up and was having trouble falling asleep and this movie went on. <br /> <br /> This is a topic dealt with many times elsewhere (it's certainly not as good as Educating Rita, despite a couple of extra turns) and has a very predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious shortcomings, I enjoyed the film and this was due to the performance of some of its players instead of the story or the piece as a whole. . <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Sam Neil and I've seen him in many different movies, including: Dead Calm; The piano; Sirens; Children of the revolution; Horizon of events; The bicentennial man and the ubiquitous Jurassic park. It was very good, but I could have interpreted this part with my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances were, in my opinion, the terrible Rose Byrne, for example, and some of the elusions were pretty harsh (all the woman on the board in empty lives, all dressed totally in white, for example). <br /> <br /> However, two actors (whom I had not seen or remember before) impressed me very much Sin√©ad Cusackn as Frances (Frank) Kennedy, and especially Matthew Newton as his son David. He, in particular, was very convincing and I would like to see much more of him.
