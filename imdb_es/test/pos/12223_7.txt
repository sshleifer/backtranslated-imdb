I like the program, but the writers to come, do something about it! Stop dragging it again and again. You have a great concept and it could be much more. Miles (Jenkins) is great and behaves like a child whose age should act in the situation in which he finds himself. Hey, be creative with the creatures, they can have telepathic abilities or other extravagant powers. The children actors of the series are very good and convincing. The parents of Miles seem to be too out of touch as to what is happening, but develop this, come on! You have a great seed here and there may be a new twist for next season with many new characters and creatures and all kinds of science fiction stuff. If you could do a series about a witch, then you should be able to make one about these creatures and children.
