This is pretty good for the 'what if' variety movie. As in, what would happen if the terrorists exploited a "dirty bomb" in a big city, in this case, London? Many people say "we are all ready in case of an emergency" which then reveals that they are not exactly telling the full story. And is someone prepared for something like this? You can bet no. This shows the material for the bombs that are smuggled into the country, the manufacture of the bombs, the secret and the double life that the people behind it carry, etc. It also shows public servants (ie, firemen) who give everything to save people when they are not receiving any help, when the government does not want to send anyone else to the affected area. It also shows how woefully inadequate the "preparations" are for any such event, since the government says it all, but then keeps its mouth open as the tragedy unfolds. And could this happen right here in the old old United States? Well, unless you've been living in caves for the past 20 years, something has already done, up to a point, and do not bet on someone being prepared for something of this nature. This is quite realistic and yes, even scary. It's worth seeing, but I hope nothing like this ever happens. 8 out of 10.
