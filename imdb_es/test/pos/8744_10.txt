I remember seeing this when it was made and I thought it was brilliant at that time. Seeing it for the second time, almost 20 years later, I still think that Traffik is brilliant and much better than the movie from the United States that was based on this drama. <br /> <br /> It should also be seen by all of us who have arrived today. The politicians of tomorrow who think they can win the war on drugs, since the problems raised in this film are as relevant today as they were back then in the late 1980s, and, unless they change their policies, they will be in another 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well written, well done, beautifully acted and superbly filmed. A provocative drama that entertains and reveals some of the harsh realities of drug trafficking.
