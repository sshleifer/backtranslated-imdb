I remember this movie as the other person who commented said. I recorded it, but I wish I had it now only because it had to be one of the worst movies in history. Funny, in a really bad way. I remember that the line of the label on the box was "The definitive frontal lobotomy". I got it from my mother, who received it from a friend at work who said it was the worst / most cheesy movie I had ever seen, so my mother said "Probably my son will love it". and the woman gave it to him just to get him out of his possession. Then I recorded it, which I regret. I also remember that the "corck screw" thing was one of those things that catches the ball ... the yellow cone-shaped things, with a red "button" at the end, and when you hit the red thing, it sends a flying ball . Well, they used it with a crank on one end, and a corkscrew on the funnel. When the killer killed, he was shown advancing with the "weapon" and then they closely cut what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victim's head. I do not know what else to say about this "gem", except that if you like bad movies, there is nothing worse than this.
