Chris Morris' Brass Eye television series has always generated a large number of complaints, both from the public and from the people involved. But, nothing he has done has managed to arouse more controversy than this. The 2001 special of brass eye. Before the much-hyped Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye special held the record for most complaints received about any television program that aired. Special was amazing! Many complaints were expressed by people who did not even see the program! The theme that handled the program turned many heads, but the message was widely misunderstood. The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. This was not a show that made fun of the issue of pedophilia. The show was purely about the media and its presentation of the theme. Morris, is and always will be, a satirist of the media. The idea that the program "mocks" pedophiles and children who have suffered abuse is completely ridiculous! Morris never tries to do either of those things. It simply draws our attention to the overwhelming and often stupid media display surrounding the subject. <br /> <br /> Using many of his established 'Bronze Eye' characters, such as Ted Maul and others, Morris shows how much more than the media outperforms everything on a theme that they themselves created and developed, and the The result is as fun, if not more fun, than anything Morris has done before. Using his proven and proven formula, Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing they are working on a serious documentary. Actually, they are made to look exactly as they are. Delays <br /> <br /> In general, the Bronze Eye Special must be seen to be believed. And, with an opening line, Morris manages to summarize the entire media situation as presented in 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
