I thought the movie was good, but I like to read the real story behind the movies "based on a true story". Does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters on which the movie is based? I have done a complete search on the Internet and can not find any information about this case. All I get is the information of the film and the fact that it is based on a "real story". I find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence immediately in the courtroom, even after such a sincere speech from his brother (the great John Corbett), but in general the story was very exciting. Anyway, if someone knows the real "real story", I would appreciate it if you shared it.
