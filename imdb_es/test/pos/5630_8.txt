I am proud to say that I am a student at UW-Milwaukee, where parts of the film were shot. Yes, I recognize Mitchell Hall, where I took a film class, possibly the same course as his classmate Smith. <br /> <br /> That's where I learned about "American Movie." Our professor told us about it shortly before its launch. To be sure, I was intrigued, but for some reason, I postponed seeing it for several months (it must have worked out pretty well if I was still playing, at least in Milwaukee). <br /> <br /> When I finally saw it, I thought it was an entertaining documentary. It's not a masterpiece, it's too long, but I think Mark's passion and commitment are inspiring. I hope this movie signals the beginning of bigger and better things. Maybe his next "Northwestern" will drive him to fortune. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (of ****) <br /> <br /> 108 min / Posted by Sony Pictures Classics
