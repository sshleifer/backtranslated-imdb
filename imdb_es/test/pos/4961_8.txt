Being a D.B. Sweeney fan, I've been looking for this movie for quite some time. I recently rented the video and found it very nice. I had some really hilarious scenes. The dysfunctional life of some of the characters was disturbing, but I think the film also showed that it is possible to keep your life on the road or get back on track if it has been derailed.
