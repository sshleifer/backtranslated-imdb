Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great television movie for all ages. The film focuses on "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to travel in search of gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What follows is an adventure you will never forget. This television movie was just great. The performance is # 1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush. I recommend this television movie to everyone without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
