Yesterday I saw the movie and I was surprised, but even more so by some of the comments I have read here. One person wrote that it was ambiguous if the torture victim was guilty or not, therefore ... One person wrote that, since he was not a US citizen, therefore ... Some people commented that the people in the Middle East Therefore, they hate us and they want us dead. So, are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who is not a US citizen? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who can hate us and want us dead? Are we saying that, as it is written in the Geneva Convention, the Declaration of Human Rights and the Constitution of the United States of America that "torture is wrong, but torture is less bad than others?" When does "torture" become "right"? That's why this movie is powerful, it's ambiguous, but it's not about torture. Torture is always wrong, and if we are willing to do it, even in the name of justice and "National Security" or "freedom and democracy", then we are wrong and we are evil; We are doing exactly what we accuse our enemies of doing (and we call them "evil" at the same time.) My favorite phrase in the film is "if you do not want to commit, join Amnesty International". Touch the exact subject.
