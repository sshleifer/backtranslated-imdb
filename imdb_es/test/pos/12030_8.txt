Guest of the Future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, the battle between good and evil, all with a small budget, children's actors and some special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn. ;) Kolya "Nick" Gerasimov, a sixth grade student, finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years in the future. Discover an almost perfect, utopian society, where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is friendly and people enjoy everything that technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that lets you read minds of humans and animals. The device can be used for good or bad use, depending on which hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates of Saturn who want to rule the universe try to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of the school boy of the 20th century, Nick. With the hot pirates on their way, he returns to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and fun situations continue as the lucky pirates try to mix with Earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school that Nick attends and demonstrates superhuman skills in physical education class. The problem is that Alice does not know what Nick looks like, while pirates do. In addition, pirates can change their appearance and literally become anyone. (Mmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron had the idea of ​​Terminator ...) Who comes first to Nick, and to Mielophone? Excellent argument, adventures without stopping, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made children's movies like this ...
