Even for the non-opera-loving public, the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by Bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. But as much as opera is now considered a staple in every repertoire of opera houses, the real story of the wild gypsy girl created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845 has never been told, as well as in this film version of the talented Spanish director Vicente Aranda ('Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love', 'Lovers', 'If they tell you I fell', etc.). Incorporating the author of the novel as a main character who seeks the story of Carmen from one of her lovers, José, provides the just advantage to tell the story of this famous gypsy wild lady. <br /> <br /> Carmen (the incredibly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory next to the military station where Jose himself (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is stationed. Carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a factory mate who calls attention to the fact that Carmen is a gypsy, Carmen murders her co-worker and is arrested. José feels physically attracted by the voluptuous Carmen and when Carmen flirts with him, he agrees to let him escape, his reward is the promise of a night of passion with Carmen. Carmen keeps her pact, giving José her first sexual encounter, and José is condemned. His lack of military discipline leads him to lose his rank and be imprisoned for a time, but when he is released, José meets Carmen again, kills an official companion and, with fear, runs to the hills to live with the smugglers. and gypsies that are Carmen's. people. Many incidents occur to prove the passionate bond between the lovers, but when Carmen's true husband is released from prison, the destructive behaviors take control, behaviors that include Carmen's infatuation and romance with a bullfighter and the passion of Carmen and José reach a tragic end. <br /> <br /> A factor that makes history (adapted to the screen by director Aranda and Joaquim Jordà moves so well is the role played by Prosper Mérimée (Jay Benedict): his interrogation of José completes the story Bizet The opera only sketches, the performance is magnificent, the cinematography of Paco Femenia and the excellent musical score of José Nieto contribute enormously to the success of this excellent film.This is a must for lovers of the opera Carmen and a splendid drama of action for: Those spectators who admire historical pieces, Highly recommended Grady Harp.
