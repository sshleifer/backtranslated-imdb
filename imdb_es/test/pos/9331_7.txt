Music videos are often completely ignored in any discussion about movies, and most people consider them a minor art form. While the vast majority are simply eye-catching clips to announce the latest success of a popular performer, a few really rise above the rest, becoming works of art in their own right (anything directed by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is always worth the price. worth seeing). While "art" is not exactly the word I would use to describe Michael Jackson's "Thriller (1983)," it's a hybrid of sympathy and incredibly engaging music, and a scandalously affluent short film that remains surprisingly attractive. 25 years later The thirteen minute music video, the longest and most expensive of its release, was directed by John Landis, a filmmaker with whom I am not very familiar, although "The Blues Brothers (1980)" is a classic. and I heard that 'An American Werewolf in London (1981)' is a super entertaining comedy / horror. <br /> <br /> Whether 'Thriller' really qualifies or not as a music video is certainly a topic of debate, considering its extensive extension (although Jackson improved this effort with the 'Ghosts' of 1997, at 38 minutes} and the fact that the title song represents less than half of the total execution time.The video starts with a short movie inside a movie, while Michael, on a quiet and bright night, reveals to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is "different" from the others, transforming into a horrible werewolf as the night clouds move away to reveal a full moon, while presumably beheading the unfortunate heroine, we find Michael and his girl in the cinema, seeing how this drama unfolds in a horror movie.When the girl is scared, both leave the cinema and start to walk home, moment in which Michael begins to sing the first lines of his last song, "Thriller." However, when a treasure trove of bloodthirsty zombies emerge from the local cemetery (its entrance told in a macabre way by Vincent Price), the situation begins to be interesting. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say why 'Thriller' is considered one of the biggest music videos of all. It can not be simply that the song itself is very funny, and Michael Jackson? Although since then he has become the target of jokes by all comedians for his peculiar personality and his actions? There is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer. Perhaps a decent explanation for the popularity of the film is the incredible amount of work that must have been done; never seen anything like it, and still remains a kind of rarity in the world of music videos. The makeup effects of gruesome monsters were designed by Rick Baker and are surprisingly graphics for a music clip, although everything is done with a good sense of fun. Several moments give rise to a really exciting suspense, successfully capturing the atmosphere of the movies that parody (although always with a cheesy touch in the usual formula). In short, you will never see a zombie movie in the same way again.
