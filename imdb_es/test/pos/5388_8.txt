I can differ from many people in this forum, but I enjoy watching Mind Of Mencia. The reason why I like Mind Of Mencia is that the host is not afraid to say what he thinks or exploit the stereotypes. Carlos Mencia does what we all do with our friends, but we are not willing to admit it and then some. <br /> <br /> Mencia has no problem making jokes about any race, religion, sex or orientation. Although he receives a lot of criticism for this, it is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times. Mencia does not care if she offends someone, but she is not racist and even jokes about her own race. <br /> <br /> The typical format for Mencia's Mind is as follows: there will be an open sketch. Fun of a person or recent event. Mencia then goes out and makes a 5 or 6 minute stop where she talks about various topics. The show then has 2 separate skits divided by ads. In these parodies, Mencia does a variety of things, such as making fun of people, giving her personal opinions with a funny touch, or simply making parodies of people, events or movies. At the end of the program, Mencia goes out for a minute with a final sketch or something else to say. <br /> <br /> People criticize Mencia for exploiting stereotypes and says her statements are too offensive. Carlos only does what everyone thinks of certain races, but they are afraid to say. As for Mencia being offensive, she's just saying what she thinks. I do not find anything wrong with it. <br /> <br /> The show is not perfect. The parodies can not be put together in the best way and, sometimes, Mencia overrides his jokes. For the most part, though, it's a show in which the comedian says what he has in mind, no matter what the consequences are and what comes up in a humorous matter. So, if you're not afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone say what they think and say what you've always wanted to say, then look at Mind Of Mencia. However, if you are easily offended, you should not see this program because you will feel offended or worse, you might even laugh.
