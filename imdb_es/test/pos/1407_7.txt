I found West Point like a nice movie, although I doubt I'll see it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as another nasty and funny young man who has his advantage at the end of the film. It is hard to believe that stardom beckoned to Joan Crawford less than a year after this movie was made, as it sometimes looks quite uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Would apply the comment made by another referring to "Huddle" (1932) by Ramon Novarro to this film as well. There is a great movie waiting to be made here, but something is missing. The backdrop and the integration of the Corps were well used, but I was less involved than I thought. Maybe the character of Haines went too far, or got away with it too much. His "repentance" did not seem genuine enough; And what kind of message sent to run every move in the last minutes of the Army-Navy game? Where is "the Body" in that? He could also have taken the other ten men and let him do everything himself. In addition, I doubt very much that the weak and weak character of William Bakewell has ever a counterpart in real life at West Point. <br /> <br /> Leaving this aside, the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. It is a good look at the daily practices of an honorable institution. Thank God, tradition also means something at West Point, unlike the vague "traditions" of the Ivy League schools, which only half participate these days. <br /> <br /> Regarding the score: it was appropriately martial. But, there was excessive use other than cash drums. Using them to knock on the door, scene transitions, and ALU, as well as in more than half of the scenes, became quite tedious. Rather the visual experience decreased. I was ready to say "I already understand the point". <br /> <br /> With that, enjoy the movie, but do not expect too much emotional involvement.
