Women will like this movie better than men. Of course, women like all romantic comedies more than men, on average. In general, I like romantic comedies a bit, however, I considered this as a 5.5 for the first 50% of the movie and around 6.5 for the next 40% and a 9 for the last 10%. Then, reluctantly, I will grade it with a 7. I recorded and I will keep all the movies with a 7 or better and none that is a 6 or worse, at least that is my goal. I have over 1200 movies, so why stay with the dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife liked this movie a little more than me, although I'm not sure why. I'm more of a Drew Barrymore fan than her. <br /> <br /> The focal point of this film was about a young woman returning to high school (covert) to write a story about the high school experience today. She was an idiot in high school the first time and has to learn to be cool the second time. Your journey to the cooldom, as well as your falling in love with a teacher, is history. <br /> <br /> What drove me crazy during the first half of the movie was how elegant it looked. I wondered why she would be chosen for this role until I realized how capable she is to look like a dog. So much that I really do not think I want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. ARGH! Naturally, she became a pretty attractive woman at the end and became very popular. <br /> <br /> The end is around 9.9 on the very sweet scale, so the chaveros will like that. Otherwise, it is not very easy to remember and memorable.
