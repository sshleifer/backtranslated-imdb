This film is one of the only historical documents that show the talent of so many singers, actors, actresses and black dancers. Many who are no longer with us. Those who have the blessing of being able to enjoy today in 1999, through this film, allow us to recognize the talents that existed then. This is the reason why people who still live today, as well as those who have passed away, are icons of super stars. Due to the educational history in music, drama, filming, design, singing, etc., this film belongs only to the people of this country. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie. The sound was excellent! The film seemed to be complete, the color and clarity were reasonable, but good considering the antiquity of this film without repairs on the frames. I agree with all the previous positive reviews. I have no negative opinion. <br /> <br /> I would just like to make a request. Please, to whom it may concern, make this film available so that everyone can have this historical experience.
