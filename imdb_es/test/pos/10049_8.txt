This is a wonderful film as a movie: it gets an 8 out of 10. Like a piece shot from a precise story ... one wants to be more loving, but it's 5 out of 10. And I think I'm really being very charitable. <br /> <br /> How was he: that man of horse and saber, who was the youngest "child" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended up dying with all his command in the most big Military victory of the North American Indian tribes? Opinionated, militant, clumsy, bloody, ambitious, intelligent, too intelligent, Indian-enemy, Indian-friend (?) And national hero. His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him to a position of fame equal to that of Washington, Lincoln, Jackson and Grant / Lee, and Sherman / Jackson. Only with a growing awareness of the mistakes that were made in his career, the overly ambitious ambition, his reputation declined. However, to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best remembered figure in the military annals of our history to lose his last battle (I really can not think of a similar one, perhaps General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to remain with his men in Bataan). The march of death, but Wainwright survived the march and the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Custer has appeared in more films than many better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn. Too bad the details of the real race were never handled with as much love as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film. But even in 1941 the legend was still powerful. Olivia De Haviland played Libby Custer, who was recently mentioned in another film review on this thread, survived George until 1933, so his effective handling of the story was still valid eight years later. Custer was seen as our errant but brave wandering knight, and with the shadow of World War II approaching more we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have fully understood and approved. <br /> <br /> So we have the opinion that it was a spur, but that it was patriotic. Although he was almost kicked out of West Point for demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year. You see, most of the so-called West Point military talent (from Robert E. Lee below) was Southern, and joined the Confederacy. The Union needed all the "Points" from the north that they could find. <br /> <br /> Custer's Civil War career should be studied more closely: he was linked to the staff of General-in-Chief George B. McClellan, and was himself distinguished in the Peninsula Campaign and other wars of the Eastern front. But he was a cavalryman, and he would rise before the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's friend, Phil Sheridan, in the latter parts of the war. In particular, he performed with great skill and distinction in the battle of Cedar Creek, which put an end to the Confederate threat in the Shenandoah Valley. He also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close friend from West Point, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederation and rose up in a position like Custer: mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur for the last night of his life. the latter). <br /> <br /> After the war, things collapsed. He wanted his brevet - Major Generalship to be permanent (it was not like that, since it was a promotion on the battlefield). They only had one lieutenant colonel to hand him over to the reduced army along the border. He tried to play politics, he made the mistake of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866 and discovered that most northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot. He was supposed to admire the Indians (he was certainly eloquent in writing them and the West), but in 1868 he caused an authentic military massacre of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial. Later, during the 1870s, he would support the claims of the Indians against a group of politicians (who went to the Secretary of War, William Belknap), who bought and sold Indian commercial stands for profit. He ruined Belknap and left a black eye in the Grants Administration. He put him in the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was the former Belknap commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career. Then he was sent to the final Big Horn campaign. And immortality came. <br /> <br /> That race is worth a real movie, but would it be too critical? Should we sustain a man from the 1850s - 1876 to the 2007 standards? Would you like us to do it in a hundred years? Certainly, it could happen, but I'm not sure we like it. <br /> <br /> Custer (style 1941) adjusted to Flynn like a glove, since it offers the action closest to a "dance" in any of His main films. His latest film with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero character. In the support of actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn they did very well as friends, enemies, or even treacherous infractions (Kennedy). As an entertaining piece of myth creation, it is still high, but as a study of a complex military hero is not what it should be.
