Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born in a pastry family in the Bronx. Although the Polonis have been well known for their garments over the decades, the business has gone through difficult times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is one of the most talented dessert creators in Manhattan, but she seems unable to achieve an excellent confectionery position due to the glass ceiling. An accidental meeting between Marco and Grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for both. There is a high-profile bake, The Golden Whisk, which will take place in the near future and Marco wants Grace to be associated with him. There is a lot of "mass", haha, in game for the winners, enough to establish Grace in her own business and save the Polonis restaurant, too. Reluctantly, Grace agrees. But, there are complications. Some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past problems with Grace and Marco. Then, too, although Marco and Grace are attracted to each other, Grace has a very rich and long-standing boyfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the contest? This is a lovely movie for romantics at heart. First, there's the nice cast. Holly has always been a charming actress with a remarkable husky voice that promotes her attractions. In this film, she is perfectly chosen as the determined but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, also delights as the handsome rival baker. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco's mother, is quite nice. Like a Hallmark movie, the costumes, games and production services are irreproachable and the script still looks fresh and fun, despite some familiar themes. Treat yourself, lovers of romantic comedy, to a sweet confection ensuring a visualization of this film. It is definitely the equivalent of a great box of quality chocolates.
