It's hard to know what to do with this strange little Australian crime movie: on the one hand, it's a fun little movie with a great sense of humor. but, on the other hand, it only lacks something that ensures that the film never reaches beyond its limit that keeps it trapped within the merely "interesting" territory. That said, Two Hands is a well-traced film that excellently combines several stories at the same time, allowing for several small climaxes throughout the film, which in turn helps to keep the film from becoming boring. The absurdity of the events, the thick Australian accents and the strange set of characters help ensure that the film is also entertaining. The plot follows the story of a young goalkeeper who believes he will go to bigger things after accepting a job from the area boss. He does not do the job just messes him up when he likes to swim and stupidly leaves ten thousand dollars on the beach, which is quickly stolen by a couple of children who have the time of their lives on a shopping spree. However, not everything is rosy for our hero; who must find the money or face the consequences ... <br /> <br /> The film is composed of a cast of unknowns; at least, it was in 1999, since nowadays Heath Ledger is something like a name. However, here it does not impress much, since its performance is mainly of the variety of a note and it is not a very convincing advantage. He fits in the film because he is Australian and looks naive; But beyond that, it's not the best clue I've seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best performance here. He may not have much time on the screen, but he steals all the scenes he is in and it is he who gives the film a lot of humor. However, it has nothing to do with the best sequence, which takes place in the form of the most hilarious bank robbery ever filmed. In general, I can recommend this movie to people who enjoy extravagant crime movies; since rarity is abundant, and the way in which events give a turn for the strange is pleasant; But if you're not a fan of this kind of movie, I really can not say that Two Hands will float in your boat. It is not a must, but if it is your thing and you have the opportunity to see it ... you probably will not regret it completely.
