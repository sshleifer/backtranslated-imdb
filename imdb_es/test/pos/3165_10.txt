I saw it in Europa-plex. Great movie!! <br /> <br /> This movie is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. The protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an RV difficult to drive across the United States, stopping often to fill his tank full of gasoline. He is middle-aged and confused. He feeds his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio. He is the flesh: agitated and, at times, spaced, quite oblivious to the growing tension that surrounds him, but feeling it like pangs of discomfort. <br /> <br /> The Spirit infuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and happens in the visual field. The Spirit finally collides with the flesh and Kirk falls, unable to understand what has happened to him. He has been denying how bad things have become due to the lack of attitude of all of us, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We are all in the same denial, so we, as Kirk, run the risk of falling and being dragged by the sands of the desert like him.
