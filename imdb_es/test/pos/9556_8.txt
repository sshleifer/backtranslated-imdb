"Best in Show" is an often hilarious simulation that takes us to the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who are preparing for the event. The only thing that separates this movie from the real dog shows is that the dogs in "Best in Show" act healthier than their owners! Fun stuff from a top-notch cast that includes Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the movie), Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Christopher Guest (who co-wrote with Levy and directed). All are fun, but Fred Willard steals the film with his explosively funny performance as the announcer of the dog show that says the most extravagant things. Besides dogs are cute too. "Best in Show" is not exactly the riot of laughter I expected, but there are laughs and it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
