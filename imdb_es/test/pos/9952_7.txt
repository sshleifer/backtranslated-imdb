The merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare portrays the Venice of the sixteenth century. Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish shark who plans to take revenge on a Catholic who has despised him. The film is a slow-moving plot at the beginning that accumulates over more than two hours. The film gives a very good appearance to his characters, especially Pacino. Upon hearing that Pacino plays a Jew, one might think that it would not work looking at Pacino's mafia-type movie roles. However, it works very well, credit must be given to the costume designer and the director of the film. The appearance of all the characters fits well with the period of time in which the work is developed. The costumes resemble the Renaissance appearance that one could imagine being. <br /> <br /> The film presents a very anti-Semitic atmosphere. From the first minute to the last it shows how Catholics try to take advantage of the Jews in everything they can, even to the point of keeping them locked in "ghettos" and not allowing them to do regular jobs. Compared to The Passion of the Christ, another recent film that people believe is very anti-Semitic, Merchant of Venice makes Passion look like a Jewish holiday. The film shows how the Jews, or at least Shylock, wanted revenge for the mistreatment that the Jews received. The location shots also seem to be very timely and the stage is sometimes very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film, which makes it much more realistic. Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be considered anti-Semitic because the ugly is generally shown around the Jews and the beautiful around the Catholics. <br /> <br /> Although the film clearly tries to have a serious aura in certain parts it adds a bit of humor to the act. The very serious test between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a bit of humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) enter the trial and decide who will be the winner and the vanquished. That in itself might not be fun, but seeing that they were women disguised as men, one might find that it is quite fun. The whole cross dressing scene, as convincing as it was, could probably have been even more memorable if make-up artists and director Michael Radford realized that the two women still resemble women and could easily be recognized. The director could also have seen the fact that women speak through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men, which partly moves away from the scene but does not kill him completely. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie gets a 7 out of 10
