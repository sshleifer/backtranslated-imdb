This was an excellent movie with good performance and keeps your attention until the end. Maybe people are tired or uncomfortable with the issue and that is why it is destroying so much. It could also be too deep for many of the viewers who give movies like the American Pie series. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst, not an agent, who must observe an interrogation of an Egyptian man by Moroccans, not Egyptians. It is not supposed to be a hardened agent and, therefore, is presented as naive of the interrogation techniques used. This is more credible than if it had to be an "old hat". <br /> <br /> The story jumps a bit and can be confusing, but it also keeps you focused on what is happening until the end, when everything comes together when the puzzle falls into place. The supporting actors did a good job helping to bring the film. I thought the film was powerful and stimulating.
