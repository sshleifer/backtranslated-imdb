There is great danger when you see a movie that had such a profound effect on you the first time, that 20 years later, you will not have the same magic as before. I must admit that I did not expect it to be as good as I remembered it, but I was pleasantly surprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as I remember when I was 12 years old. This movie has a certain kind of brightness that many movies do not possess. It is fascinating, it has a brilliant performance and the best thing of all is that it makes me feel like a child again and there are not many things that can do that. The scrolls of John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden in this movie are first class and I had forgotten how good they were so far. I urge parents of teenagers to sit down, observe this and see if it has the same effect on them as on me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10
