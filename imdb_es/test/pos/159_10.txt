If you love the Chan-wook park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic and artistic, with touches of very dark humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I loved every second, from the cinematography (every photo is magnificent and creative) to the story, which combines Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, gothic horror and the drama of layered characters. The characters are complex and there is a lot of moral ambiguity. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The address is restricted and the actions are nuanced, such as SYMPATHY FOR MR. REVENGE, there are too many subtleties to assimilate in the first visualization. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, audacious and constantly surprising filmmaker. It is unpredictable: the scenes go from being brutal and heartbreaking to laughing out loud in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE, after SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE in terms of being exaggerated and comical. But, like LADY VENGEANCE, it is incredibly rich, stimulating and rewarding. <br /> <br /> If you like the stories of beautifully told vampires (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park, watching The third should be obvious. Easily one of the best films of 2009.
