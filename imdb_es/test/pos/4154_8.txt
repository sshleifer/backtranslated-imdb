The Golden Door is the story of the journey of a Sicilian family from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland in Sicily behind, undertake the arduous journey through the rough seas and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World, their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The images of the New World are optimistic, intelligent and highly imaginative. Silver coins fall from heaven upon Salvatore when he anticipates how prosperous he will be in the New World; carrots and onions are twice the size of human beings that are harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk submerge and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will produce. All these images are interwoven in a surreal way with the characters and help complement the harsh realism that the story reveals to the audience. The contrast between this image and the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps to provide hope while they are on board the ship to the New World. <br /> <br /> The trip to the New World takes place almost in complete darkness, especially when stormy seas roar and almost kill the people inside. The dark reality to which I referred is the Old World and the journey in itself to the New World. The Old World is described as indigent and primitive. This is shown when Salvatore rushes to sell the few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) to get the right clothes he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was quite interesting that these people believed that they had to conform to a certain dress code to be accepted in the New World; it almost suggested that people should adjust to a particular stereotype or mold to be recognized as morally appropriate. The most powerful image of the film was when the ship left its native land and set sail for the New World. This image shows a view from above of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from each other, representing the separation between the Old and the New World. This shot also suggested that people were being snatched from everything that was once a family, wanted to divorce their previous dark living conditions and wanted to enter a world that was more promising. <br /> <br /> As compared later. To what the New World looks visually, the Old World seems dark and gloomy compared to the bright but hazy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty would never show through the fog on Ellis Island, but remain hidden. I think this was an intentional choice of direction that seemed to deny the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty means: "Give me your poor, your tired, your hunger" seemed like a joke about what these people had to go through when they arrived at the new world. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through quite humiliating tests (ie, delousing, math, puzzles, etc.) to prove they are fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilians. In particular, Salvatore's mother had a harder time complying with the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where once their dreams provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was derogatory and rude. Salvatore does not change much more than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be compared to what the New World really was that he found disappointing. This attitude was shared mainly by all who traveled with him. His arcs of characters are more related to a precious dream that is very angry and a dark reality that had to be accepted. <br /> <br /> The film seems to make a strong comment about preparing to enter a civilized and celestial society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a comment on how the United States learned from the failures of other nations and was thus established on purpose to ensure that these pests did not infest and destroy. Although the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help people to flourish.
