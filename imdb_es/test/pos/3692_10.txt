My husband and I love this movie. At first, my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got for sitting through it. But after some key scenes, he was totally absorbed and, in the end, he was convinced that it was one of the best movies. Kathleen Bates has never been so wonderfully adorable and the rest of the cast is just fantastic. Thanks for this beautiful movie.
