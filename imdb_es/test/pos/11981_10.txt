Do not let the grade of 5.9 (as of this writing of 12-8-02) fool you, this is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how he got that rating considering it is so solid at all levels. The direction, the acting, the cinematography - all good. The story is interesting and original, and my only clue as to understanding why the rating is such, is based on the fact that it is probably the kind of movie that the classification of people does not normally see. <br /> <br /> I compare it. It's playing modern rock for an 80-year-old boy. He can be young, educated and love him, but he or she has not been and as a product of a different time and taste, he does not care. <br /> <br /> If you want films and can handle films based more on real people compared to those that comprise action without sense, huge showy budgets and mediocre talent, try it the next time you see it in ... <br /> <br />
