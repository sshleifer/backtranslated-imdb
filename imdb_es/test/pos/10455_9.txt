Maybe this movie was meant to be nothing but fun. Maybe it was meant to excite teens with all their nakedness. But what I got was actually something that many people believe in. And that is, "The good guys finish the last ones". <br /> <br /> There is a line in the Angel's Heart of Lisa Bonet's character that says "It's a bad ass to make a girl's heart beat faster". True. Most likely. Women always say they want flowers and candy and politeness and whatever. But (at least at an early age) they end up going for the indomitable, thin, skinny, disrespectful guy. The one they know can not conform to their beliefs. And that is part of the attraction. After all, what is the thrill of a boy who is already what you want him to be? I think this may have happened to Boaz Davidson. And what he has to say in this movie that is disguised as sex, nudity, parties and all that teenagers can relate is that you will break your heart. It happens to everyone and will happen to you. And that is a strong final statement in the film. But having said all that, the movie is fun. It's fun and shows the pranks of high school students pretty well. <br /> <br /> This is a rare movie that is elegant enough to please the teenage crowd it serves, but also smart and moving enough to show what it is; like to break your heart. No high school film has done this better. As I said, I think writers must have experienced a situation like this firsthand. Maybe we all have it. <br /> <br /> This is an old movie, but if you ever find it collecting dust on a shelf in your local video store one night, remove it and you'll be surprised. It's much better that they've never kissed me.
