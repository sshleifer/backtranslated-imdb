I loved this movie, which I just saw at the Philly Film Festival. In March of 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I interacted with everything, and I savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story touching and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the presentation. This film shows very well the mix, but not the complete mix of 2 worlds (East and West). The support cast was wonderful, describing the life that a tourist is in India quite realistically. The humor is subtle, and sometimes dry, and this makes it even more realistic, as it is woven into the daily adventures of the characters. It is so easy to identify with each of the situations portrayed.
