Excellent storytelling and cinematography. Poignant and scathing social comments. <br /> <br /> Great effects. Well filmed and acted. <br /> <br /> However, the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures (although very well done) sometimes lasts a little too long (approximately 3 hours), and the excessive interruptions the flow of the story . <br /> <br /> The first time I read the book was a child, and I enjoyed the parts about the giants and the tiny people, but the book lost me when it came to the floating island and the land of the "yahoos"! Well, although the plot of the adventure may sound like a story for children, in fact it is a very adult story, full of symbolism about the moral decadence in England at the time of Jonathan Swift, the author of the novel on which the movie.
