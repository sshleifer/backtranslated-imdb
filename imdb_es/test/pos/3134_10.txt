Along with the most underrated, The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite movies. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well performed by members of Ford's "corporation", such as Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond and Harry Carey, Jr. Like almost all Ford films, it is a meditation about Freedom and community. It is also worth mentioning for a much more positive depiction of the Indians than in most Ford movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American democracy.
