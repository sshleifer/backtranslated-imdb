Fat Man and Little Boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that were launched in reverse order in Nagasaki and Hiroshina. The way they emerged and came to be in the hands of Americans is the story of this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, the terms are the code names of two bombs fed with plutonium and uranium. Fat Man was the plutonium bomb and the one that was thrown over Nagasaki and Little Boy was the one used in Hiroshima. <br /> <br /> The film is mainly a conflict between General Leslie R. Groves of the United States Army and the physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under the direction of Groves. With two men from such divergent backgrounds, conflict was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who throughout his life has been a disarmament activist, plays General Groves. To his credit, Newman does not play a man whose opinions he very little in common with any kind of caricature. Groves is a military man, first and foremost, with a background in engineering. I wanted a combat command as trained military professionals would naturally wish in this great war. But due to his engineering background, Groves came to head the Manhattan Project, which was the name of the effort. So be it, Newman is determined to make his contribution to the war effort count. <br /> <br /> Most of us met Dwight Schultz from Team A as H.M. Murdoch the pilot whose control over reality is, at best, tenuous. If you only knew Team A, you might think that Schultz had a great future in comic roles. <br /> <br /> Instead, Dwight Schultz is one of the best actors in the English-speaking world with an amazing range of dramatic parts since that television series came out. J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. The challenge of the problem also intrigues him. Later, Oppenheimer became embroiled in a real problem due to his political opinions of the left and associates that everyone knew when entering the Manhattan Project. <br /> <br /> Some of the minor roles that stand out are Bonnie Bedelia as Mrs. Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson as the communist lady of Oppenheimer, whose business with Oppenheimer got her into a jackpot, and Laura Dern as a nurse in The site of Los Alamos. <br /> <br /> But the best is John Cusack, who, like Michael Merriman, is a composite of some real-life scientists who could be cataloged as the first victims of the atomic age. His scenes with Laura Dern, especially with what happens to him, take a real shock. <br /> <br /> The debate about bombs as they are being used is still a matter of furious debate. Fat Man And Little Boy presents the facts and allows you to decide what might have happened if you had taken an alternative use of them.
