Opera opens with a very close image of the eye of a bird that is always watching and, therefore, begins one of the strangest and most pleasant features of Argento (my second favorite, in fact, behind Deep Red). Of course, sometimes, the movie is quite absurd (the lack of real concern after the murders, the attack of the birds, the burned-out doll, that ending?), But this is the fantastic world of Argento and once accept it, find it works. However, I do not intend to discard these flaws completely, but the art of the film compensates for them. For example, the attack of birds mentioned above is completely exaggerated in theory, however, look at the wonderful execution of this; the crows flying in the chaos, adding their angry squawks to the rhythm of the rock, the crowd in a state of panic as seen through the circle, camera work from a bird's eye view and then focused attack; Aria of terror by the way. The incredible and fluid cinematography of Argento is shown in Opera, and clearly one of the highlights of the film. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of the operatic themes and the rock music, a good contrast of music with each one used effectively (the rock starts with the murders in a perfect time and gives the scenes a very frenetic feeling). The sound effects also deserve a nod, punches, scissors, picks and everything. <br /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: "I've seen a lot of your movies, yes, you're really an expert on this, I'd really like to hear your opinion." <br /> <br /> Marco: "It is not advisable to use films as a guide for reality, is not it an inspector?" <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: "It depends on what you understand by reality" . <br /> <br /> As it is a giallo, stylish killings are a necessity and Dario does not disappoint (the "bullet through the door" scene is possibly one of the largest deaths ever shot, if you forgive the play on words). The murderer with black glove, deep voice and pulsed brain (great shots!) Is cold and brutal, and having him stuck with pins in the eyes of our heroine to force her to see the murders was a nice touch. Everything said, like a giallo, Opera does not have a mystery as good as it should. The murderer is kept secret far enough from the audience, but there is little effort in the film dedicated to solving the murders. This, and the strange ending, could have used more work. However, despite these problems, Opera can still be a satisfying and valuable horror film. <br /> <br /> A final note: it was nice to see a movie, for once, show the correct view through binoculars (just a circle, not two circles together! Good eye for detail, Dar√≠o!
