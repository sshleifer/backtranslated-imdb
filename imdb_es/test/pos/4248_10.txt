I have to admit that I had never heard of this movie. I caught him last night at TMC. I thought he was hysterical. I laughed so much and loved the ending. Imagine what a Marx Brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then they all abandoned LSD. <br /> <br /> Fun and nervous are two overused words these days, this movie has more than 200 intellectual coefficients. Points of most current and surreal comedies to boot. I had to get up at 6:00 am and I saw it until 2:30. I slept more and I lost my obligations. It's still worth it. I would not recommend renting it, I would recommend having it. It was so good <br /> <br /> The only warning I have is that, therefore, the references are dated and it is possible that younger people will not get them. Discover it and use your head. <br /> <br /> I would have to put it in my best comedies of all time.
