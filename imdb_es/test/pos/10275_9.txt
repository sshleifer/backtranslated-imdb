Gilles Mamouni is playing with the public with the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his biggest lost love (Monica Bellucci) just before committing himself to another woman. Mamouni uses many sequences of flashbacks without warning, so the best way to know where in the story we are observing the actor's haircut. Otherwise, it can be very confusing ... It remains a solid cinematic debut for Mamouni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (the fifth element, the Messenger), and Monica Bellucci is a beloved child ... I felt a little disappointed near the end So I gave him 9 out of 10.
