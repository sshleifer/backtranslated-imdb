This was a great show ... I do not remember much about it, but I remember seeing it and loving it. I remember the mother and the father. I really like grandma. It was like a grandmother that you really could not appreciate until you became an adult. She was very knowledgeable and without nonsense. My favorite song on the show was Sardinas in the morning. (That might not be the title) I remember that after watching that show and listening to that song, I went to Cleveland Ohio to visit my cousins ​​and me and my sister sang that song so much that by the time we left, all my cousins ​​were singing too I would also love to find this on DVD.
