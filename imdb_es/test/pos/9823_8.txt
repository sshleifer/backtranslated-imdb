Like many others, I was attracted to the combination of Pollack, Ford and Scott-Thomas. I enjoyed the work of Pollack and Ford in Sabrina, a well made movie and a careful rewriting of the old material. Upon hearing that this movie was in production, I ordered and read the book. Immediately it seemed that this would be a harder story to film. The characters are not always sympathetic, there is little or no humor and the author makes numerous plot shortcuts to focus on his main theme: that, since each would see the other as the only one who shares the unique combination of loss and betrayal caused by the plane crash, the wives completely surprised of the adulterers would look for each other. In addition, imagine that the resolution could reach both through a bitter exploration of the hidden lives of adulterers and that this experience of "thick and thin" could produce a deeper love than the previous one. Although much of the book is about their bitterness and hatred towards their former partners, in the end is acceptance and forgiveness. The script of the film only retains the plane crash and the shared problem of the spouses. Where the woman is the aggressor researcher in the book, is the man in the film and the woman is never a willing co-investigator. The film has a completely new secondary plot for Harrison Ford that seems even more artificial than the double coincidence of the plane crash. The sub-plot of "woman of Congress for re-election" for women is also new, but works better. Audience, the expectations of a pure romance or a romantic comedy can not be fulfilled because this story focuses on a very bitter pill. However, where resolution and forgiveness are achieved in the book, by lifting the burden of the reader's bitterness and allowing levity, there is no corresponding moment in the movie. Although forgiveness is never implied, we must assume that healing after a shot fulfills a double function. The character of Ford does not have to be a man of few words so entertaining and the change of accent of Scott-Thomas is a bit disconcerting at first. This movie is not the dead loss suggested by others. However, it is a film difficult to appreciate because the rewriting and adaptation to the screen are below the standard previously reached by the casting director.
