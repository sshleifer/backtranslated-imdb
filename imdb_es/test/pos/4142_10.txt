Buddy Holly Story opens with a photo of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a skating rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. When the credits begin, the camera drops from the moon to the parking lot, to the skating rink, passes the concessions and crosses the runway to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a follow-up shot that Welles and Scorcese would appreciate. Cut to the face with Buddy Holly's glasses looking down in absorbed concentration as he grabs the headphones and talks to a man who puts this band on the radio. <br /> <br /> A young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his acting is key. It has to show in some way the passion that Holly had for her music to make the movie work. This is a story of rock and roll without lines of coke pursued with injections of heroin and a fifth of whiskey. It is not a man with several women to choose from in a lustful, abandoned, scandalized and scandalized tragedy. This is a movie about a good guy from Texas who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds that spark and lights it, his passion is clear and infectious. He really plays the guitar in the movie and sings, he's not overdubbed with Holly's recordings. Busey was a young man in Hollywood in the seventies, an actor with difficulties and also a rock musician with difficulties. Therefore, it gives a great performance, because although it is not Buddy Holly, it is in a similar situation. <br /> <br /> His first song is the old classic of Les Paul, "Mockingbird Hill", and has the accent of the country to nail it. Then, a boy asks for a bop, and against his two bandmates (actually, the Crickets were 3 men, but the small size works well for the limited narrative of the movie) that heads them with "Rocking with Ollie Vee". Children love him and parents hate him. The DJ on the track records it and then launches it in New York without Buddy Holly knowing it was recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in a movie full of comedic moments. A Buffalo amplified disc jockey calls Buddy to his house. The DJ has been playing "That will be the day" for 12 hours and goes by 24. The policemen are knocking on the door of the station. Holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he is very excited. He tells the children, and begins his meteoric rise. Dan Stroud as drummer and Charles Martin Smith as bassist complete the band very well and have good chemistry between them. There are problems but not an exaggerated drama that is found in most rock biopics (all?). The movie does not manipulate you either. Your emotions are triggered, but they are not manipulated. When the Crickets take the Apollo stage in Harlem, the first white group to play there, then they get into an electric-charged performance of "Oh Boy" and they beat the audience, my rock'n'roll-loving ass choked and I cry. Next, Busey and the children make "It's so easy" sound more fun and moving than I would have thought possible. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a cursory knowledge of Buddy Holly's story will know where this movie will end. Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Valens and the Big Bopper too young. We, as the audience knows, however, the film is so well written, directed and acted with love that we almost forgot it. The film is not about his death, but about his life and his place in the history of rock and roll. The film ends with his last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of Busey rocking possessed by the ghost of Buddy Holly. I was happy to hear him finish with "Not Fade Away", my favorite of his songs. The film freezes before the credits end with information about the plane crash, but I barely noticed it. I was still thinking about how good the last song was.
