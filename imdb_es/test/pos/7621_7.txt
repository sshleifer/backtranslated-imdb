I'm not sure if these other people watched the movie; Apparently, some could not follow the "complicated plot". He is a billionaire who owns an oil company that ALSO goes to big game - wow - that's very far-fetched. Either way, your new "drilling machine" breaks through a glacier and on the other side there is a world separate from our time where dinosaurs and cavemen roam. Nothing innovative about this, but it's certainly not ridiculous. Anyway, the rest of the movie is about this T-Rex they find (that the billionaire, Boone, claimed to be there) hunting them and hunting them. Look, it's an old movie for television. Of course, the special effects look corny. They did not have CG. They did the best they could and for an MFTVM they did an incredible job at that time. This film must be remade for the big screen, I would love it and it would be the first on the line. Seeing that dinosaur with today's special effects harassing those guys would be great!
