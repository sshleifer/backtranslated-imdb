Flash Gordon is, without doubt, the best of all American series. As early as 1936, Universal was able to make such an entertaining story, and twenty years later, when I saw it for the first time as a child, it involved me in a great adventure and excitement. Buster Crabbe was the hero we always wanted to be in our childhood, and Jean Rogers, the beautiful girl with whom we always dream of being in love. Dragons, octopuses, monsters, gorillas were also the attraction. Charles Middleton had a great presence as Ming, the Ruthless. A true predecessor of Starwars by George Lucas.
