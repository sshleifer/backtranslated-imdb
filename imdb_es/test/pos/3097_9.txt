"Fata Morgana", by the famous filmmaker Werner Herzog, is incredibly unorthodox. Although the characters appear in the film from time to time, there is no real story. The film is not an educational or historical documentary either. It's a movie without an accompanying script. <br /> <br /> The film consists of a curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative, whose combination superimposes a long series of images of most, though not exclusively, of the Sahara desert. . Some of the images are wonderfully strange and out of the ordinary. The camera captures ghostly images, or mirages, optical illusions that captivate and hypnotize. <br /> <br /> This general cinematic trend is marked by occasional observations observed on incidental subjects. For example, in a sequence, a man wearing glasses offers us a mini-tutorial on lizards. And in what for me was the most captivating and weird sequence, a small box room contains a man with dark glasses who sings with a voice totally distorted by the microphone he is using, accompanied by an old woman who plays a melody in a old piano Neither the man nor the old woman seem to enjoy what they are doing. How baroque. <br /> <br /> "Fata Morgana" has an underlying concept, one that unites the great variety of strange images and eclectic sounds. But that concept is so subtle, so opaque that you will never solve it without help. From this subtle theme, the film does make sense. Without that point of reference, however, the film can seem tedious and endless, a meaningless parade of random earthly images and an incomprehensible esoteric narrative. <br /> <br /> Without redundancy, thematically disconcerting and kinematically heretical, "Fata Morgana" is likely to make you fade with delight or vomit. Either you will cling to the Zen qualities of the film or you will be tempted to break the DVD into a thousand pieces. One thing that most viewers will agree on: "Fata Morgana" is ... different.
