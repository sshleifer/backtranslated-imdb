The incredibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, a new nurse in one of those movie halls where the doctor in charge has her own unorthodox ways of treating inmates. Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, a.k.a Annabelle Weenick), reluctantly brought her on board. The inmates do not care too much about Charlotte either. <br /> <br /> Part mystery, part horror, this initial effort of the film director B, S.F. Brownrigg has an oppressive feeling. These colorful psychopaths, which include a nymphomaniac without self-esteem, a gentle giant who has already had a lobotomy and a supposed "judge" who speaks legal jargon, dominate the screen with his disconcerting presence. <br /> <br /> It is an image that works quite well, setting the harsh and gloomy atmosphere from the beginning. Some brief outbursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good quality of outdated exploitation. <br /> <br /> It intensifies as the heroine in danger struggles to maintain her own sanity, offering one surreal encounter after another. Particularly effective is the poetic and old Mrs. Callingham, who quotes in poetry. <br /> <br /> For the cheap cheese of the 1970s era, it is quite effective, with a particularly unpleasant climax. I had a good time watching it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
