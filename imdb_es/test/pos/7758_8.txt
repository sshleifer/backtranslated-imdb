At first glance, this is another animated high school with many excuses for "fan service", but there is much more at stake. The 'fan service' is part of the plot, the main character is a tired cynic (unusual), and the most important thing is that there is an intelligent plot that unites all the episodes, and that raises some interesting questions. The episodes are deliberately non-chronological, and it's certainly worth seeing the series again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> The series deserves to be watched carefully, because there are many casual tips there that prefigure and explain things, plus a good number of jokes about other series, anime and others.
