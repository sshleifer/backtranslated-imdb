<----- Minor spoilers! -----> <br /> <br /> A woman gets pregnant, but not for her husband. She develops "something" inside her, or at least that's what her husband thinks. They go through many difficult times, while she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The husband communicates with a UFO teacher and, with their help, they try to find out what is wrong with him. <br /> <br /> <----- Minor spoilers! ----> <br /> <br /> The story could have been a bit better, or at least made less predictable, but the film is catchy and it caught me and my sister with no problems. The acting is very good, and the shooting is much better than normal, if you compare it with your normal b-alien movie. The effects are good, and something is happening every second of the movie. The characters are really nice, and apart from a stupid nurse in a scene, they are all very convincing in their roles. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie, and I can recommend it, if you like the alien. / Monster-abduction movies! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - The story could have been a little less predictable.
