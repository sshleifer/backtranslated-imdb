Many critics seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which I have not had the opportunity to see. By itself, the '56 version is a very well made movie. The series of Hitchcock films of the mid and late fifties (including "Rear Window", "Dial M For Murder", "Vertigo" and "To Catch A Thief", as well as this movie, is one of my favorite periods In The Man Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart vigorously throws himself into his role as always Doris Day is very credible in the role of an atypical blonde from Hitchcock, I thought there was nothing fake in her acting. his character has not been written as strongly as the original, but it has definitely not been reduced to the role of a passive, "Yes, dear", a nice thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm. <br /> <br /> There were some really smart lines written for Hank (the son of the couple who is then kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus, it's a pity that Christopher Olsen read them with so much wood, but it is rare to see a good performance by a child actor in the 50s. However, the ma Most of the other supporting actors in this film were very competent, especially the murderer (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /> <br /> Some small details that make this film undoubtedly Hitchcockian: the use of non-English dialogue, especially French (something that Hitch did on a much larger scale in "To Catch A Thief" ); the use of forebodings, Arabic music at the hotel when the killer appears; Stewart and Day talk among themselves in the church, singing their words to the rhythm of the hymn; the scene of Albert Hall, which shows specifically the musicians and accomplice of the killer after the score, increasing the tension, as well as the percussionist preparing the dishes; and finally the killer's weapon as it appears from behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (also an effect that Hitch used at the end of "Spellbound"). <br /> <br /> In general, the man who knew too much is fun. movie to watch. It is not as deep or as loaded with symbolism as some of his films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on a Train"), but it is still one of my five main masterpieces of Hitchcock.
