Sui generis Friends, I'm not going to lie to you; Merhige is a marvel of one or two hits, but what a movie (it almost excuses SUSPECT ZERO). Nor am I going to pretend to understand it completely; Half of what makes it what it is is trying to guess what the hell they are doing on the screen because of the chiaroscuro. <br /> <br /> Richard Corliss says: "It is as if a Druidic cult had risen, promulgated, really, three biblical stories: the creation, the Nativity and the torture and death of Jesus on Golgotha." That is not a bad description, but there seems to be more to that than religious correspondences apparently one by one. <br /> <br /> There is an environmental issue near the surface: notice that towards the end (after the sterility of the landscape) there are large pipes not very different from those of a construction site. Oh no, he's going to say how people are raped to Mother Nature. We rarely see a dead metaphor in action, and with this great hyperbole, but seeing it represented is much more frightening than what language implies. <br /> <br /> And yes, if you just want something that is synchronized with a death metal soundtrack, it has the necessary atrocities. But as for me and others like me, it's an important art film that should deserve a release from the Criterion collection. It is at the height of FAUS de Murnau. <br /> <br /> ~ Ray
