This film is masterfully directed by Clive Barker, he really knows how to establish a relationship between the audience and the characters. I think a sequel is missing for this, Barker should have devoted himself to the sequel to this movie instead of making the boring Lord of Illusions, I think that was a real crap. But I also think that because of this and due to the lack of the sequel, NBreed has become a cult classic dark of horror movies.
