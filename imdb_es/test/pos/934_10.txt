This film is not only the last piece of the trilogy of the three colors, but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s. There is hardly another film that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for each being human. <br /> <br /> Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Even though she has a boyfriend, she seems to be quite alone. One night, she has an accident and wounds a dog and who takes her to her owner, a retired juglaise (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who is cynical and spies on the phone calls of her neighbors. Disgusted by him, she can not leave and they meet again. Two lonely souls meet and become friends and develop a deep mutual love. <br /> <br /> The story itself is too complex to be told completely, there is another connection between them in a young man that represents the true love of the judge and Valentine and there is more to their relationship than just friendship. <br /> <br /> The actors are wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant develop a deep and authentic friendship. <br /> <br /> The themes have an infinite validity, the Fraternity, not only in contact with each other, but also in respect of the right to privacy. Alarmingly, we seem to lose this right more and more, which makes movies like this one even more important than it could have been in 1994. <br /> <br /> Red is one of the strongest colors that exist, which represents an internal turmoil. Love, anger and passion. Used here as another protagonist, it brings an incomparable depth to the film. A masterpiece!
