I think this is a great classic monster movie for the family. The mole, what a machine! The tall creature with the beak, the flying green lizards, Ranthorincus / Mayas or whatever they are and the apemen talk telepathically with them. The battle of men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast umm! tasty! Class, what else can I say? How would you do a 2002 remake of this?
