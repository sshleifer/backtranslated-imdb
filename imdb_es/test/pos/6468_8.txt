A film skilfully directed by Martin Ritt where a murderer and antihero, John Cassevetes lands in New York to escape a tragic incident in his life, where he killed his brother in a car accident and left without an army license. <Br /> <br /> Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows guts in his interpretation of a movie. I'm surprised that Montgomery Clift did not get this part. <br /> <br /> Ruth White is her mother and she performs remarkably well in two scenes over the phone. <br /> <br /> Once in New York, he becomes friends with Sidney Poitier while the two work at the docks. Immediately, Jack Warden, a bully and villain in this film, dislikes and tragedy ensues when Poitier tries to defend his friend. <br /> <br /> Ruby Dee, plays Poitier's wife in this film, and is brilliant in a scene in which she urges Cassavetes to reveal her husband's killer. <br /> <br /> This is definitely an interesting movie of moral values ​​and the lonely society. Against the backdrop of the houses, the correct mood is shown in the film.
