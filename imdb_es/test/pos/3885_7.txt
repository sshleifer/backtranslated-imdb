Has the proliferation of relatively high quality programs in the proliferating television networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and / or star in their own films that they otherwise could not have been able to? That is something good? <br /> <br /> This movie does not answer the last question in any way, but it seems that without Curb, Jeff Garlin could not have made I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. <br /> <br /> Like most new producers / directors, the independent piece by Jeff Garlin throws a much more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is mainly known for (Curb). And yet, is it a sensitive type movie? He is not really a sensitive guy. Nice, of course. Relatable, by the way. <br /> <br /> What this film really is about is a bit difficult to say, I can only relate what I took away from it. <br /> <br /> I rented the movie due to the advances, in particular to the scene of a counselor played by Amy Sedaris informing James Aaron (Garlin) that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because it is a " Chubby hunter ". "I almost fell out of my seat, based only on that scene, I ran to my computer to write me a note to rent this movie, the reason: I thought the school counselor (Sedaris) was talking about Beth, played by Sarah Silverman. I imagined a light romantic comedy between the cunning Silverman and the fat Garlin, I did not think the story was anything but original, but the dialogue would be agile and the scenes would move at a satisfactory pace ... In short, I thought it would be a comedy. /> <br /> It was intriguing that the movie started that way, but then it took a much more realistic turn when Beth gave James the weight because "I've never been with a fat man before." That's how brutally we live life and it was completely realistic, I applaud the decision, it just meant that Beth had already left the building and with her, the smart person in the movie. <br /> <br /> James's relationship with his mother was also interesting. part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start like a play. I had that intricate feeling. (The entire "Marty" movie within a movie was completely lost on me, since I had never seen that movie before). <br /> <br /> However, I had many doubts about the character of James Aaron. Is it really possible that at age 39 he has not had a serious relationship? And he is an actor? That really did not fit with me. For me, his character was less actor, and more corporate. I really could not buy your ordinary either. No doubt, I was extremely disappointed that things with Beth did not work out. We feel that. But then, did he really care? <br /> <br /> Another thing: how in the world can he and his mother afford to move at the same time? Do not you just lose your job? The last one he had? That was one of the reasons why it did not seem normal. Where do the funds come from for your life? <br /> <br /> And yet, I have read reviews that talk about the realistic portrait of urban loneliness, and that's it. Yes, it is very realistic, the way we should be satisfied with what we have because it is all we have. The way we disappear from ourselves and others in interactions (James and Stella), is a kind of misery that occurs only to move to the next moment. That, in contrast to the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments, our thoughts as James had with Beth, is really overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Very well done.
