The other night I saw her on cable by request and I thought: "this is the kind of film that Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns could have starred if it had been done in the late 50s". A farce in the English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their performances. Naomi Watts simply sizzles in a cheerful way Jayne Mansfield (if she could have acted). The rest of the cast has some great twists and bits. The Welsh landscape is a delight. An absurd premise, in fact and not at all credible, but that does not interfere in the enjoyment. It's not a BIG movie, yes, but it's a really fun watch. And Walken is at his best. A joy for the eyes!
