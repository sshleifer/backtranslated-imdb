I agree with many of the other reviews here. This was a great movie and an even better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I think the author died before he could see this movie made. The performances are all first class, with the three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross and Veronica Hamel) apparently made for their roles. The exteriors, both in Europe and in Israel, seem very authentic, and the duration of the 4-hour miniseries was the right one to tell this story. Fortunately, I made a recording of this when I was on television and I have enjoyed watching it since then. I can say without hesitation that it remains until today. I gave him a grade of 10. If you have not read the book, you should really find a copy. This would be an excellent movie to release on DVD with extras that could easily include cast interviews.
