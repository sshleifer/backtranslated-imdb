I have the common logical good sense to know that oil can not last forever and I am well aware of how much of my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemicals. I have been an avid consumer of new technologies and I am running out of space on power platforms, so I know that even the energy crisis associated with Peak Oil will change my life appreciably. <br /> <br /> The End Of Suburbia shows, in a rational and entertaining way, how much lifestyle of my whole family will have to change in my life. I am particularly concerned about future generations who will have to pay the bill for our excesses, however, the filmmakers offer a glimmer of hope by recognizing human ingenuity and determination, and the sense of community that tends to be engendered. for shared difficulties. <br /> <br /> There is no point in trying to pretend that Peak Oil is a baseless propaganda, or treat it as the radioactive cloud that approaches "On the beach" (ie, with the suicide pills ready)) . Even with our best efforts, times will become increasingly difficult, and I hope there is enough compassion and humanity for all.
