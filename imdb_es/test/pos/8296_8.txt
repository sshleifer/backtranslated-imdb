Family happiness is falling apart when, from the beginning, rich father Ward (Michael Ontkean), becomes poor and can no longer support the family. Then, mother Faye (Jaclyn Smith) has to assume the role of breadwinner and begins to work to support the family and, at the same time, only periodically, she must manage family life. Not always as good, but as good as she can be. Family life hardly becomes easier when the father finds out that son Lionel (Joe Flanigan "Stargate Atlantis") is gay and is living together with his lover John (Joel Gretsch "The 4400"), also an old friend of the family, which results in The father making it clear to Lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. Lionel is the one who most referred to his sister Anne (Leslie Horan) during his upbringing, since the family neglected her. Anne can not stand the fact that her father cut the ropes with Lionel and, therefore, has run away from home. As this was not enough, son Greg (Brian Krause "Enchanted") enlists in the Marines and is sent to war. The plot of this film can sometimes seem a little thin, although it still has a lot of realism, which makes it worth seeing. Because this film illustrates many relationships and sensitive situations, I think the best way to appreciate it is a mature audience, although it is not bad for teenagers to see it and have something to think about before adulthood.
