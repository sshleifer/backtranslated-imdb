This is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. Many people love it and on a creative level it is brilliant. Most of the episode does not have dialogue, which is a great idea and "Hush" handles the silence really well. Also, this episode presents Tara, which I really like. But, I do not like Riely or Initiative or Maggie Walsh and it seems that they have a lot of screen time in "Hush". Also, I do not think the gentlemen are so afraid and I get tired of seeing the float around Sunnydale. I know that I am in the minority, but I tend to advance parts of "Hush". Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are great, so if you're watching them on DVD, I recommend watching this episode. It really is a classic. <br /> <br /> "Silence" revolves around the whole city losing its voices. The slender-looking demon men, called knights, arrive to gather seven hearts of human victims, but if they hear a human cry, they die. So they steal the voices of everyone in town. Buffy and the Scoobies try to figure out what's going on, while the Initiative also starts investigating. Meanwhile, Xander realizes how much Anya means to him and Willow meets a witch named Tara. Buffy and Riely finally come face to face as they fight the Knights. Both are amazed by what they learn ... He is a commando and she is the Matadora. In the end, Buffy saves the day, but now she has to deal with her new knowledge of Riely's secret life. <br /> <br /> Actually, the creativity of "Hush" can not be seen in a basic scheme of its plot. It is the overwhelming silence of the episode, which makes it so great. The characters try to communicate in different ways (whiteboards, pantomime, obscene gestures with their fingers, etc.) and everything works really well. After a while, you forget that there is no dialogue because everyone is very good at expressing themselves. During the "spoken" parts of the episode, there are many references to the importance of actually "listening" to each other. Anya claims that Xander will not really talk to her. Giles ignores the protests of Spike and Xander and insists that Spike moves into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly replaces the word "oil" with "patrol" when she talks with Riely so she does not have to explain her call. And then in the end, when Buffy and Riely really learn the truth from each other, they sit there with nothing to say. Everything is great. <br /> <br /> There are many good parts in this episode. I love that people keep forgetting that they can not talk. Buffy and Xander try to use the phone. Riley can not use voice recognition in the Initiatives elevator. People try to scream. It's basically what everyone would do if they suddenly did not have a speech. And I think it's funny that Spike has to move in with Xander. (They will also share an apartment for a while in season seven). Xander and Spike have a fun children's game that is simply hilarious. I also like the beginning of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are very nice together. It's nice to see them starting. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, I do not understand how gentlemen are choosing their victims. It seems that they float around the bedrooms and choose people at random. Also, I do not like Riely. I've never liked it, but from "Silence" I'm almost waiting for Angel to return to the city and hit him. Finally, what about Olivia after this? It seems that we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything is fine ... and suddenly it falls. I do not get it. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the episode: "Who are the knights of Giles?" Conference to the Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and their heads are very funny. He makes some similar-looking flashcards in "First Date" of the seventh season. Almost whenever Giles starts drawing monsters, it will be fun.
