Surely the Gershwin family realizes that this is one of the best operas in the United States. You have thousands of fans of this opera waiting to be released on DVD. Please, do not be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and wonder that you can bring to a hungry audience of quality music, launching this great GEM. Do not wait until the movie is beyond repair. The cast is first class, the music is simply amazing, we need beautiful music in today's world. You can never re-shoot with such a large cast. With today's home theater systems, wonderful sound systems and the need for good music, I beg the Gershwin family to reconsider and launch this incredible movie. Thank you
