This was a very good western of 1950, one of the best I've seen in a decade that included that genre on the screen and on television. He certainly had three great actors in the tent: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. It turns out that Ford was the star of this film, while the other two stars had secondary roles. Ford had most of the dialogue. He was also the "good boy", while Robinson was the "bad boy" and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson. She played the real weight in this movie and the character she played was a bit contradictory at times. <br /> <br /> Ford handled his star status very skillfully, as he used to, especially in westerns. He played a good guy who did not want to fight, he was a quiet man ... but if you pushed him ... be careful! <br /> <br /> The story had a good mix of action and calm, not exaggerating either. It had an expansive western configuration that was put to good use with the CineamaScope widescreen. He also had realistic people in a realistic environment. That credibility with the characters, especially with the secondary players, was the most impressive. Men outnumbered women in this film, acting and with character. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak, the only negative aspects of production. It's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars. <br /> <br /> Despite being over 50 years old, this western is one that you'll still find fast enough to enjoy, no matter how old you are. They are or what you are used to seeing. For fans of classic cinema, this is almost an obligation with this cast and a good story. Highly recommended
