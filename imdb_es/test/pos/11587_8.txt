The true story of a Spanish paraplegic, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to be eutenised. This film, along with the winner of the Best Movie of the same year, Million Dollar Baby, caused a stir that year with his performances of disabled people who want death. Both advocates for the disabled and (unfortunately for disability advocates) pro-life conservative groups protested both films and their Oscar nominations. The nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle, just to put everything in a historical perspective. Do the protests, especially of disabled groups, against Million Dollar Baby make any sense? The film clearly showed, without hesitation, the life of a paraplegic as worthless. The protagonist of the film, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes a paraplegic, does not seem to receive any advice, nor help, and immediately wants to die. The movie is, honestly, quite silly and without complexes. The Sea Inside, based on real story, is certainly much more thoughtful on the subject. Most likely, it has entered the same category as Million Dollar Baby without its protesters have seen, an incredibly common phenomenon. The film gives time to many different sides of the plot. And immediately declares that the desire to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone. However, he is guilty of a couple of crimes, and he would still understand why disabled groups might have a problem with that. In the first place, there is the meeting of the protagonist with a paraplegic bishop. I do not see myself with kindness in the way he is represented. His wheelchair operated orally is described as absurd, and there is almost a comical sequence to which his effeminate servants of children's toys drag him, in his chair, upstairs. He can not even reach the room where Ramón is, and one of the children-toys is forced to carry the conversation between them. I had to think, wow, maybe if Ramón lived in a house a little more accessible for wheelchairs, he would not spend his whole life in bed and could find life more satisfying (who knows how close the movie describes reality) . The director Amenábar (The Others) also includes some scenes of laughter that try to make this film about suicide more affirmative of life, as a transversal sequence in which Ramón is considered and the baby of his lawyer is born. But in addition to some ugly moments, the movie is very good. It hurts that someone wants to die when he has the ability to bring so much joy and understanding to the lives of others. However, in the end, our lives belong to us. Should not we have the right to choose? The most important asset of the film are its secondary characters and the actors who play them. It represents how Ramón's struggle and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision. The family members in particular are great, and Ramón's final output of them is absolutely heartbreaking, and it made me cry. My favorite performance in the film comes from Lola Dueñas, whom I also felt gave the best performance, or at least without a doubt the most undervalued, in Volver de Almodóvar last year.
