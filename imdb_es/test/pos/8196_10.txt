After watching the movie several times, I found so many subtle touches and emotions in the dialogue. Jing Ke, the Assassin has become one of the favorite movie characters of all time. This excellent Chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements than any American big screen actor today. Qin, the Emperor, is brilliant as he guides the audience to believe the goodness in his heart, only to unleash the most cruel acts on the people around him. The promises he makes with incredible passion and shattered with an evil fist. Gong Li, like in almost every movie I've seen, is simply fantastic. His command of the screen is so elegant and emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> In case you could not say it, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />
