I work in a cinema and every Thursday night we have a screening of a film for employees that leaves the next day ... Today was The Guardian. I saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much of them, and I did not really anticipate seeing this movie. As it turns out, this movie was much more than I would have thought. It was a great story in the first place. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did an amazing acting job in this movie. Being a big fan of That 70's Show, it was always hard for me to think of Kutcher as anyone other than Kelso despite the great performance he did in The Butterfly Effect, but after seeing this movie, I think I'll finally be able to see it as a serious one actor. <br /> <br /> It was also a great tribute to the forgotten heroes of the United States Coast Guard.
