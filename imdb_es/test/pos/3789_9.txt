Considering all the comedies with a military situation that have been made in history, someone had to be the first. One could argue that, in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that back then this was a bold move. When you consider that some of the best films involving people like Bob Hope, Abbott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy involved military service and were made during the war, it is something that you accept and laugh at. <br /> <br /> In the First World War Chaplin along with other stars like Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went on bonus tours. He was a great supporter of the Allied cause, something unusual for some of his leftist views. It would seem natural for the Tramp to be selected and unfortunately it would turn around and wreak havoc on everyone. <br /> <br /> Many of the things you would see in World War II service comedies had their start in Shoulder Arms. Chaplin had no more imitators because, a few weeks after the premiere of the film, the war was over. <br /> <br /> But one of the greatest geniuses of comedy had established a form of comedy.
