I read most of the comments here where everyone saw only the flaws of the movie. I agree, the director is not Kuprik, the actors are not Oscar winners, but he has something that everyone can relate to. I do not want to spoil, but to count more than the plot: the end of the school and the trip to a big party, or if you want to see beyond the metaphor, is to choose the way of living. Do you remember the days of youth? The days when you or our friend acted like the characters? Or do you think you should act like one of them and now you regret not having done it? If you can go back to that time and if you ask any of these questions, maybe the movie was not so bad.
