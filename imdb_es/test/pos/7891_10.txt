Finally I have seen the real reason why Peter Boyle became famous. It was not being the monster in "Young Frankenstein" or the bad mood of Frank Barone in "Everybody Loves Raymond". For the younger people who only know him on TV, try this movie, this makes Frank look like a saint. <br /> <br /> "Joe" is Boyle in his best acting role and, as someone mentioned, he probably gave The Inspiration for "Archie Bunker" in "Everything in the Family". I think Boyle even went back to "Joe" a bit to play Frank. (I say this because I noticed that the "Joe" and Frank Barone's basement look similar). <br /> <br /> I did not know anything about this movie when I took it out of the library, I just knew Boyle and Susan Sarandon were introduced. Yes, Susan looks very good here and for a young actress a very good early role. A young hippie wants to be, who runs away from his parents' house and lives with him, the last lost in a drug-induced foggy hippie, who also sells everything he buys. <br /> <br /> After an almost fatal overdose with too many pills, she is hospitalized while her parents go to collect her things, her mother does not come into the apartment smelly and careless, but her father does. While Dad picks up his things, his boyfriend comes home and exchanges words and then the father does what we later hear Joe say he would like to do to a hippie. <br /> <br /> Joe is shooting his friend. tell how he hates different cultures / races, hippies and a long list of others. When he says, "I'd really like to kill one of them," the father (trying to look like he's kidding) says, "I just did it." Joe almost buys it but then he takes it as funny. <br /> <br /> Later, when the police are on the scene and the story is in the newspaper, Joe realizes he was not kidding. Instead of catching the rich man for money through blackmail, in reality, he does it, he blackmails him. Only wanting him and his wife to "know" him and his wife. A long story short, their association is uncomfortable, but after Sarandon realizes what her father has done, the lower part runs the risk of falling. <br /> <br /> How all this will look in the end, will have to do for you. Although more than 35 years ago, the end is something that is not expected. Unless you've seen the movie before, of course. Once again, I recommend it mainly for those who have not seen it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars for Boyle not only playing someone completely opposed to his nature, but for what he will show to others that he was more than just a television and movie comedy actor. (FINISH)
