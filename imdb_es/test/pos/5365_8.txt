I saw it at the Stony Brook Film Festival in NY in 2004 and it was very well received. In this pre-World War II film, a pair of German rocket scientists are working on Scotland's Scarp Island as the war looms on the horizon. The characters found on the island have no price in their creation and representation. Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable <br /> <br /> After catching up with the "Scootish" accents, the viewer feels at home with these people watching with amusement as the Germans work to link their island with the continent through a delivery of mail based on rockets. As unlikely as it sounds, this movie was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> In short, a memorable movie that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting, its history or its stage.
