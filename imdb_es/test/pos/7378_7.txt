While driving dangerously zigzag on a lonely street at night, teenager Cliff (Jay R. Ferguson) has a car accident with his friends Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Masterson). While they spend the cold night stranded in the forest around a bonfire, they kill time telling ghost stories. In "The Honeymoon", the couple Rick (Ron Livingston) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) travel in their RV to Las Vegas on their honeymoon. Rick takes a shortcut to visit the Clayton Caverns at night, but the strange Cole (Hawthorne James) advises them to leave the place as dangerous creatures attack people in the full moon. In "People Can Lick Too", on the eve of her twelfth birthday, Amanda (Alex McKenna) tells her Internet friend Jessica that she is alone at home. However, Jessica is actually a psychopath. In "The Locket", motorcyclist Scott (Glenn Quinn) is crossing the country on his motorcycle. When she has a problem with her bicycle, she finds an isolated house where the beautiful fool Heather Wallace (Jacinda Barrett) lives with her father. When the man returns from his flock, Scott finds the truth about Heather. <br /> <br /> "Campfire Tales" presents three good horror stories, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts and a surprising twist at the end. The weakest segment is "The Hook", with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories are great. The point of the plot is totally unexpected and gives a great conclusion to this horror movie above average. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazul): "Contos da Meia-Noite" ("Midnight Tales")
