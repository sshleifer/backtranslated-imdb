Simply charming. It is long. There is no climax. Do not wait for nothing to happen. Ideal for a rainy day. About a man in a middle-aged crisis who takes his family to an isolated area of ​​the Greek islands. I saw this in my adolescence and I still love it more than 20 years later. However, I have not been able to find it in the video stores. Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then settles in the place. There are no telephones, no television, boredom, that when struck with that tranquility, the human condition is to get bored and then reflect. And each character does it. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to get involved sexually with the character of John Cassavetes, but he can not, well, you know. Gina Rowlands, is the wife who loves him, but is about to give up his marriage. It is demanding and frustrating for everyone. There is another character in the film, a Greek who talks inappropriately with Molly Ringwald about sex, but has curiosities about her. But he is irritating and horny and I did not like this character. The setting of the movie is what makes this film so good. It would not work if it were filmed elsewhere. I recommend this movie and I give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
