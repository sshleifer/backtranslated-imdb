It's a great movie (documentary) about Istanbul and its people and it's music of all kinds. The editing and success of the director is very impressive. I've been interested in Faith Akin since I saw the "Gegen die Wand" ("Head-On") ("Duvara KarsÄ±") and I really admired their work, but this has been the most touching for me, so I'm here writing this . It's not just about Turks or something, it's a very good biography of a city and we can say how the music is still alive in it. There are views of many people and very varied ideas about life and love. I really liked it and I think that everyone should see it, NOT ONLY, but especially those related in some way to Turkey ...
