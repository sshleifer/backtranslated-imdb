While I examine the hundreds of comments that the loyal readers of IMDB have published in this film, I find it very interesting how many comments there are "halfway". Everyone loves him or hates him. Having seen Apocalypse Now about 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how do we live without those digital magic machines?), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place. In my heart for this movie. "Why would you like a movie that is so confusing?" Ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality ... This is a classic history of society that protects itself from those who refuse to be in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual who has his own way of doing work. They (the Big Brother) sent him to do the work, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted "standards" of death and destruction (Am I the only one who is concerned about the fact that we have "standards" for death? ? and destruction ????), so they send the "Compliance Police" to eliminate the individual. Hmmmm ... Do you draw any parallels between this and the things you see every day? With the deepest respect for Mr. Coppola, who I think is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended his original intention of the film, and probably did not realize it until after the film was released . The subtle subtext that permeates the entire movie has too much to have been planned and portrayed; instead, it seems to have grown, like a wild flower in the middle of an orchard. Once again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a great job in this whole production, as did the cast and crew, but the sum of the film exceeds the individual efforts ten times. So, if you have not seen the film, fix it, look at it, then look at it again, and maybe a few times more, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then to judge the quality of the film. See those of you who have seen it, see it again with the mentality described above. I think you can have a new appreciation for the movie. Or maybe not! It does not matter if you love him or if you hate him, be sure to give Coppola credit for his masterful narrative style!
