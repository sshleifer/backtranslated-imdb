Hallelujah! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border (s) to show how Bogot치 and Colombia really are. I am an American of Colombian and French origin, sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others. <br /> <br /> How many of you know that Colombia is the second oldest and uninterrupted democracy in the world? world (after the US), or that has a vibrant film and television industry (to say nothing of Ugly Betty), which is capital, Bogot치 (Pop. 9 million) is the "Book Capital of the World", or that this beautiful city is the headquarters of the GREATEST International Theater Festival? I hope that Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (Mr. and Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeckis, Diane Thomas (Romancing the Stone) will one day visit Bogot치, to see how wonderful it really is, and focus on the vitality and cultural diversity of Bogot치 . instead of producing myopic films, like Maria Full of Grace, of which Joshua Marston benefited enormously (for this excellent film) without ever thinking about the ontological damage that his film would perpetuate in the "unjustly tarnished image" of Colombia. /> <br /> -By anyhow, at least you'll enjoy Bluff a lot! -Oh, and thanks to IMDb for your invaluable / great job!
