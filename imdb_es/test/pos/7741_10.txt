I love this film and all its aspects, well directed as a comedy and as a drama. The performance is tremendous, played by a stellar cast that plays the high society of New York to perfection. The landscape is amazing, totally impressive. I also love history: a successful New York architect who is going through a mid-life crisis leaves his wife deceptive and escapes to a Greek island to hide with her daughter who decides to go with him. I just can not express my love story enough about this movie. "Show me the magic".
