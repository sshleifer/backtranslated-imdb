I watched this drama on cable television. Although I only saw two series, I love this drama. I hope that more cable series will be broadcast. <br /> <br /> Although it describes a horrible and absurd situation in the prison camp, it shows an indomitable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They do not know if they can survive or not, but they firmly maintained their hope without feeling discouraged by adversity. <br /> <br /> I know that this movie is not realistic like other war documentaries, but I do not want to do it. I blame for it. It makes me believe the strong will of the people in the most difficult situation. <br /> <br /> 'Private Bill', especially, this episode played deeply in my heart. <br /> <br /> I remember each scene. I always hate math. But after seeing this drama, I can understand something about mathematics ... Mathematics is its connection between the past and the present, and they also symbolize eternity. <br /> <br /> 'Time, light and memory framed in a circle'. Br /> <br /> Like other victims of war, she lost her lover for an irresistible destiny. I am immersed in your time and your memory as if you were experiencing the same thing. <br /> <br /> He experienced the great loss but he has pure passion for study. <br /> <br /> He began his study at the camp, his joy of accomplishing, <br /> <br /> I think his dedication to the study sustained him. <br /> <br /> I saw it several times, but the meaning of this movie never faded. Every time I see it, I feel the same deep emotion. <br /> <br /> * Your songs are beautiful, harmonious, <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can not hear OST.
