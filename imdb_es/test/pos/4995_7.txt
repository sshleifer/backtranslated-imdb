I think the consensus is pretty unanimous about this recent television miniseries: it's fine, but it's a long way from "Loneome Dove." It is compared to the latter simply because it is a prequel to that famous story. <br /> <br /> "Commanche Moon" is definitely a watch for any westerns fan. Just do not expect it to be as intense as "Loneome Dove." Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play are not as strong as Duvall and Jones played the same two guys. Some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison, but you have to compare it: it's the story of the same two main Texas Ranger characters: "Woodrow Call" and "Gus McCrae." <br /> <br /> The main difference, I found, was that this prequel is much slower and more relational (the two Rangers and their women) sometimes. However, that did not matter to me because the two main women were pretty women and generally nice and nice people. They were played very well by Linda Cardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie"). They helped make this long film acceptable. However, if you've seen pictures of women in the Old West, none of them looked as pretty as Cardelini and Banks. They were a joy for these masculine eyes that gesticulated. Maggie's son, "Newt," was also a wonderful child, the kind of child every father would want ... <br /> <br /> The most interesting character, I thought, turned out to be "Inish Scull", played by Val Kilmer As in the western film, "Tombstone", Kilmer almost steals the show from the protagonists. "Scull" is really an original, if I ever saw it: a strange guy, by the way. <br /> <br /> Actually, all the supporting actors here did a good job, from "Deets" by Keith Robinson to Wes Studi as "Buffalo Hump". I always find that Studi is fascinating, no matter what role he plays. I wish I had a more important role in this miniseries. <br /> <br /> One thing that this film has in common with "Lonesome Dove" and other good westerns: landscape and photography. It is beautiful at times and it is a joy to see it. We also have an excellent director of this film: Simon Wincer, who directed "Lonesome Dove" and another prominent of the western television, "Crossfire Trail". He also made two of my other favorite feature films, both based in his native Australia: "Phar Lap" and "Quigley Down Under." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although I enjoyed this, "Commanche Moon" is not as good as the movies mentioned above. However, I still saw everything and regretted that it would end, if that makes any sense. I wanted to see Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: The title page says that this is 360 minutes. That must have included television commercials. The DVD version of two discs that I saw had approximately 4 hours and 40 minutes.
