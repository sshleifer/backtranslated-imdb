There is a lot of evil in this movie. I will not lie. I will say that most of the problems are felt as a result of a budget that was cut out from under the movie, and of a bad edition of hacking tasks. <br /> <br /> This is not Office Space. Do not wait for yourself in the Office Space comedy levels. Although it is very fun. It is a disaster, but very funny at the same time. A funny mess of a movie. In the way that Caddyshack is fun. A mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some funny and very annoying scenes. <br /> <br /> However, it works as a whole, and certainly deserves a broad release. This is the best comment about the nation of Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV you could expect. The fact that a movie is exploring the idea that silly people are playing at an alarming rate while smart people do not do it is great in my book. Not very politically correct, but at least it is worth a debate.
