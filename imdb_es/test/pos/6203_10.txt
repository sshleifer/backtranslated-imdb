It has the developments of drama, suspense and character that you would enjoy if you like the drama that involves you and entertains, in addition to educating. <br /> <br /> The writers know their material and it shows. Management is always attractive and is not lost, and the performance is excellent. Why this program did not win any awards tells me that the "powers that exist" in Hollyweird do not know the drama or much more. <br /> <br /> There is a plot twist in this episode, in the end, it was a complete surprise and it was played very well. I'm glad it was not used as a crash scene for any climatic ending of this series, which would have been more typical and boring. Rent this series at once! Hopefully it is brought from the extinction of celluloid.
