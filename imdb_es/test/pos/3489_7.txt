Alter Egos is no more fun than the creation of Ali G. de Sacha Baron Cohen. Completely deceived by his delirious and non-existent sense of the suburban environment of central England on which his social environment is based. He persists in living the style of a Los Angeles Gansta. While still living with his Gran in the London suburb of Staines, he maintains strict control of his Posse, the West Staines "Massiv". <br /> <br /> Spending his free time between me, Julie, his girl, the Posse and Teaching the eight-year-old local Scouts in "Keep it Real (Advanced)" lessons at the John Nike Leisure Center funded by government. <br /> <br /> This is where the story begins, and he is told that the government funding has ceased, Ali G then continues with a one man search "In the fight for justice, I am willing to leave my life, just like Martin Luther Van Dross did. " Being his response to the local media team when he interviewed him on a hunger strike while he was chained to a fence. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance here plays David Carlton, the sinister and devious Deputy Prime Minister, who is "Even more evasive than Skeleton."

Ali G suddenly becomes a sensation during the night and a savior of the people, working directly with the Prime Minister. The story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences. <br /> <br /> Ali G Indahouse is a great British film that brings together the enormously talented talents of writing, along with Dan Mazer, executive production and acting of Sacha Baron Cohen. Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, as the P.M. he plays his role with great seriousness between the gags and the hilarity that is Ali G. <br /> <br /> Ironically, seeing the parodies interpreting their role in a world that is really real, and that they continually preach "Keep it real" from his little world that is West Staines "Massiv" is a true comical paradox. <br /> <br /> Directed by Mark Mylod, his first full-length feature film since he directed television works such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show and the Smell of Reeves and Mortimer, to name a few. <br /> <br /> Very real and very funny.
