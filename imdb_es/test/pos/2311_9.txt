This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I have been in the water since I was 13 years old, so I had a lot of humor and I also recognized many of the landscapes close to the earth (the film, which took place around Virginia, was shot around San Francisco. Bay), especially the mothball fleet just east of the Benicia Bridge, where the Kelsey Grammar character was first introduced to the USS Stingray, and the San Francisco docks at the end of the film (including a boat in which I have worked up ). As other people have said, the actors seemed to have fun making this movie as well as entertaining it. The line "We are getting close to the bottom, sir! I can hear a couple of lobsters making footsteps" is, at least for me, invaluable. <br /> <br /> I am one of the many people who are waiting anxiously. A DVD will be presented in the form of a letter from Down Periscope.
