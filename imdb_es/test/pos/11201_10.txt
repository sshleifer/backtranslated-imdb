This is not a movie to impress you with a high budget, high-tech shots, fast camera movements or gleaming costumes thought by a too enthusiastic and hungry director. But it is a film by a director who is also a very good photographer, who has a good sense of seeing things as a human being, not as a half god unlike most of the directors. This is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best "performances" with unreal gestures and mimics or, in the best of cases, learned. Rather, it is a film in which they act in the most realistic way possible. Actually, they are not professional actors at all. The dialogues between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life. You tell the same lies to the people around you with the same remorse that you avoid expressing in words. It shows the same signs of discomfort to an unwanted host. This is the same sense of disconnection that is obtained in the modern life of the city. And this is your chance to see yourself from the outside, personified by the main characters. I saw all the films by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, incl. His short film Koza (Cacoon) thanks to those who put it on the DVD. Many will compare him to Tarkovsky, Ozu and perhaps to Bresson or Bergman, since he is becoming a true author. And he's sincere when he says that his films are not to make money but to give meaning to his life. That's the kind of sincerity you'll find in Uzak.
