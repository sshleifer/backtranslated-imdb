Although this movie looks like a Crime Thriller Noir, the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few twists or surprising turns, and those that do appear are not exactly shocking. <br /> <br /> However, if you leave the 'intense action thriller' mode and enter 'nonsensical entertainment', then this is a really fun movie, with several fun moments. Most of these can be attributed to the ingenious dialogue between the characters of Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, but with that said, Sadie said it all in her funny opening greeting to Friedman, and left very little else for it to develop between these two characters. The south accents of these esteemed British actors did not seem so bad to me (Ok, Thompson sounded like he was rolling marbles in his mouth while trying to speak in the south, but Rickman was surprisingly pretty good with very few minor mistakes in his usual accent on English) - if you want to criticize the accents - let's talk about Coco - he only spoke in the south periodically! <br /> <br />
