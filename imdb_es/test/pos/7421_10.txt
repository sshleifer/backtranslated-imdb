When the long 'Happy Ever After' came to an end, its characters - 'Terry & June Fletcher' were revived for the longest and most popular sequel - 'Terry & June', although their last names were changed from Fletcher to Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry has received a new job and, as a result, he and June move to Purley, where they end up in all kinds of scrapes: the unwanted guests come to visit at an inconvenient time, the boss he invites himself to dinner and Terry trying to risk his arm in DIY, but he piled it up every time. Another IMDb user described this program as "not smart" and "never well written". Fair enough, I was not smart, but that was the point. As for 'it is never well written' - some of the episodes were quite below the standard, I admit, but in general I found it extremely well written, very funny and very well acted. <br /> <br /> It was good-hearted slapstick, not unlike the later BBC comedy 'Keeping Up Appearances'. Eight different writers contributed to the nine series, which gives the program a wide margin of action. Terry Scott was a comic book genius, as he demonstrated in productions such as 'Hugh & I', 'Carry On' movies and, of course, here! June Whitfield was also a legend of comedy in its own right. <br /> <br /> I enjoy some modern shows, that is, 'Still Game', 'The Catherine Tate Show', 'Legit' and 'Empty'. I even enjoyed the 'alternative comedy' - 'Naked Video', 'The Young Ones' and 'The Comic Strip Presents' but I'm more inclined to enjoy classic comedy, like this one. The humor in which you do not need to think is excellent for when you feel dejected and want to get up. For the record, 'Terry & June' was something wonderful. A special note should be made of the melody of the catchy theme that captured the humor of the show tremendously well!
