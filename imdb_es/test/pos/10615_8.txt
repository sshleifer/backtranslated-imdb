*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It's easy to see why the script of this movie won an Oscar. At least during the first half. My head was spinning around all the nimble lines that flew by. Noel Coward plays a New York editor ("Why do not you publish the books you like?" - "What? And you corrupt the public?") That charms and manipulates their many hangers. Then he dies in a plane crash and the story becomes a strange takeoff by Flying Dutchman in which Coward must find someone who really cries before his soul can rest in peace. Very nice until it gets weird. Seen at Cinefest in Syracuse in March 2003.
