As far as I know, this was my first experience with Icelandic films. It's a great relief to see something more than your usual Hollywood movie. Pity that films like this have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. I can only hope that people see this by accident, by recommendation or another ... <br /> <br /> Because it's really worth it. I left the cinema feeling very sad. I could not get the tragic fate of the characters out of my head. And I was even more impressed when I thought about the complexity of the movie. Not only was it a tragic story, it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, look at it! It's really stimulating and it made me reflect a lot. <br /> <br />
