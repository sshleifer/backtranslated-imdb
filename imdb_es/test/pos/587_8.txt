I really enjoyed the MUPPET movie. It was the first of the Muppet films and is by far the best because it is very creative and fresh. With later films, the ideas just did not seem so original. But here, we can see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding bikes (an incredibly difficult scene), an excellent cast and a lot of fun. I loved every minute that the Muppets performed and I would have rated the movie much higher, except for one serious problem. In this and in most of the subsequent Muppet films, some powers felt the need to include many non-Muppets, in particular, many, many cameos by stars. Some worked well (like Charles Durning), but many seemed irrelevant and stopped the image to a halt. Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was an incredible man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew, but the small scene in which he was found was not necessary nor most of the cameos. However, despite this great complaint, it is a great movie for the whole family, from children to the most demanding adults.
