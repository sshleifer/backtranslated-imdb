La Antena, an audacious film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, is as successful as a reinvention of the silent film genre and an exciting cautious story. The stage is a city that does not like meaningless television, its people deprived of the power of speech, except for a solitary and mysterious screen presence known simply as La Voz. In an attempt to cement their control over power, the wonderfully evil duo of TV mogul Mr. TV and the mad scientist Dr. Y set out to kidnap The Voice and turn their unique talent towards their own cowardly ends. It is up to a young family and the voiceless and anonymous son of The Voice to stop this evil plan. The result is a roller coaster of a story that is disconcerting at times, but never less than fascinating. <br /> <br /> This is a silent movie that has many of its influences on its sleeve; Open references to big silent movies like George Melies and Fritz Lang will be evident to anyone who has a passing familiarity with their work. But the most subtle references and symbolism are behind such tributes. I especially like the fact that Mr. TV and his henchman handle the typical gangster cars of the 1930s, drawn from the decade when the silent film era became extinct and a very different industry began to emerge. <br /> <br /> La Antena extracts the clich√© of plot devices and the theatrical overacting common to so many silent films, although in a very wise and humorous way. It is the surprising visual style of La Antena that really sets it apart from the films to which it pays homage. From the hypnotic TV logo to the threatening transmission station on top of a hill, this film is full of a dazzling visual inventiveness that is the rival of an animation by Studio Ghibli. and all this with real actors and handmade sets. <br /> <br /> In addition, although the style is often intentional and theatrical, this is a disturbing, provocative and emotional image. The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena gives an additional resonance to the struggle between the TV Empire and the waning power of words. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original, including the hypnotic swirl of televisions and the nightmare television food factory. <br /> <br /> I hate to finish this review with a bitter note, but I feel that the English release of La Antena is disappointed by the subtitles. The original Spanish subtitles are used with great effect, with much play with words on the screen. However, the English subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete, with omissions and errors that sometimes leave the viewer to put things together for themselves. The Antenna is, nevertheless, a surprising piece of cinema. a visually stunning experience that shows great energy and humor while narrating a powerful warning story.
