This movie is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made. It is a story told at a constant rate, told mostly not by words but by means of cinematographic expression. The perfect combination of spectacular special effects and classical music gives life to the creations of the human imagination in a realistic and poetic way. The story itself is quite simple at first glance. As the title indicates, there is an archetypal journey, a motif that is repeated for thousands of years. This motif was always used not only to represent a journey in space and time and beyond, but also had a rich philosophical meaning. The film is a poetic contemplation of the most exciting eternal questions. It is not just a person's odyssey; It is an odyssey of our species. The film is great by itself, however, in my case, the impression of it will always mix with that of the book. I read it at the age of 10, I do not really think about problems like "what is the relationship between the evolution of humanity and the development of human morality". But the impression was big enough to make me fall into the whole genre of science fiction. <br /> <br /> The day I learned '2001' only got Oscar special effects and was not even nominated for Best Picture, it was the day that 'Academy Award' completely became two words that did not mean nothing for me
