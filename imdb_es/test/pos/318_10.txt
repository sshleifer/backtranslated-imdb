The first time I saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 was when it was first broadcast on British television. I was dumbfounded after seeing this masterpiece and, despite the close competition of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, this film is still my favorite of all time, almost 20 years after I first saw it <br /> < This leads to the problem of how I can even start commenting on the movie. I could praise the technical aspects, especially the sound, the editing and the cinematography, but everyone else seems to have praised (rightly) these achievements to high heaven, while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noticed, and all the others have mentioned the rigid images of the Dou Long bridge and the assembly of the boat upstream after passing through the border. <br /> <br /> How about the script? Francis Ford Coppola is better known as a director, but in all cases he is a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director. I said "I was" in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned every creative brain cell in your head. but his sacrifice was worth it. In the original solo project of John Milius we have a script that is as insane and disturbing as the screen, but Coppola's participation in the script has injected a narrative that exactly reflects that of the war. Check out how the script of every jingoist and male begins with a star turn by Bill Kilgore that would not have been out of place in THE GREEN BERETS, but the more the story progresses, the more shocking and demented everything becomes, so much so that true. the time comes to Kurtz, since the audience is watching another movie in the same way that the characters have navigated in another dimension. When Coppola says "This movie is not about Vietnam, it's Vietnam", he's right. What began as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid-1960s on the stage of the film (Manson's trial suggests it is 1970) changed the United States' vision of the world as well as of itself and the vision of the world of America <br /> <br /> It is the crazy beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterpiece of cinema and says more about the brutality of conflicts and the hypocrisy of politicians (what did you do in the Vietnam War, Mr. President) that Michael Moore? I could hope to say in a life. I have not seen the REDUX version, but seeing the original impression, I did not feel that there was anything missing in the story that, like all really great movies, is very basic. In fact, the premise can lend itself to many other genres, such as a western in which an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who is leading an injun war party, or a science fiction movie where an assassin the UN is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who is leading a resistance movement on Mars, although it is probably due to Joseph Conrad's original novel <br /> <br /> My favorite film of all time and is very appropriate that I have chosen this film as my thousandth review in the IMDb
