This film is based on the true story of the Iowa housewife, Lucille Fray, who contracted breast cancer after the birth of her tenth child. Realizing that the state would take children away from her ineffective and alcoholic husband, she spent the last year of her life traveling around the state to find new homes for each of the children. An excellent script, which is still preserved 20 years after its first creation. The adult children, many of whom had not seen each other since her mother died in the late 1950s, met in "That's Incredible," before the film was broadcast in 1983. Barbara Stanwyck won the Emmy for best actress in a television movie or miniseries, but during his acceptance speech, he did everything possible to release Ann-Margret for his moving performance.
