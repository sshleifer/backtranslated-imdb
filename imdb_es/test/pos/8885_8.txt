When I saw this movie as a child I did not understand the premise of the Hitchcock films and dark comedy. Now that I am about 20 years old, it makes much more sense. <br /> <br /> I think the reason I like this movie is that the comedy duo of Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito make an interesting comedy, both the slapstick (the scenes of the pan and the car) the verbal (arguments / conversations about murder and writing). <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Larry Donner (Crystal), a writer with difficulties who have been robbed of his masterpiece. of him by his wife Margaret (played by a surprisingly radiant Kate Mulgrew, also known as Capt. Janeway of Star Trek: Voyager). <br /> <br /> While switching between the writer's block and the creative writing class, he meets with the student. Owen Lifts (DeVito), an aspiring writer and mom's boy who grew up too sadly still acting like a child. He has toy train tracks, do I need to say more? Think of Failure to Launch, only Matt McConaughey is short, fat and bald. <br /> <br /> Owen is stuck in his own life, with a demanding evil mother (Anne Ramsey) whom he can not stand. He seeks Larry's advice on how to get out, and when he says that to go see a Hitchcock movie, Owen realizes that if he kills Larry's wife, he will return the favor and kill his mother for him. The hilarity occurs while the two try to deal with the other's problem. Owen goes to extremes to kill Margaret, while Larry, who refuses to accept his part of the plan, goes crazy over Owen's mother. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Larry and Owen form slowly but surely. A bond of friendship that is rare in dark comedy today. One part of the movie that I really loved was where Owen shows Larry his collection of coins, and let's say it's more of a sentimental collection than anything else. <br /> <br /> Apart from the two main stars, the late Anne Ramsey is as funny as Mom, and mortal with that cane of her. She is much more comedic verbally and physically in this, unlike her role as Mama Fratelli of The Goonies. So she curses like a sailor and belittles her son at every step, but that's what makes her character so vivid. She turns her character into the kind of person you love to hate. <br /> <br /> Another delight in this film is the music of the great jazz Brandford Marsalis, who plays Larry's neighbor and friend, Lester. There is a great moment in the film where he plays jazz for Larry, who is depressed and needs some good melodies to alleviate the pain. Jazz can do that. <br /> <br /> In closing, I wish Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito would make another good movie together, but he's a bit too old for the game, I'm sorry to say. This is one of those rare movies where both stars shine in a subtle way. DeVito's children's comedy and Crystal's sharp wit made this movie for me. 5 star comedy
