The plot of "In the Mood for Love" is quite simple: a married man and a married woman (though not among them) slowly develop a romantic bond between them. The pace of the movie is quite slow and very little really happens between the two. However, the background of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and the keen sense of director Wong Kar-Wai to capture the beauty of the stage, as well as the main characters, make it a joy to see this movie. The actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are excellent, and Wong Kar-Wai has done an extraordinary job to capture the feeling and nostalgia of the past (something that many films and directors try to do, but generally fail miserably). There are so many small details that add charm to the film (a registered trademark of the director) and the colors and cinematography are what make this story, otherwise, so simple, a wonderful cinematographic achievement. 9/10.
