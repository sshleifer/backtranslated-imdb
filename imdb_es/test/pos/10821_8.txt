I was in the mood for a French movie and I saw it on Blockbuster. What a little gem it turned out to be! I'm not sure how I missed Gregori Derangere all these years, but he's fantastic. What innocence and grace! I love your face and the way it moves. Isabelle Adjani was very funny; It reminded me of Nicole Kidman's performance at Moulin Rouge. She looks the same as 20 years ago ... really remarkable. Gerard Depardieu has not kept up so well, but his performance continues to surprise. It's perfect in this movie. I probably bought this, I enjoyed it a lot. If you want to see another great French movie, rent Joyeux Noel. Wonderful.
