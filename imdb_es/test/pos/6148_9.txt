An example of great filmography. The epic story of three main stages of life for a child told with eloquence and crudeness without fear. Rarely does a movie appear that makes me say it out loud during most of the visualization, "this is a really good movie ..." over and over again. That's exactly what happened when I saw this movie. I really do not understand how anyone can like it. In those moments I found myself crying and laughing at the same moment, unable to control what I felt about the scene. The performance is outstanding. Eric Mabius, why is not it on every movie screen? It was really extraordinary. His seemingly effortless attempt on the screen impacted me in a profoundly visceral way. I appreciate it. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmmakers in the world, and I hope he continues to face the challenges he faces in trying to give us art in the face of fierce commercial filmmaking. <br /> <br />
