In many ways, this film defines the essence of everything I love about cinema, in terms of capturing those strange and evasive moments of unguarded truth. In other ways, it is undeniably an amateur and unfocused result of drug addicts who cheat with a camera. Ultimately, it arises somewhere between pure brightness and instability (fortunately much more than the first than the last). A part of me wants to reward her solely for her absolute innovation and moments of pure sublimity, but at the same time I can not completely ignore the openly horrible and sometimes openly bad "performance". At first, the editing seems overwhelmingly sloppy and unnecessarily distracted (or maybe just plain "innovative" wrong), but after a while I got used to it, which is, in the end, the real sign of whether a movie succeeds on its own. terms or not. I guess that answer basically sums up my general feelings for the movie. That is to say, in spite of its insurmountable failures, in general it works very well. And, at the very least, a movie like this really shows how false and false the false-documentary and shaky style can sometimes be when applied as obviously as an effect (as in films like Roger Dodger would otherwise be admirable). Here the aesthetics is clearly derived from the needs of the filming situation, and not only is it arbitrarily used to make it look "great".
