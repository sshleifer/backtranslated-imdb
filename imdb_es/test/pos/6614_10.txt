I remember when skateboarding had its rebirth in the 70s. I begged my parents to give me money with a second hand skateboard from a friend. It was a scrap piece, complete with clay wheels and everything. I also remember reading the Skateboarder magazine and being completely impressed and totally terrified of the Dogtown team. Skating never became a way of life for me, but somehow it has always been part of my life, whether it's using a board to transport me or just having a group of friends skate. <br /> <br /> This film is a brilliant documentary of the true birth of modern skating. Seeing this team spinning in the skating from the boring and flat passage that was towards the vertical lifestyle, has turned my mouth open for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's surprising that there are still enough shots of this period to have created this movie, and thank God for that. The images are bright. I got the feeling of seeing an old movie by Buster Keaton: I've seen some of the tricks that Keaton repeated countless times in other movies since then, but when you come back and see the first person to do that trick, it's surprising that, No they were only the first person to try it successfully, but they lived it and made it seem effortless. That is the feeling that this movie gave me. Yes, I have seen people skating in the pools before, but seeing the FIRST people skating in the pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like seeing the fa√ßade of the house fall on Keaton, leaving it standing in the frame. of a window. It is absolutely brilliant to see something that, until that moment, had never been tested before, but since then, it has been tried and tested by almost everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a movie. This is a movie that will attract people if they like to skate or not. I've talked to a couple of my friends who had their girlfriends sit in this movie after a loud protest, and they all said their girlfriends were hypnotized at the end of the movie and they loved it as much as they did. <br /> <br /> Regarding the previous comments in this forum that complain that the movie is too self congratulating, I think it's an unfair scorn. I liked seeing these guys get excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. They have the right to pat themselves on the back. They were stars for doing what they liked to do. Most of these guys / girls never achieved the amazing success that Tony Hawk enjoys today, but that kind of success was not available to skaters at that time. Of course, they had some success, but more importantly, they have been able to live a life doing what they like to do and, as we see in the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or work in surf / skate. industry. How many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have succeeded in breaking all the rules and doing what we like to do? They can. I take my hat off to Dogtown and Z-Boys for being themselves and changing the world of skateboarding forever.
