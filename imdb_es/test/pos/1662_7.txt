You can take the thief out of the joint, but it seems much harder to get him out of the joint. We have seen this type of character in these types of situations before (and since then): in films like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times to mention. What helps make this one of the most notable is (of course) the robbery in itself, which develops without words in real time, and the behavior of the leader. Bogart would think twice before crossing this guy. The ironic ending adapts perfectly to this story (it almost demands it). All around, one of the best noir movies.
