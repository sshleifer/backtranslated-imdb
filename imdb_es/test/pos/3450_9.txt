Pity the poor critic who did not like / did not understand this wonderful movie. What a sad life he must lead! <br /> <br /> This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most of the ones I've seen, but it's not dark or preaches like the kind of "ordinary people" movie. It is above all humorous, although technically it is not a comedy. <br /> <br /> Everything seems a bit like a fantasy, maybe Shakespear's "Summer Night's Dream". Beautiful and intelligent women abound, with a wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting script that does not lose the rhythm. <br /> <br /> I hope to see it every time this movie is seen again on the cable. It's like going back to reading a favorite and precious book.
