Having reviewed 3 of the 4 comedies by Perry and Croft, I thought I was going to do them all now. Dads Army, is my favorite comedy of all time. It is not half. Mom is also a classic, as is You Rang M'Lord. I do not consider Hi De Hi as a classic, but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> It is a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, they are yellow coats. It is run by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well-meaning man, but he has the personality of a sock. The staff includes the entertaining entertainment manager Ted, his partner Spike (he ended up being thrown into the pool in almost every episode), the yellow jacket Gladys, the careless maid Peggy who longed to be a yellow jacket and the man from Punch and Judy, Mr. Partridge, who hates children The situations occurred mostly around the pool, where he would throw himself at someone in each episode (with clothes on, of course). <br /> <br /> It's not a classic, but it's fun. Jeffery Fairbrother went to the middle, so this, a bit like Only Fools and Horses, exceeded his welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat in Butlins. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Peggy's Big Chance, series 2, episode 2.
