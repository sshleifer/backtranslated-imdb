As in the last ten years or even more, the whole world is flooded with so-called comedies (actually, very few deserve this title because they are very predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and surprisingly funny alternation. It is about the daily life of a delivery man and his wife who works as an assistant to a lawyer in Manhattan in Queens, NY. With them lives Arthur, Carrie's father, an extrovert of picture books, played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the show to everyone else every time he appears. Other important people are his best friends, Deacon and Kelly, a married couple, and his other friend Spence, who is almost 30 years old and still lives with his mother. What makes this show so unique and fun is, above all, that each character seems so real and Carrie's cynical and sarcastic attitude is the opposite of Doug's kind and foolish optimism. And Arthur is the one that makes it absolutely unpredictable with His strange ideas and habits. He often gets into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to get him out of the mud. Even if, in my opinion, the quality of the program has decreased a bit in recent years, it is still one of the best daily comedies. It takes a little time to get into the characters and relate to them, but after that, you get some unstoppable laughs. Although I think I could not survive a day with Arthur in a closed room without removing his guts, I really adore him in this show. Look and have fun, I give it a 9 out of 10.
