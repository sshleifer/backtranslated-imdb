CONTEXT is all when one is going to rate a movie. When rating this movie one has to consider the moment it was made. We really did not know WHAT was the inside of the EARTH in those days, so you can not get too angry about the movie because of the plot (based on a much older book). For the era, these were first class special effects and the production quality was excellent. I saw this movie in a master of HD restored with expertise. At the moment, the makeup and effects almost make the guys in the rubber suits look plausible like a monster. This is pure full-film cheese with bad rubber suits, models and spooky costumes. AMAZING. PD Doug McClure ROCKS!
