HOUSE CALLS was a fun comedy from 1978 about a widowed doctor (Walter Matthau) who now wants to play in the field, but he can not help but be attracted to a patient of his (Glenda Jackson) who refuses to be just another notch in his accommodation . Matthau likes the woman but does not really want to make the commitment that he insists on, so he agrees to go out with her exclusively for two weeks and then decide whether or not he wants to commit; however, other complications make it difficult for Matthau to make a decision after the two weeks have passed, even though he is clearly in love with the woman. Matthau and Jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and receive strong support from Richard Benjamin, Candice Azzara, Dick O'Neill and especially from Art Carney as inept and senile chief of staff at the hospital where Matthau works. Matthau even has a brief scene with his real-life son, Charlie, who appears as Jackson's son. This sexy comedy still holds up pretty well after all these years. If you've never seen it, it's worth the rent.
