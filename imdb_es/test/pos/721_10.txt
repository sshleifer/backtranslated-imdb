This is a cult classic for sure !! <br /> <br /> It's hard to follow at times, but, again, so is a movie like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want a standard rate, then I guess I'm going to rent the Care Bears movie or maybe an old Disney classic. But if you want to "see the world differently," then I would say that you open Enigma's and, in fact, a movie that challenges what we see and think. <br /> <br /> For me, the key is that the film was original and made me question all the time. So, although I've seen some complaints, in general, I'd say take the movie as it is and enjoy it.
