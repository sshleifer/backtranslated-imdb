DO NOT TORTAR A PATRON (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972). <br /> <br /> Definitely, a prime candidate for the most insane film title ever conceived and that is quite an achievement in Gialloland. Originally, the film was titled even more absurdly, "Do not Torture Donald Duck", literally translated from its Italian title. A small figure of Donald Duck appears briefly as a toy, but not enough to represent a title like this, but, apparently, was changed for fear of the legal ramifications of Disney. I fought quite a lot against the previous LEGGING ON THE SKIN OF A WOMAN by Fulci (1971), but here all the right ingredients are present. A surprisingly effective mystery, a good cast and an imaginative shot against an unusual rural environment. Everything just clicks. I think it is rightly considered one of the director's most accomplished achievements. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the context of a small mountain town in Sicily, where someone is killing young teenagers. Among the suspects, the most obvious is a young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously by unearthing the skeleton of a baby and putting pins in the shape of effigies. Guiseppe, the idiot of the town is also under suspicion, since he made a feeble attempt to take advantage of the disappearance of one of the children and entered directly into his trap. At the moment when an ingenious newshound (Tomas Milian) arrives from Milan to cover the murders, he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions, when he meets with two other possible suspects: Don Alberto, the local priest (Marc Porel) with a high-level attitude, and Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a bored young woman from the city with a problematic drug offensive past, who also believes she has sex with young people in the city. Talk about your main red herring. <br /> <br /> Fulci contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly built elevated road that meanders through the Sicilian hills, past ancient cities where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. One could debate the political stance of the film as The North vs. The South, or as a commentary on the virtues of small towns, the conventions of society in general, which are often dangerously close to turning to moral disintegration, chaos and, ultimately, self-esteem. Justice for the people. The film has often been criticized for its anti-Catholic tone, but here it is not an important element, except for obvious reasons related to the plot, which would be revealing too much. Actually, it is quite docile compared to a film like Joël Seria's NO DELIVERY OF EVIL (1971). Probably, the rather unflattering depiction of the film of Sicilian values ​​of a small town (when another child is killed, the local population is represented as a lynching of retarded people) could be a cause of some crime in Sicily, but, considering the problematic relation of Sicily with the rest of Italy, hardly problematic for other Italians, it seems to me. The film vanished in the darkness too fast to have a big impact anyway. <br /> <br /> When talking about Fulci, the amount of blood is usually a key issue for the debate. Although missing scenes that draw attention, the film contains two very graphic scenes. In the total ending, the killer falls from a cliff, breaking his face against the rocks on the way down with frightening results (though not very realistic). And the chain sequence with Florinda Balkan in the cemetery shows Fulci's inclination for sadistic violence and, in general, he is not refraining from showing graphically what most filmmakers would simply insinuate. Surely, one of the most horrible scenes in Fulci's repertoire. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a small, tense, well-written and effective mystery, very well focused by Fulci, with an impressive cast of regular genres such as Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not very convincing as a priest ), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (mouth full of madness like the witch of the city). <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
