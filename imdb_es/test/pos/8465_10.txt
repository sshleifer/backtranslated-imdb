The fact that this film has been shown at Barbican in London suggests to me that the impression must have been acceptable enough for such a projection. Now the question is: Why is this important and lost movie not available on DVD (or even VHS)? A lot of people in Europe and the United States have waited for many years to see this movie, if only because of the wonderful music written for it by Sergei Prokofiev. What needs to be done to make such a wonderful production available to a wider audience, not just for Barbican customers in London? After having been a devoted listener of Prokofiev's music for many years and aware of this movie, PLEASE, someone "out there" does the right thing and presents it as a DVD.
