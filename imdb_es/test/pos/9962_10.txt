My guide for the quality of the film is if I'm still thinking about it after leaving the theater. I keep thinking about this the next day, which does not happen often. <br /> <br /> The landscape (a reasonable assumption for sixteenth-century Italy), the costumes, the lighting, the cinematography are excellent. It is a beautiful film visually. <br /> <br /> The characters can never stand out from the script they should recite, but these actors made the most of their material, which is excellent. This is one of the best works of Shakespeare, in which people will continue to enjoy another 400 years in the future. All the directors were interesting and nice. <br /> <br /> Those who say that this is anti-Semitic must be deaf and blind. In any case, it is anti-Venetian, from the 17th century Catholic. While Shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the injuries he has suffered, it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame. The script clearly puts your personal responsibility where it also belongs. <br /> <br /> A great movie.
