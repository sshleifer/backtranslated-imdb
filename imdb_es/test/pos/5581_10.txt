Somehow, I missed many of the first episodes of Farscape, so I see them in all kinds of orders as they are repeated on several channels. I caught her for the first time, completely by accident, while she rested in a hotel room. The first 10 seconds had me completely hooked: this is SF. <br /> <br /> The characters are strong; and Moya / Pilot the living living is what Lexx should have been. The plots vary in quality, but none falls below excellent in my opinion. And I have to mention Rygel, what a gloriously irreverent character! None of your extravagant Star Trek aliens coated in sugar here, this is the real deal: cynical, selfish and full of disgusting personal habits, Rygel is the creation of a genius. <br /> <br /> Last week, the SciFi Channel showed "Out of their minds" (the episode of exchange of bodies). A true classic, I could not stop laughing from beginning to end ... <br /> <br /> For a long time Farscape adorns our screens!
