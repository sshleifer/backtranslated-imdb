Another one of the endless amount of films of 'Kickboxers Fight to the Death' for the fun of the rich Scumbags that there were so many in the 90s ... You know, those created by taking the words 'Death', 'Blood' and 'Steel' and the words 'Ring', 'Fight', 'Match' and 'Cage' and put them in a random generator! That said, however, Death Match is a very good entry into the overuse genre, thanks to its exciting fight scenes and the surprisingly good performance of its kickboxer cast. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends - ex- The kickboxing world champion John Larson (played by the pug-faced middleweight kickboxing champ Ian Jacklin, probably formerly known for his horrible acting as the main villain in Ring of Fire 2) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, a sympathetic guy probably best known for the role of street fighter Sergio in Bloodsport 2) who works on LA docks loading boxes on ships. A discovery of a box full of weapons and a brief fight later, our two heroes are unemployed and support a bar of L.A. The sensible John Larson decides to head north and look for a job; stubborn Nick Wallace has heard of a guy who pays good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches. "Why should things change?" John says: "If you need me, I'll be there." As expected, it is not long before Nick gets lost and his good friend is fighting on the deadly "death ring", trying to find a clue for his lost friend. <br /> <br /> Indeed, there are no awards for originality here, but as I said before, this film has its strength in its action, in its cast of real life fighters and in the good performances it manages to take from them. Ian Jacklin in particular surprised me. Previously, I had seen him as the bad guy in Ring of Fire 2 and in small parts in Tripe as The Steel Ring, and I have always had a lot of fun how bad he is as an actor (even if he is a good fighter!). But in Death Match, he's pretty good! Given a decent script and a haircut, it shows that he is a charismatic leader! And his friendship with Nick is very well portrayed. Jacklin and Hill have good chemistry and you really think these two characters take care of each other. Enough so that one of them loses a job, travels through half the country and rises to death to save the other. I wish I had a friend like that! <br /> <br /> It was also nice to see Matthias Hues as a villainous villain with a little more depth than we are used to seeing in his many villainous villain roles. However, do not be fooled into thinking that it is the star just because it is on the cover of the video (it seems that it has the head stuck in the body of Michael Bernardo of the cover of Shootfighter): it is good while it is on the screen, but not It's in a lot ... <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the movie is pretty slow when there are no fights, with lots of unnecessary scenes (what's the useless gangster Jimmie Fiorello story about his grandfather?), and the final fight is disappointingly short, but overall I enjoyed it! Many fights, mostly good ones. Is not that all we really need martial arts? And, of course, goodies, here in the beautiful form of the very pretty Renee Ammann. In short, a very entertaining kickboxing movie.
