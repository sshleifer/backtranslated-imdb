A demon, of a tree, is removed in the form of a human man to make love to a young maiden so that she dies. The demon's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall on a bed he had created especially for his object of desire. The bed consumes the blood and its hunger remains ... everything that comes into contact with the bed is consumed! This was explained to us by one of the victims of the bed, a painter whose soul is trapped "inside", one of his last works, the artistic representation of his final resting place (... he was dying of consumption, coughing up blood, deciding to die on the deathbed). You see the painter, whom we can see as if he were trapped in a small room looking through his painting, unfortunately a viewer of the meals in the bed. The bed has a dark sense of humor, and we see that this allows the painter to live, even giving him jewelry and other possessions that were once owned by victim food. The skull of a victim grows bright red flowers, not far from the basement that houses the bed. The film presents three young women who are in the mansion that houses the basement that contains the death bed. The painter (Dave Marsh) could have a method to destroy the deathbed, but it will include a human sacrifice to resurrect the body of the one whose death caused the hunger in the first place. Patrick Spence-Thomas provides the soft and depressing voice of the trapped painter, narrates the film, regrets his current situation, tells us about past victims and, often, scolds the bed for his predatory nature. <br /> <br /> A A definitive and genuine cult film. I hope your status skyrockets now that DEATH BEDS: THE BED YOU EAT has found its way to an audience (like me) that appreciates the weird and the grotesque. The bed itself contains a type of liquid acid with a tone of apple cider in which we see objects and human beings (.. fighting for nothing) consumed. Many can recognize a young William Russ (BOY MEETS WORLD, THE UNHOLY) in curls, looking for his runaway sister, finding her in the basement, as a zombie and traumatized (... of course, Julie Ritter was so largely in that way general, movie, in trance, barely uttering a word) with the two trapped. In one of the most insane scenes in the film, Russ tries to stab the bed just so his hands are trapped in his grip, the flesh is acidified and only skeletal bones remain, and the cartilage deteriorates. There is an attempt to escape by a victim whose legs were trapped in the bed, almost outside the basement when the sheets returned to his belly where he belonged. The film feels almost completely surreal as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold. Director George Barry often jokes about the victims who are in the most unfortunate position by choosing the deathbed as their place of refuge ... the painter reminds us of the different people who were eaten. There's really nothing like this movie anywhere, it's definitely one of a kind.
