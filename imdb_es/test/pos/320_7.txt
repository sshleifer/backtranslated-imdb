Play Bollywood's epic melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who learns that she is adopted and is determined to find her biological mother. The biggest success of the film is the performance of P.S. Keerthana, who plays the girl. The first half of the movie is very good. There are also some really good songs, especially the number that presents the protagonist. Unfortunately, the second half of the film, which takes place in a Sri Lanka devastated by the war, feels like a completely different and disappointing film. It's big on explosions and special effects, with Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels dodging grenades, fleeing from fireballs and being ripped off by trick wires. All the film can offer is a cheap image, such as: "Someday peace will have to come" and "Maybe children will find a way". The final sequence, where the daughter and mother meet, is good, but so exaggerated with music and a downpour in time that seems like a trap. I know, I know, everything is Bollywood style. But this is a story where great moments simply detract from the simple and powerful central story. Bollywood could certainly also use a little moderation at times.
