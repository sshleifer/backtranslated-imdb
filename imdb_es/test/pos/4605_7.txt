When I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff in the cast, I expected to find a typical 1950s horror movie. The opening scene (a graveyard with a wolf howling in the background) seemed to confirm this. However, once I began to see it, I discovered an ingenious mystery about an Englishman (Richard Green) who sought to discover what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the Black Forest and, if necessary, to take revenge on them. . the evil Count (Stephen McNally) who ruled the territory. Chaney, like the Gargon without a voice, had a rather limited role (one that reminded me of the Hunchback of Notre Dame, actually) while Karloff had a somewhat more important role as Dr. Meissen. In fact, Meissen was one of the most interesting characters in the film, and until the end it was difficult to know if it would be considered good or bad. The whole castle was magnificent, and even the limited representation of the Black Forest was real enough. Certainly, it was not presented as low budget, compared to other movies I've seen anyway. The only disappointment, I thought, was the performance of Rita Corday as the Countess. It seemed somewhat dry and did not seem to put much passion on paper. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, I found that this movie caught my attention the whole time, and there was enough suspense about how this was going. It turns out that it's worth seeing. Definitely recommended, with a rating of 7/10.
