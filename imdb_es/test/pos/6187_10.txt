For some perverse reason known to themselves, these IMDb boards seem reluctant to recognize the great Billy Wilder as co-screenwriter in at least two (East and Ninotchka) of their early classics when any amateur can spot Wilder's hand at work. . As it happened, this represented the first time he partnered with Charles Brackett (who HAS a credit) and it was a great start. One commentator has noticed how satisfying it is to see this type of movie in outdated cinemas and I can not agree more. In Paris, one of the smaller houses of Revival shows in one of his works a retrospective of Lubitsch more or less continuous, and I am pleased to report that this had a very grateful audience throughout the age spectrum, although I doubt there is any alive when it was first launched in 1938. The famous Wilder schtick the meet-cute is particularly tasty here when the millionaire, but carefully, Cooper tries to buy half of a pajama at a department store on the Riviera and runs into the Sales resistance until Claudette Colbert appears and agrees to buy the other half. The gag is milked even more when, after having exhausted the chain of command in the store itself, the manager calls the owner, who is in bed and leaves to reveal that he is also wearing only the top top of the pajamas. The film is full of visual guts like this, balanced with a verbal wit that makes it almost perfect. Claudette Colbert is tremendous and gets a great endorsement from Edward Everett Horton as her impoverished and titled father. David Niven in the fourth place of invoicing has some "business" fun, like Franklin Pangborn and if Gary Cooper is not up to his role, as it does the verbal skills and sophisticated personality that Wilder requested at this stage of his career , you may not have everything and what you have is almost perfect.
