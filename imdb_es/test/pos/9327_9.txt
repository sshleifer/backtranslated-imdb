No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson himself, you can not deny that this video is the most exclusive video of all time. There is no other video that is even remotely close to "Thriller". The first time I saw him was when he was 6 years old and I was very scared. Now I see it with a smile because now I can appreciate the wonder it is. I love this video and it will be available as long as there are music videos. I think everyone should sit and watch it when it's on at some point and look back and see how good it was, especially for being 1983.
