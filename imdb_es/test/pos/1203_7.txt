(May contain spoilers) I am disappointed with the criticism that this film receives. While it is true that it is not perfect, it is much better than what is attributed to it. The acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, "Where do I go?", "Easy to be difficult" and "Black Boys / White Boys". While I have not seen the music scene, I think it clouds the judgment of many. This is not the musical you see in theaters. Do not try to compare them. The theatrical musical could have been sensational to watch, but it would never have had the same effect on the film, so a plot had to be added. And the ending that has been added is simply amazing. The film made me feel that I had actually seen something important, unlike most movies today, which only satisfy one level.
