The favorite trio of all imbeciles go crazy in a hospital in this incredibly scandalous and often hysterically funny game. These guys are, without a doubt, the most incompetent group of doctors who have ever crossed the screen. The comic aspects include the Stooges constantly breaking a door glass, their encounter with a deranged patient who claims that the rats used to come out through the buttonhole of his shirt, the Stooges riding through the corridors on a giant bicycle, a huge horse, and miniature racing cars, and our sublimely stupid trio accidentally leaving instruments inside the abdomen of a helpless patient after they finish operating on the poor man. Director Ray McCarey tells the frantic comic shenanigans at a frenetic, uninterrupted pace and stages the slapstick's wide gags with considerable enthusiasm. Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard are at their peak, with the excellent support of Dell Henderson as the patient and patient supervisor of Graves Hospital, and Jeanie Roberts, with a shrill voice, is a hiccup nurse (the scene in the Stooges make an absurdity the impromptu group along with this girl is absolutely cutting-edge!), Ruth Hiatt as whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as the ranting mad patient, and "Little Billy" Rhodes as a small patient fighter. The crazed madness never stops for a minute, which makes this baby beautifully crazy one of the best exits of the Stooges.
