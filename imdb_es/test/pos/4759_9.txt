I was born in '68 with little guidance from parents as to what I saw on television (as a child in the 70s). I always loved this movie (and the French Connection) and I would always try to catch it when it was on (check the TV guide on Sundays ahead of time). I bought it on a DVD a few years ago and I've seen it twice since then, and I must say, I STILL LOVE IT! Roy S. was a great actor of the 70s (Jaws is one of my favorites of all time, Marathon Man, etc.) and although the 7-ups is not an Oscar-worthy film, it puts you in a moment in one place (NY, in the early 70's, as did French Connection) and it gives you some difficult characters and a vision of life as a policeman at that time. And yes, the car chase is one of the best of all time.
