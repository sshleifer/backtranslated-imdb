My first Ichikawa in many years, and the first of his war films that I have seen, was exciting and brutal from the start. In the first scene, the nominal hero Tamura is told that he can not continue with his unit, to which he has returned from the hospital. Apparently he has TB? but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him, given the number of war wounded they have. But your old unit will not return it either; his officer gives him a grenade, and tells him that if he feels really desperate to blow up, it's something honorable. <br /> <br /> The Philippines, 1945, and the situation really seems desperate, for PFC Tamura and everyone else. Nobi is an odyssey through hell, or rather hell? naked forests, dead rocky plains and dead and dying Japanese soldiers waiting for only one end, through peace or death. Ichikawa's film is photographed in an impressive field of action in black and white that serves to highlight both the desolation felt by Tamura and the people he meets on his journey to his destination, and to show how truly small and naked all are in the middle from the immensity of mountains and forests. ? This little matter of humans will end soon, the earth seems to say, but I will survive and I will hardly notice it. <br /> <br /> Tamura travels back to the hospital, but is (not surprisingly) rejected there. and he spends the rest of the movie trying to stay alive, stay human and get out of danger. He does not manage to do it very well for any reason, dies slowly from hunger and eventually commits some pretty repellent acts. Finally, he gets hooked with two other desperate men who have lost or survived their units and have resorted to cannibalism and, in his weak state in front of other armed men, he finds that the only way to live is to break everything he believes. . in. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's movie is as brutal, intransigent and intense as any war movie I've seen. There are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and do not remain in memory, like the scene with the man on the top of the mountain who practically begs Tamura to eat his flesh, the recurring black comic touch with Tamura exchanging his broken shoes for the best skins of a fallen comrade ... the degradations that humans will endure to survive ... the truth that this is a war, all wars, all of humanity as long as we continue like this. A masterpiece that I probably will not see again for a long, long time. Seen through the beautiful DVD Criterion Collection.
