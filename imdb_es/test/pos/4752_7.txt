This film is not about soft drinks, nor is it the French Connection. <br /> <br /> The Seven Surveys are a group of elite police officers who use tactics that do not conform to the protocol of the New York Police Department. Scheider leads the group with his gang or regular-looking joes. They're conducting surveillance on a local scam poster and things go wrong when a policeman's wire is discovered. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the most evil looking man in the movie (Invasion: America, Little Nikita) and his partner ends up killing the policeman by accident and escapes Scheider in the chase scene Cooler than I've seen, Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as one on the West Side to George Washington and the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey. <br /> <br /> The trick drivers are great and Lynch makes him free, although he seems scared by the dangerous journey. Roy Scheider almost died when his car crashed into the back of the Mack truck and ripped the roof off. <br /> <br /> Things come to a critical point and one has to keep looking to follow that sequence. Fast and intense movement, fresh for thirty years.
