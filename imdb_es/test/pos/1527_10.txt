This is an amazing movie and is very intelligent when using the few actors and scenarios. It is also very shocking: physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implicit) is mixed with calm and even humor. So the horror is always unexpected, and brutal. I'm not soft, but this would have to be the most shocking movie I've ever seen. The message of this film is finally delivered with a hammer. This is the movie for which I will always remember both actors.
