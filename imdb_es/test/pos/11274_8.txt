Anyone who correctly identifies the initial images as if God committed suicide without reading the final credits definitely deserves a free ticket for a rest home in Transylvania. I imagine that this would be a favorite movie in the dark inn of "Twin Peaks" in the movie night if time existed there. I would think that a better title could have been: "How much fun can you have with someone who is almost dead in the forest with only Neolithic technology?" The answer, it seems, is enough. So, in spite of the stupid "God killing himself," the super-pretentious (an appropriate phrase taken from a previous letter), more clearly "Alistair Crowley - Hi, I'm the Beast, treat it!" beyond Christian cosmology (I can not believe that another viewer had a thick head to see the Judeo-Christian Bible on this) ... despite all that ... this is a bold and important work that most people I should not see. I'm impressed and scared that it was done.
