"Fame" had been one of my favorite movies for years! It's not just an 80s musical movie from "that" New York high school, it's LEGENDARY, people no longer refer to the High School of Performing Arts but to the "school of Fame"! <br /> <br /> The characters are real, they are not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film follows them throughout the four years of school, beginning with a powerful monologue of a student at the auditions and ending with a spectacular graduation show. <br /> <br /> Apparently, some find the Broadway show better, however, it is my opinion. You should definitely watch this movie anyway, and then have your own view. For anyone who enjoys watching movies and would like to have "classics", this is surely one of them. It is an example of one of those films that was really great, with actors that we loved during those 2 hours, and then we never saw them again ... they are "famous students of Fame". <br /> <br /> make Fame lives forever.
