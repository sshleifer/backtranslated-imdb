It is particularly difficult for a director to capture the making of movies without getting precious, pure, dramatic or all three. Breillat skillfully demonstrates the instinctive methods of an author's lizard-brain by extracting from two "bovines" (as Hitchcock called actors) a love scene of fiery intimacy. Its main battle is with its protagonist ("an actor is really a woman", he thinks), although, naturally, it is the protagonist who will steal the show. I do not agree that this is Breillat's first comedy. The 'romance' was fun at several points, but I accept that the French sense of humor may be hard to find for foreigners; In fact, dozens of critics of IMDb did not detect comedy in Romance. On the contrary, Sex Is Comedy provokes a lot of laughter, mainly by using the support of an actor that goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks. We asked ourselves, leaving the theater, if the "beard" of Roxane was a wig. A lovely performance by Anne Parillaud as Breillat struggling with her own script, looking ten years younger than her age.
