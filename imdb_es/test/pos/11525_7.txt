As a father of four in his forties I thought that this movie was a compelling vision, if not that it was on the edge of the seat. I deserve a much higher rating than the 4.3 I had when I wrote this. (I gave him 7). <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the comments about the characters, but Cameron Diaz, again, shone in another very different role. The plot was a bit silly, but the point of the film for me was beautifully summed up in the final sequence, quite surreal. A touching ending for any parent. <br /> <br /> I could imagine that a single young man might find the film quite boring, but for other people who do not look at high doses of testosterone they would find something sweet in this.
