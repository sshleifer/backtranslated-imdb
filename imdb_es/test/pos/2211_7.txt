We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is nice, friendly, she smiles often, but she is strangely brutal and honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot and wise sister has been reciting original poetry, which is exciting the community with the sister's writing. Unfortunately, it is Evie's poetry. While her mother begins to be happy again and the boy next door shows her interest in Evie, Evie just tries to find out what she really wants to do. <br /> <br /> What you have to keep in mind when watching this movie is who. Evie really is. For such a brutally honest person who does not mind telling the Ivy League guys that she does not respect them, it would seem strange that she could make a lie. For someone so happy and cheerful, he has no emotions when it comes to certain topics. These are not defects of the characters, are a development of the plot and mean much more than they seem at the beginning. <br /> <br /> It is mostly a melodrama: a character lies, the personalities of the other characters. Drive them through drama while relationships are put at risk. But in terms of writing it is very fresh and bold. The acting helps the writing very well (maybe the idiot sister and wise could have played better), and it's a real joy to see her. <br /> <br /> Management and cinematography are not so good. They are acceptable, and Evie's world is wrapped in color and light, which creates some very beautiful images, but it is not very consistent. It really is not so much a defect as a result of a low production value, but within that same value there are some genuine stories and a true concern for the characters. So, while it's not a perfect movie, it's certainly a nice movie. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
