I am a glutton for series films. I love the old Drive-In rate like this movie. This movie, made for very little money that seems, does one thing that some higher budget films fail. It's cheezy It's bloody. It does not have a real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. Either I laughed or covered my eyes in shock. There are some great effects, such as a shot from INSIDE of a man's mouth when he is stabbed in the chin by a knife and it peeks through his tongue and crashes into the palate, and one of them comes out with a guy who gets his eyeballs retreated. But there are also a lot of zombies, and some psychopathic killers modeled after the Texas massacre and a demon possessed a scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that murderers emit while torturing and killing people. It has a great camera work, and some interesting editing tricks. This is more original than the first bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it still follows the model of those grumpy zombie movies of the 70s and 80s, and still has a factor that has a high rank. Do not wait for Romero, only the second-rate Fulci. I would say that Horror fans will like it, and it's fun and joyful and a quick trip through B-movie Land.
