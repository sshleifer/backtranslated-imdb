Very beautiful love story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very strange and funny. An entrepreneur (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B.Blethyn). They try to fake his death to escape from their husband and the village. Start a scenario of strange situations. As good as SAVING OF GRACE and LIVE LIVE NED DEVINE.
