Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who has spent years working in a steel factory, as a maintenance man, that the Italian owners are selling to the Chinese, arrives at the end of the meeting where the purchase is being organized because he wants to tell him the new. Buyers of a defect he has discovered and he believes he has the solution. He does not exactly fall in love with the old Italian administration, or with the new Chinese owners. He even fights with the translator about the exact term he wants to use to express his concern. <br /> <br /> The next thing we see is that Vincenzo comes to China trying to get in touch with the new owners. To his surprise, there is someone new in charge, since Mr. Chong, the man who tried to warn in Italy, has been fired. Your next quest is to reach the woman who was the translator, Liu Hua. He finds her working in a library, but she tells him that, in clear terms, he blames her for being fired from his post. Liu, who sees Vincenzo's desperation, agrees to accompany him to find his steel plant. <br /> <br /> In this way, Vincenzo and Liu begin a journey through some of the desolate fields that involve traveling by train, steamboat, bus and truck, to remote parts of the giant country. In the best of cases, finding the right factory turns out to be difficult to achieve, but Vincenzo discovers a life that is completely foreign to him, as well as finding a kind soul who does not hesitate to help the Italian, despite his initial dislike for him. . . <br /> <br /> Gianni Amelio's film is a kind of travel notebook. Take the viewer to unknown territory. Some comments compare Vincenzo with Marco Polo, the great Italian traveler, although the similarities are not so tangible. The film keeps our attention in the early stages of the trip, but it begins to be less pleasant as Vincenzo is left stranded after separating from Liu. Amelio is an interesting director, as clearly demonstrated by this film for which he worked on the adaptation of the novel by Ermano Rea, which we have not read. <br /> <br /> Sergio Castellitto is the only reason to watch the movie. This versatile actor contributes a lot to the film, which, in some way, is a tour de force for him, as seen in almost all the pictures in the picture. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto proves to be a winning combination. Ling Tai, who is making his debut as Liu Hua, has some lovely moments and shows good chemistry with his co-star. <br /> <br /> Luca Bigazzi photographed the Chinese landscape in all its desolation. We see a China that is not pretty postcard. Mr. Bigazzi captures all the gray, so typical of the areas where the film is developed. Franco Piersanti's musical score serves the film well.
