This is really fun. I really enjoyed it, even though it was nothing original, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were very good together! All the characters are great, and the story is pretty good, in addition, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy are simply amazing in this! Rene Russo is excellent in his role, and there's a lot of laughter in everything (especially when Deniro fakes the lines of Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover), and the ending is just great. Yes, it's just another streak in the "Buddy Buddy" movie, but it works because of the fantastic chemistry between De Niro and Murphy! In addition, he also had some great car chase scenes. It's nothing really good, however, I found it very fun, and a perfect way to spend some time! However, the main villain was very weak and was not very good at all. This is far from being the best "Buddy" Buddy "police film, however, it's still a very entertaining movie, and I thought it was very well done and written too! Also, the ending was quite fun! I enjoyed it very much, although Robrt De Niro and Eddie Murphy were very good together, I recommend it a lot! The direction is very good Tom Dey does a very good job here, good camera work, great angles and keep the film Robert Deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is hilarious, very nice, he had a fantastic chemistry with Eddie Murhpy, he did his usual amazing things, they took some really funny faces, they seemed Have fun, they had some fun lines, and they had a really cool character! (De Niro Rules !!!!!!!) Eddie Murphy is also amazing here, it's hilarious, like De Niro did his things div As usual, he obviously loved being in front of the camera, and while he can do this, Ff in his dream he was still very funny to watch! (Murphy Rules !!!!). Rene Russo is fantastic here! He had a great character, and although he did not have much to do, he added a lot of presence on the screen, and made his character always interesting, it was great! (Rules russo !!!!). William Shatner is funny here surprisingly and was not overdone, and caused some laughs in the movie. The main villain is fine, but a little weak and rather insipid, he still did what he had to do properly. The rest of the cast does it well. In general, I recommend this one! *** 1/2 out of 5
