This movie surprised me. The box is deceptive, the slogan is deceptive and the costumes and tone of the film are deceptive. The film is quite bloody, well acted and beautifully shot. The special effects are first class and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize that this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 as its tone suggests. It is a unique version of Dr. Moreau's story and one of the best filmed versions. The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film never falls apart. Definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the costume / horror and gore-fests classics.
