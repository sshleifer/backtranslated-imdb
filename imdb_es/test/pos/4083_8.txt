I captured this on local Mexican television at 2:00 am and decided to give it a try, since it is based on a real-life case that deals with the murder of the typical All American family (a father, a mother and a small child ). ). <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the indications point to that Walker is the murderer since he had great differences with his father. Soon after, when Walker and Luke are taken to the Sheriff's Department. When examined by the lie detection machine, things are very different ... <br /> <br /> Also, when Walker and Luke attend a meeting with their father's lawyer, they find out that Luke would receive $ 200,000 and Walker is out of the heresy. Luke immediately buys a convertible. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an excellent mystery film that deals with betrayal, ambition, feelings and cold and very cold blood. <br /> <br /> I know the real thing The names were changed but still the experience is the same. Try this movie I know there are HUNDREDS of "based on real murders" or similar events, but this one is truly worthy. Pure quality in acting, direction and plot.
