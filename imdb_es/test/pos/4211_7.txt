They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of a previous Warner Brothers movie, The Life of Jimmy Dolan, starring Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the film's professional wrestler. <br /> <br /> Even with the restrictions now in production by In the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly misinformed as a pugilist. John Garfield, with his background and style, delves into the role in which he was born to perform. <br /> <br /> They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley, whom Jack Warner believed in keeping busy among musicals. In fact, Berkeley would soon leave Warner Brothers to go to MGM. <br /> <br /> Berkeley does a good job here, keeping the action flowing at a good pace. I particularly like the scene in which four of the Dead End Kids and Garfield swim in a water tank and are stranded there when the water level drops. They take it out of it in a very limited way and with a good wit. <br /> <br /> Other performances, besides Garfield and the children to remember, are May Robson, who runs summer camp for children and Claude Rains as the obsessive detective of The Garfield Trail.
