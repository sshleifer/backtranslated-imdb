Thanks to The FilmZone for showing this sleazy soft sex movie at 1 a.m. I really enjoyed it. To be honest, I expected much more from a sexy cast with McKayla, Dru Berrymore and, of course, the talented Chloe Nicholle (as Rebecca Carter). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are really bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort would not hurt. For example, cinematography makes it look like a hard core porn movie. There is absolutely no effort in lightning. But ignore that fact because we are honest, we saw "Pleasures of sin" due to the high amounts of sex. <br /> <br /> The sexual factor is quite good and offers hot and explicit scenes. Chole Nicholle offers the best performance of the female cast. <br /> <br /> So my advice is, watch this movie if you're in the mood for a good sex explicit or just look if you're a fan of Mrs. Nicholle. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for sex scenes; Do not expect anything else.
