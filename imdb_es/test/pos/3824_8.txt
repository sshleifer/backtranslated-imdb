No, I have not seen the original series and I will not compare the two if I had them. This series was filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well written in a different story every week. Some are scarce, but most of the time it is the quality of the narrative. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the episode of Deprogrammers with the irresistible Brent Spiner as Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves of a kind of reptile lizard. It's funny how lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V, but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed to serve the alien species on earth. The stories are usually a little out there but very entertaining to watch.
