Upon entering this film, I was a little cautious. I've always been a little iffy about claymation movies. I've always liked decent animated movies, but claymation was always different for me. But this surprised me. Wallace and Gromit are very adorable characters, and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. There are silly jokes of burp / fart for children and subtle, but over the heads of young children, jokes for us, the elderly. Claymation very neat and although the story had holes, kept my interest from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days, this movie was even more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit are going to do their normal job, which is to HUMANLY exterminate the buggers that ruin the horticultural crops of the people. But this time they are fighting against some form of giant rabbit that their humanly constructed traps can not even keep under control. Great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun. If you have not exposed yourself to Wallace and Gromit, I recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I qualify it with a 7 and no more is because it's still a family movie and I do not have children. I enjoyed it, but if I had been watching it with some carpet rats and my wife, it sure would be at least a 9! Give it a shot!
