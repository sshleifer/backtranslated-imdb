I'm glad that Cage changed his name from Coppolla and got this part on his own. In a good mood, you do not need a deep thought, but a nice piece about the opposites that attracts, although his parents are still hippies ... Capture the voice of the early 80's, the groan of the valley and the funk of the other side. One can see the beginning of Cage's talent.
