Look, this is a low budget horror movie that suffers from all the problems that accompany low budget movies. But you should see this just to see Lisa Erickson as Julie. She is sexy and a great actress! These types of horror movies often discover a rare gem and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! Nothing I enjoy more than sitting in my studio with a Coke and putting this movie. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree ... Lisa is not only brilliant, she is a hottie. The film itself often progresses with difficulty and the rest of the actors are not very useful in that regard. But as soon as Lisa gets to the screen, things really start to get better. The others clearly are not in their league. This is not the Exorcist, but as I said, if you want to see a small and funny movie with a small and sexy actress, this is the only one to see!
