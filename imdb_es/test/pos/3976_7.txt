I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little out of rhythm, everyone in the making of this film achieved a nice movie, good for many, a laugh. The writing and the jokes are much more literate than I expected. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors who do a good job, all of them. <br /> <br /> The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from "Ed" and Apple's new computer ads. He had just become an actor in "Ed", and it was excellent here. He is a natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who does not throw punches. He's on "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central once every two weeks, but he really shines on HBO's "Red, White, and Screwed." I regularly find it on the uncensored comedy channel of XM Radio. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. Whether your speeches and lines here are written or improvised, it does not matter. He has no price delivering his thoughts on the anguish of the middle class. One thing about Black's delivery, his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. It seems he's having a conversation with you, and I think that makes him unconsciously more effective.
