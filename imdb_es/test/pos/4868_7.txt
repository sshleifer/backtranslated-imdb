Chuck Jones' 'Beep Beep' (named after the fact that the Road Runner clearly says "Meep Meep") is the second of the exceptionally popular Road Runner series and is a big improvement over its predecessor, the historically important but without brightness. Furry-ous'. While it features several predictable rapid fire gags, 'Beep Beep' also expands on that initial caricature with more ambitious and longer sequences. The main one is a fantastic and extensive chase through an old mine where we see the Coyote and the Road Runner represented by two small lights. There is also a funnier joke that involves some rockets. 'Beep Beep' also sees a great improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote. Not only does he look more handsome than his scruffy prototype in 'Fast and Furry-ous', but he also attracts the audience to the cartoon with a greater amount of looks to the camera to indicate the brightness of his idea or his fear of the imminent pain Although it's a little slow to get going (too many shots of planes make the rhythm difficult in some of the first gags), once 'Beep Beep' arrives at the sequence of the mine shaft, it is clear that Jones was really beginning to understand This the characters and the greater possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better Road Runner cartoons than 'Beep Beep', but there is a real sense of triumph over this caricature, as if it were the confirmation that there was a series that should be eliminated from this scenario.
