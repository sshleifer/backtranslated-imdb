It occurred to me as the final scene of the film froze to reveal the scant detail of Buddy Holly's death, that there are still people alive today in that place in Clearlake, Iowa, who remember it vividly. That has to be a disturbing memory, granted even more touching by the lyrics of "American Pie", as it pays tribute to the day music died. The world lost a tremendous talent that day, short lives before its best, and one can only wonder what would have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day survived to create an even greater musical legacy. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie today, some thirty years after its original theatrical release. Thirty years, I have some problems to wrap my mind around that. I had forgotten much about that, while remembering some of the little things, like the cricket on the wall that was immortalized with the name of the band. But above all, I remember the music. It's hard to just sit there and not start playing the rhythm of "Oh Boy" or "That'll Be The Day", and you have to wonder where the threat to our morale could really have come from with those melodies. I'm with Buddy at least in that aspect, how could the rhythms of the jungle be if it occurred to them? It is curious how each successive decade brought its own threat to the fabric of society: The Beatles, Motown, Disco and a whole host of other musical forms. We keep listening and dancing to the rhythm, so I guess they could not have been so bad. <br /> <br /> There was another revelation of the movie that I had forgotten. This is where I learned to hit a phone on the table when the person on the other side did not see things my way. I have done it several times over the years, but by now I had forgotten the source. Well, it should be fine for another thirty years or so now. <br /> <br /> You certainly have to give Gary Busey credit for his interpretation of Buddy Holly. Seeing him today, one could never imagine him as the rocker thinned with horn-rimmed spectacles, but it was a characterization and a performance of the strength of the force that earned Busey a nod to the Oscar. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are competent as members of Buddy's band, although their characters are behind much of the story. I enjoyed the subtle ways in which other musical legends were incorporated into the image, names like Sam Cooke and King Curtis, never stopping in their presence. <br /> <br /> I will always be a fan and follower of the music of the fifties and sixties, as they are called "oldies". I guess that also makes me a little old, but you can not replace the experience of growing with the history of music that now reaches the big screen. What only serves to reinforce the idea that I will continue to enjoy the music until, well, the day I die.
