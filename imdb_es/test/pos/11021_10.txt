It is worth seeing this film: Robin Tunney stands out and Henry Thomas shows that it is one of those rarities, the child "actor" that grows to become a true actor. The characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth, they might have been unconvincing, but all the actors are simply amazing. The cast of this film has to be above "Girl, Interrupted" (both films, by chance, star in the brilliant Clea Duvall). The music and music selections fit perfectly, and there is a lot of action to prevent the film from becoming a character study. If you want the story, you will not find it in this review, but I will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.
