"The man who knew too much" falls into the middle ground of Hitchcock that characterized many of his films during the 1950s: not a masterpiece of suspense in any way, but a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day play a couple on vacation who are caught in a plot full of foreign intrigue. The famous climatic scene takes place in a classical music concert, where someone will be killed during a clash of cymbals in particular in the score. The rogue Hitchcock, of course, lets us know what that point is, so the race to stop the killer becomes a nail-biting race against the plattador. / Goldie Hawn comedy "Foul Play" I have to believe that the movie was inspired by this. Neither movie is important, but both are easy to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
