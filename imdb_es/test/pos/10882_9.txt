This game is not exactly the best N64 game ever. Sure, it's good, but only when there are 4 players. Without 4 players, the only fun thing is to take remote mines and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game are levels where you have to save Natalya, so you'll have to limit the use of remote mines at those levels, and that gets pretty boring. The graphics do not quite reach the level of Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you're talking about a great multiplayer in a first-person shooter, you'll have to choose Perfect Dark. At least you can play "multiplayer" by yourself.
