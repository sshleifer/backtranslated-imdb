This film went into production before the Second World War began, but it was not released until it was already underway. With a significant fascist sympathy in the USA. UU And Chaplin himself as a suspected Communist sympathizer, The Great Dictator was a very brave effort. Such risks in the making of films, political statements little veiled, would be almost inconceivable today. Would I imagine the consequences if someone made an equally satirical movie today that criticized the foreign policy of the United States? <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious, moving and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin makes an order to end the madness, but it is too late for him and for us. A must if you have any interest in history, cinema, politics or satirism as an art form.
