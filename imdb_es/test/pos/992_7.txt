This is mainly about love in World War II, but we must remember that it is also a biographical film for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage of his life. <br /> <br /> The timing of the movie is just great. It really captures what I think the spirit would have been during those times; Smiling and hoping you will not be bombarded. While it may be boring for some, the movie has a particularly dangerous advantage. <br /> <br /> At one point, my heart was racing towards the end when the movie reached its climax. It really presents some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors. Cillian Murphy is in good shape here, as is Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and makes it an interesting watch. The relationship formed between the characters of Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley is wonderful and we have to act as thanks (and be alert to a cameo of Suggs of 'Madness'). <br /> <br /> Despite all this, it's a fairly slow movie. Coupled with the fact that there are only two hours left, it is quite difficult to reach the conclusion. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a solid and non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully elaborated moments that undoubtedly helped The splendid amount of well-known British names behind the scenes. But it really does sometimes too much. Still, a watch that is worth it. 7/10
