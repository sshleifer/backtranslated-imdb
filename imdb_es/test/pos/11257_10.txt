I just watched this movie tonight (November 5, 2005) for the first time. I wanted to see it because I saw the basketball diaries (Leonardo Di Caprio) and I loved it, but this was much heavier. I think he had a good representation of drugs to a certain extent. I identify mainly with the character of Nick Stahls, probably because if someone I was crazy with was in those things, I would like to help them out. A promising student and athlete who spends all his time training and studying; Well, it is understandable that he wants to try adolescent life (his craziest side) and in his efforts, what begins is to help his friend, ends up being addicted because he wanted to see what it is about and due to his horrible family situation that results in his most tragic death. A really sad movie, but one flaw that I noticed is that you do not have a good enough view of the damage it causes to families, but other than that, excellent performances in a truly moving film.
