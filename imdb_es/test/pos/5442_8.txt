A political satire of a comedian (Williams) who after dissuading political campaigns and presidents is forced to run. But surprisingly we won and made fun of the office. "Man of the year" is not the funniest movie nor the best, but in small doses it works. Williams again teamed up with Levinson after a hit with "Good Morning, Vietnam." The two seem to have a great chemistry and work against each other. I'm not comparing them with Scorsese and DeNiro, but you can get the image. Although I would not say running away to see the movie in theaters, I would recommend renting it. This movie is a comedy, but it also has a great satire, please, if you like movies like "Scary Movie 4", it's not for you, take your brain to see it. - ***
