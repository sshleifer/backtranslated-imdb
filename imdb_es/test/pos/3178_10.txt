Up and Coming was a very positive comedy, which brought a tool or a channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and perspective was a message of positivity for our people and hope for change. I advise this selection so that every American household experiences the struggle and the reward. The program never had the opportunity to flourish the idea of ​​middle-class blacks becoming owners of their own businesses. The issues were so compatible with real life situations that they impacted the lives of so many. I sincerely hope that the entire volume can be restored and put on a DVD for Americans to enjoy with their families. <br /> <br /> Thanks.
