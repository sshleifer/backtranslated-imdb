Sleeper Cell tries to swim on both sides of the pool (terrorism / American patriots), and does not do very well. <br /> <br /> I had postponed watching this program for a long time, because I had a feeling that it would be too predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue, I finally moved it to the front. <br /> <br /> The program is about an undercover Muslim man who works for the FBI in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The undercover agent in the program is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflict / resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. Personally, I would have preferred to see a drama about a Muslim American family living in the United States, but it is doubtful that a television channel (cable or network) in America will produce something that will show Muslims in a flattering way. <br /> <br /> I am not a Muslim, but I have many American Muslim friends, and I can honestly say that none of them is a terrorist and that everyone loves the United States. <br /> <br /> The sleeping cell approaches bankrupt Stereotypes of Muslims, but also focuses on the worst Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode we see a "murder for honor", which is a very poor portrait of Islam, but in the third episode we see a highly respected moderate Muslim scholar who teaches the viewer that true Jihad is actually a personal struggle that does not means to incite violence towards others. <br /> <br /> If only the moderate Muslim scholar had been the main character of the program. <br /> <br /> Americans need to learn much more about Islam, Sleeper Cell helps a little, but it is far from giving the US audience what they really need to know. <br /> <br /> That said, the performance in this show is excellent, and the drama is extremely fascinating. If only they had done this show about Islam in America without terrorism, it would have been first class.
