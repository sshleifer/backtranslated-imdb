I'm torn by this show. While most parts of it looked like HILLS, other parts of it seemed stupid and I was just surprised by the shock. The parody outside the wall of some of the cartoons is brilliant, since in fact there are many scenes with children. However, I do not think it's smart to make small children say rude things. It's not that I think "oh, poor children, they're being exploited", it's really not smart! It is something that ANYONE could do, so it is as simple and useless as making a paper airplane. To improve this show, they would have to stick to the natural responses of the children, which I think can be more fun than the script at the moment. <br /> <br /> By far, the most fun part of Wonder Showzen is Clarence, the blue puppet who wonders through the streets talking to strangers and annoying. It is very fun and mostly improvised. Seeing him in a long scene about the importance of the patience test, the patience of a man EXTREMELY patient, was, by far, the funniest scene in my opinion. <br /> <br /> You should see this show because, in general, it is very funny, although sometimes it is stupid.
