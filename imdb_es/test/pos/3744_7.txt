Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, lets his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) does not respect him and loses a patient who is operating. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers that her husband has cheated on her. Both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful inn by the sea in Rodanthe, at the same time that she reserves a room. They are all alone together. You can find out the rest. <br /> <br /> This is what is known as a whining or a women's movie. It is beautifully shot with a romantic atmosphere and many quiet scenes. There is tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an edifying ending (more or less). The great performance of Gere and Lane helps to disguise the fact that this movie is not really much. Each bit of the frame is predictable. I rolled my eyes at some of the events. It's also too short: I did not believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. If it comes out of nowhere and moves VERY fast. Still the movie works. The inn itself is absolutely beautiful and I was crying at the end along with the majority of the audience. So it's a predictable but beautiful movie with a wonderful performance. He does not deserve all the criticism he is receiving. I give him a 7.
