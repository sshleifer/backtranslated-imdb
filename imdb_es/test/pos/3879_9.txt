He made one at Christmas to try to recover a number one song, and now the great Justin Lee Collins wanted to bring together the cast members and maybe some team from one of his favorite television shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member who could not get was the late great George Peppard, who played the main character, Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try to help. He managed to gather all the members, including Dirk Benedict (Lieutenant Templeton "Faceman" Peck # 2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (HM Cap "Howling Mad" Murdock), Melinda Culea (Amy Amanda Allen) ), William Lucking (Coronel Lynch) and Lance LeGault (Colonel Roderick Decker, the only member of the team that died). He spoke with Mr. T (Sgt. Bosco "B.A." Baracus) in an early interview, but was not available to appear at the meeting. It was really fun to see him trying to find them and talk to them, although they probably did not want to, and the meeting, of course, is the great climax. Very well!
