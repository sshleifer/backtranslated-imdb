Due to its predictable second category title, (at least the one that was distributed in Italy) I did not expect much from this movie. I thought it would be another cheap movie about a haunted house ("LA CASA MALEDETTA" means "La casa maldita"). Well, I had to change my mind right after the first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the spooky atmospheres reminded me a little of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian scams, but this was going to be something completely different ... This is more like Hitchcock meets the Italian thriller! Very well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot ... Well, I tried not to spoil the visualization of "7 Hyden Park" for you, which I strongly recommend to all. <br /> <br /> P.S. Am I wrong, or when Joanna crawls or tries to get up (is she paralyzed from the waist down) her feet and legs move too much? (... And I'm not talking about the "bad dream" sequence.)
