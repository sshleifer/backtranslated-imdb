It is generated distorted black and white images. It seems that it could have come from the 19th century. However, the sound is very clear, less synchronization and the addition of calm sounds of nature. <br /> <br /> This movie was very critical with the struggles of life. It shows a single mother and child in a violent world that thrives on the innocent. The mother is very alien to her environment. This leads to a lot of torture, pain and death. You can see it many times and see different symbolisms, layout devices and basically "what does it mean?". <br /> <br /> If you appreciate art in movies, then you will love it. Otherwise, do not bother.
