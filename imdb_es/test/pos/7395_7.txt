Jack Frost 2, is probably the most cheesy movie I've ever seen. The full title of the film is Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman. Fans of horror movies who have a taste for the story lines, will be happy to see this. This movie was direct to video, and for good reasons. Here's why: The acting was so outrageous and so terrible that it could make you cry. The main character had no personality, and the actor's bad performance made things worse. The script was, it was also atrocious. Each character always says a cheesy line, and adds the cheesy lines to the bad choreography, then you have something bad. Second, the story line is not really that impressive, but since this movie was direct to the video, it's forgiven. The director and the writer could have turned the idea of ​​a killer snowman into something great, but they did not. History has many plot holes. At first, a cup of coffee falls into the fish tank, with the Jack Frost melting. Scientists try to restore their life, but they could not. Once the coffee cup fell into the tank, Jack Frost was completely restored. Now he is immune to antifreeze. In part 1 of Jack Frost, the main character's DNA was mixed with the antifreeze that was used to kill Jack Frost. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is also allergic. Therefore, here is my point. They say Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's. But, one of the scientists had some saliva in the cup, so when it fell into the tank, the scientists' DNA would have merged with Jack Frosts. Another thing, the special effects were not very good either. Here are the positive points: Jack Frost 2 has a lot of blood, which seems quite realistic. Even though this movie has flaws in hell, it's still entertaining. In general, Jack Frost 2 is a nice horror movie. The first was better, however. 7 out of 10
