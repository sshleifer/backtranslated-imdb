Excellent performance of Mary KAy Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekah Johnson. Splendid story that surrounds you in the film, emotional, but cheerful. I own this movie and everyone with whom I've shared it, they love it. Excellent for mixed companies, more than 18 people. <br /> <br /> Good production, it is not a cheap budget, it is well organized and keeps your interest. He uses new dome ideas, for flashbacks, and at one point keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat. <br /> <br /> No matter what lifestyle the viewer is in, they will accept entry to one or more Points of View in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would love to see a sequel!
