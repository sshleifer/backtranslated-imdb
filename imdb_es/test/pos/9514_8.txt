In fact, I caught an advertisement for JAPAN SINKS in a Japanese magazine last year, and I wondered what the hell it was until I saw the trailer for the movie. It was then that I remembered that I had seen the English translation of Sakyo Komatsu's novel some years ago. I got it, and it was pretty good, as well as chilling and realistic. It is enough for the reader to be afraid to hear news about earthquakes in Japan. <br /> <br /> Now, I read the book and saw this version of the 2006 film (the first movie came out in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was pretty good, even if there are major changes from novel to film (but that's understandable). The story is simple: an important tectonic change will cause Japan to sink within a year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis shake the country as frantic efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. A scientist has a plan that could stop the country from sinking and save what is left of the landmass, but can it be implemented in time? I saw JAPAN SINKS at Otakon 2007, and while I had a couple of problems with that, it was a bit long, and a couple of moments of the characters were too stupid. However, I was impressed. The whole concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea became terribly real, and the effects were some of the best I've seen, rivaling everything Hollywood has done. The film also does not have favorites with the main characters, and some do not reach the final credits. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I have been surprised by some of the negative comments that have been made about this film. Difference of opinions, I suppose. Personally, I enjoyed it. And I have read the original book.
