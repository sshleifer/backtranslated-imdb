This is a really great and beautiful movie. The underlying theme of this film is the innocent girl (Heather Graham as Joline) who struggles to make her naive wishes about how the world should be made sense while the real world hits them incessantly. However, it is not an unhappy movie, exactly the opposite. It's a funny movie with a sad side, but just thinking about the movie makes me feel very happy. Near the beginning of the film, the beautiful and vulnerable Joline faces a drug addict who tries to get into her friend's car. She reasons with him, convinces him to seek help and gives $ 30 as a start. At the end of the film, he reappears to pay her, explains that he has no drugs, that he is fine and that he is grateful. I can hear the cynics moan. Of course that would never happen. This movie has no place in the real world. It happens in the world in which we want to live. The sad part is realizing that we do not live there. The happy part is knowing that there are people who wanted to have done it.
