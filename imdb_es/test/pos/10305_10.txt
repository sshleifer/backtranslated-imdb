A very moving and stimulating film that raises mental health problems, terminal diseases and euthanasia. Does it sound a little too heavy? It's a bit, but all of this is dealt with in a realistic and direct way within a story of the changes that occur in the family that has to deal with these things. This is a positive story of face to life and responsibility that is not overwhelmed by the subject. <br /> <br /> Afterlife is a beautifully shot and elaborated film in modern times that deals with modern themes. It is a passionate film for the character, with a strong cast and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's not the kind of movie that always performs well at the box office, so do not miss it.
