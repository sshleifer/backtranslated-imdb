If I rate the film maybe a bit high, you can blame the feeling. This is one of the first movies I remember seeing and totally loving. I saw it on the drive-ins here in California in the late 70s. I was already a big fan of "The Muppet Show" on TV, so I was ready for the movie and the film did not disappoint me. Basically it takes all the absurd spirit of the Muppet show and transports it from the vaudeville to a road movie. Kermit the Frog is on a quest to become famous; Not because he wants to take champagne baths and travel in a private jet, but because he wants to "make millions of people happy". Of course. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he picks up all his beloved muppets friends, the most sympathetic Fonzie Bear, whom he meets in a seedy bar. They sing "Movin 'Right Along", a song that I have always loved with its cheerful melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery. He also meets enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy luminaries like Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle and Mel Brooks. Brooks in particular is a little bit boring, and you get the feeling that Henson could have cut some of these cameos if he was not afraid of offending the stars. Anyway, as befits a road trip movie like this, the first person you know is Dom DeLuise. <br /> <br /> The ending is one of the strangest examples of literally breaking the fourth wall you'll find in any "child" movie. The Hollywood dream seems to collapse completely when a true rainbow crosses the Hollywood scene with its authentic joy and mystery. I'm sure this was related to some of Jim Henson's personal or spiritual experiences. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie with the Muppets anyway. If you or someone else wondered why the Muppets were so popular in the 70s, considering how poor the movies have been over the past decades, I think this movie is at least old enough to provide a clue.
