I have seen my good part of the Bollywood movies growing up. You know, the typical argument that the boy knows with the girl, the girl rejects the boys, the dakus (bad guys) take the girl, the boy rescues the girls killing hundreds of dhakus and they get married happily , I have omitted one hour of musical style numbers). Well, looking at Hari Om, I was expecting another typical Bollywood movie; however, to my delight, it turned out to be atypical and quite funny. Hari Om of Bharatbala is what could be described as one of those "out of series" Indian films, such as the South Asian hits as popular as Monsoon Wedding, East is East or Bend it Like Beckham. <br /> <br /> Being of South Asia, having seen several classic Bollywood movies, there was a lot of humor and sub-dialects that could be learned that reminded me of the funny and charming side of Indian culture (for example, the various Hindu numbers). pop that were actually redone by Nitin). Soni or the ingenious Indian slangs that were used). Hari Om can be enjoyed by all South Asians, and it is also entertaining for those who are not used to Indian humor, since the characters and the plot are addressed to all audiences. <br /> <br /> In a "cocunutshell", the film is about the auto-rickshaw driver (also known as "four-wheel vehicle" for those of you who have traveled to India) played by Vija Raaz ( from Monsoon Wedding) that puts himself involved with a thief and ends up owing him some money. To avoid selling his four-wheeled vehicle, 'Madhuri', he escapes by chance with 'Madhuri' and a very charismatic and charming woman from France, Isa (Camille Natta), who in turn is escaping the boredom of her boyfriend Benoit ( Jean Marie Lamour who was in the pool). The movie is from your trip traveling through the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan? the land of love stories; Through humor, you see the two main actors trying to discover who they really are. <br /> <br /> What made the night more memorable was having the director, executive producer, principal editor and even the mother of Mrs. Natta present at the screening. After talking with Bharatbala (who actually has a background in zoology), many interesting details of the film were discovered, including: having the film finished just 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and taking only 45 days to shoot, and have only five actors in the play (the rest were all real actors for the first time). When I got home I realized two things about the film: that there is always a human connection between us despite our differences and, secondly, as the director said: "Everyone has a love story". <br /> <br /> It is a must for all!
