The opening scene of this movie is quite incredible. I have seen several sci-fi movies with great special effects, but my roommate and I looked after the opening sequence and told me clearly: "sensory overload". The plot of the film is quite simple, but the good thing about this science fiction movie is that it allows the audience to discover most of the technology for itself instead of wasting time to explain it "subtly". The creatures in this movie are also very interesting. You can not see them really well until about two thirds of the way. In general, a very entertaining movie.
