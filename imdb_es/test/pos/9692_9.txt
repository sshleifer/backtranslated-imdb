First, I want to say that most people who give a bad review do not like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and is not afraid to laugh at some stupidities. <Br /> <br /> This movie is recorded as the television show with many short clips compiled in a long movie. Some of the scenes do not even have a dialogue, someone will just come out and do something unexpected and it's fun! The only negative thing I had was that I felt I wasted money on my Popcorn and Icee, there was no way I could eat or drink anything during this movie, I laughed constantly. Honestly, I was nervous about drinking something from Icee and seeing something that made me laugh and shoot everywhere. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind some male nudity, and enjoy the movie Jackass, teasing the TV show, and live the bam, then for YOUR SAKE go see this movie. <br /> <br /> And if you DO NOT like the first movie or the TV show. Do not see it, and if you see it, do not post a bad review about it. Unconditional Christians who see this and hit it just do not seem right to me.
