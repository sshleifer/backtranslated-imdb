The "all I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ..." was a riot. I also made fun of the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted horseradish, threw the bird to the Japanese boy and said "friend of Pearl Harbor". I think my IQ is above 115, but I'm not sure because I can not count as high. <br /> <br /> Funny thing, this requirement of 10 lines. It seems that they would beat you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I do not get to 1,000 words before I get to line 10. <br /> <br /> I still have two short lines. Forgive me while I think and drink, or drink and think. It depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind. Well, I think I've reached the limit of 10 lines. Thank you for reading!
