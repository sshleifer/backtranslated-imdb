I've been waiting to see this movie for years and finally I have it! As soon as I heard the title, I knew that this movie would be my favorite movie and, when I saw it, believe me it did not disappoint me! <br /> <br /> This movie had everything of dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was a lot in that and it was about important issues (which were in the 60's), like abortion. <br /> <br /> The dance in this movie was fantastic, just like the performance was! Swayze was brilliant as was Gray too! <br /> <br /> Although this movie was absolutely fantastic, you can not say that you've seen it if you have not seen the last scene. It really takes your breath away, since all the choreography of the last dance was done brilliantly, it made you dance at the end of the movie and it would not really surprise me if it influenced people to dance. <br /> <br /> In general, Dirty Dancing is a movie that should NOT be missed, and even if half of the actors are in: "Where are they now?" The actors will always have this great movie in their career!
