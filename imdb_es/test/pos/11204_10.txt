The first time I saw the poster, I was surprised by its tranquility and beauty. So, the city of Istanbul has been obsessed in my mind ever since. <br /> <br /> Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was filmed as elaborately and aesthetically as a sculpture. In itself it is a landscape. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are many things in the movie, but the director deliberately omitted the most dramatic parts and left them to our imagination, thus creating a really flat life. ** (slight spoiler) One can see the beloved of Mahmut crying on the toilet and then leave without saying a word but not her fight; One can see Mahmut accompanying his mother in the hospital, but not his fight against the disease. For me, the most dramatic scene in the film is that Yusuf laughs out loud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece, ** and that's when it almost broke my heart to see this boring and lonely life bursting like that . <Br /> <br /> With all the trivialities of life, history presents the pure inner world of all the characters, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regrets ... And as the story unfolds, finally I understood his desperate situation in which his emotions really had no way out if external things did not intervene, which is exactly what each person tries to maintain at all costs, especially for an irresponsible artist like Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I just finished my second viewing last night, I crouched down on my bedspread, I had some vodka next to my bed and I went through the whole movie in a trance. I felt two real lives, one off the screen and another inside the screen. I felt free from all that loneliness and anxiety because the people inside were experiencing it. I just retired from all those things. <br /> <br /> We can not deny the universal problem of communication, and loneliness even puts us away, and it becomes a vicious spiral. I bet Mahmut still did not find a way to live in the end. That's why he left his room to try to find the answers from the outside world, the coldness and the landscape.
