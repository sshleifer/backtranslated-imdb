I can honestly say that "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" was a much better movie than I expected. Allow me to clarify the plot in case the title of the film is too vague: there is a bed that eats. An evil bed. It eats people. Several women, confident in an "exit" of some kind, run into the sinister "sack" and are finally victims of their hunger. The process of devouring the bed consists of a yellow foam that soaks the people inside ... stomach acid; All complete with chewing sounds. This is a very strange cult movie and the only George Barry movie that he had forgotten he had done until the news of his new cult status was spread, he returned it and decided to release it on DVD. It's not a bad movie at all, if you can look beyond the bad acting and enjoy the hokey effects, the most ridiculous is the guy whose hands are eaten and is left with only skeletal fingers of plastic appearance ... A tone pretty dreamlike. Also, being very surreal and aberrant, mainly everything related to the artist behind the painting and the demonic history of the bed. If you like strange extravagant movies without a budget, definitely look for "Death Bed".
