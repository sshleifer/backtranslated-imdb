When I was in seventh grade (in 1977), I was asked to read the novel on which it was based as part of my English studies. I remember that I was very excited when a television version premiered a year later. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol was a popular television actress when this film was produced and she was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family. In the hit television series "Family." It was clear that she had the scope and capacity to carry out this part. I remember her as sometimes a little "rigid", but above all she does a good job. She takes the movie well. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle is fantastic, since the domestic seems to be the only one in the home who seems to really take care of her. Barbara Barrie, like the somewhat frightened and somewhat neurotic mother, is also good, as is the young Robin Lively (who will eventually appear as the black widow Lana Milford in "Twin Peaks") as the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of parental attention. affected. Bruce Davidson is also appropriately attractive as the German soldier of the title <br /> <br /> The best performance, however, belongs to Michael Constantine. It is truly powerful and deserved more recognition than it did at that time. The bitterness and coldness it expresses make the scenes in which it seems difficult to see, but it makes it much easier to understand the silent despair of the rejected daughter. Constantine gives everything that has the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations. <br /> <br /> The film differs from the book only in some small aspects. It is wonderful and inspiring to see it, and I hope it will be published again on a video or DVD. <br /> <br />
