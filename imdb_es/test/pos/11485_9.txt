Do not hate Heather Graham because she's beautiful, she hates it because it's fun to watch in this movie. Like modern clothes and funky surroundings, the actors in this film work well together. Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally lights up the screen. The lesser characters, Goran Visnjic {sigh} and Patricia Vel√°zquez, are as HEAVY as they are beautiful. Congratulations Miramax and Director Lisa Krueger!
