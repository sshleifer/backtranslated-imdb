After years of waiting for a definitive collection of Led Zeppelin performances on video, fans have finally been rewarded with what is undoubtedly the best concert video of all time! Much better than the bleak "Song that stays the same", this video includes performances from no less than 5 different places that span a decade. It also includes rare interviews and television appearances. The sound quality is amazing, considering the source material used. And the quality of the video is even more impressive. This is an ABSOLUTE MUST for any Led Zeppelin fan.
