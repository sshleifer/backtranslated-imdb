Isabelle Huppert must be one of the best actresses of her or any other generation. "La Pianiste" really confirms it. As if that were not enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of the best actresses of her or any other generation. So, as you can well imagine, those casting pieces are worth the horror we have suffered. Isabelle and Annie play characters that we have never seen on the screen. A mother and a daughter yes, but with such virulent courage that sometimes I could not even blink or breathe. Personally, I do not believe in the intentions of the director, I do not believe that (the intentions that are) go beyond the shocking anecdote and the end made me scream in frustration, but I was fascinated by the story written on the face of the sensational Huppert and the fierceness of the strength of Girardot. I highly recommend it to movie lovers everywhere and to collectors of great performances like me, you can not miss "La Pianiste".
