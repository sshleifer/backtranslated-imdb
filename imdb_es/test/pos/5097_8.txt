"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a magnificently written and photographed musical version of the classic 1939 film. Apart from the wonderfully controlled and underestimated performance of Peter O'Toole as the pedantic school teacher who finds love and is affected by She, the film contains hundreds of impressive images, from Greek ruins to side streets of London and an extensive montage in the countryside. The music and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse have been criticized for being boring or not at the level of movie musicals, but they are used to enhance the story instead of telling it. Many songs are used to underline montages or scenes; the few who are not relegated to the "show biz" numbers. In this way, the songs do not interfere in this delicate story, but increase what the characters are thinking or feeling. "Where did my childhood go?", "Walk the world with me" and "You and I" are especially effective. An absorbing film, brilliantly acted, directed and written.
