Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) begins this story in disguise, helping to smuggle the famous physicist "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) out of Switzeralnad and under the watchful eye of the Nazis, who want their bombing plans. The Allies obviously want it too, and Sherlock is there to help. Dr. Tobel has invented an instrument that helps a lot in the accuracy of aerial bombardment. <br /> <br /> Holmes and Dr. Tobel arrive safely at Baker Street, but the scientist would prefer to be alone, for some mysterious reason, although he had promised the English that they would help them, not the Germans. He remains true to that promise, but Holmes and the English are going through desperate moments along the way. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining movie and one in which our famous detective uses not one, but three different costumes. He needs all the help he can get when he faces his archrival, the "Professor Moriarity." One complaint: if Moriarity were that evil, he would have dispensed with Holmes without blinking, instead of giving him openings to escape. It is also quite sad that the usual imbecile Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) has to rescue his boss from certain death a couple of times! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some credibility issues in this story but if you can put your brain on hold a few times, it's a fun movie to watch ... and it looks beautiful, thanks to the excellent restoration work made on this DVD. It makes the old letter come alive with some wonderful images, particularly the nocturnal shots. <br /> <br /> Another note: whoever did the English subtitles miswrote or misinterpreted at least half a dozen words. It's a very sloppy work, and it's not the first time I see it watching the whole series on the restored DVD set.
