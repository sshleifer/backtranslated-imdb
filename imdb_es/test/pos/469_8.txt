This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise), and the best soundtrack you've probably heard ... if all that makes sense. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds practically tell you that a crooked trip awaits you. (I was surprised that no one left immediately during the Brooklyn premiere). But from there, the film is installed in a festival of interviews between two people really damaged, Daphne and Buddy. <br /> <br /> They are alone, disorderly, and boys, do they talk about sex? Daphne gives life to her most interesting stories about escorts, some are quite funny (Mr. Chang), some disturbing (the scenes of Harlan with music that tells us what we see that could be what is happening or what Daphne really feels ), and because I have a friend who used to escort, I might add, the majority seems quite real. <br /> <br /> You Are Alone is multi-layered and mostly bright. Okay, maybe a couple of minutes less talk, and I do not know we would have missed anything. <br /> <br /> Again, I need to see it again knowing the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director asked people in the Brooklyn audience to write a review on IMDb because many people read them.) Application granted.)
