WOW I love this movie. This definitely adds to my list of Ghetto Movies. <br /> <br /> Juice - Starring Tupac 'I Don Giva F ***' Menace II Society - O-Dawg 'I'll Smoke Anyone, Just Do not Giva F ****' New Jersey Drive - Hey , they steal cars in broad daylight, obviously they do not give g *** f *** <br /> <br /> New Jersey Drive is Hood's best movie. It's at the top of the list, the Menace II society is the second, and the juice is the third, the Clockers are really stupid. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of New Jersey Drive is also Pwnage Mac Mall and Young Lay - Everything about my fetti is heard throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Lords of the underground - Burning rubber, another good song, and also Ill & Al Scratch - do not turn off a player <br /> <br /> If you're a GTA-SA fan, you'll love it this movie And the incredible soundtrack. The soundtrack is basically Rap on car theft ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Movie!
