Obviously, the answers here were written many years after the release of the film and can not be taken in context. In 1980, in England, after labor, this movie was very funny. We were glad of something to laugh at and Rising Damp, with its mocking sympathy of a complete social stratum, was one of the best British comedies of its time, if not ever. He played a chord in almost everyone and, in British fashion, we laughed at the Rigsby in ourselves. America had nothing to touch this kind of humor because self-destruction was not fun for our foreign cousins. Leonard Rossiter was one of the best actors in England, on stage, on television and in movies. His commitment and professionalism were insurmountable. Richard Beckinsale was, although young, a perfect comic film for Rossiter and should, by all rights, be ranked as one of the best of all time. If they had not taken him so young, I am sure that, by this time, he would be classified as one of the best British comedy actors. Frances De la Tour found her best television moment in Rising Damp and, for me, she never quantified her undoubted ability with other roles. If you did not see the movie at the time of its release, you are not qualified to comment, simply because you can not understand why it was funny, the mood of the moment.
