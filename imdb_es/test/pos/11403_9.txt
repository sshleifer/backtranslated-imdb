I have seen both films and I saw without a doubt that the new version is the best, I know that many people would not agree. Those who have become fans of the original version probably do not like this new version, but I thought it was well thought out and definitely scary, it was so good that I'll see it again tonight, the original scared me because they killed the kids, I mean who does that in the movies anyway ... but in this the children have at least half an opportunity ... The only bad part of this movie is when the nanny (Jill) walks towards the sounds that He listens and runs towards the bushes to check if there is anyone, clearly nobody in his right mind would. that while taking care of children, so that's the only thing I found wrong in the movie, and even then they probably had to put that there to create suspense, I do not want to give too much for all those who have not seen it, I recommend you do it instead of listening to all these people saying that it is crap and worse than the original. Being a better movie for teenagers, since it shows things that most of us are afraid of, but when I was in the movies there were at least 10 adults over 70 years watching it, and they enjoyed it, if they enjoyed it. I think you will! I give it a 9 out of 10!
