I'm doing a thesis on how to blur the limits: the woman who dresses cross and I'm using the book Tipping the Velvet as my main text, any comments on gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, gender as performance, gender as fiction . Gender images, transvestism as an erotic fantasy and as a revolution, the effect of the male suit, etc. It would be very appreciated! But a little out of place, has anyone seen the Sergio Toledo movie in 1987, Vera? It is a young lesbian who is possibly transsexual. I'm dying to see it because I think it would be very useful ... Does anyone know where I can get a copy? I have tried Amazon and some other sites, but I had no luck ...
