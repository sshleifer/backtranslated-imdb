Hey, I think this movie was great and it had great graphics and I'm glad they've used Final Fantasy 7. I think that was the best game I've ever played. This is a great movie and I loved it. They should do another, but maybe they should use Final Fantasy 7 again or Final Fantasy 10 thereafter. The two are incredible: Tyler Sheena. I hope you can send me an email back if you have any details, if there is someone else. It is animated but it seems quite realistic and it has amazing fight scenes that I have not seen so fast to fight in a movie for a long time. The final Fantasy 7 game is also great, not good graphics, but it's really fun and challenging.
