LOL. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that I start my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a kid; and even then I felt the stupidity of all that. The low budget, the horrible acting and the lame script were evident at the time. I saw him again yesterday and I could not stop laughing. It's so bad that it's really good lol. As another critic said, it is not taken seriously. There is no way to see this movie and say that the creators did it. The soundtrack is very funny, I laugh every time I listen to it. The 'climax' is just an uproar of laughter. It's a total war zone in New York, full of explosions and total chaos ... so ridiculous that you can not help but laugh when you see it. <br /> <br /> Other fun moments: <br /> <br /> - The scene with Kersey and the cop running side by side like 2 cowboys against the whole Wild West was so cheesy it was fun. <br /> <br /> -He killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at Kersey and he could even fall on one knee aiming with the always careful (and slow) target and not receiving the LMAO hit. Of course, with him was a shot, a murder with his elephant gun LOL. <br /> <br /> - Another funny scene was the ending when he finally killed the gang leader ... with a ROCKET LAUNCHER lol ... destroying the entire side of the apartment building with him. <br /> <br /> - It's clear that Kersey is almost used to losing his loved ones ... when his new girlfriend is quickly eliminated after only a few dates. The acting is so bad that you can not blame anyone who I could only think that Kersey is angry about the destruction of the car. Lol ... run down, look at the butcher shop and just walk away. <br /> <br /> Again, very bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> *** of **** stars.
