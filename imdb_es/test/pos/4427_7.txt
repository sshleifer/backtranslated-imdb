Video Vault By Shawn K. Inlow <br /> <br /> My architect: The journey of a son 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not rated: 116minutes Vault Rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What a thing to be without a father. "My Architect: A Son's Journey" follows the Philadelphia filmmaker, Nathaniel Kahn, as he desperately searches for the answers of his father, the renowned architect Louis I. Kahn, who died 30 years ago. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn died in A Train Station in 1974 and left behind more than one family. The funeral service, when the filmmaker was just a child, was, shall we say, an unpleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> We find that Nathaniel only knew his passive father, from his sporadic visits with his mother, who, we are told, he loved deeply. This film is about a boy who is looking for his father and maybe himself visiting his work, as if the magnificent structures kept some secret. <br /> <br /> No doubt, Louis Kahn was a gifted architect, but "architect" is a cold word. The man was a large-scale sculptor who spoke of his craft in broad terms of silence and art. <br /> <br /> Among his notable works, explored with love in the film, are the Salk Institute (1965), The Kimball Art Museum (1972) and the monumental complex of the capitol in Bangladesh (1983). The part of the film in which Nathaniel visits Dhaka, Bangladesh for the first time, finds work, but not man. <br /> <br /> The film greatly benefits from having many images of the man so public while working in New York City. and as a professor at Yale and at the University of Pennsylvania. Many of Khan's contemporaries and collaborators also help develop the filmmaker's phantom father. <br /> <br /> Even so, the viewer seems not to reach a particularly satisfactory place. The answers that Nathaniel Khan is looking for seem empty. It is not good enough. <br /> <br /> In the scenes where the director meets his half sisters, both of different mothers, one can feel the tensions of years, the slights and the wounds. One could expect them to erupt in anger, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. Each of these children has lost something in a visible way. <br /> <br /> It could be noted that Khan, who looked like a motivated perfectionist, never got rich. Instead, it became noteworthy. It was as if he sacrificed his family for his art. This is a tremendously sad and great thing. <br /> <br /> April 28, 2005
