This film is about a group of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. The misfits come together to successfully complete their mission. <br /> <br /> Hilarity occurs. <br /> <br /> As in the films of the "Police Academy", the humor comes from the crazy characters of the ship. I thought it was an attractive movie and I'll stop to watch it anytime I'm on TV. No, it will not make you reflect on your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of humanity, but it's a pretty fun entertainment for about 90 minutes. In addition, Lauren Holly looks sexy in a naval uniform.
