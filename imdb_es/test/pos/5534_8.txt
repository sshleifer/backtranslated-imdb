Strange but acceptable mafia comedy that has an undercover FBI agent (Matthew Modine) flirting with the worried widow of a mafioso (Michelle Pfeffier) ​​to tie two murders to an elusive mob boss (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> The film shows that you do not have to overlook to be funny and director Jonathan Demme ("Silence of the Lambs", "Philadelphia") prevents the film from appearing to be restricted. That's good and avoids being predictable, too.
