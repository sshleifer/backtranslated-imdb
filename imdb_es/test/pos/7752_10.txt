I tend to fall in love and fall in love with anime, because the more you look, the more you realize that many shows are just bad copies of the few gems or repetitions of old formulas. But once in a while one of the real gems appears and its originality leaves you breathless. Haruhi is truly one of those shows. Many anime series are originally manga and, sometimes, the translation to an animated show is quite poor and does not use the benefits that animation has over static drawings. Actually, Haruhi is based on a series of light novels and fires in all the cylinders, a beautiful animation, an excellent interpretation of the voice, a great music and a complete story and of good rhythm. Look at it, you will not be disappointed, and I suggest you see it in order of transmission, so it works much better.
