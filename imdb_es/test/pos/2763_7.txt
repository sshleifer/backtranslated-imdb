Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall removed the tears from his eyes with his fascinating epic "Alive", was already the legendary Mexican director of exploitation Ren√© Cardona, who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film "Survivors of the Andes " The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentine Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 of them were finally rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate travel companions. Of course, I can not say that this film of economic manufacture and approximate edition is better than the famous version of the 90, but I definitely appreciate and respect this film more. After all, an exploitation film requires much more participation from both the cast and the crew, while the big-budget Marshall film, though intense, is more like the money-making routine. Sets and special effects naturally can not compete with "Alive", but "Survivors ..." offers an equally impressive feeling of hopelessness and creates an even more pessimistic snow hell. Cardona's film is ambitious, surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable Mexican productions in history. I am really amazed that Cardona's interpretation of this story is not more exploitative and explicit. However, the scenes where deceased passengers are cut and consumed are difficult to digest, but they only serve to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to emphasize the inhuman conditions of the survivors. Rather complimentary for a vicious director who gained fame with his notoriously bad films such as "The Night of the Bloody Apes" and the Holy Series. The young unknown Mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is lovely. The story is well known, of course, so the script does not offer any unexpected surprises. Whether it's the story or before you've seen "Alive", you know what kind of dramas these people still have to endure before being rescued and you can only expect them. Still, this is a good movie that should not be hit as too often is the case.
