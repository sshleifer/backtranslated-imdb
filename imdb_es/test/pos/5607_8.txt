One of my favorite films of Hartley. (As if there could be a "bad" one). Although, this may be a bit more religious in nature than we would normally expect. However, it still maintains Hartley's inclination to which we have all become accustomed. <br /> <br /> First imagine Jesus and Satan discussing their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets about the imminent end of civilization. Now imagine that the whole conversation takes place with a few drinks at the bar in your neighborhood. And as an additional conversational distraction (not to mention the visual), let's cast PJ Harvey as the sensual companion (also known as Magdelena) with Mr. Chist. Then, just to smile, in the background, a Salvation Army Band always present (played by Yo La Tengo) to serve as an additional diversion. The road to moral justification has never been so pleasant. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly more questions than answers, but that's where the fun lies. And Mr. Donovan is subject to his brilliance, as always.
