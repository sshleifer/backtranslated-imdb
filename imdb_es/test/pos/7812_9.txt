In One Minute to Pray, One Minute to Die, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unhappy outlaw with a reward of ten thousand dollars in his head and degenerative epilepsy. <br /> <br /> Realizing his days as an outcast are numbered, he desperately wants (albeit reluctantly) to take advantage of an amnesty granted by the brutal territorial governor Robert Ryan, (excellent performance) who wants him to McCord renounces his forms and accepts amnesty as an example for others, while in the Escondito bandit, the outcast Mario Brega plans to kill McCord to prevent that from happening. <br /> <br /> Also starring Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and a host of other well-known European faces, this is co-written and produced by Albert Band, Western pioneer of spaghetti (American), also responsible for Gunfight At Red Sands, a film before Leona. <br /> <br /> Although the solution to the "epilepsy" of the main character is eliminated directly from El Dorado, by Howard Hawks. , the script is solid, quite cool and unpretentious. we. This has a great balance of action and history and Alex Cord is great at it. It really should have been a bigger star. <br /> <br /> In defense of the shortest English version (well nicknamed): personally, I have passed that age in which the longest version is always the best version and the ending where McCord is ironically shot by hunters of rewards after his forgiveness, is unnecessarily nihilistic and completely destroys the film's message about hope and redemption. <br /> <br /> Call me old-fashioned, but I encouraged McCord and I felt like he earned that. happy ending!
