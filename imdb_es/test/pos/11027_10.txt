I saw this movie in 75 and this movie was kind of an open mind to me about how important it is to take care of Natur and the Wild life. When I got a dog in 83, I called it TRUSKA (In Movie..Avakun's dog) to never forget this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, I HAVE a copy of this movie, but it is in Portuguese language and the quality is not as good as a DVD or a new VHS (I recorded almost 20 years ago and at SLP speedy ... that the quality is not so good ...) <br /> <br /> If someone wants a copy .. I'll try to convert it to DVD and I can send it. Is that okay? <br /> <br /> Ot's a great movie and I agree that it is a movie that should always be seen. <br /> <br /> Waldemar Braz - Sao Paulo / Brazil
