After watching The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two-pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since these two films were childhood favorites. <br /> <br /> Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It may not be a five-star classic, but it's a fun movie and it's a good night of entertainment. It's a light refreshment of Disney's darker, more serious classics. Aristocats tries to be a happy musical comedy, and I think it's almost successful. <br /> <br /> The plot does not make much sense and I do not think the plot is particularly strong, but it certainly is not weak. The animation and the backgrounds are a little harsh in some places, typical of the films of the 70s of Disney, but they have an old and rustic charm. <br /> <br /> The strongest points of Aristocats are the characters, the music and the music. humor. The music is very memorable. Try to get 'Everybody Wants To Be A Cat' out of your head quickly! The songs are written by the Sherman Brothers, who also made music for The Jungle Book. There was a song called 'She Never Felt Alone' that was going to be in the movie, but unfortunately it did not become the final movie. It's a shame, because I think it would fit very well. <br /> <br /> The characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley is voiced by Phil Harris, and is basically Baloo in feline form. Eva Gabor gives the Duchess this warm and motherly feeling and the kitten's voices really sound like children, and not like an actor who imitates a child's voice. Secondary characters are here by the dozens and you still end up understanding their personalities. Edgar, the "villain" butler plays a role similar to that of Cruella De Vil, but is more comical than terrifying, and often ends up in funny situations. Even though he is the bad guy, he is still kind anyway. <br /> <br /> The two British geese: Abigail and Amelia really made me laugh, along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like dogs, which tend to argue about who is "the leader". I could go on, but I will not spoil it. But I can tell you that The Aristocats is fun and will entertain everyone without having to resort to the rudimentary humor of the toilet. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that the Aristocats may not be Disney's most important achievement, not even their strongest movie of the 70s (that prize is a tie between The Rescuers and The Many Adventures of Whinnie the Pooh). But it's a nice romp and it's sure to entertain. If you are looking for a dazzling piece of art, it might be better to see Bambi. But if you want to have a fun night, The Aristocats is the way to go. It is a lovely and adorable movie and it is impossible that you do not like it. Enjoy! (And besides, it's good to have a movie where cats are not seen as villains).
