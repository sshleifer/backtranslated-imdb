Often, when television series are transferred to the big screen, they lose their appeal. Not in this case! The historical precision in costumes, equipment and direction of art in general, like the television series, is outstanding. A good example of comedy and farce, with excellent writers and comedy actors in the right parts. Based on a classic television series that stands out in the history of the British television comedy.
