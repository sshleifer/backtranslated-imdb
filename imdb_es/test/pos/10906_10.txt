Joan Cusack steals the show! The premise is good, the plot is interesting and the script was good. A bit too simplistic in the sense that the story of a gay man that came to light was so positive when it is usually not so positive. On the other hand, it is fiction. :) In general, an entertaining game. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was the "inner joke" aspect. Since the target audience was probably direct, they may not have the gay "stuff" in context with the story. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline showed a facet of his acting skills that writers sometimes do not take into account when suggesting Kline a part. <br /> <br /> This hit the mark.
