If you're a science fiction fan, and you've only seen this movie once, please go and give it a second time. I just did it, and I was surprised at how good I thought the movie was, unlike when I saw it for the first time three years ago. The first time I was impressed by the astronomical views that we dealt with in this film, but in general I did not think much about the film as a whole. It was an Alien scam, and I thought the description of the monsters was a really bad science case. Being allergic to light was something that I found especially ridiculous. Based on my first visualization, I recently rated this movie with a 5. <br /> <br /> However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on its way, and the movie poster for that seems incredible, I thought I'd better go over Pitch Black one more time, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I'm so glad I did it. There's a lot of what I thought I remembered from the first visualization that turned out to be extremely inaccurate. I thought that most of the characters died very early in the movie. This was not the case. I thought that the character of Claudia Black was the first to die. This was not the case. I thought Riddick was the only survivor. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> Now I see that the movie works * extremely * well. There is not an excessive and boring focus on monsters. It is much more of a human drama. The main characters are attractive and capable of some convincing performance. And there are so many small details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and credible, such as the oxygen shortage in the atmosphere of the planet where they crash, and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet, and that's how they come back. each other. <br /> <br /> And I have to mention the astronomical perspectives again. I mean, we begin to see the spacecraft passing through the tail of a comet, with pieces of dust spaced across the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just when shipwrecked people think they are about to get dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon and everything is wrapped in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see that the giant giant of ringed gas rises through the sky, and in the final scene of the film we see the ship gliding very close to one of these rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I do not think I've seen any other SF movie that has really highlighted the inclusion of these things. I hope we see much more in the sequel. <br /> <br /> Pitch Black now gets me a rating of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You gamble !!
