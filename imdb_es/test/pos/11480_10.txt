I consider that this film is a complete masterpiece, in fact I consider it the best work of Fernando Fragata and, without doubt, the best of all Portuguese films. I do not think you can find a kind of "zero budget" movie that is as impressive and surprising as this one. <br /> <br /> The direction is done with perfection at an incredibly fast pace and the music is also composed. By Fragata it is above all excellent. The story is spooky and humorous at the same time, and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying "Misery loves the company," kind of situations intertwined with an amazing mystery. A recipe more than perfect to glue the eyes of the spectators to the screen from frame one to the last. <br /> <br /> It's been called Neo-Hitchcock, and I agree. Like the best Hitchcocks, I kept guessing throughout the movie and most of my assumptions were far from what ends up being intelligently revealed.
