For once, a story of hope highlighted on the tragic reality that our young people face. Favela Rising attracts one to a terrifying, insecure and unfair world and shows through beautiful colors and music in movement how a man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art. An entertaining, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful film. I showed this film to many high school students who also live in neighborhoods with poverty and violence with firearms and were in love with Anderson, the protagonist. I recommend this film to all ages over 13 years old (due to the subtitles and some images of death) of all origins.
