Do you know the saying "Curiosity killed the cat"? Well, I've heard a lot about this movie, from a magazine that named this one of the most shocking films of all time, my 1001 movies that you must see before you die, my sister who saw it at a film festival and I love it the show of the 70 in VH1. I just had to watch this movie because it was named the crassest movie of all time, and well, after watching this movie last night, I must say that it really lived up to its title. My God, this movie was so weird! I thought I really saw it all with some of the sickest movies and TV shows I've seen, some things that I suppose will always feel like a shock. <br /> <br /> Well, Babs Johnson, aka Divine, has been named the dirtiest person in the world and a jealous couple named Marbles competes for that title. They want to take out Divine and be named as the dirtiest couples in life by kidnapping women, raping them, impregnating them and selling their babies to lesbian couples. But it seems that Divine and her family are well ... I do not know, she seems to maintain the title by having sex with chickens, the synchronization of the lips to the top, eating dog droppings, filling the skirts of the skirts, the incest, and it just gets More and more rude. <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos is acting horribly, it is done horribly, and well, just horrible. The reason for the 10 qualifications that I am going to give you is because, well, how could you rate this movie? I always qualify, so I just imagine what the hell? Through the rudeness of this movie, you have to give John Waters some credit, who the hell would think about this movie more than 35 years later? For the cast and crew that worked on this movie, you are just unpleasant! <br /> <br /> 10/10
