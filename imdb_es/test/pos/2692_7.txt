I need help to identify an episode of King of Queens. It begins with a scene in which Doug is talking to Carrie over the phone, and he suggests that they agree to stop finishing all conversations with "I love you". However, it is difficult to do and he calls her again, only to close with "I love you". It's a very smart time and I think it says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> I think (but I am sure) that it is the same episode in which Doug receives some local builders. whistle and throw creepy comments at Carrie to encourage her spirit. <br /> <br /> I watched this episode recently, but it was probably a repeat. I do not know in what network I saw it. Can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode?
