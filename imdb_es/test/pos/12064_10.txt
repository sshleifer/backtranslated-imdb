I'm not from the USA UU I'm from central Europe and I think the show is incredibly good. It can be easily compared to married to ... children. My title says that it is not shown for conservative public. I mean I am not so liberal, but there may be a slight difference between European conservatism and the cons. Anyway, the show is starting to be very popular in our area and it is very bad that it only contains two seasons. Last episode opens many continuous and fun moments. Anyway, I and many people would be happy if that continued playing. The last thing that moves me about this is a very nice moral education in humorous scenes. I mean, I've seen many comedies that have more than two or even more minutes of tragic scenes that do not fit comedy. War does not contain something like that and is made to laugh. It's like The Simpsons and the married ones, who also do not have sad moments or even without grace. I apologize for my terrible knowledge of English, but I still hope you understand what I meant.
