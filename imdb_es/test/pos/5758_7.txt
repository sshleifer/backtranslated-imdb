I had been looking for this film for a long time before I found it, I had seen it when I was younger and I loved it, after my second visualization I still loved it and I still do it. <br /> <br /> This is a love / hate movie, if you like the background, young people, the comic strip, then you will find this fun. If you do not like that kind of humor, then do not bother. I love this movie and I have grown up with these comedy shows, for me, this movie is just placing your comedic genius on the big screen. It is not an award winner in any way, but if you just want a good healthy slapstick, this is the place. ! <br /> <br /> the movie lacks the quality of the television series and this is usually the case with movies, but it still has enough material to keep you laughing, even if many of the jokes are quite similar to your works previous <br /> <br /> Yes, the humor is a bit childish and not everyone's taste, but sometimes you just need that in a movie.
