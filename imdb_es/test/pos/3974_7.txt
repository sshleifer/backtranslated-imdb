(Synopsis) Bartleby "B" Gaines (Justin Long), who graduates from high school, finds himself without a school to attend. He has been able to talk and get out of all the problems he finds, but he has not been able to hex the college admissions board of eight universities. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby has not been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby does not go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the universities to which they applied. To satisfy his parents, Bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own university with a website. They turn an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the website declares that we accept anyone. On the first day of school, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students who were also rejected by all the universities. With a million dollars in tuition money, Bartleby must turn his fake university into one that works. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the dean of the university. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules and celebrate all night. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The premise of starting a university without a teaching staff is a bit out of place. Since it was a fake university, Bartleby really did not need staff. The film reminded me of the classic movie "Animal House", the university atmosphere, the fraternity, lots of jokes and beautiful young women. These new university students had a different notion of what the university experience was about. The film not only has a lot of humor, it also has a good message for life. People must achieve their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. The ending was a bit unrealistic, but it's just a movie. The film was made for young people to have a little fun. (Universal images, execution time 1:32, classification PG-13) (7/10)
