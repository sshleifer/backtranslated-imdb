Okay, let me explain why ... Haggard is probably one of the funniest nonsense movies you've ever seen. It has a mix of a unique story about a boy who has girls' problems and everything goes back mixed with countless humorous scenes that will make you laugh throughout the movie, basically, if you've seen Jackass or the CKY series, he would know what to expect from humor, considering that you have most of the people in those movies. In general ... I just had to give it a 10/10 because it is one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> ~ F0rs4k3n <br /> <br /> (P.S.) Haggard Rules!
