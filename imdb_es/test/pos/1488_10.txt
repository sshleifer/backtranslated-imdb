Mr. Bean has shaped the comedy of British television. He has shown that you do not need wicked words or wit, a massive budget, a large amount of intelligence or even any intelligence to do something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters that you can not forget. Some of these episodes had me on point: yes, they are not realistic at all and they are all quite stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers that Bean has broken on his way to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. you always manage to prepare interesting new ideas and new fun gags, remember when Mr. Bean drove his Mini Green while sitting on a sofa in the ceiling? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never weakens: the movie was not as good as it is, but Bean has introduced a new sense of humor in the world, and both children and adults will marvel at its immense fun. "Extras" and "Little Britain" can be condemned: this is the British comedy at its best and the most original. These adventures never get old! 10/10
