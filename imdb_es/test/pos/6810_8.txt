I saw this 1997 movie because I'm a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and his father, the late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo looked very good in this movie, mainly because of his hairstyle and the very tasteful wardrobe that flattered him. <br /> <br /> As the plot progressed, I realized that the movie was more than just entertainment or A reason to see a favorite actor. The story was about a ring of serial killers and attempts by law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring members to justice. There was enough suspense, and I think that the violence was necessary to relate the story with the spectator. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was surprised to learn that the film is the true story of the horrendous murders that occurred. In utah In addition, Lorenzo and his first lady portrayed the real agents of the FBI who resolved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the arrest of the ring. I think the movie is worth it, as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.
