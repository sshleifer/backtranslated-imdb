This is the kind of movie that can give you a nightmare, plus it's very fun. <br /> <br /> Hardware Wars is the only good parody in Star Wars, other movies like Spaceballs have failed. This is the only fake movie I've ever seen, it's not a Star Wars scam, it makes fun of it, and that's what parodies are supposed to be.
