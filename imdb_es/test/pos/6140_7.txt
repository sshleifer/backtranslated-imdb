I had not planned to see this movie, however, I was not disappointed when a friend dragged me. Although there are no real surprises here, the guys do quite well with their obviously modest budget. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the trailer, you probably know what to expect from this type of film and there is a constant. There are a lot of jokes here, with a couple of classic moments, where the highlight is probably an excellent flashback of how the guys were in the 1980s. Also, I read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment, but I It seemed very different from what I expected from this genre. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie will not change your life, but it's enough. He laughs there to keep you entertained all the time.
