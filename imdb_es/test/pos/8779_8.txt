I really enjoyed this movie, which in many ways, as Hitchcock did several times, was a first conspiracy attempt that came back to roll later in his career. However, possibly the most surprising thing about this is the way in which the main characters are faceless. After looking, one remembers Murray Alper as the driver of a jovial truck, the moving turn of Vaughan Glaser as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable traveler Freak Show and, of course, Otto Kruger as the soft and sophisticated villain, all which completely overshadow Bob Cummings as the most fugitive of wood (compare that bridge jump with the similar trick of Harrison Ford in "The Fugitive" by Andrew Davis) and Priscilla Lane, whose change of heart and subsequent love for Cummings never It is credible. <br /> <br /> The other major The support player is, of course, Hitchcock himself, who frames the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. Many people criticize old movies for their lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that, with the lack of technology, even trying and transmitting what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film carries an antifascist message, made at the time of World War II, but being a Hitchcock is never the most important and the emphasis is always on the action. It is worth taking a look, especially for support papers.
