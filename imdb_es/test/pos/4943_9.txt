The story line for this game is very uneven where it seems that game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul. That said, this is the only complaint I have about the game. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the FMV is spectacular with stunning landscapes and interesting new devices, such as the ability to create and design your own character and yours. Martial arts discipline There is even a second story mode that compensates for the uncomfortable story design of Tale of the Souls. <br /> <br /> The FMV parts during Tale of the Souls are also interactive, where you can decide the fate of your character to a certain extent, which is an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> With the many character combinations you can create, the varied paths you can explore in the story mode of Tales of the Souls and Chronicle of Swords, this game will keep any fan of Beatem up / RPG Entertained for a while!
