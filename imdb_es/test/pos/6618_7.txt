This documentary traces the origins and life of the Zephyr skateboard team, using the original film shot in the 1970s (mainly by Craig Stecyk) combined with interviews of team members and other influential people today. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film documents how the "Dogtown" section of Venice, California, began at the turn of the century when the city was created to be a European city similar to Venice, Italy. In the 1970s, the only remaining local attraction, the Pacific Ocean Park, had been abandoned, leaving a beach with many exposed docks and other dangers. Poor children living in the area had nothing better to do than surf, and excelled despite (or perhaps because of) their surroundings. Because the waves dissipated in the afternoon, they started skateboarding to fill their time, and the empty pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surf funds led them to create the vertical skating style that is the current main currently. <br /> <br /> I found that the film covered much more about surfing than I expected, which seemed like an advantage since I really did not know much about surfing or skateboarding before watching the movie. The soundtrack, of course, was also good. I also liked how these children just followed their passion and in general they ended up better because of the experience. The parts that did not work so well were the drama that they tried to create, which seemed somewhat forced, and the team's sense of self-importance a little exaggerated (although this is probably the attitude of the street they came from). above). This does not mean that they did not have a significant influence, but only that it seems extremely likely that there are other factors as well. <br /> <br /> One note: my wife is more affected than most at nausea when the movies use what we call "SpastiCam" (camera movements). This movie is often guilty, so if you are so distressed, be careful. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone, but especially to anyone with a skateboard and / or surfing in their story. <br /> <br /> Seen on 11/5/2002.
