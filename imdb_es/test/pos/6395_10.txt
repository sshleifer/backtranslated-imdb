It's one of my favorite television series. A wonderful cast, a great script and a plot of the siding. <br /> <br /> Watch the family routine Kyle is a grantee of great moments of humor and great comedians. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no comments. It is one of the best today. It has perfect timing and always captures the point of the joke. <br /> <br /> - Tisha Campbell: Jay's paranoid and sentimental is simply wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> - George O. Gore II: perfect for the role. It is impossible to imagine another person as the adorable (and silly) Junior. <br /> <br /> - Jennifer Nicole Freeman: the self-centered Claire found the perfect actress. Beautiful and talented <br /> <br /> - Parker McKeena Posey: impossible not to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> - Noah Gray-Cabey: this guy has a future, I'm sure <br /> <br /> I feel very sad when it ends, but this show will be in my mind forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie ... we love you!
