This film is important for those of us interested in Western history because it uses authentic techniques in its production. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the wagon train are particularly authentic; As far as I know, it contains the only scenes filmed that illustrate the techniques for crossing rivers on a cliff. Horses and mules must be lowered to the level of the river and the wagons must be lowered with ropes and pulleys. The scene is such that I could see it again and again just trying to get an idea of ​​what a crossing was like ... and the first travelers did it again and again as they crossed the country. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the melodrama, this image is as authentic in terms of dress and style as they come and it is worth seeing for that alone.
