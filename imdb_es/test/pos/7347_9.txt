I really enjoyed this movie. It is rare to find a star that can carry out the physical aspects of any sports / dance theme film convincingly and also do a first class job as an actor. In this film you find two stars that are up to the occasion. Both women deliver warm, moving and sometimes humorous performances. The film also addressed several topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. And, nevertheless, the approach was not heavy. The production values ​​were also first class for a small budget movie. I saw him at the gay and lesbian film festival in Philadelphia and I saw him for the second time. It was a real pleasure for the crowd. Everyone I spoke seemed to enjoy this movie.
