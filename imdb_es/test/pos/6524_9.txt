Fans of apocalyptic films will savor this well-made low-budget thriller that is essentially a remake of George Pal's 1951 classic "When Worlds Collide." A comet is headed for a close collision with Earth, and when its scientific colleagues ignore its warnings of doom, the eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly build an underground sanctuary. <br /> <br The story unfolds through the eyes of Gulf War veteran Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati), who inadvertently discovers the hidden sanctuary of Crawford and then decides that Crawford is wrong to keep his project hidden from view. rest of humanity. As the comet approaches, the issue of who should live and who should die makes for an interesting drama. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are not in the same league, I enjoyed the story more than the Spielberg War. The Worlds, because I feel that this script is better. It requires a certain suspension of scientific reality, but it is worth it for the development of a good story. I recommend this movie to fans of the genre.
