I love this movie ... one of my favorites of all time! This was the first big screen movie that my mom took me to see when I was 9 years old. I recommend it to all African Americans. This story is about the love, trust, challenges and daily life of a black family. All the actors worked well together. I would like it to be on video, but so far, it is not available, as far as I know. I captured it on TV a few years ago and I recorded it, so every time I want to see it ... I have it! The soundtrack is awesome too! You must see it!
