While it may not be his most laughable film, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE is one of Charley Chase's most satisfying comedy plays, twenty minutes of witty visual jokes, a well-choreographed physical comedy and fun jokes (played through of the title card, of course) all based on an extravagant and tremendously implausible premise. We have been told that this is "a story of homely people, a wife with a face that would stop a clock, and her husband with a face that would start again". Soon we find Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who have a huge nose. But there is no point in discussing plausibility when our plot is based on a series of interconnected coincidences so incredibly incredible: that is, first, that Charley corrected her overbite the same day her wife would repair her nose, second, that each spouse would keep their respective Cosmetic surgeries are secret to each other, and thirdly, that by colliding with each other in public later, Charley and Vivien would not recognize each other. It sounds a bit exaggerated, right? Multiple stretches is more similar. Clearly, we are in the world of farce here and we just have to roll with the crooked turns of the plot, so whenever you can relax and forget about plausibility, you're likely to enjoy this short film. <br /> <br /> MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE begins slowly as the various complications of the story are set, but things get resolved once Charley and Vivien "meet" and make an appointment to attend a party at Charley's dentist's house. Each one rushes home with enthusiasm, enters separately and at first they do not realize the presence of the other. (Mr. and Mrs. Moose seem pretty rich, by the way, since they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel). It follows a beautifully reminiscent sequence of THE NAVIGATOR, by Buster Keaton, in which husband and wife throw themselves on the House without even meeting face to face. And once they get to the party, the comedy really gets going when Charley is forced to dance with Gale Henry. Henry, an esteemed player in her own right who starred in many short comedies dating back to 1914, is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace to her dance. There is also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence, when the camera shows us only the shoes of Charley's dance partners, Gale, Vivien and Vivien, but we can follow exactly what is happening between the principles by watching their feet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Charley and Vivien, the party they attend is raided and, from there, the complications multiply when they manage to escape from the police network and return home. When Charley realizes that his newly prettified wife was trying to date another man, he solves a lesson for each of them. . . while conveniently forgetting, of course, that he was trying to do the same. The final minutes of this film offer some of Chase's funniest physical comedy, crowned with a good-looking gag for the auction. MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow, and is surely classified with the funniest comedies produced by the prolifically and sadly underestimated Charley Chase.
