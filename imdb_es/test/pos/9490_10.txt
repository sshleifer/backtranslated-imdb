Just another showcase of Zeppelin led in its maximum expression and its best absolute balance. each member of the band is on his best page of jimmy and his bow and guitar JPJ with his thunderous bass sound beating and Robert singing like his not tomorrow. I have to say that when we go into the first song we're going to groove on, it's the beginning of something very special. this DVD follows the zeppelin throughout his 11 years of Carree, starting at 69 at the Royal Albert Hall, then at Madison Square Garden 73, followed by a much older and mature band at 75 in Earls Court and finally a band from It looks different in its last concert in English in Knebworth in 79. This DVD is a fantastic showcase of zeppelin and if you are not a fan, you will be looking for it. north
