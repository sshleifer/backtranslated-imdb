What a great movie! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but I was familiar with his happy and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950s. Although I never got interested in Gary Bussey, he was fabulous like Buddy Holly! I do not know how accurate the film is, but I guess at least for the most part it's accurate, which makes the movie even more interesting. The music throughout the film only adds the pizazz to this biography. I do not think I changed anything in this movie, everything was good! What a difference in stars from the 50s to the stars of today's music. How can you compare someone like Buddy Holly with Justin Timberlake? Or one of the other popular singers of this generation?
