Personally, I have a weakness for horror films that are found in hospitals and in nursing homes, so I had a good feeling to see this "Do not look in the basement", although its reputation is dubious. Well, it turned out that he was right! This is a great entertainment of poor quality with a couple of efficient crashes and deliciously absurd characters. He must, of course, look beyond the poor production values ​​and the completely illogical plot, but if he manages to do so (and if he is a fan of this type of horror, that is an essential quality), he will be rewarded with a scandalous "video" -needful "in which blood and madness form the main elements. The young and pretty nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanatorium where she is supposed to start her new job. She learns that the doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and that substitute teachers of the doctor in charge seem reluctant to accept the arrival. Life inside the sanitarium is quite peculiar, as patients run free and all doors are kept open. After a whole series of strange events, Charlotte discovers the horrible secrets that the institution hides ... The first 10 minutes (pre-credits) are great and so is the climax completely deranged. Everything in the middle is practically without surprise or tension, but you wait patiently because you feel that the end will be very funny. The patients of the asylum are lunatics of textbooks, but in spite of that I love them. Some of my favorites are the former judge (who still speaks exclusively in legal terms), the suspicious army sergeant and the exaggerated old woman. "Do not look in the basement" is a great fun with little brain, especially recommended for the fans of the cinema of garbage of the 70s, sick puppies and other types of scum. The lunatics have taken refuge, yes!
