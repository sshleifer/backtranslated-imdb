Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple) surprises many of his fans when he learned that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies on the West End and Broadway. In general, he was a total villain or a serious actor for the public who ignored his comedic talents. In fact, he actually made four comedic appearances (a parody of his evil backsliding with fellow villain Peter Lorre in a cameo). His best overall appearance in a movie in a comedy was probably that of magazine editor Alexander Yardley in "Christmas In Connecticut" (although his autocratic and half-crazy soap mogul in "The Hucksters" is in second place). Despite some problems with the script, it's a good movie, and it's usually revived in the holiday season. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in the magazine "American Housekeeping" for Yardley, where she gives home tips and recipes. She is Martha Steward's version of 1945, except that Mrs. Steward is a cook and a housewife, and she can respond by trying and proving what she defends. Stanwyck can not. Her recipes are those of her friend FÃ©lix (S.Z. Sakall), a chef and gourmet restaurateur. The house she describes as her home (a model farm in Connecticut) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend, architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner really would not mind marrying Stanwyck, but she is not quite ready to consider a final commitment with him. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts, the Nazis are shipwrecked in an American. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor. Spend two weeks on a raft before being rescued. Sensing the value of advertising, Greenstreet decides to grant Morgan's wish to have an authentic old-fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. She basically tells Stanwyck that she will entertain Morgan and him on his farm during the holidays. Stanwyck is unable to explain that the self-image of the columns (complete with her ability to flip the ailerons and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband) is a lie: if she does, she will be fired, as will her immediate boss. Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). In a moment of depression, she accepts Gardiner's marriage proposal, and then Gardiner discovers that her Connecticut home becomes Stanwyck's "real" home and he and "her baby." <br /> <br /> Of course, apart. Leaving Greenstreet's intrusive curiosity aside, Stanwyck and Morgan discover that they are falling in love (much to Gardiner's displeasure: he really expects Stanwyck to still marry him). Complication after complication occurs, while lies accumulate on lies, and when neighbor's babies happen to neighbor's babies, before Greenstreet begins to wonder if something is missing. But it's a comedy, so everything works fine. Even Greenstreet, in the end, has fun with all the madness: his famous laugh that reflects the Santa Clause for a change. This is not a classic comedy, it's certainly not a big one, but it's fun enough for the season to be worth seeing in December.
