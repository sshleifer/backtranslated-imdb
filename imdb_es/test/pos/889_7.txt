Created by the same association Monty Berman / Dennis Spooner who produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk (deceased), the latter was titled My Partner the Ghost for the United States market. Department S continues to be a classic example of the action and adventure series produced by the United Kingdom. Bulk in the late sixties. Like those two shows, its internal dynamics of two men and one girl could indicate a progressive attitude towards equality (the S Dept also has a black superior), but it is mainly front: the launch episode, "Six days" , is halfway before Rosemary, Nichols, is called to parade with a bra, panties and one (yes, one) stockings to free herself from a dubious situation. Still, it's an interesting time capsule, even if the awful fashion sense of the Peter Wyngarde character (who, surprisingly, degenerated even more in the spin-off series Jason King) should definitely have remained buried.
