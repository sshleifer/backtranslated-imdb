*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of 4) <br /> <br /> "Do you think there is a part of yourself, deep inside? in your mind, with things you do not want other people to see? During a session I'm in, I can see those things. " <br /> <br /> - Catherine Deane <br /> <br /> And so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "The Cell" is a love / hate film, whether you love it or hate it. I can understand the reasons why some people do not like this production. With a story that combines disruptive serial killers with a mental probe, "The Cell" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think it's one of the most fascinating films of the year. <br /> <br /> Making his film debut, Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich and colorful images and provocative characters. The filmmakers take advantage of each shot. Protosevich conceived ideas for "The Cell" in 1993, when he decided to combine two of his main interests, those of the mind and serial killers. He was reportedly influenced by directors such as Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such imagination. <br /> <br /> The film combines two main narratives, one on the scientific exploration of the human mind and the other on a psychopath who murders young women for their own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a child therapist, is part of a neurological study at the Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of his empathic personality, the scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of a catatonic preadolescent with the hope of reviving his brain and awakening him. <br /> <br /> A sick and demented serial killer walks the streets. Inside an abandoned rural farm, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) locks up innocent victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI every time he approaches, until now. A violent attack makes him comatose. The FBI captures your body forever unconscious. Unfortunately, he has already prepared the cell with his last victim. In forty hours, the cell will be filled with water, and Stargher is the only man who knows the location of his victim. <br /> <br /> The FBI takes this situation to the Campbell Center, where Catherine enters Stargher's mind. hoping to discover the location of his last victim before the cell is filled with water, sending the woman to a watery grave. <br /> <br /> The science fiction parts of the story are based on both real science and the theoretical fiction of creation. of the System of Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer. The premise takes a long time to develop, but it's worth waiting for. It's unlikely, but that does not matter. The movie makes us believe. However, even if you do not suspend disbelief, the visual appeal offers an attractive environment to enjoy. <br /> <br /> According to the production notes of the film, Mark Protosevich was delighted to work with the director, called Tarsem, because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, impressive art direction and highly developed skills to tell a story. "When I wrote 'The Cell,'" explains Protosevich, "I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of paintings or pictures of painters while I was working, so I'm thinking visually, and Tarsem is a highly visual director. of visual references that made a very smooth collaboration. " <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a backbone, and no actor could have achieved his character better. It offers a mysterious, disturbing and attractive performance. "I think that my character is, in a certain way, trapped in himself", reflects D'Onofrio. He also investigated the psychology of serial killers to help him get beneath the surface of the character. His deep preparation for performance has excellent performance. <br /> <br /> While the actors, the writer and the director do wonders with their material, the real honor is for the talent behind the scenes of the film. Director of photography Paul Laufer, production designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney and visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They bring the world of "The Cell" to life. It is an extraordinary world worthy of several sightings. Some movies that you see, others that you experience. "The cell" falls into the later category. <br /> <br />
