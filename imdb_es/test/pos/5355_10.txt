I really refused to watch this movie. I refused to go to school and I refused to go with my parents. Just looking at the trailer, I thought it stupid, anyway. That day, one of my friends wanted to take me to the movies and offered me 2 options, "The Dukes Of Hazzard" or "Wallace And Gromit: The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit". It took me 17 minutes to decide. The time was running out. I had to choose. "Few" appeared on the screen, as in some other entries. By the time we had to line up and get our ticket, only one of us could enter. He desperately wanted Nicholas to come in to see him. But he forced me. I crossed my arms and felt very moody and disappointed that she came in to see this childhood. I went in, sat in the only seat available and ready for the movie. I must say that I was very surprised that I sat through that MASTERPIECE! It was incredible. I do not know what I was complaining about. The animation Clay was, by far, the best I've seen in my life. The story was brilliant. About a rabbit that interrupted and crashed a carnival that had been planned for more than 500 years. Basically, Anti Pest Control protects people who compete in the competition of vegetables. Anti Pesto, known as Wallace and Gromit (who are in charge of this business), tries to keep all the rabbits away from the carnival of vegetables. I will not say anything else. It's too good to say. I admit that the whole idea of ​​a Were-Rabbit is incredibly amazing and very childish, but Nick Park adds substance, which makes everyone love it. I mean, there will not be a 10-foot rabbit loose and there will definitely be no 8-foot werewolves as it is said in "Dog Soldiers." On the other hand, Were-Rabbits and WereWolves are not real creatures. But in any case, it worked very well. <br /> <br /> The jokes were also bigger. Children do not get some of the jokes. It goes way over their heads. He had a lot of British jokes there. If you love British humor, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I also loved the cast and the voices. Everything about the movie is incredibly well done. The direction and pace was absolutely ... FANTASTIC! I recommend it to fans of old Wallace And Gromit shorts (And no, I have not seen them yet), and I recommend it to fans who liked "Shrek" and "Shrek 2 and, most importantly, I recommend it People who like Clay Animation Cracking good movie! 10/10
