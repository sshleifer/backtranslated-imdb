I have been a fan of Mario since I can remember, I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a child, this game has brought me many of those memories and added something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment of the incredible Mario franchise. This game is very different from any other Mario before this, while the best elements of Mario are kept intact, the first notable difference is that the story takes place in space. <br /> <br /> The story begins much like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at his castle in the Kingdom of the Fungi. Upon reaching Castle Peach, Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their aircraft. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle into space. In the middle of the castle that rises into space, Mario falls and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the house of Luma, a floating space station. Here, Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets his leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has removed the stars of power from the space station and dispersed them throughout the universe; It depends on Mario to help the Lumas to find them and save Peach, and that's how the adventure begins. The game is made flying from the space station to other galaxies. Each galaxy consists of several planets among which Mario travels in levels through these shooting stars to retrieve the Stars of power. Mario can walk many times around the planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others large, many planets are similar to Mario's classic environments. The best of the game are the controls, all the things, like jumping and similar, are still the same, but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote control. Mario will perform a spin that is used as the main attack in the game, and will also activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to shoot bits of stars at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there are the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it's so hard to describe how good this game looks, you could almost say it looks as good as in some 360 ​​games. <Br / > <br /> My only minor complaint is that the reverse effect requires a little time to get used to, and also the story is quite weak. The worst part is that you lose all your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you have when you last left, you restart at 4 lives. Still, apart from these minor problems, it's an excellent game that is very entertaining and very challenging. This is the kind of game we've been waiting for on the Wii. <br /> <br /> A perfect 10 out of 10!
