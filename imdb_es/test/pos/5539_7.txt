If you're looking for a not-so-serious mafia movie, with a woman as the protagonist, you're in the right place. Pfieffer has acted much better than this. You can see that she has matured beyond this image. <br /> <br /> The first time I chose this film, I expected Pfeiffer to be wrong, however, she plays the role of mafia wife until the end. Nor is it a bad performance by Baldwin. <br /> <br /> If you do not pay attention to the hair, you could enjoy this movie. But do not take it too seriously ...
