I have seen this movie when it was released and it is certainly moving. I liked the point of view of a girl who came to know that what she thought about her was not true. It's a fragment for that little boy. And her quest to discover who she is. And before and after she knows about her, the relationship between her and her adoptive mother. That's a nice sight. A R Rahman adds his stress for a good re-recording and songs. In this film, mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advice (as in Vuyire), but simply narrates the characters as they are. And that's why the film hits the audience exactly. The pool bath scene of chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas did not perfectly convey what it meant. Mani Ratnam has improved incredibly.
