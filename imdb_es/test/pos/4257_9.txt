I can not say how many times that line has made me laugh or how often I have described that scene to people who are not familiar with this movie. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19 years old. I do not think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Pleased to see here that others found him as hysterical as me, and I see that he has a lasting value despite the past time. Rent it, buy it or buy it ... a must.
