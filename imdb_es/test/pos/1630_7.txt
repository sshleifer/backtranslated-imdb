I was at the premiere of the movie last night in Rome. I'm not an expert on the book, however, there are a lot of book changes to the movie. The rhythm of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were cut otherwise, this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feeling of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company. <br /> <br /> There are some things in the book that seem very unlikely in the film form. I'm not giving spoilers, except to say that the end of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who watch the film may be interested in reading the book to get all the details of the story. Some minor details are also cut out of the movie. <br /> <br /> Although they made a film in Rome, they had to recreate interior shots. Since I made a walking tour of Rome the day before the movie, I can say that the interior sites are authentic in appearance. Kohler is not in the film and does not show much about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes related to the archives of the Vatican. Of course, they did not have access to that area and I'm not sure if anyone really knows what the archives of the Vatican look like. Eyelet Zurer has his chance in this film as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as a bonbon for Hanks. <br /> <br /> This film should be better received by critics and the public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and, as we saw him and the cast before the movie, this is just a movie.
