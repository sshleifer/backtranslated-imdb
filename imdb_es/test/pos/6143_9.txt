I was surprised to read the comments of the person who did not like this movie. It really is quite fun. There are definitely some laugh phrases that my boyfriend and I quoted. Some of the situations can be disturbing (bisexuality, drugs, a particularly bizarre view of a child's sexuality) but believable at the same time. It is about communication and lack of communication between men and women.
