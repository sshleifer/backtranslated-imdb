After watching "Waco: The Rules of Engagement," I was just sitting in disbelief of what I witnessed. A big cover up by the FBI, a massacre by happy government agents? I clearly remember the confrontation of Waco, I was 17 years old at the time and I saw everything on CNN. I remembered reflecting on all the children as I watched the Mount Camel complex burn in April 1993. I remember feeling sorry for the children, but I clearly felt it was the fault of their evil leader David Koresh and the other Davidians. Gazecki's film clearly and unequivocally shows, although it is partial, that the FBI lied again and again. I think this film contributed greatly to the reopening of a new investigation of the incident in 1999. The result of this new investigation was, in a sense, predictable, the trial was based on a fact as gray as the facts that the Davidians presented I felt very disappointed with the verdict, because, as far as I know, it did not take into account all the lies, the misinformation and the concealment of the evidence by the FBI and other officials. Why has not anyone been prosecuted for obstructing the work of Texas Rangers investigators? Why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and demolish the complex shortly after the incident? These are questions to which the government has not given me answers. Most importantly, what about the children? In this new research I have not been informed about who was responsible for spraying CS flammable tear gas into a compound with many hazards to ignite this gas and I have not found any response to whether the muscles of the children contracted due to the effects of gas, while they were alive. If they did, they would surely think that Janet Reno or whoever was in charge of the raid should be charged with mass murder or murder. The question that was raised by Gazecki, but not mentioned is; Was it a direct plan for the people in charge and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building with intention? (a plan that would have been achieved with 112% efficiency) or if the officials in charge were so incompetent, that they were not aware of the consequences of their actions. Both are equally frightening. Even if the Davidians set fire to the complex, the officers in charge surely gave them the opportunity to do the work. If the officials in charge knew, as they claimed, that the Davidians would burn down the complex, why did the f? Did the tanks cut all the holes in the building to turn it into an oven and why did not they have plans to deal with the fire that they knew would happen? Dark questions that still will not disappear The last and most relevant theme of this film is the way in which the Davidians are demonized by the government through the media, which only transmit it to the public. I clearly remember the resentment I felt for the evil Davidians I saw on CNN in 1993. Now that I am older, I can see a clear line of communication that comes out of the government every time they prepare for a massacre of civilians. with the intended objectives. Demonize people with words like; "They have different illegal values ​​and we" "do not enjoy freedom" and "are a threat to our freedoms and our way of life", does it make them much easier to kill?
