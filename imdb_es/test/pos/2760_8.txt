Graphically, it's the same game as the first, only different levels and some new features added for fun. <br /> <br /> The PS1 version still has a problem with giving skaters enough air for some ground tricks. The version of Dreamcast, which is rarely seen anymore, was the best version of the 4 versions (Xbox finally came out with a fifth with 2x), had a clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed than PS1 and N64 could drive. <br /> <br /> The levels are really amazingly done, from beginning to end, like the first, the school was my favorite, I enjoyed that level very much, not only because of the golf cart that sometimes runs over you. but for the length. That's what I liked about the first two games, they do not make these games graphically improved, they just focused on the length of the levels, which is great. <br /> <br /> In general, as good as the first, and well worth playing.
