This short film certainly does not throw punches. The story is of a butcher who unfairly kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually abused his retarded daughter. The film continues to show how the butcher fulfills his duty, and returns to life with his daughter in charge, and having to accept a life without a future. <br /> <br /> The graphic scenes of the opening of a horse. Being sacrificed, and the full frontal birth of the daughter of the butchers gives you a brutal mood that stays with you throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The fast flow of the film is very direct and adds to its brutality. Consequently, a lot of ground is covered in the 40 minutes. You are completely involved with the non-life carnage, especially after you lose your daughter to social services and your business. His story continues in the excellent film Seoul Contre Tous.
