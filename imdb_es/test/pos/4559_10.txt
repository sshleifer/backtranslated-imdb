It turns out that Chris Farley and David Spade only made three movies together ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but this was truly the "Citizen Kane" of their partners. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the heir of an auto parts company. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires Richard Hayden (David Spade) to take care of him. Big Tom is going to marry a "ten" (Bo Derek), so everything has to be in order. After Big Tom dies suddenly, Tommy and Richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. From then on, the film is an excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best: mess everything up. <br /> <br /> When this movie first appeared in theaters, I saw it with my grandfather. He soon discovered that the characters of Bo Derek and Rob Lowe were hiding something. But you can ignore it completely and simply enjoy the antics of Chris Farley. There is nothing safe around his stomach, and hell has no fury like his carefree and happy attitude. The scene in which he sets fire to the cars, and then to the scene of the deer, creates a pure revolt. Chris Farley and David Spade were really the John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of his time. It is a pleasure to be able to always think of "Gordo with a small coat" over and over again.
