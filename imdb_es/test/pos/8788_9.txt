Alfred Hitchcock's saboteur is not one of his best-considered films; made between two images much more popular and praised by critics, Suspicion and Shadow Of a Doubt, is generally considered as a minor effort. I agree that the latest film is innovative and draws Hitchcock completely into the mainstream of the US for the first time, but Saboteur is on his way at least as animated as Suspicion; Its main flaw is that its not so charismatic star players, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. <br /> <br /> In Saboteur we find Hitchcock touring America, literally, while his main character travels from California to New York in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was charged. Cummings is very young here, and quite attractive. His adolescence (but not immaturity) is perfectly adapted to the character he is representing, and it seems appropriate, since the director, although middle-aged, was in the process of reinventing himself, and an older and more established star could have put things lightly. The powerful heroine of Priscilla Lane, who was not a typical type for the director, was very common in American films at that time; and she and Cummings provide an opening and a young man that the director needed both in his life and in his work at this time. I can not imagine older, more solid guys, Cooper and Stanwyck for example, doing it better, since they would have, between them, well, too much luggage. <br /> <br /> As is the norm In Hitchcock movies, nothing is as it seems. Where Saboteur differs from its best-known films is that the audience is allowed to enter the game early. Although Cummings is an accused arsonist, we know he is innocent. The villains become apparent pretty soon; and the film depends more on its plot than on its ironies. The pleasures there are incidental, and here the Master does not disappoint. There's an interesting interlude by Tod Browningish with some circus fans, who help Cummings avoid his capture. In another scene, reminiscent of James Whale's Frankenstein Bride, Cummings spends some time in a blind man's cabin, who, it seems, is Lane's uncle. Was the director studying key American films from the previous decade? Whatever the case, these and other unconventional and discursive aspects of the film give it a ludic touch and a variety that, when added to the fairly youthful clues factor, makes the image look like the work of a younger man, still learning his trade. <br /> <br /> The later scenes of the film, in New York, are more suspensive and typical of the director, since the image gradually becomes more Hitchockian as it progresses. In the end it seems a satisfactory work; and since neither Cummings nor Lane has a dark side as an actor, neither does the film have one. It is deliberately light, and I suspect it is semi-experimental; an attempt by Hitchcock to see if he could achieve, in an American environment, the kind of history he had done so well in England. He got it admirably. The next logical step: Shadow Of a Doubt, a film in which the main character travels from east to west, and with a completely different set of values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
