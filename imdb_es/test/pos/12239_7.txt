The creature characteristic of the early 1980s refers to an abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to revise. Naturally, they do not find gold there but a very hungry monster that crawls in search of prey. <br /> <br /> Although I have to be honest and admit that at first I found it boring (I personally prefer the theme theme) "The Boogens"), it actually grew in me as I went along. Now, the characters are not very interesting nor the actors. The closest to an interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. In any case, the female protagonist Terri Berland is quite attractive and Rolf Theison makes his dominator an easy person to hate. The writer played by the effects man Mark Sawicki quickly runs out. <br /> <br /> Start in a predictable and comfortable enough way, with a night game in which it is stated that two victims achieve an acceptable start. The monster itself is intriguing because of its design (as you can imagine, it is revealed little by little until the end of the game) and because it is the product of stop motion animation when this process was not used much anymore. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (who runs under the pseudonym David Michael Hillman) and the crew deserve some credit for their atmosphere creation. They manage to make the film look quite claustrophobic and grim, and their use of lighting works well. The film builds in intensity towards a pretty good ending. Suffice it to say that they do the best they can with their low budget. <br /> <br /> A small, dark item worth looking for horror fans. <br /> <br /> 7/10
