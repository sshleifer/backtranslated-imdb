Mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. In the world of wine there is a great difference between the large and the small winery. It is not only about the size of your vineyard, but also about the amount of money and power you have. If you have enough money to place ads in the wine viewer and contract a so-called "wine except", then the size of your estate does not matter. Also in today's business world, wine is often sold en masse and adapted to the taste of the people. What it means many times came filtered from its origin. Mondovino shows the commercial side of wine in that of the mega producer Robert Mondavi, and Michael Rolland, the wine expert who shapes the wine to the taste of today's critics, such as Robert Parker, who is also in the film. Now these men are not evil or they are wrong because they have done a lot of good for the wine. But they have power on a large scale. As we all know, power corrupts. Mondovino also shows small winemakers such as Aime Guilbert of Languedoc and Hubert de Montille de Volnay in Burgundy. These wine makers are not hungry wine makers, but they know, like all great winemakers, that this is where the grapes come from. The best example of this is explained not by a winemaker but by a Haitian man who works for Neal Rosenthal, the wine importer. In the area where the grapes are grown, the terroir that matters, a guiding hand that knows this makes the wine important.
