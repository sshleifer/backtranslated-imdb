This film is excellent, it has the same feeling as the first low budget movie of 'Pi' and 'Clerks', but it has the style of 'Memento' (also by writer / director Christopher Nolan). The score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost 'Memento' prototypes, and the story shows that Christopher Nolan is better when he writes and directs. Do not be discouraged by the low-budget appearance and performance, or even for the short duration of the movie, and look!
