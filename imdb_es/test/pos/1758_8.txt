Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those movies that I grew up listening to, however, you could never get a copy until now. I just watched this movie on DVD and I thought it was a lovely and charming movie, with a wonderful animation, a good plot and great songs. If this film was made by Disney, then the film would be considered a classic, however, because it was made by a little-known film studio that has long been gone, the film slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The film was made by the Max Fleischer studios in their studios in Miami, FL and was launched through Paramount Pictures. The film had to have its premiere on December 7, 1941, date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Although this probably affected the release of the film, the film was screened in some movie theaters for up to a year, as the research shows. The film was rated as a favorite by most major American newspapers. The film continued to be reissued approximately every year, usually on holidays such as Holy Week, at least in major cities. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, this film was reissued with a new name "Hoppity Goes to Town", which is named after the main character of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is a true period piece, which captures a portion of Americana as it was in the late 30s and 1940s. The animation is great, and many of the characters are very cute. The animation of the humans in the film is done through the rotoscoping process, which means that the actors were filmed and then the images were tracked by animators, which gave the movement a very real look. <br /> <br /> The Fleishcher studios were one of several animation studios that make cartoons in the 30s and 40s. While some of Fleischer's characters like Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman cartoons are more known, the work of the study is more or less forgotten. <br /> <br /> Almost entirely the body of work of the Fleischer studios are in the public domain. All Superman cartoons are in the public domain, all but one of the "Color Classics" series are public domain, and the movie "The Trips of Gulliver" is also in the public domain. This film never seems to have been released in the United States on VHS or DVD, but was released in Europe. However, some who search the Internet can produce a copy very quickly. I recommend the search.
