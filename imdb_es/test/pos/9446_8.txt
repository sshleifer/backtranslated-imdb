Okay, so I do not understand why people feel so aggravated by this movie. So I thought it was going to be Amanda Bynes' usual movie, but it was not. It was great. <br /> <br /> Well, it's okay, so the performance was not the best, but I thought the performances were still great. Also, you could say that the actors were having fun while doing this movie. In other films, which have surprisingly won awards, where the actors did not like to work in the film, you could say. All the actors had chemistry, and that also proved it. <br /> <br /> A ton of people are taking advantage of the soccer skills that the actors have. Yah, then they are not perfect ... get over it! They are actors, not soccer players. I've played soccer all my life, and believe me, it's hard to learn, so stop improving the level of skills you have. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was going to be stupid, but it was really funny. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a situation fun without even saying anything is fun. I found myself laughing a lot in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general ... I LOVE!
