LACKAWANNA BLUES is a good play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even better movie when the author adapted his own life story for the screen. This brilliant film turns the screen on with intense colors, good music, brilliant editing, excellent direction by George C. Wolfe, and such an impressive cast that makes encore viewing mandatory. Yes, it's that good. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the author's life as the 'Junior' child (Marcus Carl Franklin) raised in the inimitable home of empirical empathic Rachel "Nanny" Crosby (S (Epatha Merkerson), a a lady who dedicated her life to helping the marginalized by transporting them from the south, from psychiatric hospitals and from the streets to Lackawanna, New York The boy remembers all the lessons he learned about the lives of the inhabitants of the house (strange characters with pasts Painful) and the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny.The innumerable characters of the house are too numerous to describe, but they are represented by some of the best actors in the business: Terrence Howard, Rosie PÃ©rez, Mos Def , the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper. goes on and on. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of disaggregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the contagious joy of the contributions of the African-American music to our musical culture and the courage of a woman who fought against all the difficulties the world can offer to maintain the dignity of the people she came in contact with. S. Epatha Merkerson is totally immersed in this role, a role that she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. She offers one of the most impressive performances of recent years, and if this movie had been released in theaters instead of like an HBO movie, she would certainly add the Oscar to place next to her Golden Globe award. <br /> <br /> The full cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles acting and storytelling like a teacher: like the riffs in a jazz piece, he pastes small moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the array of dance festivals in the local clubs filled with incredible blues, jazz, dance and joy. The production team has mounted this small miracle of an image with extreme care and, for a moment, the attention does not move away from the impulse of history. Highly recommended, almost mandatory viewing! Harp grady
