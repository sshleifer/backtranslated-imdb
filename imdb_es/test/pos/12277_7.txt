You have to love the western universe of spaghetti. The vision of a west where the good ones go blank without warning, the cartoonish villains chew the stage in extreme approaches, and the antihero in the end moves away from the girl. Many people say that Corbucci's films are "depressing". I find it a bit iffy in terms of descriptions. I think that grim and implacable are more apt for the most part because "depressing" suggests a level of sentimentality that almost all Eurowestern directors ignore in favor of depicting characters in broad strokes. <br /> <br /> GLI SPECIALISTI must be seen in all its widescreen splendor Before it can take its place in the canon of Sergio Corbucci. It is a beautiful movie. And it makes sense that Corbucci would like to vent to COMPANEROS after the incessant hit two of THE GREAT SILENCE and this (although he would later return to his usual tricks with the foolish SONNY AND JED). There is still a certain amount of caricature that detracts from the general desolation of the film, but it hurts more than anything else that is an unnecessary inclusion of three children dressed as hippies lurking around the city in search of gold and trouble. And it hurts that Mario Adorf plays the Mexican bandit with a hand The Devil, since he always plays his characters. <br /> <br /> Those minor complaints aside there is more than enough here to wet the palate of amateur spaghetti Shootouts in abundance, the population of an entire city reduced to crawling naked on earth, the iconic badassness typical of laconic antihero (played by Johnny Halliday), the moral bankruptcy of almost all the characters in the film. It is possible that Corbucci never receives the acclaim of the most famous Sergio or the American patriarchs of the genre, but you and I know that this is a grave injustice for a talented director. His dynamic selection of shots, the in-depth staging with objects stuck to the camera and receding in the background, his talent for fast paced and fevered energy in the movement of a story that was not always all, the way in which I photograph open spaces, all in their work, I assure you that if Corbucci were American and had appeared 15 years later, along with Mann and Hawks, critics of Cahiers du Cinema would have praised him as an author worthy of serious critical consideration.
