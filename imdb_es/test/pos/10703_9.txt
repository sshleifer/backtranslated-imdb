For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson about making American movies. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are based largely on casting. You choose and choose characters that you think will improve the drama and entertainment value of your movie. <br /> <br /> After filming a ton of footage, splicing it to make a movie with ups and downs, inflection points, climax, etc. If you have problems with existing images, you can shoot some more that make sense, find some archive images or be smart with your narrative. <br /> <br /> The claim that the filmmakers used images of places that are not part of the film (favelas along beautiful beaches) do not detract from the film as a dramatic piece, and the image in particular is a that resonates enough to justify its inclusion not so truthful. In any case, use the material you can. So they did not have images of police violence for that particular neighborhood. Does this mean you do not include it and just talk about it or maybe include some cartoon animation so that the audience is not "cheated"? Um no. <br /> <br /> Regarding the hopeful ending, why not? Yes, the Americans did it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why end with a low note? Simply because it is set in a foreign country and foreign films in general have a negative note? Let foreigners portray the grim picture of life. <br /> <br /> Americans think that there may be a happy ending in the future. There can be only one.
