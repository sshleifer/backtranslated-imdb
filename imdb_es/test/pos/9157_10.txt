Hey, you're not alone! I remember Nichols! I was only 17 when I was turned on. I remember that James Garner was one of the best actors, and Nichols was a great show. I could not believe it was in such a short time, I wish I could remember the last episode, I probably did not see it ... there was not a backup at that time, so when I saw it, it saw it, and if I missed an episode that It had gone forever unless it came back on summer reruns. Anyway, sure it would be great if it came out on DVD, but I do not think many people knew. What a shame. <br /> <br /> A few years later, Garner would make it big with Rockford Files, and brought his friend Stuart Margolin from Nichols to play his partner Angel.
