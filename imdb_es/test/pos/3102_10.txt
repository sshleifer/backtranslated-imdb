There is a need for this type of entertainment in our modern world. You can see "Ma and Pa" with adults, with your family (children of any age or only, like me.) They are gentle, but gentle they are so refreshing in a society of children that kill children, a horrible war, an inappropriate television in the primetime and poverty, we do not even understand where all those children come from! Give me plumbing and I will gladly become a Kettle Humor does not require offensive language It is difficult to follow conversations in shows where all other word It's a beep, relax, take off your shoes and get on your recliner with a good glass of old-fashioned lemonade, and just breathe easy watching Ma pull the hens off the table at lunchtime!
