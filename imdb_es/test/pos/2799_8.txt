The first thing I wanted to do after seeing this movie was to see it again (because I had missed many things with all the laughs I did). I am European and I have studied abroad and I have lived as well as Spanish, French, Italian and German. The film was full of stereotypes, which, most of the time, make people take off, and when reading some of the other reviews, I see that this made people angry. But, this movie has stereotypes so correct that I can not criticize it. Except maybe the way the Frenchman became a drunken party animal. The English boy was the perfect "geezer" stereotype. Drunk, annoying, insulting but shining at the end. In addition to the stereotypes, the film also correctly reflected the emotional aspect of studying abroad. At first he is shy, he does not know anyone, he misses his house, he does not know how to move. As time progresses, it becomes your home and when it is time to leave, it is extremely difficult. A feeling that people can only understand if they have experienced it. I highly recommend this movie.
