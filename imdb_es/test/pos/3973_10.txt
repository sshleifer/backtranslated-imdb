I entered this thought another thick film with thick humor. Counting from my first sentence, I do not like that humor and this movie had its moments, but I loved it. Justin Long has never really done a comedy like this, where he is sarcastic and intelligent and I loved it. Lewis Black ... I said enough. The ending that I really loved because I had to take myself seriously, I mean, how else would you end it? Yes, it is another weaker story, but not in its typical format and the film was not its ups and downs, it was the people who joined for a common goal: to go to the university where they were accepted. The cast was incredible and yes, I laughed out loud when I thought I would not and the laughter lasted longer than I thought. The parents and the sister played their roles well, but their characters are placed when necessary. The film was not focused around them, but at the same time they appeared when you waited and did not expect them to do so. They played the story very well, and I loved the familiar faces Anthony Heald (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long) Ross Patterson (The New Guy) and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added some truth to the movie that made it even more enjoyable, as well as to B's Friends. I recommend this movie to anyone who has hated those thick comedies of the last 4 years and really wants something with humor and really a story!
