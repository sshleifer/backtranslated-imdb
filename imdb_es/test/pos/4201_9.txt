Who plays the role of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. Apparently he did not receive credits. Very bad. <br /> <br /> All the Dead End Kids do their work beautifully in this 1939 entry. It's strange to see them on a western stage with their Brooklyn accents (I guess it should be Bowery). They even show some swimming skills. <br /> <br /> I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing / love / crime story. My favorite at this moment is in the fight scene near the end of the movie. Busby Berkeley shows his experience in dance films when John Garfield moves and, as we watch that movement, the camera moves closer to his face. I will not reveal why or when, but the expression on his face at that time probably caused the 1939 audience to stand in the theaters. <br /> <br /> Some will think that John Garfield looks a lot like Frank Sinatra in many scenes Only his face. Actually, Frank was still not making movies, so maybe Frank looked like John. The boxer named Smith in the movie looks like a clone of Ed Begley, Jr. <br /> <br /> Now I have to tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch the movie, look at the grandmother's hands. Let Robson do his part well. She seems to have hands that wander a little. In a scene where she and a crowd enter the boxer's dressing room (John Garfield), she watches where John Garfield rests while he is using only his trunks. <br /> <br /> A great ending. Many wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> The best line could be at the service station, "... eight gallons, that's a twenty-eight dollar ..." Tom Willett
