If you are a film student, or you were, or are thinking of becoming one, the name of Battleship Potemkin has or will have a resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other silent film pioneers such as Griffith (although Eisenstein's innovations are not as common as Griffith's) and Murnau, has had such an impact on the history of cinema that, of course, it is taken for granted. The reason why I mention the part of film student is that at some point, like it or not, your film teacher 9 out of 10 will show the sequence of "Odessa Stairs" of this film. It is difficult to say if it is even the "best" part of several sequences of the film dealing with the times (at the present time) of the Russian revolution. But it leaves the biggest impact, and it can be seen in many movies that show suspense, or simply montage (the climax of the untouchables comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Montage, which was not only the gift of Eistenstein but also the blood of his life at the beginning of his career, is often used incorrectly in the current cinema or, if not used incorrectly, in a inappropriate context for the story. Sometimes, the assembly is now used as a device to move from point A to point B. The assembly was something else for Eisenstein; I was trying to communicate in the most direct way I could, the urgency, the passion (s) and the most important tragedies that were in the Russian people at that time and place. Even if one does not see all of Eisenstein's narrative or the traditional ideas of "history" to have a lot of ground connection (Kubrick has said this), one can not deny the power of seeing ships get to port, the people in the stairs, and the soldiers coming to them anyway with weapons. Some may find it hard to believe that this was done in the 1920s; It has that power as the Passion of Joan of Arc to surpass its time and remain in importance even if only in terms of technique and emotion. <br /> <br /> Of course, one could continue with the books (which have been written hundreds of times, one of which was not the least by Eisenstein himself). In the film itself, Battleship Potemkin is really more like a dramatized newscast than a specific story in a movie. The first segment is also one of the great sequences in the film, since a riot is plotted against the Captain and other bosses of a given ship. This is detailed almost in a manipulative way, but in some way extremely effective; The assembly is also used here, but in bursts of energy that capture the eye. Other times, Eisenstein is happier to let the images speak for themselves, as the soldiers get tired without food or water. He is not one of those directors who will try to put all sides of the story; He is, of course, very Russian at the beginning of the twentieth century, but he is nothing more than honest about how he sees his themes and style, and that is what he wins in the end. <br /> <br /> Some may want to check it out of film school, since the sequence of "Stairs" is like one of those milestones of the serious tragedy in the movie, which shows the ugly side of the revolution . It is possible that Eisenstein is not one of the most 'accessible' directors of silent films, but if the editing, the details in the picture, the non-actor and Bolshevik themes are his cup of tea, it is truly one of the must-see visits of all life.
