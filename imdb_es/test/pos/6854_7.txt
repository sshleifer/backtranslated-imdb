I really liked this movie. The actors were great, particularly Powerful, which is different in each role; FÃ¼rmann, who is also capable of playing anyone; and Loos, who spices up things (she is also a talented singer, sings the song "Mi verdad", which is heard when a character activates the stereo in the laboratory). <br /> <br /> Anatomie is a good horror Flick, who pays attention to his characters. Sometimes it is also very bloody, and the design of the set is innovative. It's a shame they had to make a sequel, which does not look like the original. <br /> <br /> On a side note, there are two other things that are definitely worth mentioning. The DVD is not bent, which improves the movie experience. Also, make sure you keep looking after the final credits start rolling.
