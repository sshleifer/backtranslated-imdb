The funniest performance was that of Shalom Harlow, as the supermodel fianc√©e of Matt Dillon. She was more interesting to me than all the main actors. This movie got it all wrong; Even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Cusask, could not say how ridiculous the plot was. I enjoyed hearing "Macho Man" from Village People during the closing credits. The rest of the movie could have been tolerable if it were raised to that level of energy.
