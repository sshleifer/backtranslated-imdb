Recently I started to see this program in syndication and I find it a bit unpredictable. Some episodes are stupid: Doug is upset about something trivial / youthful and acts like a fool, etc. <br /> <br /> However, others are quite funny and, at times, touching. These include those episodes that face the complexities of the characters. For example, the theme "the friendly young overweight boy marries the sexy wife" is found in several situation comedies. (Carrie also has something of her, from the visual point of view, not just a sexy girl.) But, Carrie has an advantage: she can be pleasing to the eye, but she has too many personality traits not too far from her father . <br /> <br /> And, she admits it easily, for example, an episode revolves around her lack of desire to be nice to co-workers. Personally I find her sexy, but you have to be the right person to be able to live with that. Friendly Doug is a good match. And, deep down, look at the simple things too. Maybe, not as much as Doug, whose nirvana is watching television and eating a big snack next to his big TV screen, but she has no culture. This lack of a sensitive side is one of the reasons why the two do not have children. <br /> <br /> Of course, the simple pleasures of a boy are nothing to make fun of, and they add to the charm of the show. They live a working class life in Queens: it is realistic in that sense. And, in general, the funny and enjoyable sitcom, esp. if you just want to relax. It gets a little tired at the end, so it's probably good that it's ending. He had a good career. See also, Becker.
