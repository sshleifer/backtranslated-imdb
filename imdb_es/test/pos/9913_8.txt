Kirk and the crew are visiting a federation mining colony on a remote planet rich in mineral resources. The Devil in the Dark is the Horta, a very unusual life form based on silicon that makes its way through solid rock. The Horta has been killing miners and, it is decided, must be destroyed. But how? <br /> <br /> It is difficult to continue this review without writing a spoiler, so I simply concentrate on the technical aspects of the episode and play its themes. The special effects are fine, but many of the scenes with the Horta seem a bit absurd. The performance is quite average for TOS. Some of the miners are a little uncomfortable. Nimoy has the most difficult role of all in Devil in the Dark, and he does it well. <br /> <br /> Why is it still my favorite? <br /> <br /> Devil in the Dark is really a work of ecological and anthropological morality disguised as adventure. More than many episodes of this great television series, brings home the importance of keeping an open mind and at least a certain degree of empathy towards others. In addition, it implies one of the most interesting plot twists, if not probable, in the original series. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
