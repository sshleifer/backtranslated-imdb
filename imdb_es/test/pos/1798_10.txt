Happy 25th birthday to Valley Girl! Great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances ... capture the spirit of the 80s; The slang of the mainstreams and the marginalized. A wonderful interpretation of the life of the high school and the "sandy center" from a suburban perspective. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack contains modern English songs, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola $, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Skins, Men at Work, The Flirts and Bananarama. <br /> <br /> This film is truly Romeo and Juliet (minus the double suicide) set in Los Angeles in 1980. Julie's father, played by Frederic Forrest (Sonny Bono, someone?) is hysterical like a dad idealistic hippie who wonders how such a materialistic offspring arose. However, he does not judge, do you understand?
