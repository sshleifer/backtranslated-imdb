The first time I saw Heimat 2 on BBC2 in the 90s was at the art college, living and moving between artists and musicians, hoping for future success. So 'The Second Home' - of friendships made after leaving home, of striving for professional excellence - resonated strongly in my living reality. I was captivated by the characters, the narration, the lyrical work of the camera and, above all, the music. In it I could guess the beginnings of German electronic music, the 50s Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Can, Neue, Fausto of the 70s, the sound experiments of John Cage, Walter Carlos and British electronic psychedelia The White Noise. The composer of the soundtrack Nikos Mamangakis studied with Carl Orff of Carmina Burana-fame, so I found his tastes contemporary to the world of electronic music / sound effects. <br /> <br /> I had not seen Heimat or Heimat 3, so I saw it as Everything in itself without a before or after. As someone else has commented, it is both epic and lyrical, historical and artistic. Many favorite moments, such as the wonderful voice of Gisela Muller (Evelyn), Bach's marimba by Daniel Smith (John), Henry Arnold's piano (Hermann) and Salome Kammer's cello (Clarissa). <br /> <br /> I could write more but it has already been said here. Why British or American television can not produce such masterpieces? The Wire had the realism, the politics and the epic sweeping of a city, David Lynch and Dennis Potter also had their imagination in series for their serialized television work, but this is art and soap at its best film and narrative expression. It is never included in the choices of Best Films critics, but it should be. Still as poetic and powerful as when I saw it for the first time more than 17 years ago. I watch the 3 boxed games each fall for their "soft fruiting". Inspired and inspiring
