With a film starring the Twins, Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen, no one should expect a film masterpiece. However, what you get is a fun movie that is easy for the eye and the brain. There are lots of vampires Hollywood style (without sucking Chinese bloodsuckers here), cute girls, handsome heroes and the occasional very funny moment. And Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Of course, kung fu depends a lot on working with cables and CGI. Sure, the script reminds you of Blade. And sure, the whole thing is instantly forgettable. <br /> <br /> But for a really pleasurable piece of cinematic fluff, it would be hard to find a better one.
