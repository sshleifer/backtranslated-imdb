MANNA FROM HEAVEN is an excellent film that is predictable and unpredictable at the same time. You know that the characters after discovering that the so-called "Gift of God" was actually a loan, they will return the money and that everyone will be happy at the end, but how to get to them is not so obvious. The scenes are usually funny and occasionally moving when the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going. The cast of veteran actors is more than a simple nostalgia trip. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones and Cloris Leachman show that they are capable of more than playing Riddler, Mother Partridge or Phyllis, Mary's friend, while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play different characters than we have seen in their television series. Ursula Burton's depiction of the nun is touching and fun at the same time without making fun of the nuns or the church. If you're looking for a movie with an excellent cast, great music (including a Shirley Jones version of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an edifying finale, try it out. I do not think you're disappointed.
