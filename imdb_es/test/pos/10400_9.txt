Like many of the terror fans who were looking for the next big horror movie, we plundered the Asian horror market for anything we could get our hands on, without leaving any ghost lady with dark hair unturned. We had good reasons to do it, the Asian market had generated wonders as terrible as Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon, spite and a tale of two sisters. By the time Takashi Miike started wicking the genre with One Missed Call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving it open for teasing and teasing, even though the continuing Hollywood Remake Machine was still working flat out. Now, do not get me wrong, there were still many good Asian horrors, like Marebito and Shutter, to mention, but two, one day will be the classics of the genre. But the straight haired ghost lady had definitely fed her at the party, and it was time to take that drunken drifter to bed! Then comes a movie like Noroi - The Curse. A film that is smart enough to pay a subtle tribute to its roots, however, throws the rules book out the window as it does so. What I am going to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think that there is nothing new here. The film is a documentary about one of Japan's leading paranormal investigators when it receives stories and warnings about ghostly events. He begins to investigate a woman's claims that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, but there is not a baby there, other than a middle-aged woman and her son. These two disappear abruptly when the reporter pokes his nose, but strange coincidences begin to appear. A psychic girl, a mentally ill seer, a young and pretty actress who had a strange vision, many dead pigeons and a very sinister demon called Kagutaba, which led to a truly terrifying confrontation in a small historical city. <br /> <br /> Saying something more about the plot could ruin the fun a bit. The film was filmed in the form of a "fake documentary" and incorporates images from television programs and news reports, and the labels through subtitles let you know where you are in terms of the timeline. The film has attracted more than some comparisons with the Blair Witch Project, but apart from the filming format and the creepy journey in the wee hours of the morning, the comparison really ends there. <br /> <br /> What is refreshing Noroi is the way that modern terror audiences do not please. If you are waiting for the croak ghost women to come out of the attic, look elsewhere. The strength of the film lies in its slow and gradual accumulation of terror, a terror so deep that it will remain with you for days after seeing it. The climax is damn weird, but just when you think the movie is over, you are treated to the "real" ending when the credits begin to roll, and sweetheart, it's a killer. In terms of performance, it is especially convincing. You get a little 'comedy' of insanity, clairvoyantly covered in foil, but that soon dries up in the middle of the movie. The movie also has a slightly more "unpleasant" feeling than many Asian horror ghosts, since there is also a violent streak in some of the events. <br /> <br /> In general, Noroi is one that you can see on your own. late at night. Not since I first saw Ringu ten years ago, I've been so delighted watching a horror movie. It is one that will sting you until it is too late, then it will be under your skin. Just let yourself be carried away completely. And not a ghost lady with straight hair in sight? No wonder it's just been released outside of Japan, let alone that there's an American remake still in line. Take a look at this if you can, essential visualization in my books!
