I have read innumerable reviews that talk about the superiority of the miniseries. I certainly can not agree on such a broad statement. If you analyze all aspects of a video / film production, there are many areas where the film is vastly superior. <br /> <br /> Certainly, many of the comments are valid with respect to particular areas of the mini-series. Specifically with regard to more threads (customs officers) and more developed threads (such as the Pakistani farmer and family). That said, the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones seemed much more convincing than desperate women, from poverty to riches that "will not return." That is a much more pleasant character than these cold women who did not seem to have as much reason for their quick turn towards evil. (And yes, I understand ... her children, I was desperate, I just did not see her so desperate). <br /> <br /> Also, although I appreciated some of the most complete story threads. In the miniseries, Benicio del Toro's character was very convincing. An anchor for the movie. That thread was changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) in a way that was not good. A fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I'm skeptical that someone so pure can exist within that system, but I do not know enough about the nation's politics to argue). <br /> <br /> After watching the first episode of The Miniseries, I actually watched the movie again. Why? I kept reading about the fantastic performance. I found that the performances in the first episode of the miniseries were almost ridiculous. Certainly, this improved as the miniseries progressed. Now that I have just finished the two versions in a few days, I can not agree that the performances in the miniseries reached the same level as, for example, Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, although Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan were very good. I also feel that the police in the film far exceeded the miniseries. I was not impressed by the Germans throughout. <br /> <br /> Finally, the dialogue, as it appears in the film, is much more nuanced. Especially in scenes that are almost textual. "Be careful, you're starting to sound like your husband." unlike "HAHAHAHA! You look like Karl." Once again, I found that some of the performances in the miniseries are unconvincing. This was an excellent example. <br /> <br /> Other superior aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, edition. <br /> <br /> Should I complain that the movie was not anymore? No. I think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format. The changes made were on their own. I mean, would you sit in a theater for 5 / 7/10 hours? Of course not. <br /> <br /> Miniseries: 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> Movie: 9 of 10
