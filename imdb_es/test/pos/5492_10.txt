One of the best movies I've seen ... Good script, original plot by a man who is obsessed with the murder of JFK when he was assigned to protect him on that cold November day in 1963. Thirty years later, another crazy antisocial wants to kill to the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner on the road, the crazed gunmen who dodge, lie and kill anyone who gets in his way and gets in his way. <br /> <br /> The film is accompanied by a great memorable score and a moderate but significant romance between Russo and Eastwood ... which shows how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. Malchovich is great, surely many other candidates could have played the role he played, but how many could act with such cunning and intellect that showed in the film? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I thought this was a great movie ... every time I'm on TV I have to watch it ... and I have it on the DVD! I'm a big fan of Eastwood, this just fueled his already fabulous career, and Malchovich's best role to date! <br /> <br />
