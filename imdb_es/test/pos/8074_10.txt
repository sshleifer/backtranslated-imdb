I have seen this film twice at the Transylvania International Film Festival (TIFF), the film is in competition and I really hope that Esteban Sapir receives one of the prizes (at least the prize for the best image). <br /> <br /> As a silent film fan, I am interested in contemporary films that cite or recreate the language of the cinema of yesteryear. The previous critic emphasized the quotes of Fritz Lang and Father W. Murnau. As I see it, the film makes direct reference to the Metropolis of Lang and the allegorical-parabolic character of its plots. But I did not see Murnau in her. However, there is a more obvious tribute to Melies: the Moon with a human face (here smoking cigars), and the mountains and cityscapes painted on paper. I enjoyed the film mainly because of its images, and in the meantime, I found the story about silence and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the city without a voice very interesting. From this perspective, this film is a unique reflection on the silence of silent films, because in the films of the silent period it is difficult to find stories with silent characters. In this case, it can be questioned whether the story of the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form, or whether there is an intention to play with the mutuality of the silent films. Another example of this type of reflection that I found in Guy Maddin's Careful, where the inhabitants of a mountain village have restrictions to use their voices. I intend to write an article on this topic, if you know movies related to this topic, let me know! <br /> <br /> I recommend Esteban Sapir's film to all the spectators (one of the critics called it: the jewel of the festival). <br /> <br /> PS: The winners were announced and the movie won. The prize for the best cinematography!
