Buena Vista Pictures of Disney presents a marvelously narrated sports drama directed by actor Bill Paxton. The photography is magnificent, but sometimes the story goes on. This film is about 20-year-old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and his competition at the US Open in 1913. What a story; a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a young man supposedly unable to play alongside the best golfers of the time, including British champions Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus). A book of stories that ends leaves a lump in the throat. The cast also includes: Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox, and possibly stealing the show is Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, Ouimet's caddy and best friend.
