Andreas arrives at a strange and inhuman place, where everything seems perfect. He has done a good job, everyone is kind to him and everyone, and he really does not bother too much to find a beautiful girlfriend. But in this city without a name, Andreas discovers that a perfect commercial world is not really a paradise. Really one of the best movies I've seen this year. The attractive plot is perfectly supported by an intelligent direction in which each component (fresh desaturated photography, cold symmetrical design, non-emotional action, slow and highly controlled camera movements) helps to create a unique and strange atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until the final. A sarcastic, ironic and bitter comedy that made me laugh and think, as only the best movies can do. Nothing new, probably, in the analysis of the modern dehumanizing civilization, but really an intelligent work with great surprising ideas that will hardly forget who was lucky enough to see it. Simply beautiful the amazing scene in the subway metro.
