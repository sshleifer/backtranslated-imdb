I just watched this movie for the second time. I saw it for the first time in the mid-90s as a Vanguard video selection. He has retained his power. <br /> <br /> It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a real story. Two is that it is a launch pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, he has Dennis Hopper in one of his best roles of social maladjustment / psychotic character. <br /> <br /> The movie is also a study about the way people act in different environments. You have characters in one to one, family, peer group, school, environments of society in general, etc. History shows well how a person will act in each environment. <br /> <br /> I wish I could do it Find the details of the real murder to compare with the movie. I saw a small fragment that indicated that it happened in California and that several schoolmates were taken to see the body. <br /> <br /> This is a good option for video rentals on a rainy night. Be prepared to feel restless in the end.
