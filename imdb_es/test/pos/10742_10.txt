"Kramer vs. Kramer" is a terrible drama about an unhappy woman who abandons her husband and her young son. The husband now has to assume the responsibilities of caring for the child. While doing so, they know each other better. But then, the mother and wife return, and she wants custody of the child. "Kramer vs. Kramer" has a lot of drama with some wonderful pieces of comedy released to a large extent. Dustin Hoffman won his first Oscar for best actor for his brilliant performance here. Most people say that his performance in "Rainman", which earned him his second Oscar, is the best. It was great in that movie, but I do not agree that it's the best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. It is also fun sometimes. Meryl Streep, who was not as well known when she made this movie as she is today, was also an excellent performer. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in "Kramer vs. Kramer" as the wife and mother she tries to meet after leaving her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the movie came out, is wonderful as the son of Hoffman and Streep. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and even today he is the youngest artist to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a worried family friend. She also earned an Oscar nomination (for Best Supporting Actress, where she lost with her co-star Streep). "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great movie from start to finish. The writer and director Robert Benton has made a film that is absolutely unforgettable. <br /> <br /> **** (of four)
