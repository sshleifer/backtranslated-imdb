I think Vanessa Marcil is the best actress in the cast. She makes Sam one of the best characters in the show. James Cann is also pretty good. I love when you care about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes when Ed and Delinda are hitting someone. That was fun. Nikki Cox is also good and has a great chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was amazing in her guest role. I wish they had not killed her. The program has a great cast without bad actors that is not something that is often seen on television. Although I still think that Vanessa Marcil is the best. I should have got an Emmy in my opinion. It's a pity that the show has been canceled.
