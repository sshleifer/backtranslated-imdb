I saw this movie five times and I never tire of it. This presents traces of the genre "giallo", but also with a vivid Italian country atmosphere, where ignorance and superstition are more lethal than any serial killer. With an excellent location (sometimes reminiscent of Fellini, sometimes of the Taviani brothers), a good characterization and some of the best genre actors (including the great Tomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), this is NOT a European garbage, only a masterpiece that should be discovered generation after generation (recently received a great recognition at the Cinematheque in Paris in a double tribute to Lucio Fulci)
