Once again, I am surprised that Thomas Gibson has not reached the head of the group before in his career. In this film, Gibson demonstrates once again his ability to capture a character regardless of his sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay man of the late twentieth century. Tender but not effeminate, fearful of the basic principles of love, the character of Gibson plays a variety of emotions. Also worthy of praise is the performance of Cameron Bancroft. His need to be the heterosexual conqueror instead of the "homosexual conquests" of his best friend, provides dynamics for the relationship that are unexpected in many aspects. The chemistry of Bancroft and Gibson is evident from the first scene in which they appear together. There are many "panels" in this quilt. From homosexual relationships to direct relationships; from heterosexual relationships to the exploration of lesbian love; this film covers the broad spectrum of sexuality while at the core it has the story of a serial killer. The only thing I regret is that it's been 6 years since its release before I discovered this movie! I hope to see you again and I highly recommend it to any fan of Bancroft, Gibson or Director Denys Arcand.
