Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. were perfectly cast in this film. It is a moving story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we care. I think there was a lot of realism with the characters. The screenwriter did not incorporate racism into the film in the way that most films do, which I think created a more realistic plot. <br /> <br /> Writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism, but usually go overboard <br /> <br /> There are as many cities as this where people of different races live in harmony. Ed Harris should have been nominated for an Academy Award because he was a great leader and coach, realistic as a father and showed an affectionate side when he helped Radio.
