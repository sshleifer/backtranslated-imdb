William M. Thackeray once said: "A good laugh is the sun in the house." When I saw Take Away, I must say that the sun was shining in my house. This film was excellent, the opening was very smart, the story was kept tight, in a nutshell, two owners of a chip shop that normally enemies are forced to form an alliance to participate in a David and Goliath fight against A fast. Food chain that builds a restaurant on your street. The ending was hilarious, although I have found many who do not agree with me on that. <br /> <br /> The film was, although very discreet, portraying contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes, in particular the collision or cultural clash between the two. the traditional Anglo-Australian and Australian-Australian stereotypes, and how they found a kind of "unity in spite of adversity", very nice. <br /> <br /> I found the performance of Vince Colosimo as "Tony Stilano" an Italian-Australian fish The owner of a chip shop in his thirties to be first class, his performance was very genuine and convincing, Through his performance he really brought out the essence, or should I say the soul of the Australian Italian stereotype, which is actually Not too Italian, but not very Australian either, Colosimo found that balance, breathed into his lungs and gave him life. <br /> <br /> The Cinematography could have been better, more shots of the area would have been nice, For what I can see was in Melbourn e, but where in Melbourne? For me, it seems like a place between Ivanhoe and Bullen, although I'm not 100% sure about that. <br /> <br /> I do not know why so many people are comparing this movie with "The Castle", although they have similar themes through them, Take Away is in a league of their own. <br /> <br /> I think the film was excellent, with a capital "E", it has everything, it's fun, the jokes are great, it deals with the contemporary problems facing Australian society, the story holds Well, I loved it! I highly recommend it.
