It is just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the fourth of the series that is, in my opinion, the best in the series. Jennifer Tilly was great in this movie. For the dolls, they were better than some actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr., for example) and more fun than many comedies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The argument was not great, but I really did not care. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany fight and fight. And the end leaves it open for a fifth sequel (which I hear is in the works). Idle Hands will be released next week and it seems to be another horror comedy, but I doubt it will surpass this one.
