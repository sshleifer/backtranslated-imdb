In complete contrast to the previous correspondent here, I thought that Shoppen Munich (as it was presented when it was shown with English subtitles here in London at the German Film Festival in November 2007) was very funny, very well acted and excellently written. <Br /> <br /> It is quite bold to design a 100-minute film that consists exclusively and relentlessly in talking heads. But I think Ralf Westhoff succeeded with ingenuity and ethics. There are no standard filmic devices of, say, following the pronouncement of a character who reveals his soul with some meditative music of minor seventh chord and long shot nature cuts. But when someone said something that revealed their souls, well, the man with the timer rushed us for another superficial introduction. What is, of course, the point: the superficiality of the control box of thirty-something urbanites, where everything is reduced to a quick question and answer. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of the films are so clich√© and stupid that the English are prepared to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and unconscious cinema, but I can promise you that in the screening of this night (Curzon Cinema, Sun November 25, 2007), the entire audience let out a laugh along the way. So I was not the only one who laughed! <br /> <br /> My girlfriend (who speaks German and has lived in Munich) thought it was very funny. I (I do not speak German and I have not been to Munich, I think) I thought it was very funny. I recommend Shoppen (Munich) to anyone (especially couples ...) looking for an intelligent, witty, original and wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the bewilderment of the generation that feels that happiness has been lost. - Whatever after the first time. <br /> <br /> NB In the presentation subtitled in English in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were shown completely below the slightly reduced image, not inside it. I thought this was a good thing.
