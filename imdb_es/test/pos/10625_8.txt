In general, this movie seemed good to me: exceptional performance with disturbing scenes (some essential, others useless) and a weak second half. CONTAINS SPOILERS The movie is divided into 2 parts. I thought that the first half of the pianist was great. We meet Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and we introduce ourselves to her world. She is single, struggling to find her space against an overprotective tyrannical mother and on the edge. We understand that she has lost or has rarely experienced love as a physical + emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being acute and offensive to people, she releases her sexual tensions in sex shops, as a voyeur or in sadistic self-mutilations . This first half is very clinical and creates an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> Next comes Walter, a handsome, extroverted young man (played magnificently by Benoit Magimel). Although at first she feels the coldness of Erika, seduces her and slowly destroys Erika's strength. He loves her deeply, but she needs him to fulfill his sadistic desires. Then, when she is about to fall in love with him, he feels disgusted by his world and, in the end, we discover that Erika can not love or feel at all (especially because Walter is presented as someone impossible to love). This is the second half of the film, very touching, since we see that Erika's inability / inexperience to love her leads her to self-destruction. This second half seemed less dominated by Haneke, and sometimes had non-credible (that is, too shocking) scenes that paradoxically diminished the drama. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a raw movie at least in the French version. : You see porn sex shop sequences, daring mutilations and sex scenes. The scene of fellatio between Magimel and Huppert, which was talked about so much, was quite good, I thought, and it is fundamental to understand Erika's unhealthy relationship with love. As for the actors, Huppert is wonderful throughout the film, Magimel improves and improves to perfection, and Girardot (the mother) is excellent. <br /> <br />
