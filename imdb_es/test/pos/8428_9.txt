I only have the opportunity to delve into Austen's previous films, and I learned this because Persuasion is, has always been and will always be my favorite work by Jane Austen, and Anne Elliot, my favorite hero of Austen. So it was with great anticipation that I put the disk in my player. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed either. I knew there had to be some inconveniences, so I'll expose them, and try not to be too fat with them. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen's characters; She is the least talkative and the least witty. There are passages in the book where Anne does not say anything, only her feelings are described. This works well in printing, but how do you successfully transfer it to the big screen? Apart from making well-thought voices (which would be tedious for four hours), you are left with a long succession of shots in which the heroine says little or nothing, and must communicate everything through her facial expression. This may leave the feeling that the movie is slow and lacks purpose. If you need a more open Austen style, then this movie is not for you; but if the style is more tenuous, and you tend to capture the unspoken "vibes", this will fulfill all expectations. <br /> <br /> Anne Firbank (as Anne Elliot), is, fortunately, an actress whose face can convey a lot. It seemed as she had always imagined Anne Elliot would look, not like a knockout: Anne was not supposed to be the elegant family, even in his early youth, which is also occasionally highlighted by lighting and makeup. What you see is someone who looks a lot like Austen's character: someone whose appearance you can overlook once; but listen to her talk, and look more closely, and she becomes more attractive as you meet her. This is Anne Elliot, as she was brought to life by Anne Firbank. <br /> <br /> The representation of Captain Wentworth is skillfully handled by Bryan Marshall. The bitterness is never apparently obvious (except in the concert scene); and, yes, I found it hard to believe that it was interesting to Louisa Musgrove as she showed it to him. But that's another point in Austen's book: I did not find it interesting, I TRIÃ“ found it interesting and, ultimately, it failed (sigh of relief). So, this also fits Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the portrait of Lady Russell, who I thought was not described as REAL in the book; This also appears in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> So this is a movie that followed the book closely; I could write much more about the fidelity with which everything was reproduced, but here I ran out of space. Charles Musgrove remained one of the most optimistic characters (good fun), Mary the most annoying (I was dying to silence her, but I had that feeling when I read the book too), captains and the admiral seemed charming to me. <br /> <br /> The cinematography seemed a little stiff. There was little or virtually no disappearance from one screen to another, maybe it is because it is a television movie. A scene - CHOP! - In the next scene, the actors enter on the right, proceed on the left and - CHOP! - Another scene, where the same thing happens. This was the only part of the movie that I felt that cheated me a little. A low budget has to be shown somewhere, I suppose. <br /> <br /> And, as I said before, if you like to go with Jane Austen, do not worry about this, because you find it too slow. However, I enjoyed it immensely, as it provided a lot of details (the sets were very elegant!) To an excellent adaptation of my favorite Austen novel. I highly recommend it!
