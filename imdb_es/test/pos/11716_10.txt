Meester Sharky, you look so ... normal. You would never get a table in this elegant cocktail restaurant / bistro. I, on the other hand, 'and like grapes and pate' every day. Do you like my fur coat with all the fine cut? My huge golden gold rings? Or maybe you like these blondes, 'how do you say?', Bombazos, all qualified in aerobics and naked petanque, which decorate my long and velvety brown sofa like so many larks boiled in a plate of fried bread with foie gras and figs. You like? You can not have! Zey are all mine. <br /> <br /> You will never own them as I possessed them. Domino was the best, apart from Maman. You do not understand the art of making love. Just look at your lower mustache. It's almost fun for me, no, to think of that ridiculous bulge in your stupid face, as you settle on the banks of Domino's love like the little pig looking for the truffle in the forest, the forest shaking and rocking in the warm winds of desire! You lose Sharky again. <br /> <br /> When I make love with women who know, Sharky, you know. Learn, learn until you become the teacher. Not nano-mathematics, the arts of love. The domino was the seedling that I watered. I played it very often. Everywhere Sharky. Its scented petals, its proud stem, everywhere. It will wither under your ridiculous hose, like the souffle you took out of the oven five minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> I must go now, Sharky, you bore me like that with your shameful behavior. It is you who will rinse in the pissoir like the stinking thing. <br /> <br /> Nice opportunity!
