The director of 'Oldboy', Park Chun-wook, returns with what must be one of the most disgusting and at the same time most serious vampire movies in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Relying on the latest Hollywood fashion, vampires are supposed to be rather nonviolent, asexual, gentlemen of love instead of the evil ones, the sexual beast that manipulates the mind, the man -beasts of yesteryear. This is the movie you want to see if you want to remember the sticky emotions of the past ... well, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> 'Thirst' begins with a long exposure of characters that culminates in a slightly different love story. The transformation of vampires of a priest is, for a long time, left aside by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story, which makes it an uncomfortable vision. But the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly bloody. Well, maybe it's not so surprising if you know 'Oldboy' and 'I'm a Cyborg but it's okay', but I think it's fair to say that 'Thirst' surpasses Park's previous films in terms of direct violence. <br /> <br /> In general, keep in mind that this is neither an art cinema nor a horror movie. It can be too unpleasant for many and too docile for some. 'Thirst' is original, entertaining and, fortunately, a little less strange than Park Chun-wook's previous efforts.
