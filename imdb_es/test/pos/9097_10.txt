Just go see this movie. Take advantage of all the incredible rock and roll, the band comes up with some great songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder, etc.). All this with Teancous D Humor makes this the best movie in history. <br /> <br /> The Cameos are very good in the back, with Meat Loaf and Dio singing to JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I really like the character of Tim Robbins. You also discover who Satan really is! The musical and musical references are fun and amazing. Playing songs great songs of The Who, Dio and others, simply completing them. Personally I did not think that the band could surpass the incredible songs of the D, but they did it with songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Seriously, incredible music. <br /> <br /> Just go see it, it's a must for anyone who loves rock!
