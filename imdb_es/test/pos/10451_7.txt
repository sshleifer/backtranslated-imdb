Yes, it's an aspiring Fast Times, but it's still a decent entertainment. <br /> <br /> Some of the comedy parts are really fun. The scene in which the three boys visit the Spanish lady is hilarious, with a bit of flamenco music in the background. The reaction when your husband mariner comes home is a riot. The exploits of the boys when dealing with the crabs are also fun when they try to "drown them" and when they visit the pharmacist. <br /> <br /> The abortion scene is also a Fast Times scam, but it does a good job of capturing the terror of the situation. You really feel for what Karen is going through, and for Gary in his crazy fight for the money to pay for the abortion and accommodate for his recovery. <br /> <br /> The ending is painful to watch, but refreshingly realistic. Those who see for the first time will not be ready for this and it will be a shock. <br /> <br /> There is a visual appeal for boys with young girls and the Spanish milf, but heterosexuals will probably want to skip the penis measurement competition. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack underestimated too. Check out Early, Early U2 (!), The Cars at its best and an appropriate James Ingram song for the surprise ending. <br /> <br /> Some people will hate it and it's kind of outdated, but those who Like teen movies or who grew up in the early '80s, should like it.
