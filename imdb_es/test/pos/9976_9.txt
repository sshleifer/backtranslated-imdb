When you think of golf movies, you think of Caddyshack, but what if there are children around? Go directly to this movie! Disney uses its proven formula to make a movie that adults and children will enjoy. The acting in this film, in my opinion, is quite good and the main cast, for the most part, is very young! This film is also surprisingly well filmed and is unique, seeing all the angles of the game of golf. I think this movie should be ready for some awards from the academy for film editing or something like that because the whole flow of the film is first class. Although the ending may be a bit predictable, the film works well on its own! It also shows that you do not need to swear, nudity or violence to make a great golf movie!
