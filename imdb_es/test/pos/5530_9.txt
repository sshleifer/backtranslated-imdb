That was one of the lines in a trailer about this movie and, for once, the publicists did not exaggerate. The six players that appear here are on the screen 99% of the time, so they have to be good. <br /> <br /> It is always fascinating how certain premises of the plot can be worked out for a highballing comedy or for a serious mortal. situation. Mary Boland, of the ditzy, and Charlie Ruggles, of the henpecked, play their usual characters who plan to reach California. To share expenses, announce that someone shares the trip. They get Burns and Allen and a dog monster. That same premise was very serious several generations later in Kalifornia. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you travel with Gracie Allen, you know you're going to be completely crazy trying to understand his reasoning about Monty Pythonesque. about the whole world And if that is not enough, you can find W.C. Fields, part-time sheriff and full-time swindler who lives in sin with Alison Skipworth. But back then we did not immerse ourselves in such things. <br /> <br /> A real classic comedy of the thirties, which should not be missed.
