The first time I saw this movie was in elementary school, back in the sixties. I was fascinated by the character played by Ingrid Bergman and it was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the film is the best, since it returns to take revenge of the wife and the daughter of its father (his mother had been expelled in misfortune). During this time she meets the wonderful Clint Maroon, played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between the two is great. The second half of the film takes place in Saratoga, New York (the title's Saratoga) and I never enjoy it as much as in New Orleans, but it's still very good. I give this movie a ten, partly for nostalgia, but mostly because it's a good movie and the characters, in addition to those of Bergman and Cooper, are equally wonderful (Flora Robson comes close to stealing the scenes from Bergman). It used to be shown on television periodically, but rarely or never, it would be a good choice for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put into their programming cycles.
