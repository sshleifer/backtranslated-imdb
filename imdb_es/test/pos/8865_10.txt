I am ashamed to say it, but I must admit that the first time I saw this movie was only a year ago. After seeing it, I rushed to buy the DVD collector's edition and I've seen it many times since then. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent on many levels. It works like your monster movie or action, as a horror / science fiction and also as a very intriguing look at the human psyche. The incredible sensation of paranoia, distrust and fear, borrowed not only by the direction of Carpenter (which is impressive) but also by the incredible performance of the cast in general. Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly underestimated in the main role of MacReady, and, as a direct result, "feels" like a real person, rather than an "all American hero" of Hollywood. The other cast members carry out their roles with style, and the net result is a highly credible environment and a really fantastic movie.
