"Do not Change Your Husband" is another telenovela comedy by producer / director Cecil B. De Mille. It is notable as the first of several films that starred Gloria Swanson. I suppose you could also call it a sequel to his "Old Wives For New" (1918). <br /> <br /> James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter are a couple in their forties where James has gone to seed and has become scruffy and lazy. He has a penchant for smelly cigars and eating raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. Leila tries to make him stretch without success. <br /> <br /> One night at a dinner in the Porters, Leila meets Schyler Van Sutphen (now there is a nickname), the playboy nephew of the socialite Ms.. Huckney (Sylvia Ashton). She invites Leila to her house during the weekend for James to "miss" her. Once there, Schyler begins to put the movements in her, promising pleasure, wealth and love, if she leaves her husband and goes with him. The sequences that imply that Leila imagines this new promised life are lavishly organized and predict de Mille's epic costume dramas later in his career. <br /> <br /> Leila, bored with her marriage and her disinterested husband, divorces James and marries the playboy. James finally realizes that he has lost the only thing that mattered to him and begins to make amends. He shaves his mustache, exercises, rejects onions and regain some manners. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, not everything agrees with Leila's new marriage. Schyler seems to like to bet and has dealt with the gold digger Nanette (also known as Tootsie, or some similar name) (Julia Faye). Schyler loses all his money and steals Leila's diamond ring to cover his losses. <br /> <br /> One fateful day, Leila meets the "new" James and is trapped by the changes in him. James drives home and realizes his situation and ...................................... .......... <br /> <br /> This movie marked the beginning of Gloria Swanson's rise to stardom in a race that would rival that of Mary Pickford. Barely 20 years old, he had started his career in Mack Sennett, two-drum comedies as a teenager. Elliot Dexter was almost 50 years old at the moment, but he and Swanson make a good team, although it is hard to imagine someone getting tired of the lovely Miss Swanson, as is the case in this movie. <br /> <br /> Dexter and Sylvia Ashton had appeared in the similar "Old Wives For New", where the wife had gone to the seed and the husband had been harmed. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast are DeMille regulars, Theodore Roberts as bishop and Raymond Hatton, as a player. .
