Anyone who has spent time working in a hospital or medical center should appreciate this movie. The plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from beginning to end. The acting is excellent. George C. Scott is the brilliant doctor but class A failure as husband, father. Diana Riggs, a sex symbol of the 60s and 70s (of The Avengers), saves him from himself. The cast that surrounds it is excellent and the dialogue quite entertaining. I think I enjoyed the movie more when I saw it on the 4th, 5th. or 6th. Time because I captured much more of the richness of the dialogue and the interaction of the characters. Well worth seeing again and again. You just do not want to register at a hospital in the near future.
