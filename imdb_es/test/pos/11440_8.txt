My wife and I endorse all the positive comments below, made by other IMDB members. While this is not a blockbuster, it has a special charm. Genuine and comforting. <br /> <br /> We saw this on video, at the end of a long day. We were very tired, and in bed. Normally, in a situation like this, my wife falls asleep in minutes, that is, unless it is an exceptional movie and this keeps us entertained until the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe the youngest spectators in your 20-year-olds would not like this, but for the rest of us it's a real gem! Look at it!
