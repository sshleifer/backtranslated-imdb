I had never seen a John Cassavetes movie until two years ago, when I first saw THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema, which I found interesting, to say it diplomatically, but not so special, I instantly wanted to see . More of your work. Since then, I tried, with an emphasis on trying, to see his other work, SHADOWS in particular. I must admit that it took me a while before I really enjoyed the movie. At first, the way in which Cassavetes had not been polished, improvised, shot up, discouraged me a little and I thought it was an original experiment, absolutely, but defective and outdated. But now, when reviewing, these little imperfections make it look so cool, even today. <br /> <br /> With a minimum budget of $ 40,000 with a team of six people, SHADOWS offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three brothers in an African-American family in which two of the three brothers, Ben (Ben) Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), are light-skinned and can go white. Cassavetes demanded that the actors keep their real names to reflect the real conflicts within the group, but they considered that the film had to do with human and racial problems. Cassavetes filmed the film in ten-minute shots and an irregular edition, a reaction against the "perfect" production values ​​of Hollywood. The main inspiration of Cassavetes, at least in the cinematographic style in which the film was filmed, were the Italian neo-realists, while also professing admiration for the pioneering spirit of Welles. The use of amateurs and improvisation may resemble some of the Italian neo-realistic directors, but with their bebop score of Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi, the film feels very different, very American, unlike what was done before. <br /> <br /> The song with the feathered girls, "I feel like a lolly-pop" (or something like that) feels like light years to me, ancient history. But no matter how old-fashioned it may be, it's still a lovely time capsule from the late fifties in New York today. I think this is one of the first films in which aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film, without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who acted and was involved in SHADOWS, states that it was THE NAKED CITY (1948) by Jules Dassin who was the first and inspired them all, but I think this was the one that really opened the eyes to aspiring American filmmakers independent <br /> <br /> Dark Chamber --- 8/10
