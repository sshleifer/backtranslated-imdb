For a long time I wanted to see this romantic drama (with a scenario of World War II) and, now that I have done it, all I can say is that it is a true masterpiece of Russian cinema! <br /> <br /> Soviet films are known for their propagandistic and jealous approach, but, fortunately, this is not so much emphasized, with the strong interest in the tragic central romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl, condemned by the outbreak of war for which he voluntarily offers himself as a volunteer but from which he will never return. The boy's cousin also loves the girl (a remarkable performance by Tatyana Samojlova) and, when he does not hear from his boyfriend, he gives himself to the latter and marries him. However, he is an aspiring concert pianist who feels bitter about the fact that the war has reduced his chances of success and, knowing also that the girl is still dedicated to the soldier, begins to neglect her. Finally, the news comes to the death of the girl of her loved one, but at the end of the film, she learned to accept this as a sacrifice for her native country and is happy to live with her memories of him. <br /> <br /> The film presents a truly amazing camera work that makes an extremely judicious use of screen space and, by frequently adopting tracking, high-angle or low-angle shots, provides a great power to the emotional drama that develops. The individual sequences are equally impressive, two in particular: the shocking scene, edited in a frenetic and accelerated way, in which the girl prevents an abandoned child from being trampled by a truck; and the untimely disappearance of the young man in an unfortunate incident on the front, undoubtedly one of the best of its kind I have seen (with the sun moving away from him, symbolizing the life that leaks out of his body, as he imagines the you will never have a wedding day!). However, it is also remarkable the scene in which the girl goes to look for her parents in her house that has been devastated without remedy during an air attack; As is his violent final capitulation with the concert pianist, whom he tries to resist by giving him a slap in the face, during a subsequent aerial attack and making particularly effective use of a set of undulating curtains! <br /> <br /> Disappointingly, the R1 DVD of this extraordinary film is a bare-bones issue (the RusCiCo edition includes some supplements but, being an export, tends to be too expensive and difficult to trace). Criterion released it along with another Russian war classic, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959), which my friend at the DVD rental told me to be published soon ... <br /> <br /> The only other movie I have seen that this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969, though through the much shorter release version in the United States!), An international production full of stars based on real events; Given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING, I regret to miss now his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) several times when I was in Hollywood at the end of last year: apart from receiving a theatrical career of a week, he showed more than once on television accompanied by a feature film "Making Of"!
