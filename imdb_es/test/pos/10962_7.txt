What's there to say about an anti-establishment film that was produced in a moment of colorless emptiness, social indifference and authoritarian satisfaction? Cassevettes' first major independent film was not an instant box office success and has not yet received the critical attention it deserves. I make comparisons with this wave of independent American projects that consist of 'Beat' filmmakers like Robert Frank and Harry Smith with the emerging scene that emerged in Paris in the late 1950s known as the new French wave. <br /> <br /> They discussed poetry, philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering American cultural supremacy; Even at this stage, this peculiar and highly spontaneous cinematographic brand fought against the establishment of such political and intolerant lexicons that controlled the development of the arts in the mid-twentieth century. <br /> <br /> The film Cassevettes examines race relations and portrays man as weak before love because we, as a culture, are blinded by our own race, prejudices and prejudices. The great element of most of Cassevettes' works is that his films have almost an inverse minimalist effect; A mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relationships, not so much images. This is the reason why his work seems to persist because he adopts a more intimate approach to defining characters that depend less on explicit actions and more on interpretation. <br /> <br /> Although my favorite Cassevettes movie is 'Husbands', this is their most important one.
