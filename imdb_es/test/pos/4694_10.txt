By mistake, I ordered a BBC series, his new version of Robin Hood. Very disappointing compared to RoS. Costumes and terrible funds. While I enjoyed the Sheriff, who was inspired by the character of Nick Grace, the rest of the cast left much to be desired. As "for example," Marion's wardrobe looked suspiciously like it came from Walmart. And Sir Guy, well, he looked a bit like a character in a movie from outer space! RoS has stolen the spotlight, probably forever, in the story of this story. The cast, the costumes, the story lines, the stage, the film and the soundtrack of Clannad are excellent, as evidenced by all the continuous information of some 26 years. RoS is a timeless classic. My thanks to all who made the series.
