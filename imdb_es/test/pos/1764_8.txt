Like all earlier films, this "movie" is very, very short: it lasts about a minute! Then, due to its brevity, it is not really possible to compare it with more modern films. But, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable movie. Much of this is because the prints were painted by hand, which makes Annabelle appear in red and other colors as well as her incredible dance. In fact, I've seen two different versions, one where it's red and one where it changes color at all times. I think the red that is shown on the DVD "The great theft of trains and other primary works" is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and looks a lot like an incredible work of art. And, unlike other movies a minute (or less) of the day, this is one that I could see repeatedly, it's just visually compelling and strange. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it online, there is a 36-second version on Google Video (write "serpentine dance").
