2:37 is admirably successful in showing us what Australian teens feel and do not say. These are the stories of real children and I think it would be naive to think otherwise. The only new thing that really brings us 2:37 is an Australian point of view. We often observe American children with problems but often we do not relate the same problems to our own teenagers. Executed with an ingenious and artistic cinematography, nevertheless (when recognizing immediately the disappointing final song) I found the musical direction lacking in sophistication. I applaud the fabulous casting of this movie. These are regular-looking Australian kids who invite a lot of sympathy for this. Great performances throughout the year and you can not beat Gary Sweet. This movie reminded me why sometimes high school stinks and, unless you're apprehensive, or if you like to go with hot and hairy people, go and see 2:37.
