Miyazaki has been making his mojo since the 70s and only recently, his films have reached the coasts of the United States through Disney and the fans who have mocked his great talent. Ponyo is not an exception. Although some of his other films have been a little more accessible to the US public. To some it may seem that this is a kind of "Japanese" in its presentation. For the same reason, Pom Poko is VERY "Japanese" and does not make much sense to the US public. UU., So are * some * elements of Ponyo. This should not stop you from seeing this fun movie of growth, hope and friendship. <br /> <br /> What is well known is the very elaborate and magical animation and history of Miyazaki that has elements of wonder and fantasy. That, along with its characteristic use of character development and, often, uses women and girls as main characters. He left a bit of his area with Ponyo, since the main character is a small boy who lives in a small town by the sea with his mother while his father is traveling on the high seas. Although he is not alone, Sosuke is like any other curious boy who likes the adventure and the charm of the sea. Like Spirited Away, we see the different worlds of human beings and sea creatures and I think that Miyazaki may be trying to attract the attention of viewers to the vast and undiscovered nature of the things that live under the sea and our acceptance of them and things. which are different <br /> <br /> I managed to see the subtitled version of this last year and I liked the story and the plot. Miyazaki has claimed that "this is my last film" for many years, but shortly after Spirited Away, he gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo is certainly the proof that Miyazaki has not hung up his spurs and continues to delight, innovate and promote the most creative animated films of all time. Look at Ponyo with an open mind and the tip of a hat for the fantasy and imagination of childhood, and you will be transported back when catching the fireflies and secret hiding places was more important than bored adults and eating their vegetables.
