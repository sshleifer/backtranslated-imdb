I can not explain it, but I think this movie is not only funny, but I like it so much that I feel compelled to watch it again and again, or at least I did when I had cable TV. I always felt it was a very bad movie, but maybe it's because I saw it on cable. I intend to get a DVD of this movie to really see it honestly, but the most important thing is to have a good time watching it. I liked the plot and the idea of ​​the film and I especially liked the cast. I always wonder if the cast enjoyed doing the movies they are in and this is no exception. This film deserved a better fate than it received and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Mrs. Holly. Who did not The characters in this movie were the kind of people I could identify with when I was in the army and the madness was accurate. Nice go troops
