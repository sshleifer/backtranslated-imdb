As a fan of zombies, I love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by evil monsters. PB is also an excellent link with Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang has to run as fast as possible from the darkness. There are so many metaphors in history! Riddick is a bad guy, but he is also the hero who tries to save slow-moving people. The Muslim man, Imam, relies on the sun's positions for prayers five times a day, but is trapped in a land where darkness will rule. In general, I recommend this movie to any science fiction fan. You will not be disappointed.
