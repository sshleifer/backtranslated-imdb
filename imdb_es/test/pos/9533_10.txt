Edith Nesbitt's best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film, I love it. The film itself has a magnificent picture and an excellent realization of the theme. The end is enough to have you in tears, as it is very well done. Lionel has directed some really excellent films, like Amazing Mr Blunden, but this is his best film as a director for a mile. The costumes were absolutely charming, combined with the beauty of the countryside, and the brilliant and conveniently faithful writing helped things. However, it is the quality of the performance that keeps this film together, since it is nothing shorter than incredible. Dinah Sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother, a much needed feature of the character, and Bernard Cribbins was as funny as Perks. In fact, I preferred Perks in the movie, since it's not so comical in the book. The children were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett gave energetic presentations, but it is the charming portrayal of Bobbie's Jenny Agutter that most impressed me. Another special mention is the beautiful music of Johnny Douglas, the title music reminded me of Charlie Chaplin's smile. In conclusion, a funny and moving masterpiece, which is better than the book, I think. 10/10. Bethany Cox.
