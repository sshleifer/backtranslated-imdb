What a pity that this movie was never released. (Now it's playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my great respect for the stars and they rewarded me by watching a much better movie than I've been paying in theaters recently. I like to be surprised Very often, the films are marketed as "unconventional", but in reality they are more of the same old recycled sound. This movie is really different, with the advantage of a moving message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel. Although the plot forces him to sing some of the most sensationally written songs ever, he does them so well that one does not care. Cathy Bates and Rupert Everett are well-formed and proud, but a newcomer in the role of Cathy Bates's daughter-in-law steals every scene in which she finds herself. Give this movie a chance.
