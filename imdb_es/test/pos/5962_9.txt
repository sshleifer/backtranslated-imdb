One of Starevich's first films made in France is possibly his only political satire. The story of the frogs that wanted a king reflects their title as a group of high-level "sketches" that feel that democracy has deflated, so they demand that a king of Jupiter rule their lands. When he sends a stump, the frogs ask for another king, saying that the stump is nothing more than "political wood." Jupiter sends a hungry stork this time whose lustful frog eyes devour the city's residents. When the original "corvee" is about to slip down the stork's beak, he speaks in his moral: "Leave him alone." This movie presents some scenes of multitude of dozens of puppet frogs. Starewicz tricks the audience into believing that everyone is moving at the same time keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs or something like that at the same time. The slightly cheesy dialogue and problems with lighting in some places diminish the quality of repeated visualizations, however, its historical importance in the life of Starewicz makes it important to observe it. His feelings towards the government immediately after his escape from Russia are likely to be expressed in this film. In addition, the technical achievements of animating so many characters at once in a stop-motion movie are amazing.
