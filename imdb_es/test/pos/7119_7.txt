I am very impressed, really. I expected a cheesy gambler humor and nothing more. <br /> <br /> Okay, there's a lot of pretty geeky humor. But the movie is very well made. The acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue, although the player is corny at times, I think that to cater to the multitude of players, it is not bad at all. Sometimes it's even, dare I say, great. <br /> <br /> When the player, who created this non-traditional wrestler character instead of the usual type (minimum / maximum), receives all these additional attacks (it seems correct, I did not review the rules,) it was great. <br /> <br /> The sets are incredible for what should be a fairly low production film. <br /> <br /> The story progresses along. The transitions from the game world to the real world are well made. A man who plays a female character would sometimes be played by a woman, and sometimes only. Pretty smart, I thought. <br /> <br /> The guy who decided to play a woman, but who kept forgetting that she was a woman, was good for a lot of laughs. He even said a label at one point, and the woman went ahead to play the role (sorry, I did not look for her name, she did very well). The boy was always trying to "get something", it got a bit tedious, but I guess it was more player humor. <br /> <br /> There were so many things to like about the movie. Cheerful. Funny! Very well done and I say it as a movie fan, not as a player (and I'm not a D & D player). As I said, I expected much less. <br /> <br /> Movies often I do not like Attention, I end up listening to them while I work on my computer. This one caught my attention. I can not give a great compliment to a movie.
