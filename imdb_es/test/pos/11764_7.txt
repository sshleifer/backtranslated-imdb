After watching the trailer, it was an easy decision not to watch this movie. I mean, I do not care about the great "stoner comedies." I'm sure it was also an easy option for a lot of people to get together, smoke a bowl and go see this movie with the Simpsons guy and a guy named "Billy Bob". It should have been a good time, but the movie just is not so funny, too bad, someone had to go all out. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I discovered that the trailer was misleading after it had already left. The theaters, so I had to wait for the video. I really enjoyed it. Good places, quality production and excellent performances by the entire cast. Looking back, the twists of the plot were not totally unexpected, but it did not seem cumbersome because the premise was so attractive. <br /> <br /> So, why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy? Did something happen to the producer, leaving the associated producers to do the marketing themselves?
