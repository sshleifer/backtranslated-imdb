First of all, I must say that I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw of director Micheal Haneke and I was impressed that the address was good. <br /> <Br /> Haneke surely knows how to direct the actors. What I found interesting is also Haneke's scenario. At first, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very loved and respected by everyone in her environment. Then you realize that she has a mother who is a control freak and is too present in her life. Now you know that she is upset, that she has emotional problems, but you do not know exactly what. And then you fall on your dark side, but your dark side only reveals itself when a student falls in love with her. You can no longer control yourself. <br /> <br /> The roles are very complex and difficult to interpret, but Isabelle Huppert is wonderful in her role and deserves the recognition she had at the Cannes Film Festival. Benoit Maginel is also very solid, but a little overshadowed by Huppert's performance. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that seemed strange to me on stage: how the character played by Magimel is not very credible. He is too talented! It is rare for a person to be a piano virtuoso, but he spends most of his time playing hockey and studying ... He thinks it is a weak point, but only a minor flaw. <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie once, so I can not make a very thorough review, because I did not analyze it. I like what I saw! So I give the movie an 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Oh, yeah ... Regarding the ending, Haneke showed that he really wanted to surprise his audience. A motivation that I do not believe is necessary to make films, but Haneke does it with style and precision, that's why his film is better than Baise-Moi, for example. <br /> <br /> Vince
