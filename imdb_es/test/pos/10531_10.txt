This film is a remake very descendant of the famous masterpiece of Fritz Lang "M-Murder". It is well made and with an entertainment key to talk about quite serious events and contemporary problems at Eurobe, but not only around the world. Ethnic intolerance is such a great evil and very contagious today. So "Children of Wax" or as it is known in the distribution in the United States reveals the question of the hatred of the Germans and the Turks in a funny way. Without a doubt, it is very appreciated that the great Weinsten brothers distribute it for distribution. And there is another fact. What I like most is the participation in this film of the favorite actor of Lars von Trier, the great Udo Kier, who appears to play with so much pleasure the Bulgarian film director Ivan Nichev.
