I am sure that all Canadians in IMDb are very familiar with Canadian content, and how much of that is ... well, let's say, lackluster. There are some Canadian programs that are worth seeing, however, this is definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> Simple premise. Two boys who pick up girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules, add some clever and intelligent comments from a group of surprisingly nice self-proclaimed "Alpha Males" and have a very entertaining schedule. Each episode is solid. If the "players" are below average, there are some uncomfortable moments, and there is a bit of soft fun in them. If the "players" are good, that takes you to moments when you just have to get up and applaud, and some comic praise was lavished on them. <br /> <br /> The premise is a bit garbage, I know, and as a guy who generally takes pride in the fact that I rose above the typical and terrible reality of television, I find it hard to admit that this program It is really fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing that should be noted that The Comedy Network did a terrible job of promoting this program. For a long time, I did not even know the premise, and all I knew was that there was a shirtless man who "loves cougars." However, after watching the program, I was surprised by how amazing the Canadian content looks (despite a fairly short opening credit sequence). So give him a chance. I still have to find someone in the target demographic group (men 18 to 30 years old) who has seen the program (and not just the annoying commercials) who did not like it. <br /> <br /> Bring It Back For a third season, Comedy Network. In fact, it has a good premise, unlike other Canadian programs you've had (cough * girls will be girls * cough). Generally, I reserve 10/10 qualifications for "works of art", but I have a lot of fun watching this show and I believe that I have been unjustly judged, that I just had to do it.
