If there is a good thriller, this is one of them. James Stewart presents a dazzling performance as Dr. Ben McKenna, American, who, with his wife and son, is in Africa on tour. They run into a murder scene, and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later. <br /> <br /> Before you can say, "Fasten your seat belts," Dr. McKenna finds out a lot about an attempted murder and tries to stop it. However, other people know that it can be dangerous, (it's dangerous for them, that's it) and they try to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> Finally, Hank, the son, is alive and well. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies, this is the one you should see. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
