The Coen brothers have really outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three convicts who escaped. Although it is based on "The Odyssey", the old work of Homer, it is not necessary that you have read "The Odyssey" in order to follow the story. The Coen brothers have woven a carpet of celluloid and auditory delight! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, in fact it is as if the soundtrack were the product and the film was wrapping paper. Each character is beautifully exploited and goes back to the times of yesteryear, when the films were rich in characters whose appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent as the chubby Everett Ulysses McGill, an honest con man in the race whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and attractive. Oh brother, Where Art Thou is easily the best Coen movie to date, as well as Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to secure a nomination for best actor, as is the performance of Tim Blake Nelson's silly friend Delmar, while the film itself deserves a nod to the Best Picture.
