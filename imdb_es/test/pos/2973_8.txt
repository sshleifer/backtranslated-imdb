I also saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at that time, and I saw him with my girlfriend who later became my wife. I remember that the movie made me feel that it was possible to overcome the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a bit too much, but the female character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that could have been the introduction to the first time with my girlfriend back then. I have not seen the movie since then and I wonder why it has gone down the road. I'd love to see it again to see if it was as good as I remember. The soundtrack of Elton John was excellent.
