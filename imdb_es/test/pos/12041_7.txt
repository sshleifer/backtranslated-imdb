Darr was a Super Hit movie, which was loved by many people. Tells the story of the innocent obsession of Shahrukh Khans by Juhi, who loves Sunny Deol. Honestly, it was an entertaining movie, but if you look closely, it's not too realistic. Shahrukh Khan keeps calling Juhi and tells her that he loves her too much. He gives her an ad in the university that loves her, and gives her some nice surprises as beautiful photos of her. Unfortunately, instead of being flattered that a man loves her too much, she gets very scared. I personally know hundreds of people who are joked by someone, and these people enjoy it because they play a lot. Yash Chopra gives us a good movie that entertains, largely by the character of Shah Rukh Khan. Sunny Deol is supposed to be the main actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan for his excellent performance. Shah rukh Khan is literally the villain of the movie, but I would have liked him to get the girl, because he loves her so much. Sunny Deol gives a decent performance, but hits all those guys on their own and survives a brutal attack with a knife. Juhi Chawla is beautiful as always in a pretty good performance. Some good songs, including Tu mere samne, are the best.
