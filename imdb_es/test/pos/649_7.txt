In August 81, there was a big stir in the movies, great hits like "Urban Cowboy", "Every Which Way But Loose", "Smokey and the Bandit" were in vogue. For that reason, I suspect that the producers of this film chose "Honky Tonk Freeway" as the title in the hope that it will help receipts from the box office of the film by drawing in that same crowd of "Urban Cowboys". Instead, "Honky Tonk Freeway" was bombed in the theaters and I suspect that it does so in part because it is loaded with a badly chosen title. That same problem now loads on video and that's very bad because it's a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of time. No matter what, probably anyone who can remember 1981 will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie has been bombed. But I think it would have been anyway, even if it had not been loaded with a poor title. It is a movie ahead of its time. One could watch this movie now and see that it is clearly a father or a "great uncle" anyway, the kind of comedy that is done today. For his day, "Honky Tonk Freeway" was full of insinuations and a kind of candor about life that did not become popular in comedy until much later. While he is clearly a son of "Airplane", he is more mature, and although he is certainly not "Knocked Up", he clearly points in that direction. The characters are more "mature comedians" because they are low profile and never think that what they do is something more than serious. The jokes are based on the choice of aspects to be highlighted, the views of the camera and the way they look and their situations. <br /> <br /> But, more than that, "Honky Tonk Freeway" is a real-time capsule. A great retrospective look at the extremely early '80s. The people in this movie are dressed and act like the ordinary people of 1981. It was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a cunning comical commentary on the everyday life that surrounds them. <br /> <br /> I do not know if my opinion is helping you, but this is really an excellent one, that is a movie that is worth renting if you want to see how many faces that are familiar when they were 30 years younger Beverly D'Angelo is so young that it is difficult to realize that she is sometimes. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was about to become the Hollywood toast, since her next movie after this was "Tootsie", which eventually made her a star. Howard Hessmann was possibly the biggest "current" star of the day this movie was made. In 1981, Howard Hessmann was the protagonist of the hit television series "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his main character, the night rascal DJ. Daniel Stern was about to explode like a star like the adult narrator's voice of the main child character in the popular 80s comedy "The Wonder Years." There are also several faces that are no longer with us these days, it is good to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as an old married couple on a trip. Jessica Tandy would finally pick up her Oscar ten years after this for "Driving Miss Daisy." There is also the great Geraldine page in one of her final appearances in the film. Although he had had a brilliant career, he did not get his Oscar until four years after this in the "Viaje a Bountiful" of 1985, for which he deserved it, and he died shortly after receiving that award. <br /> <In addition, there are many other faces in this movie, actors who are not big stars but who have done a lot of support work. Many are relatives, even if you can not think of their name. <br /> <br /> This movie is a nice little diversion. A group of people with a variety of problems move from several places, each for their own unrelated individual reasons, who, vaguely Altman-esk, end up heading to Florida and without them knowing it in the small town of Ticlaw . Florida, which is recovering from the effects of being avoided by the nearby interstate highway that did not build an exit to Ticlaw that effectively takes the city off the map. <br /> <br /> And that's also what this movie is about. The fascination with the general idea of ​​the interstate system, which had recently been "completed". It took a generation to build, since it was authorized by Congress around 1960, through many years as different parts were built and then "put into operation" and, in 1980, the majority of the system was finally built and connected all together. The first time the promise of what the interstate system would have become what it is. And the people were charmed by it. Everyone in 1980 was practically a "veteran of interstate highways" in the sense that by then everyone had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it differed from other roads, since it had no red lights or stop signs , only on and off ramps, and going to places that were previously less accessible. By 1980, anyone could drive anywhere comfortably and without having to stop for anything except eating, sleeping and a bath. And this was all new then. <br /> <br /> The end is anti-climatic and not as satisfying even if it's a spectacular moment. What makes it great is that the trip is not the destination that makes the Honky Tonk Highway timeless despite being a product of its time. Forget your title; Instead, let me take you down the memory lane.
