I should have seen this movie about four or five times already, and it improves with every visualization. Suffice to say: this is the best movie I've seen in my life. And I think I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> But I've always wondered why this movie was rejected so much in some reviews or ratings. For example, take the Top 250 of IMDb. Why is it located only at number 216 (as of today)? Surely, the answer is not in the film itself (because that is only impeccable), but in its reception. The film caused controversy in his portrait of compassion for a convicted murderer and his attitude against the death penalty. And so, obviously, the most conservative user probably did not like the movie (as you can see in some of the other comments). So DEAD MAN WALKING gets a ranking that is nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality. Those people did not understand what the movie meant, and maybe they did not want to understand, being death penalty pro. So now I understand: everything is political. You are pro of the death penalty: you do not like (and, therefore, you do not want to listen) what the movie says. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that there are still a lot of people out there. who simply disconnect when a new perspective questions their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Mr. Robbins, the theme of your film divides the opinions of the people. Some reconsidered their point of view, others simply did not listen, but you made a very important point. It is likely that his film never appears on the list of "THE 100 BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIMES", but will be remembered long after movies like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 (all of them were unfairly preferred over his film at the Oscars) 1996 ) are forgotten. Congratulations, Mr. Robbins, and thanks for this important film work.
