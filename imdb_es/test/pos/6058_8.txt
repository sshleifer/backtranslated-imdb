THE DI. (4 out of 5 stars) Wow, I certainly did not expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I had never heard of that until I saw him sitting on the tray of discount videos one day. I thought that Jack Webb playing an army mock instructor might be good for a giggle, but I thought the drama would pale in comparison to D.I.'s latest movie. as it appears in "Full Metal Jacket" or "An Officer and a Gentleman". Boy, I was wrong. This is probably the best job that Webb has done ... much better than his "Dragnet" performances of a note. The delivery of your hard-guy dialogue is simply brilliant ... done in its monotonous patented, and yet, * you know * that the guy means every word. The story may seem a bit clumsy compared to the toughest military movies that have followed, but I still found it fascinating and compelling. Even a completely unnecessary musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked. Does anyone know where I can get a copy of that excellent Ray Coniff song "If you do not, someone else will do it"? Webb is the toughest drill driller instructor there is ... and he's under pressure to expel the private Owen, but, of course, he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy, and he'll drag him out with kicks and screams ! Good thing!
