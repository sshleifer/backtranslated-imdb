At first, with the remote, careful location and sweeping metallic sound, I thought of the opening scene in "Once Upon a Time in the West." When it arrives in the city, then it begins to feel like "Kitchen stories", or "Clouds drifting", possibly even "Grimm". <br /> <br /> Then it turns out that this is more similar to "Joe Versus the Volcano" in theme (not style). And the film runs from the beginning to the end the same discrete style. Allowing you to observe, perceive the steel, the blue-gray tone of the suites, the dresses, the color of the walls, the furniture, the sheets, the mirrors, the cars, the music, the background sounds and even the expression of the people . Then, near the end, there is a shot of a completely different tone: warm orange yellow with soft music and swims in the ocean, children and laughter. <br /> <br /> But maybe the observation is too long for me, I would. much more to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the final shot. Still very well done.
