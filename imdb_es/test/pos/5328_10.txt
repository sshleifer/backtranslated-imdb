I was looking at the external reviews (Ebert, etc.) for this movie and they were all pretty negative. However, after reading many of them, I noticed that everyone did the same. Critics were upset because the film focuses on what appears to be a mindless murder of an autistic child. Certainly, this is a disturbing image. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective story that finds out why the murder happened and directly blames the culprits. They want guilt to be laid and resolved. Well, that status quo issue is something the movie is parodying. Like society, critics wanted a very quick resolution to be able to move on to their next tragic opera. Maybe there is not a simple question to be answered here? There is much more about what happened then what is on the surface. The film does not seek to rationalize what happens, but to understand why. What also excites me so much about these inane comments is that the only thing they see in the way of the presentations is Spacey and Cheadle, which were great (and in general they are). But there are other great performances at work here besides the two current Hollywood icons. Gosling offers incredible performance that really only someone of his extreme talent could offer. Somehow, Gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child understanding. This irritates many, I am sure. However, if you watch the movie, see what Leeland's motivation is, it's wrong, but it's not bad. Malone is also at the top of his game as another confused young character. Basically, the murder of the child in this movie is not the main theme of the film. The main theme is life itself and how people deal with it, the ups and downs and how they sometimes try to help others cope with their lives (which does not seem to work very well). There are many good and bad things in this world and the way we handle each one has a direct impact on the amount of good and bad things that will happen, and sometimes a confused attempt to do good can lead to a lot of bad things . I think this is one of the most memorable movies at some point and it has an ending that is as touching as anything in the film's recent history. I firmly believe that people should watch this movie with an open mind.
