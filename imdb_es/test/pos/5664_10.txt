Certainly that is not the best movie of all. But it's certainly worth seeing for people with a special kind of mind. So the one who loves sadness and depression, and fairy tales at night, and wolves and true madness, welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) As for me, I could bear it only once ... But since then, the Wolves, Saint Lucia and drawings of children, and a Christ without a head, live in my nightmares.
