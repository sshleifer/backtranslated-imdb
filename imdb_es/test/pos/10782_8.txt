Oliver Stone, always ready to make political-themed films, makes another one here. "Talk Radio" is loosely based on the career of Alan Berg, a radio host in Denver killed by white supremacists. In this case, the character is Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian), a talk show host in Dallas who loves nothing but annoying callers. As it is, most of the callers are a group of racist heads And things may be getting hotter than anyone realizes. <br /> <br /> Bogosian's performance brings a comical and light tone to a film that would otherwise be. I really liked the scene where he paints a llama who calls. Of course, I would not call this the best Oliver Stone movie, but it is a good reference in an era in which the media is increasingly concentrated. The good performances of Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help.
