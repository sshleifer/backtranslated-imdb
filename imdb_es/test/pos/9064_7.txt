This movie was original in a non-original way. While many films addressed the subject of suicide and mental institutions, we always try to treat patients and improve them thanks to the help of the doctor. In this film, we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicidal girl. She will not stop at anything to make her happy, even if she does not care about happiness, she just wants to die. This was a very interesting romantic comedy that in nothing less than enjoyable. It's fun to see if you ever have the chance, you just have to have an open mind about the material. In general I give it a 6.4, I just voted 9 to get the highest rating :)
