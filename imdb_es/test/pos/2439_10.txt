This is one of my favorite movies! Along with the holocaust of casablanca and cannibal, it is an almost perfect cinema. Rex Allen recounts this wonderful story of a cougar who just needs a little love. It contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy and chaos in the riverbed. SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE TO KILL TO DO IT! You will not find a better cat image anywhere, with "outer space cat" as second not so close. Charlie's performance is magnificent. It even includes animal cruelty and intense felling! I have to love Disney, for all moral failures!
