The sequels are a whimsical lot, and most do not approach the stature of the original. Sometimes you find a sequel that is considered better than the original, some critics (like John Charles) have declared that Project A2 is better than the original, I do not agree, but this movie is still a worthwhile follow-up and fits well at the Exit of Hong Kong's brilliant action cinema in the 1980s, as well as Jackie's own work. I wonder how with such an impressive release of great movies that his later films were not so good. He only directed two films in the 1990s and none beyond that, but he had a lot of influence in many of the films in which he is not officially the director. <br /> <br /> Early in 1987, Jackie underwent brain surgery after a disastrous Fall in the filming of the Armor of God. This encouraged him to work on his next film near home. This did not encourage him to stop risking his life and his team of specialists for our fun. The result was a great success at home that eclipsed the original in the box office counts (31 million HK dollars compared to 19 million original). <br /> <br /> Jackie Chan is once again the extraordinary police officer Dragon Ma and he is ordered to work with Superintendent "Three Wan" Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors), who is the only police officer Chinese who may have a weapon, but is believed to be organizing arrests to look better and ignoring the crimes of a triad lord named Tiger Au (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Lord of the Dragon). Apparently, Chun has too much power to be shot down directly, but he is released from the Sai Wan district (now it's "Two Wan") that Dragon Ma takes over. This inefficient and corrupt office will soon receive a makeover and there is a big scene in which three officers, who do not know who they are dealing with, try to assault Ma to teach her a lesson about complaining about police officers. Soon he will take care of the shape of the district boat and of Tiger Au. The choreography of fights and acrobatics with Tiger and his men are incredible. My favorite trick was a beautiful and brutal fall from the second floor to a large vase and that vase did not seem to be soft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a couple of subplots are happening. There are pirates who have survived the first movie looking for revenge and food. Then there are the revolutionaries, among them Maggie (Maggie Cheung, In The Mood For Love) and (Rosamund Kwan, Casino Raiders) trying to raise funds for Dr. Sun Yat-sen to defeat the Qing Government, as well as government agents They try to find these rebels. Add a mix of corrupt Hong Kong and British policemen, as well as legitimate, and you will have a stew that is getting too many ingredients, but still seems to join. This works well when there is a scene influenced by the Marx Brothers (the Marx Brothers have done this kind of scene several times, being The Cocoanuts (1929) the first) in Maggie's place, where everyone is looking for someone while hiding from another person. They spent many weeks alone in this scene and the effort is certainly noticeable. <br /> <br /> There are several flaws in the movie. Is there a certain didactic nature that creeps into the movie that seems a bit out of place? especially a little speech towards the end that Jackie gives when dealing with the revolutionaries of the mainland and the extremely easy conversion of the pirates who survived the first film. The female characters are once again underutilized and underestimated, especially Maggie Cheung. Nor was he as satisfied with the continuity of the plot as the first film. The individual scenes dominate my feelings for the film instead of thinking about this film as a cohesive whole. I do not blame the film for not being able to have Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao as the first ones (although I heard that the main reason behind this was that those two were filming Condores del Este, but I wonder if Jackie could have waited a bit while to be presented in this (they would work together for the last time the following year in Dragons Forever), but they are missed. <br /> <br /> I thought it was quite nice and good.He made a film and it is considered rightly As one of the best comedy action movies of the eighties, this film is also quite good in some unexpected places, the artistic direction is excellent (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are exquisite, the cinematography is good and the The movie seems pretty authentic, but the tricks, the comedy and the action is what I remember this movie in. There is a chase that involves a dragon and Chun in handcuffs which is excellent (part of the scene of the Ax launch would be used in Shanghai Noon). The last twenty minutes are full of impressive hits, falls, chiles like a mouth (Jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used the real peppers in this scene, you can see him with a lot of pain during the Outtakes at the end) and it is a conclusion worthy of this movie. The most famous trick of this sequence is his tribute to Buster Keaton by Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928) with the exception that there is no hole and only a weak section where his head appears. <br /> <br /> Jackie fans and / or Hong Kong action movies should consider this as something they should have and see. I certainly do.
