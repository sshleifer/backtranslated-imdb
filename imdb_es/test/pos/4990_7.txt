"Comanche Moon" had everything in his favor. To begin with, the back of Simon Wincer, a man whose name is synonymous with high-quality television westerns. Unfortunately, the problems with "Moon" are something that even the most talented director could not solve: a poor script based on a mediocre novel. <br /> <br /> Forget the historical precisions, as any reader of the novels can say. You, the biggest parody in "Luna" is that it's not even consistent with the information in the original "Paloma Solitaria" masterpiece. So many wonderful and rich moments in the miniseries and, to an even greater degree, the book, are completely absent in the "Moon". Considering the fact that the majority of the viewers of "Luna" probably come with at least some kind of "Paloma" background, the lack of emotional history and motivated by the character is downright painful. <br /> <br /> That said, "Luna" is an instance in which the adapted version could and should have been modified to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "Luna" focuses mainly on the Comanches themselves. To his credit, the miniseries tries to serve the Comanches, but in the end it gives them enough so that the viewer has the feeling that they are missing an important part of the story. Similarly, Val Kilmer's Scull is also lost here: the role should have expanded, so Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths, in fact) had something to do, or the roles should have been reduced to smaller, supportive parts . Instead, Kilmer gets the maximum turnover of a character that only leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the final act completely strange. <br /> <br /> There are strange moments throughout the film that just do not make sense to those who have not read the book (a murderous parrot? what?). Also, there is not a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are close to the incredible Texas Rangers they claim to be. Not one of his expeditions on the Moon (or "The Dead Man's Walk," for that matter) ends successfully, and Call and McCrae only seem to get on one meaningless mission after another. <br /> <br /> Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script, and he only did it because of the praise that surrounds that other cowboy movie, Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (although there is some dissent about the consistency of that statement), but he has never established himself exactly as a screenwriter. This production would have benefited not only with the return of director Wincer, but also the original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to the screen. Witcliff does not have a lot of material for his screen writing credit, but no one can deny that he did a fantastic job of reducing the original "Loneome Dove". With all this said, "Comanche Moon" is almost a brilliant production, helped by an excellent cast that unfortunately does not have enough to do. The representation of Steve Zahn of Gus McCrae, or rather, his interpretation of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae, is unmatched. And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call, saying that his performance does not mimic the quiet and stoic Woodrow of the original movie, all I can say is: blame McMurtry, because McMurtry is the one, both in the " Moon "novel and now the miniseries - turned Woodrow from a socially inept, clumsy but natural leader, into a character without emotions whose lines are simply boring and whose motivations of the characters are clear if you have seen them represented much more adequately in the sequel ". <br /> <br /> However, it is the cast that shines in "Moon", in the measure that I left the miniseries with the same feeling of melancholy that I felt when I saw the original "Loneome Dove", this time because I I realized that it is probably the last time we see these characters appear on the screen for a long, long time to come, and honestly, this cast could have done so well in a well-developed network television series and throughout ruler. <br /> <br /> In short, besides the wasted opportunities with the cast, the bi The most obvious farce is that the original novel by Lonesome Dove contained such a rich story for the characters that would have been fascinating, absolutely fascinating, to see translated on the screen. Unfortunately, everything that has been pushed aside in favor of the tedious, inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel of McMurtry.
