The first time I saw this movie was on a flight between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was a real pleasure and made the trip go through much less discomfort than the normal 10-hour flight. I tried to locate a copy without success until I discovered a copy for sale on eBay. Now that I have seen it twice, I recommend it as good entertainment. My only real criticism is that the choice of English translation words for subtitles is lower than normal, even by normal standards. In addition, the subtitle is too small, mixes with the film too often and often travels too fast to read well.
