This trio of 30-minute short films on topics related to homosexuals are executed in a respectable manner. Each story of coming of age is played with pleasant charm and naturalness. This movie deserves to be widely distributed and easily obtainable. However, it is not. I had to ask for my video copy; none of the local video stores or even the libraries had it in stock.
