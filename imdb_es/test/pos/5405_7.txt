"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film starring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue. <br /> <br /> The story is about a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the eldest son (Pardue) commits suicide. <br /> <br /> "Common people" has been mentioned often in connection with this film; It is a kind of "ordinary people" with a reversal of roles. The mother in this case, Sandy Travis (Weaver) is more accessible than the father, Ben (Daniels) who is clearly devastated and can not cope. Like "Ordinary People," the youngest son, Tim (Hirsch), is the focus of the film. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie was absorbing enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment. There were some wonderful interactions: mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some good times out of the ordinary. What he never clicked was that Ben was part of that family or had some chemistry with Sandy. This seems to have been the goal of the director / writer Dan Harris. In a scene in a grocery store, the child who makes the payment assumes that Sandy is "about 30 years old" and gives him his phone number. In almost the next scene, Daniels asks Sandy if she wants plastic surgery for her birthday. Weaver was 55 years old when this movie was made, in reality probably 54, and it looks phenomenal. So, what is Ben looking at? However, there is something twisted about Ben's complete detachment because the viewer does not really see how Daniels was attached to that family. <br /> <br /> The ending has a couple of turns and also some very moving scenes. All are very good, with Weaver and Hirsch as highlights. <br /> <br /> There is not a tremendous amount of dialogue in this film and many looks. The script could have been more acute. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
