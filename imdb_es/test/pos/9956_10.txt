I have never seen anything by this beloved of the luvvies, not to mention a merchant from Venice, I can not comment on how faithful he is to the previous adaptations of the work, so I will treat it as another film that tries to be more than novocaine for the eye MoV is an instant film about a young bassanio lover (fiennes) and his merchant friend antonio (irons) and a Jewish moneylender shylock (pacino) <br /> <br /> summary of the plot <br /> <br /> bassiano is broke and needs money to attract the charming portia (collins), go to his friend antonio, who sympathizes with the situation of his friends, so he borrows some money from shylock <br /> <br /> now antonio he does not do it as Jews in general and shylock in particular and bitter and twisted shylock for the abuse he suffered from antonio in particular and Christians in general agree to lend money to antonio on the condition that if antonio does not pay the loan in the agreed term, shyl ock cuts a pound of body antonium meat <br /> <br /> comment <br /> <br /> the movie is incredibly beautiful and acted and spoken in such a way that forces you to think about what each line means, this in turn makes the viewer get information about the characters and their motivations <br /> <br /> I think it's a film about the choices Shylock makes, and how to make wrong decisions leads to the ruin of Shylocks <br /> <br /> From the moment Shylock demands his pound of flesh, he is condemned, because the rest of the world is against him and he is committed to causing his fall <br /> <br /> This bothered me much, usually in a movie when a victim has the opportunity to take revenge against those who have hurt him, whether the victim succeeds or makes the villain see the error of his ways, which leads to a big hug. <br /> <br /> Not in the MoV, the victim is quickly seen as the villain and the ball is taken away. fortune and faith <br /> <br /> this film is a powerful and subtle portrait of informal anti-Semitism that shows how an entire society can activate a minority and make it look like the victim is really the criminal <br /> <br / > I was surprised by this movie 10/10
