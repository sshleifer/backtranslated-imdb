Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-Nazi propaganda piece, strung on Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as a Jewish barber who is Hynckel's Spit image. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen the news of Hitler speaking will recognize the strange resemblance of the caricature. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie had a slow start with a typical Chaplin hit centered on the adventures of the Jewish World War One barber. Since I had never seen him, I must confess that, after the first 20 minutes, I was wondering what all this fuss was about. But the film quickly fills with steam. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of "Hynckel-ism" to make the point of propaganda. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi discourse given by Chaplin at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> As good as Chaplin is in this movie, however, I thought everything was stolen by Jack. Oakie, playing the dictator of "Bacteria" - "Benzino Napaloni". Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject: he had Mussolini's arrogant stance down. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate about the destiny of "Osterlich" had me in point. <br /> <br /> This was a very good movie, and well worth seeing.
