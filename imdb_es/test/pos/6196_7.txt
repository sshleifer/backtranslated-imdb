Intelligently written, well acted, intense and suspense. This show lives in the real world, it's not as fantastic as "24" (and, by the way, I'm a big fan of the 24). It has credible characters and in many ways it is much smarter than most in this genre. Try to present both sides of Islam. So far, I've seen the first 4 episodes and I think the story is more balanced. Terrorists are more complex and not one-dimensional. And as a result of that balance, terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains represented in film and television. Last but not least, the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon. I recommend this program for anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like.
