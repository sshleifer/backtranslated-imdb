I do not understand why he is so underestimated in IMDb. This movie is simply perfection. The best adaptation of all time of the Tarzan myth! As a Frenchman, I can say that this is the best role of Christophe Lambert, ridiculous in many films, but here he is absolutely wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The plot is great, well told, the magnificent story, the direction, the atmosphere, the music, everything is perfect! How to believe these sequences with Elgar's music, just perfect ... <br /> <br /> Greystoke is really an incredible movie, underestimated here, I do not really know why, but I really appreciate it
