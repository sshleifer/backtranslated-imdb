Maybe I was in a very good mood when I saw this movie. But, for some reason, I really liked this movie. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a bit predictable? Yes and what? It was still a very beautiful movie. I've always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element, after all), and portrayed a selfish and sarcastic person to perfection. Maybe this film is not material of the Academy Award, but it is material to feel good. Go rent it.
