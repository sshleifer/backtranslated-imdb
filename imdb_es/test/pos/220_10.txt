After reading all these reviews, I am very surprised that no one has ever noticed that this program was based on the "M Squad" program on NBC from 1957 to 1960, starring Lee Marvin. I read reviews that compare it to "Dragnet". and some of Quinn Martin's police shows, but if you see M Squad you'll see that he's based on that. At the end of 1958, the episodes of M Squad on, will see Lee Marvin, who plays Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger, get out of his car and then shoot, and he responds, the beginning of Police Squad is basically the same (including the Jazz music) and then Lee Marvin narrates what happens (Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger, M Squad, a special department of the Chicago police) and in the police squad, Leslie Neilsen does the same (Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Squadron police, special division of the Police Department) and so on, in one episode of M Squad there is even the character of Johnny, the shoeshine boy and in an episode of M Squad entitled "More Deadly" there is an episode of Police Squad titled " A substantial gift (The Broken Promise) "that is the same story!
