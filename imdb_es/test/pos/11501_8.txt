This movie is based on a true story. The author of the novel that bears the same title, Einar Már Guðmundsson, had a brother who became mentally ill. I found this film very moving, following the path of the main character towards the disease, to see how life treats after the diagnosis and how to befriend the mental institution, everything is very convincing. There are quite a few splendidly funny incidents also in the manuscript. The title of it does not reveal anything about the story. You must see it to understand ... and listen to the music, which is twisting and turning your heart and soul as the film progresses. A must for everyone.
