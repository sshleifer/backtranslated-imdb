It is as much like the novel by Dean Koontz as Jessica Simpson is with a space scientist. If you have read the book, I suggest you move it away from your mind as much as possible before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Observers is your typical "Boy with dog, dog turns out to be super-" Intelligent government lab experiment, dog and child are chased by a superintelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by the same lab, and, oh yeah, did I mention the government agents who chase the monster that chases the dog? "movie. <br /> <br /> Corey Haim is the boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the evil guys of government, and Sandy the dog is, well, the dog (called Furface here, Einstein in the book). <br /> <br /> The monstrous effects are ridiculously cheesy, much of the dialogue is ridiculous, the script rarely It makes sense or is credible, a good example is Haim's unconditional acceptance of the intelligence of the dog, as if everything Fido out of the street can write messages on a computer keyboard or bark once per se and twice per No. Hmm, it has to be the dog How, right? "Haim's performance is enthusiastic but trembling, as he carries the stupid dialogue with the least skill. Ironside has been the highlight of many bad movies, and this is no exception. It easily gives the best interpretation of the film, although I am forced to add that the dog (which is a very good actor in itself!) Comes in second place. <br /> <br /> In general, atrociously. Silent movie, and still. . . And yet, I saw it three times in a week. And yet I can not stop liking. Hey, what can I say? I have a taste for junk and Michael Ironside (not that I've tried Michael Ironside, I'm sure there are laws against that). But any movie that can make me laugh so hard (yes, even unintentionally) can not be so bad. Consider it a guilty pleasure, a movie of "yes, I know it's insultingly stupid, but I like it anyway." <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to rate this. On a normal scale, I am forced to give it a D-, but on my own scale of cheese, I get an A-. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know. I'm weird like that.
