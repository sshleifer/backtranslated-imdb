Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 founding masters of the Japanese film, the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest film about the lives of the retired Geishas. No matter what happens, when a woman like that ages and loses her charm and mystique? Well, for those who are interested, watch this movie. One: Okin, is successful as a lender, but the other two have to borrow and are resentful. Okin does not have children, but the others do. Okin learns that her old love comes to visit her and is excited. Naruse is a teacher in subtle studies of the characters of his female protagonists. Ultimately, Bangiku draws the viewer to the study of the issues of happiness and the value of life. Very good movie indeed.
