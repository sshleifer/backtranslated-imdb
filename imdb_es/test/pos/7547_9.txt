The first of the five St Trinian films (although the latter usually has a discount) is based on the schoolgirl characters of the artist Ronald Searle, and presents the wonderful Alastair Sim as Dragic Millicent Fritton, director, and her own brother. Much of the humor is dated, but curiously poignant and outrageous in the world of personal computers today: girls drink, play, smoke and then sell to rich Arabs, but always remain in charge, defeating bureaucrats, policemen, Judges and other figures of establishments like them prowl around England. Maybe because movies have been seen so often on television, St Trinians still inspires costume parties and club nights. The movies have recurring characters that include PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The forerunner of the entire series is a charming film called "The happiest days of your life" (1950).
