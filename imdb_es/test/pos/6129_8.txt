Like those who heard the reports about the attack on Pearl Harbor, everyone who has seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it, and about thirty years later, the film is still one of the most indescribable . Filthy, hateful, repulsive and hilariously funny movies that have always been put on celluloid, guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the most difficult funny bones. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a budget close to zero and some of the most fearsome cinematographies. Around, PINK FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families competing for the sensational title of "The Filthiest People Alive". How dirty can they be? A lot: the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control to a large number of puppies, and I guarantee you will not want to eat an egg for at least several weeks afterwards. seeing him. <br /> <br /> The cast is wonderful, atrocious or atrociously wonderful, depending on how you look at it. The star, of course, is Divine ... and to describe Divina as the BIGGEST drag queen on the planet would be the underestimation of the year. It is a gigantic creature that gives BIG eye makeup, BIG orange hair and BIG expressions; it's the Charleton Heston drag, and if it's almost running down a corridor, pausing to use the bathroom on someone's lawn, or surprising the real-life buyers when taking a walk on the Baltimore sidewalk, it's indescribable and indescribably fun. Others in the cast include Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills and the always atrocious Edith Massey as members of the Divine family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as the couple of babies that sell white slaves that defy Divine status. <br /> <br /> It should be pretty obvious that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that appeals to everyone, and viewers who know director John Waters only through later films like HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will have a big shake. But if you want to see something so completely different that even Monty Python could not imagine, this is the movie for you. Just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably do not want to eat later, and you might want to have a bag to throw up by hand, just in case. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
