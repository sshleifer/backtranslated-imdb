This is one of the most satisfying of the book for TV adaptations. The actress who makes us believe that a Borg could be sexy makes us believe that a spy and a traitor can have some redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The plot line of the TV does not follow Cornwell's story exactly, but it is exciting and rewarding as a retelling of a good thread. If you have a yen for romance in uniform, there is a lot of sexual energy that was unleashed between our Sharpe man and the one who lies. It made me wish his role was closer to that in the books. But it does not matter if there are enough wrong heroes, redeemed heroes, heroes with rage, heroes in flight and heroes in battle to keep up with your DVD playback.
