A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to locate their evasive boyfriend. This is a very defamed movie due to its outcome, but until then it is interesting, well acted, strange and with a fine design (by William Cameron Menzies, developed for 3-D projection). Veronica Hurst is captivating and gentle, a kind of the elegant British Marilyn Monroe, who is still in love with Richard Carlson, who hides a family secret in his imposing castle; There are even bats in the bell tower! He moves without haste until the extraordinary final set, when Hurst and his aunt (Katherine Emery, also the narrator), sneak out of the castle at night to venture into the labyrinth and find what they are looking for in their center. As a child, I always remembered this sequence: there is nothing more terrifying (or claustrophobic) than not finding a way out of a 10-foot-tall hedge maze. Naturally, the two women split up, setting the stage to absorb the suspense with horrible music. The end result is a bit disappointing really, since Carlson's epilogue at the end makes some sense for all events, even provoking sympathy. Worth seeing.
