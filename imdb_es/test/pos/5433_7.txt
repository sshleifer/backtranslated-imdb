I went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a reappearance for Robin Williams, but when I saw it I realized that the advertisers had lied to me, since this is more drama than comedy, although it has some really good laughs. that. It felt like I was watching two movies. One was a fun game with Robin Williams that should have been the whole basin of the movie anyway, but you also get a techno thriller with a political anguish in the middle. I really do not know how to classify this movie. But I can say it was good and I laughed, not as much as I expected, but at least Williams is in the right direction. See this but I know that before going there is not all comedy and it is a bit intense.
