Since Jason and his colleagues took over the horror films around 1980, almost all horror movies have involved a group of hormone-laden teenagers who cut themselves into pieces with the focus on cutting and not on suspense. <br /> <br /> This little movie is different. Made in the early '80s, it does what every good horror movie should do: make your worst fears come alive as you sit, knowing that these horrors are just around the corner. Then, you make those horrors simmer, but do not turn it into a lesson about the biology of butchery. <br /> <br /> The story features Meg Tilly right before she had a brief twist and fame started with "The Big Chill" and then she went back into the dark in the early 90's. Meg plays a marginalized teenager who is dying to mess with the good graces of some classic evil girls. They tell you that you can be part of your small group if you spend the night in a crypt. The bad girls try to frighten her and make her leave the crypt, giving them a double reward: torment the marginalized girl even more and have an excuse to reject her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the famous occultist Karl Rhamarevich has died a strange death shortly after he claimed to have discovered a way to return from the grave and, on his return, command great magical powers. At first, her daughter does not believe it, but she hears a tape about her father's experiments, which include her successful animation of small dead animals and her plans to come out of the grave with the power to animate bigger games and gain more power from they. These animations also find out that he may have inherited the power of his father and may be the only person who can stop him if he really gets up from the dead. I think you know where this story is going, so I'll stop here. Did I mention that the magician was buried in the same crypt in which the character of Meg Tilly is spending the night? <br /> <br /> I will mention that the commercial DVD that contains this movie seems somewhat degraded compared to what you would expect. A movie that was made so recently. I saw it on television in the mid-1980s and I remember that it looks better than this. The problem is that the original negative of the film was never located, so the DVD had to be created from an impression. This means that it comes complete with dirt and scratches. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out horror fans. It was a film made independently and an example of the kind of unusual things that can commonly be found on nightly television until the infomercial turned that time slot into a vast desert around 1986. Only TCM Underground broadcasts this kind of film.
