The film follows a group of students at the Performing Arts High School in New York City. Hay Coco (Irene Cara) a black singer who will manage to reach the top despite everything. She is helped by Bruno (Lee Curren) a white musician. Then there is Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to be an actress, but she is shy and afraid. She befriends Motgomery (Paul McCrane), supposedly the only gay student in school and is in love with Raul (Barry Miller). Then there's Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray, who unfortunately died in 2003) who is homeless and a great dancer, but can not read. Then there are several teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara stand out) trying to teach the children. <br /> <br /> The songs are BIG (the title tune and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for Best Song - "Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows great ambition and talent. BUT this movie loses the boat in the drama department. Many story lines are displayed and left completely open at the end of the movie. Why did Coco make a porn? Did Doris and Ra√∫l stay together? Or did they? What about Montgomery? What happened? And did Leroy ever graduate, and how? There are too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that do not lead to anything. I suppose there were cuts in the script; I can not believe that the movie has left all this theme open. <br /> <br /> Even so, it's worth seeing for the performance and, again, the music. Basically there is not a bad song and the dances have all the strength (and at one point they stop the traffic, literally!). My favorites are "Fame", "Out Here ..." and "I Sing the Body Electric", which is a great closing song. So I recommend it, but I can only give it a 7, the script that was really needed to tie loose ends, and it was not like that. <br /> <br /> Trivia: They wanted to film this film at the Royal School for the Performing Arts, but could not get permission. The dean of the school read the script and said there were too many insults in the movie. That's true: there's a LOT of dirty language, but that's how the kids in high school talk. Avoid the TV version that abysmally overdubbed.
