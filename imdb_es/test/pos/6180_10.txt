The comments of planktonrules must have been written on the day of Topsy-Turvy, because everything that that simple way of life says is the opposite of the real truth! <br /> <br /> 'The Eighth Wife of Bluebeard' is hilarious in every scene, in every way - the chemistry between Colbert and Cooper could not have been better ... the cast is excellent. <br /> <br /> The writing and the direction are magnificent! <br /> <br /> Like so many other comments on this board again I'm sorry: "Why can not movies be like that anymore?" <br /> <br /> This is the best classic Paramount 1930 comedy at its best, friends!
