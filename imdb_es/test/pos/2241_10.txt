This is one of the best episodes of Doctor Who EVER. We have the Cybermen, the Cyber ​​conversion units (they can scare small children) and, of course, the Doctor doing one of their best acts. Bravo David Tennant. Good scenes as if it were a movie, with exciting scenes on some streets, an invasion at the base of Cyberman and leaving the world different from ours, basically a 45-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Being part 2 of Rise Of the Cybermen, this would never disappoint. With a great preparation until the end. <br /> <br /> The Doctor plus an evil enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Autons or even Macra) is a battle to the death, just Beware of young children watching this.
