In a world in which debatable and misunderstood issues can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes one at the top of that list; In addition, it does so in an objective and realistic manner, and with a sensitivity and sensitivity that make it a really great movie by anyone's measuring stick. And to add some irony to all this, even the subject of this film has been widely misunderstood, since it is wrongly perceived to be a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; It is not. In the heart of 'Dead Man Walking', directed by Tim Robbins, there is a subject that, in reality, is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it can be the most difficult for a human being really. - and truly-- understand. And that's what this movie is about: Sorry. Real forgiveness; Do not excuse an atrocious crime or the author of it, do not say that what happened is fine, but find the strength to continue and do so when choosing life. <br /> <br /> The director / screenwriter Tim Robbins has elaborated and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, in which he talks about his involvement with death row inmates who along over the years he has ministered his faith in God. As recounted in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit not only of justice, but of human dignity, began with a simple letter from a prisoner sentenced to death in the Louisiana State Prison in Angola Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) approached anyone who heard him, when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found himself venturing into a territory where he did not have Absolutely no knowledge or experience. And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey in a succinct way, while managing to keep it without any sentimental sentiment, which makes it not only real, credible and credible, but makes it a moving experience and emotionally moving for the audience. Through film, what was once a meaningful and personal emotional experience for Sister Prejean, also becomes one for all who watch this movie. <br /> <br /> For her passionate and passionate interpretation of the sister. Prejean, Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for best actress. Sensitive and charged with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly moving and real, especially in the way she conveys the underlying natural frailty and vulnerability of Sister Prejean, which she firmly hardened with the harshness she needed to continue her efforts on behalf of of Poncelet. (and actually, a total of five since it started). Whatever your point of view on the issues examined in this film, Sister Prejean is undoubtedly a person of heroic proportions, which Sarandon personifies exquisitely here; and it does so without resorting to superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping them real, subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very credible expression of characterization. It's an extraordinary performance, possibly the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. <br /> <br /> Also in the best performance of his career, is Sean Penn, who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet (lost to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in `Leaving Las Vegas). Perfect for the part in every way, Penn has simply never been better, before or after. He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person, rather than as an exaggerated caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes described here. It's not that I make Poncelet less despicable; Quite the opposite, in fact. It is really disconcerting to face the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next to you could be capable of such things. And that is the strength of Penn's performance: it is so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuances; you just have to look into their eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul. A fantastic performance, and, as good as Cage was in Vegas, Penn should have received the Oscar for her. <br /> <br /> In another outstanding performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix, father of one of Poncelet's victims. However, with limited screen time, he develops his character in such a way that allows him to empathize with him, as well as with Sister Prejean, since it is through him that we are given an idea of ​​how complex and seemingly tenuous he is. your position , At least on the surface. Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that it provides the necessary balance and perspective for the story, which ultimately is extremely effective and helps to underline the message of the film. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell ( Lucille Poncelet), Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film would change anyone's opinion one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended was to make an emotional film, involving reflection, which is exactly what Robbins has achieved with 'Dead Man Walking'. Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. Because, as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something that one simply decides to do, but it is a task that can become the work of a lifetime. And it is possibly one of the most difficult things in life to achieve it effectively; and you move away from this movie with an appreciation for people like Sister Prejean, who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping the needy, and filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon to give life to millions of people they would never otherwise have known. its. I qualify this 10/10. <br /> <br />
