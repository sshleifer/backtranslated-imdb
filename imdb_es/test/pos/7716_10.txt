Wow, it's been a while since I've seen anything so mysterious in the way it's represented. <br /> <br /> A detective story uses old black and white images to portray a private investigator who wears an old raincoat and fashionable hat. The theme of this animation is reminiscent of Sam Spayed's that was briefly mentioned by Ash. <br /> <br /> Sick of spying on the wives of the house because of his clients, Ash was offered the opportunity to track down a "computer". hacker ", who thought it was a good opportunity for a four-figure sum that he could not refuse and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> The ending was a bit tasteless, but still good. Like old fashion stories, this is the one for you.
