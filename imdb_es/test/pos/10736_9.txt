I do not think so! I mean, yes, if you compare this movie with The Godfather, or maybe a slightly older movie like Casablanca, or maybe a slightly newer movie like The English Patient. He does not have camera work or cinematography like these other movies, but that does not mean this is a bad movie, is it? I think the reason why this movie is underestimated is because many people always compare it to other great Oscar-winning films (you should never do that), which makes it difficult to understand the beauty and realism of this film. In the categories Best Film, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this movie really deserved everyone. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best performances. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that it was not his son because it was so real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for actors to play that specific role, but so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with great success, in my opinion. There are some actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can not help it, I think it's great). Meryl Streep, although she has a supporting role, is amazing and real and you can not help but be attracted by her talent and the way she makes it his own and real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful, so I say good work to cute little Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> While I was watching this movie for the third time, alone, I could not stop crying. I tried but I could not. Thank God I was alone! This is probably the purest movie I've seen in my life. Other films that were nominated for Best Film were Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed, because I have not seen any of them, but from what I've heard, Apocalypse Now is great, but when I heard about Norma Rae I just thought about Sally Field. I think that considering the other nominees, this film deserved its five Oscars, and that it will continue to play and make other people cry for a long time in the future, just as it has for the past 28 years. Good work to all the actors and actresses of this film for giving us excellent performances and memories of seeing this movie that we will never forget. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
