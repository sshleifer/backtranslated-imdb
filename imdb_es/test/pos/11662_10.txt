How do you know if a movie is good or not? It's the impact on you that makes the difference. "Dead Man Walking" bothered me a lot. I saw it twice. I do not know if I'll be strong enough to see it again. No, I did not feel well after watching it, but the movie was as successful as possible. <br /> <br /> Robbins did a great job of incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as partial or subjective. I hope many people see "Dead Man Walking". I think anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else I could take to finally convince everyone that this relic of antiquity does not have a place already in modern society. <br /> <br /> The film itself does not present an argument for or against the death penalty. Describe reality Reality is the best argument against the death penalty. <br /> <br /> A 10/10 for his excellent performances, good film making and for the most important movie made in years <br /> <br /> Thanks, Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
