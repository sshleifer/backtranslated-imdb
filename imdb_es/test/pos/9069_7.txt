Peter Lorre gives one of his most evil performances as owner of the place entitled. The plot has a new government agent that is being put on the trail of Peter Lorre's character. When the G man gets in touch with his murdered by one of Lorre's agents, the G man is sent to prison for the murder, although everyone knows there is more in the story. Lorre has placed the man on probation under his care and taken to his island where he is extracting diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he is not talking and a battle of wills starts. <br /> <br /> This is a good solid thriller that does not do much. Feel the plot wisely, but still the movie keeps your interest. I had put the movie the night before to use it as something to divert me, instead I found the story fascinating enough to go up an additional 70 minutes. Lorre is the reason why one falls into this. His behavior is disconcerting. Very recently, but it is clear in his orders and in the way in which everyone reacts to him (observes how they light their cigarettes) that he is a bad guy. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out if you find it.
