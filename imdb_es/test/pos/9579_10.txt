How often do you see a movie of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments? Waldo's Last Stand is a soft drink. Here Waldo is selling lemonade but he is not making money. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Mickey and Buckwheat come to visit him, which is ironic because in 3 Men In A Tub and Came The Brawn, where there was competition between Alfalfa and Waldo for the affection of Darla. Going back in history: The gang tries the lemonade to see if Waldo did it right. A fun moment is when Alfalfa takes a glass cup for lemonade and Waldo fills up and gives it to Darla and Alfalfa has an angry expression on his face. Spanky proposes a floor show to accompany the lemonade and even Mickey agrees that it is very nice. When the show begins on the floor, there is no one in the barn, but then a customer enters (Froggy). Spanky asks if he wants lemonade but all he does is nod his head. Spanky asks the amount of time in short and every time Froggy nods, Spanky shows many expressions on his face, which is fun. Spanky tries in many ways to make him thirsty. One way is when after Mickey said so beautifully "Those cookies are salty and made me thirsty". There are also many musical entertainments, this bit is short. The opening number is Darla, who plays dances and sings. The second includes alfalfa singing out of tune (as usual) with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky and Buckwheat on "How dry I am!" (I think they sing that to make Froggy thirsty.) He also made me laugh. The closing number includes boys and girls, all dressed in an old way. This was Waldo's last short film, Our Gang. A great musical short that is a pure 10 out of 10.
