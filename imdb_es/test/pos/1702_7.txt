I just finished a double movie of An American Werewolf in London and Paris. Let me start by saying that "London" is still lingering after all these years and the transformation sequence is quite impressive, the film was funny and scary, also a bit bloody ... Now let's go to "Paris" it's nice, some scars, a lot blood, not as exciting or as mysterious as the original, but it does have some laughs in what has become the current fashion in movies, so perhaps in that sense it was ahead of its time, the transformations' A CGI, Although it is good for the technology of its time, it is not as impressive as the original. I gave this movie a 7 because I have to admit it was nice, I laughed a lot and I discovered that Tom Everett Scott was so stupid that at first he wanted me not to like his performance just to end up liking ... imagine ... Julie Delpy was competent, as well as the direction in which the script was lacking in brilliance and delicacy. I read here that John Landis was supposed to address evil, but he was not sure it would have been a completely different movie. I also noticed a discussion about a Sequel "What If", so nobody has noticed that Obvious should be in America and here is my title "An Werewolf American Comes Home" or DC, which would be fun, all those political dogs need a good scare. You just have to see the original on your new DVD transfer with Dolby 5.1 sound and watch both on an HDTV with the up conversion turned on ... great!
