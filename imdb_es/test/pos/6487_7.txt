Society heiress Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and her wealthy father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are upset that their nieces Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) live a bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their artist uncle John (Milland) after the death of his parents (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon has stopped trying to convince John so that he and Susan can take care of the children and have resorted to the use of private detectives to catch him with improper or unemployed behavior and, therefore, can not care for the children properly. Susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to Greenwich Village, pretending to be an actress, to try to get information and / or persuade him to see the reason. However, what she discovers is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle that John and his friends live and that the girls are being well educated, but that he is falling in love quickly with John. Inevitably, he discovers his true identity and faces the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the debate over custody of who belongs to whom. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and discovered that it is very brief. The execution time (70 minutes) was the perfect duration to turn this story simple but endearing. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great actresses of the years 1930-1940, is charming in this movie. Her energy, style and healthy beauty really lend themselves to creating a beloved character, even though you know she's throwing a fast at the people she quickly befriends with. This is the first movie I've seen Ray Milland in, and he was actually young and not patrician. (And, apparently, three years younger than his co-star) His energy and carefree manner in "Wise Girl" were a refreshing change in the behavior that affects his usual, darker films. Honestly, although I'm not usually a fan of children's actors, I really enjoyed the two girls who played Susan's nieces. They were lovingly precocious, and they were really the jewels of the movie. Unfortunately, I can not unearth any other film in which any of them were subsequently after it, which is a shame, since both exhibited a lot of natural talent. <br /> <br /> "Wise Girl" was a movie that was made three years after the Hollywood Code was installed, and to some extent, this was made very clear by the fast and happy ending, and the cake in the sky, softness and ease with which the characters lived. The supposed bohemian cooperative was, in fact, a magnificent dead-end street where artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is tied very well everywhere. Fortunately, this was a film light enough and the characters were charming enough to allow for its softness and flaws, and I was able to take "Wise Girl" for what it was; a good old-fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was captivating. Unfortunately, the films of today's romantic comedy / drama genre are considerably less intelligent and entertaining, or I would not find myself continually returning to the classics. 7/10
