A story about love and hate, tragedy and happiness, and above all, friendship set at the very interesting moment of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> It interests you in the story, it involves you emotionally and makes you feel involved. We feverishly await the next episode. <br /> <br /> In addition, the casting was splendid. Many superstars appear in short cameos, the main roles are played by a variety of talented mimes: Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber must be mentioned here. This is simply an excellent example for a television production as it should be. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the sheer beauty of Wendy Kilbourne playing Constance :-)
