Well, maybe it was because I was in Yangchun China when I saw this movie. Maybe it was because I finally had something on TV that I could understand or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was funny. Whatever it is, this movie was worth it. <br /> <br /> I had just arrived for my head and foot massage when I was given the remote control to watch TV. Usually, I put out the damn thing, but I ran into this crazy movie and I got hooked. <br /> <br /> The plot, if it could be called a plot, revolves around a cooking competition and is a love story And the food in this film is the real star. If you like Iron Chef and many of the other cooking shows that are currently in reality mode, then you will love the scenes with food in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's fast and the subtitles are so fast that it's better. be up in reading speed for this. However, the action is mainly slapstick, so you do not always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea. <br /> <br /> The main actress is charming and the main actor is not bad to see. . Both are worth seeing. Finally, if you have time to kill and you want to laugh, this is not a bad choice for both. <br /> <br /> I do not speak a word of Chinese, but I was able to understand cultural humor. of this movie. For those who speak Chinese maybe it's even better. In general, I give it an 8 out of 10 and I am currently looking for a copy to have while I am in China, and by the time I return home, it will be a good reminder for my time in Yangchun and a silly afternoon in the massage parlor watching a silly movie
