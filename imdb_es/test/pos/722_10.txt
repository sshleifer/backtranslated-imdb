I saw this movie without knowing anything about it. I had presumed it was a science fiction movie of some kind. How wrong I was. The plot is exciting and intelligent, the cast is charismatic and the whole movie makes you think about a change. Some of the puzzles surprised me completely, but in the end the answers were quite simple. I'm pretty baffled by the low score of this movie, since I found it quite unusual. If you liked the movie Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix, you will like this. There are no important special effects or sophisticated tricks here at all. It is about the plot, to build the characters and create an atmosphere. However, it is a film that, in the end, does not provide answers that could bother some people, but I thought the ending was excellent. I'm still not sure if the movie is based on a true story or not ...
