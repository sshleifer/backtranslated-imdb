A strange presentation to the screen of the tragic love story of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The Que family and the Capulet family have a prolonged hatred of each other, which often results in violence. Hatred has something to do with a movie company and the fact that everyone is crazy. In the midst of all this madness are Tromeo and Julieta, the most famous "crossed star" lovers of literature who fall in love at first sight and problems arise when they realize which family the other belongs to. <br /> <br /> The film follows the basic plot of the original work remarkably well and the key scenes even use the original lines or close to the original ones. But the infamous bizarreness of Troma permeates the film from beginning to end. That makes it a movie that definitely is not for everyone, but it's still quite inventive. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene. 7/10 <br /> <br /> There are many different versions edited and classified. Each one contains violence, blasphemy, drug use and sex, all with a large dose of bizarreness.
