This is one of those films that improve with every visualization. I saw it three times and, in fact, I registered in IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. The films "about food" have already been made, some of them are really good, like, for example, a certain Japanese comedy that fans of Asian cinema will know anyway. But this really is in its own league. At its core is a Protestant Christian parable that symbolizes the ideal of goodness, but, far from being dogmatic, it also addresses the "good" in each and every one of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof. There is an underestimation and generalized refinement in the Babette Festival, but this makes the message of the film, in any case, stronger, not at all weaker. If you can not attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by Babette, you are still welcome to this party of the soul. Highly recommended!
