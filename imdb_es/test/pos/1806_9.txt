The sweet and rich girl of Valley falls in love with a punk from the alley and when her kind friends disapprove, she is forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. The very funny romantic comedy combines elements of black comedy and the cheese of the 80s that make this even more fun to watch. The movie does not just follow the life of the girl from the valley and her punk; but their friends also when they buy, celebrate, hang out and go to the mall. If the dialogue does not make you laugh without stopping for a week, the music will do it. Songs like "Johnny, Are You Queer?" they are along. In addition, Elizabeth Daily is a fun and existential character, and the speech of Prom King & Queen at the end is very funny!
