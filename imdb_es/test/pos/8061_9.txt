I read "Anne Frank: a girl's diary" when I was in high school, and I found myself completely absorbed in her story, and also in the Broadway play of her life in the Secret Annex. <br /> <br /> However, I am a little perplexed about how people have perceived their diary and about her as a person, seeing her as a little saint or having a message of hope for the world. I do not think that was the original intention of his diary. She wrote it mostly for herself, although she did some rigorous rewriting before the Secret Annex occupants were betrayed, with the intention that it would someday be published. <br /> <br /> But I never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope ... but as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and very entertainingly in a diary. Undoubtedly, she was a very attractive writer and possessed an extraordinary talent to express herself fully in words. You really knew her well through her diary. But the importance of his diary lies in the fact that it is a testimony and an important historical document of the proof that the Holocaust occurred. <br /> <br /> She also brought the tragedy of the Holocaust home, to lose someone to whom we could put a familiar face and personality, at such an early age ... literally having had her young life ripped from her and of the other occupants who were killed in the Holocaust. It is a serious charge of the systematic murder by the Nazis of more than 6 million Jews, and that should not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> But I am sad that your journal is so misinterpreted as something more than that. When I look for hope, I have the Bible ... the first most read non-fiction book in the world. The words of God in the Bible are eternal ... but Anne's diary is a diary of a young woman in extraordinary circumstances, and that's it. She is not someone to adore or idolize, because she was a normal girl with many faults, she had an incredible talent as a writer and she died at 15 years of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. She was a victim of the Holocaust, and since this excellent documentary has given so vivid testimony, she was Hitler's most famous victim. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story of Anne Frank ... the stories of her family and friends. and the survivors of the Holocaust were fascinating, vivid and powerful. I especially enjoyed the testimony of Miep Gies, and I am amazed that she is still strong and alive today. The testimony of Hannah Goslar was also very interesting. And I also liked listening to Otto Frank. But I also agree that the moving image of the young woman with the dark hair and the big eyes known at the end was particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the Holocaust that I do not agree with the documentary ... is that I do not think it's just a question of discrimination ... but something deeper and deeper, and that It was just an act of pure evil. Pure evil. Nothing but pure evil. <br /> <br /> Excellent Anne Frank and Holocaust documentary that should be observed.
