THE POWER AND GLORY OF Preston Sturgis was not seen by the public for almost twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s, when it resurfaced and even appeared on television. Meanwhile, he had gained notoriety because Pauline Kael's CITIZEN KANE GUIDE had suggested that the screenplay by Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles for KANE was based on Sturgis' script here. As mentioned at the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb website, Kael exaggerated his case. <br /> <br /> There are about six narrators who take turns treating the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newscast (representing Ralston - the clone of Henry Luce), the memoirs of Thatcher, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond the butler. Everyone has their different inclination about Kane, which reflects their faith or disappointment or hatred towards man. And, of course, everyone also reveals their own flaws when they tell their side of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping repetitions of the same incident. <br /> <br /> This is not the situation in POWER AND GLORY. Yes, like KANE, it is a legendary business leader: here is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom up to be the head of the most successful rail system in the country. But there are only two narrators: they are Garner's right hand, Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the almost three-dimensional view we get in the time of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, talks about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public: she only sees the flaws in Henry. <br /> <br /> Typical example: although he made his way, Tom becomes more and more anti-worker in his later years. The unions are rioters, and he does not care that his scams are stopping him. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major neglect, and how he worried it to the detriment of his family life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used crusts and violence to end the strike (apparently exploding the Union's headquarters, killing many people). So we have two views of man, but one is pure white and the other is pure black. <br /> <br /> I really am not hitting POWER AND GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few films do, including all from other Orson Welles films), but I am aware that the story is presented as well enough to keep one's interest until the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the couple is taken home. <br /> <br /> When they get married, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and family the benefits he never had. But in America, the great commercial success has a cost. Tom is deeply involved with the administration of the railroad empire (he expands it and constantly improves it). But it takes him too far from home and loses contact with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the youngest woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally finds out about his unfaithful behavior, he destroys her. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Tom also receives a total shock (which makes him a martyr in Henry's eyes). Eve marries Tom and presents her a son, but turns out to be Eve's son by Tom's son, Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckoo causes Tom to shoot himself. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a total success, the action is sometimes not convincing. However, it makes the business look real (consider the scene in which Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to buy a small rival train line, and discusses the use of obligations to finance the plans). Sturgis came from a rich environment, so I could provide this kind of detail. So in general it is a first level movie. It may not be CITIZEN KANE, but it is of interest to film lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary on Depression America.
