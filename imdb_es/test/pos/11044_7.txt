'Anne Christie' was the 14th film of Garbo and the first one in which his gruff and Swedish voice was heard. She plays the main character, Anna, who has struggled to be abandoned by her father Chris (the owner of a drunken barge played by George F Marion), and for the disgrace of life she has to take to keep her head above water . br /> <br /> The Irishman Matt (Charles Bickford) can mark the turning point for her ... or not? Garbo looks and sounds very good in this drama that, although it seems quite clumsy and moves at a slow pace, still manages to attract and attract an audience almost 80 years later. Marie Dressler has an impact on the role that gave her a second wave of film hits in films like Min and Bill, Dinner at Eight and Emma; while Marion and Bickford are more than adequate. <br /> <br /> An interesting part of the film's history. Garbo would do better interviews in the following years, but "Anna Christie" will always be remembered for the first time when she spoke on the screen.
