Impeccable writing and brilliant acting make this plot, ingeniously charming and witty, one of the best American films I've seen this year. The excellent casting and the cynical direction of Neil Labute prevent this film from becoming too sentimental, while the authentic performances of Ren√©e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney give crazed and brazen presentations. The best parody of telenovelas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.
