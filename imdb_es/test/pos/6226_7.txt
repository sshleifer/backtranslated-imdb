Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror film from the late 70s, about a group of young friends who are stranded on an old and deserted road by an old wax museum. <br /> <br /> The owner of The Museum looks like a strange but harmless old man, but things take a very nasty turn when the members of the young group begin to die, who is responsible for the murders, is it old Slausen? or is your collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood !!!! This movie was good, it was fast, the performances were very good from the actors / actresses (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the movie was never boring, and as I said, it had some very spooky scenes, so be prepared to hide under sheets! Definitely recommended for fans of the horror movie / ghost story! I give this movie a respectable 7.2 out of 10.
