Emilio is a successful businessman, a perfect father and a good husband. Or that's what everyone thinks. The perfect story that you have carefully constructed over these years will begin to close around you suddenly. Can he keep up with his own lies? <br /> <br /> This is a very well structured drama, with a great performance and a stable direction. Even though the plot is pushed to the limit to increase tension, the film explores some of our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we are dealing with? Can we be so sure? <br /> <br /> The story unfolds at a faster and faster pace as it reaches the point where Emilio is no longer in control of his lies. A good amount of films in Spanish have interesting stories, but they are far from the technical competence. The perfect rhythm and the well filmed scenes make the actors so believable, we get inside Emilio and we hate him, and we suffer for him, as his situation becomes increasingly desperate. There is no need for Spanish folklore, nor is it an attempt to create a Hollywood-style film. This is the real Spain, 2002, and, despite the obvious lack of suitability of Emilio's life in reality, there are many possibilities that someone we know is not like the person he claims to be. Not only is it a great commercial product, it will allow you to wonder where the lies can go. We can continue? <br /> <br /> Well done.
