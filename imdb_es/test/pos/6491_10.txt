For free, from one scene to another, from one story to another, like when we walk, from a dark path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from one tree to another, how many different sounds? Just like when they travel, people meet and tell their stories and then they separate forever, who knows? And just as walking through these places filled with the lost expectations of another era, the human "thickness" of the world takes your breath away. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with my friends, not all of them. They liked it, maybe they were too used to scenario-based stories and ready to use, I do not know. So this movie is for fools who love to watch the sun shining in the sea, walk slowly in the hills or in small towns, listening to the growing grass, which tells the stories of those below, six feet below. In the warm summer wind.
