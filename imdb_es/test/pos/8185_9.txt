Chen Kaige gives us a magnificent depth of atmosphere. Yes, it is a 'period piece', but the artistic use of Chen's images makes it something more. Actors often behave like players using the stylized diction, postures and facial expressions of the Peking Opera. All the actors in a scene play on the 'back wall', even when they are heading between them. They are like spirits of the past that enunciate with a powerful clarity a story with an urgent meaning for those in the present. Combined with a great attention to scale and a masterful cinematography in interiors and exteriors, "Jing ke ci qin wang" is an amazing story told with great reverence in its own language that captivates completely.
