This is NOT the history of the police that develops in the place where the characters were secondary to the battles of arms and car chases. So far, the episodes are more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something with a lot of Rambo style police history, you will not find it here. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 9. I want this series to live for a long time. Morse is excellent!
