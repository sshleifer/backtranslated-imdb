My choir of Saint Lucia was chosen to be in this movie. All 100 more. When it was time to film the movie, they asked me to choose only 10. Oh, my God. We had a little girl who went early so that her tonsils would come out because she wanted to be in the movie. The elections were difficult to do. The people of Georgetown are just as lovely as the people they show in the movie. Funny, kind, believers. The city sponsors an annual Christmas market the first two weekends of December of each year. I was there this year and it was wonderful. The town is charming and the people work hard to make it magical. The city appears today as it did when the movie was made. There is a lot of credit for the Historical Society that works hard to maintain historical value. The principal of the school that has become a charter school received an award from the Governor of Colorado for volunteers.
