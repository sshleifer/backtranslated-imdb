I watch the show every day and it's very entertaining. It provides technology news updates, almost all geek video games. They are also the official stations of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or something really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely improved their game since the review of the guy under me (2006). It's the only place where I get my technical information. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work wonderfully with each other and the show always has segments that refer to things from the game, the movie, the comic ... Universe. If you know those universes you will understand the jokes. In a nutshell, aots is a hilarious show that gives me and all the news about anything and everything that matters to you. I'm seeing it now as I write this, they're 'in' San Diego covering the Red Bull air races. Sweet.
