It is a pity that this movie has not been played more in theaters. It's a rich and textured love story with believable, too human characters, who are too busy playing and protecting their hearts to recognize The Real Thing when they experience it. One of the most pleasing aspects of this film is its location in Chicago, among middle-class, artistic, literate and middle-class African Americans who talk about poetry, music and literature. Another is his Royal Fineness, Larenz Tate, and if you're a fan of him, you NEED to watch this movie! His arrogance and youthful vulnerability are perfect for the role of Darius. Nia Long also shines like Nina, who longs to tell Darius that she loves him, but fears that "the Rules" will be broken. A great movie to watch cuddled on the couch with your partner!
