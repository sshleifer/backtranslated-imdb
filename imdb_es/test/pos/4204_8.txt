I did not expect much from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it and found it to be the most remarkable. His notoriety is mainly due to the talent and attractiveness of his star, John Garfield. <br /> <br /> Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is locked up for murder. He must go to the race, and ends in the clubs with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here an opportunity for redemption is offered, however, will the past reach it? Garfield was an actor ahead of his teammates. Before the term 'Method' was even coined and before Brando shouted 'Stella!' He brings 'natural' to the screen. His earthly quality and incredible acting talent dominate this production. It is also interesting that his role here as a boxer has nuances of that role of 'Golden Boy' that he so much wanted to covet on the screen. Garfield looks like the guy and goes the distance as a boxer, proving that his performance is worth it. <br /> <br /> Ann Sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as Jackie's girl, Goldie. I've never thought much about Sheridan, but I liked it here. She plays well outside of Garfield. Dickson's performance is a little tired and he does not share good chemistry with Garfield. The Dead End Kids are here, and Garfield seems to be his natural idol (even more than Cagney). Claude Rains is a mess, and he looks uncomfortable on paper in many scenes. Strange, as always was such a reliable actor. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that the director, Busby Berkeley, best known for his early musicals with ballerinas and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable facilitation. It maintains a great admirable atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A very good movie that deserves more attention 8/10.
