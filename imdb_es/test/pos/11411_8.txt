The film is about a girl who does not go to a bonfire just because she is taking care of the children that night. Nothing unusual about that, right? Until ... the phone rings. Until ... The phone rings again. And again ... And again. Those are not some stupid jokes. This is true. If you want to see how the girl reacts, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Great atmosphere full of terrifying sounds. Very well played by the young Camilla Belle who got the lead role. I see in her a great potential to become a good actress. This is more than just a decent thriller, I have no idea why it's so underrated. Anyway, in my opinion this movie deserves more than just 4/10. 24% of all voters rated the movie with 1. Be serious, people. You could not get a better thriller for a title like this.
