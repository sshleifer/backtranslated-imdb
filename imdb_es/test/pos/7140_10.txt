this is more than a Sat. Special afternoon Very well written, if the password is very low, there is a lot here if you look for it. Catch the companion cat / explorer, for example. Not only could it have been a comic book, it should have been a comic book. The comic industry (as well as movie advertisers) missed the boat in this. One of the least known really great movies. A great script by John Sayles is a strong point, but the acting is also good. Probably the best "superhero" movie I've seen in my life. Short on special effects but long on credibility. This is a guardian. I have never seen a DVD of this movie, but I used to own a VHS version. Good hunting
