The previous profile was written by me when I used the nick of OldWereWolf56, which is still my email address. I still believe that the character of Andy Devine in Frisky is the best episode of Twilight Zone and I see it at least once a year, since I consider Frisby a lucky man, since he has many friends who love him a lot. <br /> <br /> In case many of you are too young to remember, I am 61 years old, Andy Devine was the host of an entertainment program for children in the 50s that I think is called Andy Gang. In it he had three assistants: a cat named Midnight who played the violin, a mouse named Squeaky who played a hand organ and a diabolic toad named Froggy who could appear and disappear and would embarrass many of Andy's guest stars like Billy Gilbert.
