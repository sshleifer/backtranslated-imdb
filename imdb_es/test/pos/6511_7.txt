If you like silly comedies like Airplane, you will love this movie. It is definitely in the style of Airplane and Scary Movie. A funny movie! It has the most strange cast of characters in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are amazing, but I think they're supposed to be since it's a silly comedy. Apparently there are two versions of the film, one in Blockbuster and another in the official website: MissCastaway.com. The one on the website seems to be a preliminary release version signed by the director. There is also some fun behind the material filmed in Neverland with Michael Jackson. The movie was filmed in 2003 and says it's PG rated as fun in the box.
