Do not let any criticism (criticism, IMDb users or mine) influence you when watching this movie. I only read the premise of the plot and it intrigued me. After watching this movie, in my opinion, it's definitely worth seeing. It gives a perspective on life that many have probably not contemplated. However, it is not, as Leland himself says, a film that "can be wrapped in a clean package with a bow and everything". Other comments from users on this website claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not feasible. Obviously, they lost all the point of the movie, which is disappointing. To say the least. <br /> <br /> In short, it is a well-acted and well-directed film. The story is not good, but I feel that if you do not get away from the movie you feel good, you may have missed something. In my opinion, characterizing it as an "art house" is unfair, but since our society likes labels, this is probably the one that fits. If you find that you know everything there is to know about the world ... I would suggest you skip this one. If you think that movies should be a way of escape "from the world" ... you will not find them here. But if you see it ... you may find something in yourself.
