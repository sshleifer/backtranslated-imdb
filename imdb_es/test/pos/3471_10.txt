I think the lady in the store where I hired him recommended this movie to me. For once she was hit! What an excellent movie! First of all, he was convinced that James McAvoy and Romola Garai were Irish, so compelling were their accents; and in the middle of the movie, I was completely convinced that Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and quite sure that James McAvoy was also a disabled actor. When I saw the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their "normal" form, to say that I was impressed would be an understatement. I can remember all the praise that Dustin Hoffmann got in the '80s for his interpretation of autism in the movie' Rain Man '(frankly (in my opinion, of course) .The interpretation / interpretation of Steven Robertson makes Dustin Hoffmann come out of the water. and it deserves recognition as such !! In short, one of the best representations of friendship / love / human relationships in history, and it was made in Great Britain / Ireland with local actors.Hold it in the pipe and smoke it in Hollywood!
