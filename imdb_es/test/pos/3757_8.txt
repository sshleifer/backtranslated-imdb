I love this movie and I've seen it many times. I recorded it around 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four, but my tape is very worn and I would love to have a new copy. I sent an email to Film Four asking him to show it again because it has never been available. video and as far as I know it has not been repeated since the 80's. I have not had an answer and it has not been repeated yet. The performances are excellent. The movie has it all. It's fun, sad, disturbing, exciting and it takes you back to school. It is extremely good and it catches you from start to finish. The scene in the bathroom is particularly horrible. Nor can I listen to the song Badge by Cream and not think about this movie. This movie deserves to be seen by a much larger audience, since it is excellent. Channel four, please, show again or release on video or DVD.
