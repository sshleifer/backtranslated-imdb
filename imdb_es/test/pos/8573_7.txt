If you saw this movie because of the nudity (as I did) you will not be disappointed. However, I could have done it without the clumsy thieves or the bear. It could have shown some bottomless nudity, but for what it was, I think H.O.T.S. It has to be the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> It's not the kind of movie that could have been made today, which is a shame because it's the kind of movie worth watching these days. <br /> <br /> I would take nonsense nonsense about fundamental plot points any day. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that the DVD has no extras, but since they did not have DVDs when this was filmed it is understandable. I would have liked to know more about the shooting of the film, especially when they shot the football game at the end.
