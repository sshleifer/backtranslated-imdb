Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is about to get married. Then, one of his former students wins an Oscar for a movie in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks Howard in his acceptance speech, and considers him as gay too! This film follows the consequences as journalists descend to the village of Howard and he tries to convince everyone that he is heterosexual. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, he has very funny moments and always makes me feel very good with a huge smile on my face. Consequently, it is a movie that I enjoy watching as often as possible. If you have not seen it, you're missing it!
