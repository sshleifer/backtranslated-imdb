I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was fortunate to meet Martin Sheen outside the Civic Auditorium of Santa Monica one night in 1981, while waiting for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the compliments I shared with him for this work of art, especially his interpretation of the young captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of the history of American cinema. "Charlie does not surf." The famous line of Robert Duvall (the other) does not need to be repeated, since it has become an often repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will be long remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition. It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.
