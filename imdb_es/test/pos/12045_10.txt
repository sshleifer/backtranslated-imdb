Watch this movie just to see Shahrukh Khan say "I love you, K-k-Kiran ..." It's both heartbreaking and scary when he says this, from start to finish. This movie made him famous, and I totally recommend it: D It's very entertaining, the music is perverse and you'll laugh with Shahrukh here ... You'll really feel scared by the hero and the heroine and, oddly enough, you'll identify yourself. At least one of the characters. You will feel sad and happy, relieved and scared at the same time. Go see this classic Bollywood movie with your good friends and some lovely food and spend a day. And after watching the movie, have the songs and the stage in your mind ... forever.
