If you like suspense, this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina plays a mute increases her misfortune and increases the suspense. The appearance of Alec Guiness was nice, but it really was not added to the movie. I'm not sure if the part of Evan Richard like Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to be just a clumsy idiot. I thought that the cinematography was excellent. This added not only to the quality of the production but also to the suspense. The bathtub seen with the drops of water in slow motion was wonderful. Also the scene in which the knife falls and then changes Andy Clarke cutting a piece of extremely rare meat was very well made. I would call it in general good entertainment
