Episode No. thirteen of the fantasists (excuse the incredibly gay terminology) The television series "Supernatural" takes Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri, where an old flame from Dean has called them to investigate a series of mysterious murders that occur in their little city. . It turns out that a large pickup truck with an invisible driver is passing through African Americans on a desolate road ... While Dean tries to rekindle his past love story, more people in the city present themselves as highway robbers. The cause seems to be due to a racial incident that happened in the 60s, which caused a frustrated lazy spirit to remain in the ghostly limbo, seeking to kill the black motorists. "Route 666" is another good installment (which is not infrequent, I've noticed) that contains some notable aspects related to the couple of main characters, such as Dean having sex and Sam's repentance for having dropped out of college ... The killer truck does not present itself as the most terrifying thing in the world, however, for a one-hour show, it works well. It is not a fantastic episode, but a solid concept with more references to horror films.
