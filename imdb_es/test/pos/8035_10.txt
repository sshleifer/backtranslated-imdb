This is probably one of the best thrillers I've seen. It has action, but not this kind of bullet, good guys, bad guys, van damme, stalled action, but fast action, realistic and nervous, has a plot, until the end of the movie you do not know. this is going to end, it has characters, aidan quinn, donald sutherland and ben kingsley are just perfect, and has suspense, this movie will not let you go before you've seen the end. <br /> <br /> Although there are only a few characters, it was not hard for me to keep my attention on the story, and as for the story, it's basic (not too hard for the clan, but simple and raw) and realistic . <br /> <br /> If a movie with a good story, some action and a great performance awaits you, look at this and I promise, you will not leave until you've seen the end. The end of everything.
