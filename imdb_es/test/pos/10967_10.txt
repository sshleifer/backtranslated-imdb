John Cassavette decided as his first film, obviously as a once in New York, not even have a script with dialogue, and offers a feature equivalent to that of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm in 1959: all actors know what to do and say even have the right look in their eyes when they speak. In other words, it is one of the most realistic looks of the rhythm generation, with a sweet voice in its score and telling a story of racial tensions. A group of black siblings is the focal point, one tries to get better concerts than the average strip club, and has a sister, much clearer than him, who becomes entangled with a white man in a relationship, which breaks both sides. The movie, however, is not exclusively about that; Cassavettes likes his characters touring New York City (which many films did not do in 1959/1960) and his narrative style is like that of improvisational jazz artists of the time. Dated, no doubt, but it's worth taking a look at moviegoers; Martin Scorsese named him one of his heaviest influences.
