Here is one of the Jane Austen films that I found very charming. First I read the book, then I heard it on a CD and I was captivated by how a young Victorian girl could be persuaded not to marry the man she loved because of her lack of fortune or education. The joy of knowing that Anne is evidently reunited with a lost love. The fact that her godmother tries to marry her to a good cousin for nothing, who only seeks money. Observing the snobbery that comes from the upper classes and how class distinctions can divide couples to follow their hearts. Captain Wentworth realizes that he still loves Anne after seven years. Her final understanding that Anne's love was constant throughout that time and that she was not going to allow her family to interfere with her true happiness and her eventual marriage to someone she truly loved.
