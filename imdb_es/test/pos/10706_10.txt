A brilliant documentary about how a small group of young idealists have used music, art and dance to unify and heal the community of Vigario Geral, one of the most violent slums in Rio ("favela" means neighborhood in Portuguese) , which offers Young people a positive alternative to the lethal world of narcotics traffickers of drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> In his film debut, Zimbalist and Mochary created an impressive film because it works on many different levels. As a social document, it provides the facts we need to know in order to have a context to understand the meaning of the particular story that is told here. The story itself is well developed, with a strong narrative arc and, to a greater extent, it is full of suspense. Anderson Sa is a striking and charismatic central protagonist: he is an intelligent, articulate, courageous, spiritually evolved natural leader, a talented artist, a visionary who speaks in his conversation. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of music and dancing. to entertain Are there talking heads? mainly Sa and his closest partner, Jos√© Junior, but they present themselves with an imaginative kinematic brightness. The edition perfectly combines the images of different themes, punctuated only occasionally by a few static texts full of facts. The rhythm is as alive as the music. A lot is achieved in 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> Afro Reggae Group, the social club of the neighborhood that Anderson, Junior and some others formed in 1993, deploy music and dance as weapons to confront drug traffickers. And the police duplicated. They teach percussion skills to any child who wants to join a class, along with dance, martial arts, a community newspaper. The only requirement for children to belong is not to smoke, not to drink, not to use drugs. There is a subtle and soft spiritual fabric that runs through the movement, based loosely on the Hindu god Shiva, the destroyer of old habits. <br /> <br /> Jeff Zimbalist, who was also the director of photography and editor, is a student of modern culture and media at Brown University. He polished his chops by editing documentaries for PBS and others, and teaches film at the New York Film Academy and elsewhere. Matt Mochary, like Andrew Jarecki ("Capturing the Friedmans") a few years ago, came to the cinema of the business world. <br /> <br /> Zimbalist and Mochary won the award for the best new filmmakers in 2005. The TribBeCa Film Festival and "Favela Rising" were tied for the best film of the year in prizes awarded in 2005 by the International Documentary Association. I could follow the pages about Afro Reggae, Sa and this movie. A better idea is simply to go see it! My note: A 10/10
