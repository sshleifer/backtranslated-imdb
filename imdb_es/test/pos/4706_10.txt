The first time I heard about this movie was when I saw a preview before another movie. I was intrigued, but I could not see it before the short run in theaters was over. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy movie to watch several times. There is a lot of violence inflicted on unarmed civilians. There are lessons to learn here. One of Patricia Arquette's lines summarizes. "For Americans, if it did not happen on TV, it just did not happen." There is a lot of truth in that. <br /> <br /> Another is that at some point she thinks that only because she announces that she is a US citizen that the soldiers will separate and let her through. It does not work that way. <br /> <br /> The landscape is beautiful. The acting is all decent. The teacher is especially good. Mainly although I am interested in these characters. Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are fine, but their appearance is short, so they do not matter much. Patricia has guts. In the hands of a minor actor, this could have gone very wrong. As it is about loving or hating the film, it must still come out with the idea that there are still military dictatorships in the world in this century, and until one of our people gets hurt, we will ignore their oppression. <br /> <br /> Aung San Suu Kyi, is the female political leader in the film. In real life he won the Nobel Peace Prize. She was recently released from house arrest. The Bush administration, from the date I write this, is trying to pressure the military government to enter into talks with it and to re-form the government. The Burmize government was under such scrutiny that it changed the name of the country to the Maynamar Republic. The US government UU You still have to recognize the new name. <br /> <br /> If you do not show a message on your movie, do not watch this one. If you do not mind a little education with your entertainment, then that's fine.
