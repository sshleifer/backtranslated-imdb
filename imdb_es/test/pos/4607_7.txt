The best thing, and that's pretty good, about The Black Castle is that it's a Gothic grabber from the 1940s in black and white that has a crazed assassin that was made in some way in 1952. The star is apparently the British actor Richard Greene a capable leader that reminds me of an earlier version of Roger Moore. The villain is a mad earl played by Stephen McNally, who does a credible job, except when he is called to laugh maniacally. Hiding in the shadows is Boris Karloff, long dressed, in a decidedly secondary role of an elderly doctor who may or may not be the salvation of our hero. <br /> <br /> It's mid-18th century in Austria and Sir Ronald Burton (Greene) is determined to find out what happened to two close friends. They disappeared in the vicinity of the castle belonging to Count Karl von Bruno (McNally), deep in the Black Forest. It seems that Sir Ronald and his friends had been instrumental in defeating a brutal plan by von Bruno in Africa three years earlier related to slavery and ivory. The Count was left not only with the failure, but also with a scar on his face and a black patch that he now uses to cover an eye in ruins. von Bruno swore revenge, and it seems that he may have had partial success. Then, under a false name, Sir Ronald organizes an invitation to hunt the Count, and we go on a dark trip of storm and wolves howling to the castle of the Count. It is a huge mass of turrets and stone corridors, gloomy stairs, huge chimneys ... and chilling passages that lead to damp dungeons, a torture chamber and a large well full of crocodiles. It is also full of the charming, blonde and sensitive wife of the Count, Elga (Paula Corday, who is sometimes called Rita Corday), and of the two intimate friends of the Count played by the two actors we know from the fifties who specialized in being limo. In costume, John Hoyt and Michael Ansara. There is a dangerous leopard hunt, forbidden kisses, raised with knuckles, wooden signals that creak and sway in the cold wind and poison in a cup. Not least, Dr. Meissen (Karloff) has a special vial filled with a medication that will slow down bodily functions and appear to have died. The risk is that ... well, when the person wakes up ten hours later, it's better to wait until he's still not nailed to his coffin. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for all the clich√©s, The Black Castle continues to move forward happily. The film takes itself seriously, but it is sufficiently made to maintain our interest, even if we end up sitting with a smile while we watch. It is even reassuring to realize that there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game. When Burton realizes how crazy Von Bruno is, he becomes even more determined to bring Von Bruno to the accounts. And, naturally, he has fallen in love with Elga. von Bruno, maddened by revenge, but cunning and capable, is a man who loves hunting and is immersed in death. The second creative rule of Hollywood has always been: "If you're going to steal, steal the best". The first creative rule, of course, is "If you're going to steal, steal the best and then turn it into a liver burst." The black castle is a good bite of Austrian braunschweiger.
