Each word of praise fell short of the height of this movie. This movie is the true example of what a psychological horror movie should look like. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be a bit confusing at first glance, but it will definitely explain a little bit about what is going on and you really want to see it a second time. But after the second visualization, you will begin to unite the pieces and then you will know how amazing a film can be. <br /> <br /> A tip for flick slasher fans to stay away from this movie. This is not your teen movie, in which you simply turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen to see big b ** bs and a lot of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want, increase the psychological terror factor of this movie and then watch it all with an excellent home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your rude friends joking a really tense situation. And do not forget to turn off the light. <br /> <br /> My points in different aspects: - <br /> <br /> Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total = 9/10
