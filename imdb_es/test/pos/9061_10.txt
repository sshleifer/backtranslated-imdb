With whom could suicide be treated in a way that is palpable to all? I saw the movie in SXSW at its premiere and it turned out to be the best movie of all. Yes, it is crooked and strange, but it makes sense in the world created by the filmmaker (Michael Parness). If you did not laugh (most of them did), then you do not understand it and that is a shame. Particularly notable, Guillermo DÃ­az since Hector steals a lot of scenes and the chemistry between Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz is intense. The film reminds Harold and Maude, but not really, it takes a strange turn after another, and they all make sense in this crazy and crazy world in which we all live. I stayed (like most) for the questions and answers. later, and what was great was to hear that the same things that I thought in my mind as to why things "happened" are the reasons why they happened. I do not think you can say much about the movie, unless you have not understood it. I think I understood it and it seemed like most of the others too. The film is dubbed a suicide comedy, but it has a lot of heart, lots of laughter and offers a lot of hope, but it does not get scared of the horrors of suicide as well. A nice little movie that should receive attention when a release is launched, which is expected to be sooner rather than later.
