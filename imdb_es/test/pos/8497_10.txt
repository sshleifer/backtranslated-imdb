In the first place, it is a joy to hear the legend interpret such wonderful and timeless music. This film and soundtrack is a tour de force. Ray Charles is unique and surprising. I really loved the movie because it was inspiring and entertaining in everything. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx has become one of the main actors in Hollywood as clearly shown in Ray and should get an Oscar for this role, unprecedented. In fact, everyone who worked on this film should receive praise. I really liked Kerry Washington, who played the exceptional wife ... Ray Charles obviously married well. Regina King is a good actress, as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren, who plays a young mother with problems. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, I would say that this whole project was organized in a providential way. The entire cast was perfect, excellent script and impressive adjustments ... important support for director Taylor Hackford and his team for doing such a splendid job to bring Ray Charles' life to the screen impeccably. This is my photo of the year, without doubt one of the best biographical films ever made.
