Ronald Coleman had been a screen star for several years when talkies arrived, and it was a big boost for his career. His accent in Oxford English is so fascinating that he could hear him recite the farmer's almanac and not get bored. <br /> <br /> Coleman plays Willie Hale, a 30-year-old playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time womanizing and gambling. However, he is a nice rogue, not only pleasant from the point of view of the audience but also by family and friends.

He has a behavior similar to Errol Flynn, but he can not show Flynn's physical agility due to a disabling injury he received during World War I. However, what he lacks in the physical agility that Coleman always invented in the agility of the soul. Loretta Young, only 17 when this photo was taken, shows the beginning of her brand, sweet girl, who can explode in a fireball when the occasion demands it. Myrna Loy plays Willie's girl from the past, Mary Crayle, a dancer. Here, Myrna still has a part similar to the parts of exotic vampires with which she stayed stuck in Warner Brothers when she was a player hired from 1926 until shortly before this film was made in 1930. <br /> <br /> This is practically a light and windy romantic comedy from start to finish. If you're in the mood for the kind of escapist entertainment that lit up the hearts of audiences during the Great Depression, this little movie fits perfectly.
