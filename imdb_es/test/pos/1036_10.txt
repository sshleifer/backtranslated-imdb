Absolutely the best I've seen on TV. It was entertaining and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to discover how I can see it again. <br /> <br /> In light of the current understanding of history, we have to sympathize with General Leslie Groves, responsible for the nuts. And the bolts to run the Manhattan Project. Certainly, he was not as paranoid about security as most of those who thought in the past. <br /> <br /> The casting for the real-life people portrayed was outstanding. It was the first time I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor. Except for the height, he looked a lot like Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The initial scene in which Oppenheimer is leading a class of graduate students was especially interesting for me.
