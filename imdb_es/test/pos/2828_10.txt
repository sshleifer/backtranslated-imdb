The film did not have any help, as regards the promotion: if there was an advertising promotion on television or radio, I did not see / hear it. The only advertisement in the newspaper that I saw was the opening weekend: a dirty and muddy black and white photo of Andy as Val-Com, behind the bars of the jail, with the headline: "I WANT! Robot Let it escape! " (which was also the poster in front of the 3 cinemas, I saw it in NO, the color poster of this site, with shots at the head of the whole cast and a Crimebuster caricature, which really was not SO good) -They had OCCURRED having used an action scene from the film itself - did not they have a start-up photographer? A poster is supposed to HELP a potential audience to decide if they want to SEE the movie - there are MANY people who could not. I did not go into their exhausted choice, and I wanted to know what Heartbeps was about, and that poster did not help! That lackluster picture and the only photos that were given to the papers were so indistinguishable in B & W that they were worthless.) There was no trailer for the movie: just a slide in a theater, which consists of the word "Heartbeps" inside of a heart shape, with an arrow of Cupid through it, and another that was a totally black image: only Andy and Bernadette's voices saying "Val-Com! My pleasure center is working badly!" "So it's mine, do you think we should tell our owners?" THAT is not a help for people who had not been aware of the movie. <br /> <br /> During the filming, Andy told reporters that he could not eat, once they applied their plastic lips, so they would "charge up at breakfast, and fast" during the filming of the day . I do not know WHAT Bernadette did: but at that moment, I was wondering why they not only drank protein drinks with long straws, or ate astronaut puree through tubes. <br /> <br /> Phil-Co, the baby robot, seemed to have been the Johnny-Five pre-cursor of Short Circuit, with the same eyes and similar face. I've been trying to find out if they had the same designer, but it does not help. I have period magazine articles about the film, and the design team was immensely proud of their work, and they were looking for a special award for their innovative device to create odorless "smoke" for Catskill cigars. Shortly after, LucasFilm did NOT use that device, although he SHOULD have, for the scenes of the Return of the Jedi with Jabba the Hut: a man created "steam" around Jabba, blowing cigar smoke in a tube, joking that everything he needed was A glass of brandy, and he would be a happy man. I thought that the use of real tobacco products by Lucas Filme was insensitive to people who were upset by the smoke. <br /> <br /> John Williams, who had recently been successful in the late and great Arthur Fielder as the master of the Boston Pops (which was THEN a rating hit, but never recovered from the death of Fielder, and now he is a shadow of his former glory), he was using the program to promote movies with which he provided the music. He had released the score for "The Empire Strikes Back" there; And would you think that he would have helped Heartbeps along some numbers? The only thing critics liked about this movie was Williams' score, but it was NOT available for purchase! I saw a vinyl album, in 1982, with half of Heartbeps, half of another movie, but it disappeared. Only tonight I saw the CD listed on THIS site, and I asked for it. If I can ever get a scanner, and the time to write the articles, I would like to create a tribute site to Heartbeeps. I liked the movie, and I do not care what the dissidents say. <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie was that, almost in the end, it was messy, logically: the robots fled the factory to have the freedom to decide their own destiny, make their own choices however, when the owners of the scrap yards tell them that Phil must go to the factory, to have a "purpose" programmed into him, they do not even question it; They only look at each other in a meaningful way, and leave. On the way, each of the adults loses battery power and "dies". They are not REALLY dead, since they are robots, and they only need new batteries, however, they are treated as "death", with little Phil crying over them and rolling. So, what was the POINT of this? Phil never returns to the factory and gets "a purpose!" And, of course, the owners of the scrap yards COULD have driven them, or given them all the battery recharges, with backup batteries; But the real point was to have this touching scene, where all the robots were worn out and Phil had to cry. <br /> <br /> In the end, Val-Com is a golf instructor, and Aqua-Com is - I'm not sure what. Catskill is an ANIMATOR: what else is supposed to be EL? I'm not sure they made it clear. The owners of the junkyards seem to take it easy, lying on the lounge chairs, drinking Phil's lemonade, their "bartender". The new "daughter" of Val and Aqua, Philsia, I think the name is, maybe it's Sylvania, it does not seem to be much more than a table lamp. <br /> <br /> Missing images, which is sad: from the photos I guess the missing things include a sweet scene, where Phil is celebrating a Christmas, with Val giving him the steering wheel of a car; Aqua is supplying a horn; Catskill has taken the fireman's helmet to give it to Phil, as we saw; and they have Christmas trees. I do not know if any of the missing images provide a better logic, or if the writers could not think of a better crisis / resolution. The film was cut to 72-75 minutes, to match it with other films that failed. There is no other reason than that. For a DVD, I would love to be in the creation, since I want to see interviews with the cast / crew and John Williams, and the interview with Merv Griffin. The taking of archival material; and reedit and restore the missing images to improve them.
