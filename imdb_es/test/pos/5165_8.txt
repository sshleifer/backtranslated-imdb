I've already seen side effects of cartoons like The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes and most of them are great. <br /> <br /> When I saw the pilot All Grown Up in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see what the Rugrats would look like in their pre-teens / teenagers and it contained things that normally happened during that time in life, like going to a concert, go to school and be on land. <br /> <br /> The actual TV show is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica is not punished as much as she did in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie are punished in this series. <br /> <br /> I have also noticed references to Rugrats in this series and even flashbacks of how the Rugrats looked in the original series. Actually, they talk to adults in this program because they are 10 years older. <br /> <br /> This program is aimed at an audience a little older than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original program may like this.
