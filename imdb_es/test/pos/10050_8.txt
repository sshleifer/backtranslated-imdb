The legend of Custer, to the Warner Brothers Epic. Here there is no cast against the type, with the extravagant Flynn as the extravagant Custer in this touching tribute, not only to Custer, but to the men of the Seventh Cavalry. The story goes through the life of the famous 'Boy General', from his turbulent days at West Point to his last fight at Little Big Horn. Here they take great liberties with facts, and they present us with a Custer that is much more understanding with the difficult situation of the red man that is related to history. But this is done on such a large scale, only the scenes of the battle provided employment for every extra in Hollywood. The end of the battle and all that is very funny!
