She's The Man was everything I wanted and maybe even a little more. I love teen-type "chick flick" movies and I knew this would be great. In the same sense as 10 Things I Hate About You (one of my favorite of all time) She's The Man is a unique comedy, well written, very well interpreted with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy I've seen in long time. . It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther). But She's The Man is actually more fun and intellectual and most of the humor is based on the ingenious script of the story "Three's Company" of wrong Identities, mixed messages and the cast. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a star! Even since the days of the horribly rural (though strangely entertaining "The Amanda Show", she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy, she is probably one of the most talented comedians in the world.) Her style of physical comedy, personification and witty dialect makes , her big-screen debut (where she was the star) was the rather funny and well-made "What A Girl Wants." If that was not her escape vehicle, She's The Man takes care of that, Bynes is really the best Next door, it's a shame that she does not do more work on the big screen because it could be the next "It." She is the American, pretty, realistic, bubbly teenager (although she is now twenty) and will be able to transferring her talent and style to being an adult actress, it will be visible, but for the purpose of this film, she is perfect! Actually, she legitimately achieves the rather extravagant plot of She becomes roast for his twin brother and makes him credible. Not at all ... but credible enough. Most of the script is based on the comedy of his mistakes trying to be a man, but it's just funny, non-stop laughter. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's "Havoc," played by Duke. He is the athlete, the captain of the football team and, finally, the object of affection of Bynes. Unfortunately, he is also Sebastian's roommate (which is Bynes). He is a good leader, and the chemistry is perfect among them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who is attracted to Sebastian (who is also Bynes). He also does well, although his part is small and does not affect the rest of the cast in one way or another. James Kirk is great in his small role as the real Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is amazing ... they are absolutely believable as twins and more so, from a distance, you could understand someone believing that Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast fits somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supportive, but essentially all support the story between Bynes and Tatum, but all more or less support the excellent performance of Bynes. She easily transports the film without hesitation and makes it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that shows up so much in the trailer, and yet it's not one of those movies that when that part shows up is no longer funny. The parts in the trailer that make you Laugh are even more fun in the real movie. The relatively new director, Andy Fickman, does an incredible job in this movie. He weaves a potentially complicated plot, makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall. The story, which is vaguely based on Shakespeares Twelfth Night but it is remarkable how much they managed to translate to this modern movie. Apparently it's completely out of place, but it's more accurate for classic comedy than you think. There is not much to say about a drawback, except that the last half hour is prolonged a bit and also becomes predictable, but does not change the hilarity of the first half of the film. However, you'll laugh to tears and it's one of the funniest movies in movies right now. 9/10
