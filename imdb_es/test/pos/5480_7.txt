A murder thriller in the mold of Day Of The Jackal, In The Line Of Fire has the additional touch that Eastwood's bodyguard, Frank Horrigan, is concerned about the failure of the past at work. Persecution becomes personal when the reptilian murderer of John Malkovich Leary mocks him for this neurosis, with the rather clumsy exception of the love of a good woman (Lilly Raines de Russo) nothing will reassure Frank's mind that appease Leary personally. > <br /> Malkovich is a volatile presence; It is not simply fuel on the screen, but often it is also a changing actor. This is one of his good films, focused and in the game of director Petersen. Eastwood is too old but a) the audience does not care, because it is him and b) his age is written in the script, not only in the narrative but also as a recurring joke. Quite as you expected but well managed. 7/10
