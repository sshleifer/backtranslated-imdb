This wonderful 3 part production of the BBC is one of the sweetest love stories I have seen in a long time. The actresses show a very high level of talent, especially Rachael Stirling as Nan Astley. She is funny, seductive and cute. The scenes of love and close kisses are very erotic, regardless of sexual preference. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined and very credible. I guess this is a byproduct of a good adaptation of a well-written novel. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkable and well-paced drama that quickly accelerates after a couple of boring (but necessary) scenes at the beginning. <br /> <br /> My vote: 9/10
