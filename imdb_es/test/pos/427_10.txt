I've only seen three episodes of Hack, starring David Morse, and it seems I've missed 37 episodes! Well that's if ITV 3 shows them in chronological order. I just saw 'Misty Blue' (episode 38). I've really enjoyed the 3 episodes, but then I'm a fan of David Morse, (especially St. Elsewhere). For anyone who reads this, Hack is excellent. Too bad it was broadcast on ITV 3. The cast is strong, although I can not get used to the idea of ​​David playing a crooked cop, but we all know he's a good accused guy. I see that Gary Cole has been invited as a guest, what happened to 'Midnight Caller'? I'm just wondering if Hack is available on DVD (yet). Loving it. Cheers.
