A tremendous action movie that I've never seen. It was the first expression I uttered after watching it twice on local television in my country, Indonesia. A combination between a constant shooting and a great choreography of fight played well by David Bradley. He was good here in addition to "American Samurai". His skill in martial art was above average. He managed to make the fight scenes pleasant to watch. Not just hit and kick like what most martial artists show in their movies. David Bradley could use all martial arts techniques such as throwing, crushing and kicking. Highly recommended for fans of the action. I have tried to search for the DVD, but I still do not get it particularly in my city. Somebody could help me?
