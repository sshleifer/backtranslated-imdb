This is a quiet movie. It's a simple story about a writer who can not write his story when he returns to his hometown to start, but rather engages in a friendship with a strange older man whose exterior life represents perhaps the writer's inner state: it's a museum of Ideas unfinished, obsolete equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> There are no extraordinary circumstances or big movements in the plot. It's a movie about internal changes. Being caught in their lives that are not developing much, the main characters help each other to transform, stop going in dreams and achieve something or at least get a change and give their lives the new and desired direction. <Br /> <br /> On the filmmaking side I can think of a single weakness that could also be considered as a feature: we do not get much of the description of the characters or perceptions of the inner world. It's very narrative on the side of thoughts and events, and we have to guess about their true feelings that are rather hidden, but you can still see them, and this is what makes your own mind work, trying to discover them, from understand the impressions. made by these people, and it is not empty below: the actors definitely hold some internal states of their characters well. It is close to real life, where you almost never know someone well enough to understand it completely, and this turns us around and puts us before our own feelings and choices. <br /> <br /> The most important thing for me is that this simple story, almost flat, leaves you reflecting on your own life, on your own dreams and achievements. Are there any or are we trapped in the routine and the pleasures, leaving us at 100% or dreaming about it, could we do more? and move to a place where we would like to be, just let us feed ourselves and other stories like "I'll do this someday", not move a finger to make this really happen, or "I'm fine where I am". Why is it easier to follow habits than to make a change? At least that is the impression that left me and was very timely for me, which adds to my appreciation of this film so little famous. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes movies aimed at the heart, but those who need events and actions should stay away.
