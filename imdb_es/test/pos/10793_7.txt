I tend to lean towards films about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship and express what they really want to express. The character of Eric Bogosian de Barry is like Howard Stern, but much smarter. The character itself is very fascinating. Like Oliver Stone's movie, I guess I expected more. The movie sinks a little during the third act. In addition, it is quite obvious that "Talk Radio" is based on a work, with its long dialogue scenes. But in general, the movie works. Bogosian is excellent at the head, and the fact that he also wrote the play on which the film was based probably helped him. If you want to see one of Stone's best movies, I suggest you look at "JFK" or "Salvador." This is not your best work, but nevertheless it is a good movie.
