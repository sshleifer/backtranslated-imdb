I've seen some movies in my time, but this one is exceptional. You will have to see it more than once to truly appreciate it, it is emotionally very complex, it explores love and passion at its extreme and its cinematography is simply stunning. The character of the Count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or even leave his bed, the film is perfectly projected and perfectly acted. The film has a kind of mathematical precision and perfection that is rare these days. Combine action, love, tragedy, drama and politics, all in one. This film is a must, all the enthusiasm that surrounds it and all the awards can not begin to do justice. Congratulations to Michael Ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is based.
