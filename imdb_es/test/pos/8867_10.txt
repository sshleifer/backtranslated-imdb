Throw Momma has not dated anyone, it's as fun now as when it was released. A genuinely eccentric comedy, that does not try too hard for you to like and is the best for her, full of memorable laughter out loud. Even the small characters are well written and beautifully interpreted, like the girlfriend of Billy Crystal's best friend, and an adorable cameo by Rob Reiner as Crystal's agent. A little crazy and very funny.
