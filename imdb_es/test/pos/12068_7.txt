This show is pretty good. Like all programs on television, it has its good episodes and its bad ones. <br /> <br /> I've read where people compare this program with Married with Children, and I guess it's a similar program for the new generation. However, due to what was expected and allowed on television in the days of Married with Children, that program was taken to great extremes to show that, in fact, it was a television program and was not meant to be taken seriously. . <br /> <br /> War at home has the luxury of being a little more realistic. Parents talk to each other as real-life parents do, and tell their children one thing, when they will turn around and do the opposite. <br /> <br /> Sure, some of the content can be considered controversial. But I think this program really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are many families like this. <br /> <br /> Each episode teaches a 'valuable lesson'. It's just that sometimes the lesson is that you will not find a perfect solution for every problem a family can encounter and, sometimes, the solution is to choose the lesser of two evils. We all know that, in some cases, as parents, the only goal you can have is to keep your children out of really big problems, and expect them to learn from bad to bad. <br /> <br /> I respect writers for trying to keep the show true to life, instead of having a magical ending like the one that the Cleaver family always had.
