Set in 1962 in Hong Kong (in turbulent times, as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between two people married and tied to their traditions manages to remember the essence of old Hollywood scene after scene of lush, evocative colors without However, the restricted sensuality (as opposed to the required sexuality and the occasional nude scenes that have become part of the norm of a romance in a movie) and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or the communication. It is not difficult to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, as she is known for minimalism in narration and for describing the powerful drama that uses the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond and the use of re - representative scenes that could eventually occur in the life of both characters. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, your pen is very visible here from the moment we enter the overcrowded rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Ms. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) until the last scenes that explain the intensity of regret that is felt when remembering the opportunity that was lost when reaffirming this relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot is even like something that Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Ms. Su Li-zhen, neighbors in one while the two are quite successful professionals, begin to discover the most banal way that their wives are cheating them, and discover that it is very natural that they are together. The question is, should they act in accordance with what they also feel among themselves or not be like their peers? Each scene plays with the notion that at any moment they will surrender to each other, and at a given moment, it is suggested that they eventually do so despite being as intrusive as the camera tells us about their encounters (what seems to happen in a scene). daily as seen by the frequent changes of Cheung's dresses), we never see it. And just as not seeing any of their spouses increases their own love story, not seeing them perform with their attraction makes the final separation even more bitter because at all times we want something to happen, some catalyst, and the only one who comes is when Leung reveals that he loves her, followed by his silent and brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, implying that he will not either. It also gives us an idea of ​​what culture and the moment can do: from a western point of view, a consummation of their romance in a more solid and lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 60s, but since it is Hong Kong, cultural values ​​are markedly different. <br /> <br /> The performances here are of high order: it is very easy to play a torrid love story, but playing continuously a repressed and platonic relationship that overflows with desire, hardly suggested is difficult and makes all the sensuality be more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung Smolder and their ruined chemistry lingers long after the credits have rolled.
