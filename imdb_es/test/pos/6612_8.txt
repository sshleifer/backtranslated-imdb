I saw this movie at the festival of the lowlands (August 23, 24, 25) after a friend of mine said that this is a very interesting film about the history of skating. I did not know what to expect from this movie. It was recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks, or it was a skating documentary. <br /> <br /> So I went in, after waiting for about an hour, with nothing. expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a good job about the beginning of skateboarding. It started with the Zephyr team, which was a good group of surfers. This is taking place in an area not so pleasant to live. At a certain point, the waves are no longer so good for surfing. So they try something else. Skateboarding was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of the Zephyr team at the time, you are one of the great guys and girls. Because many people saw an escape from the place where they lived with the Zephyr team. So they were trying out all the new tricks that are now on a skateboard. <br /> <br /> At no time did skateboarding become popular again. There were a couple of competitions and a national contest. The zephyr team participated in several competitions and also in the national one. But what they were doing there on skateboards was incredible. But the jury did not know now how to judge them. So they put the whole world of skateboarding in their head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can tell you the rest of the movie / documentary, but you should see it with your own eyes. Because then you can feel the vibes of this movie. This movie has a lot of style for me, so I rewarded it with an 8. <br /> <br /> Greetings from Gijs and the rest of Holland. See you.
