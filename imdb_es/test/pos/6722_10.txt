Daisy Movie Review by James Mudge From beyondhollywood.com <br /> <br /> On paper, "Daisy" sounds like the dream of an Asian movie fan, directed by co-director of "Infernal Affairs" Andrew Lau and starring everyone's cheeky favorite. Girl, the popular Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun. Unfortunately, despite the talent involved, and the fact that the crew flew half the world to film in Amsterdam, the film turns out to be a bit disappointing, as it is a cliche romantic drama that turns into misery and self-importance. <br /> <br /> The plot follows Hye Young (Jeon Ji Hyun), a naive Korean woman who lives in Amsterdam, spends her life working in her grandfather's antique shop and making portraits for tourists. One day, she begins to receive flowers at exactly the same time as a secret admirer, who she believes is a mysterious man from her past who once built a nice little bridge for her. One day he meets Jeong Woo (Lee Seong Jae, also on "Holiday" and "Public Enemy"), who unknowingly is actually an Interpol agent who tracks Asian criminals in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> With Hye Young assuming that Jeong Woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship. However, it turns out that the man who sends the flowers is actually Park Yi (Jung Woo Sung, from "Sad Movie" and "Musa"), an assassin who works for a Chinese crime syndicate. Inevitably, the love triangle becomes tragic and the two men confront each other, while poor Hye Young tries to figure out which of the two is the love of her life. <br /> <br /> Although "Daisy" is apparently a love story, it has the feeling of a funeral, with a slow, somber rhythm and a plot that accumulates in misery. Half of the film's execution time is occupied by scenes of the characters that look with nostalgia from the window to the rain, and the silence is broken only by the episodes of self-pity in the narration. Director Lau seems to have the impression that the film is a great Shakespearean tragedy, instead of another sad love story of a hit man. As such, the procedures have a rather pretentious air, despite the fact that the plot is intrinsically predictable and relies heavily on a dazzling clich√© borrowed from the likes of "Fulltime Killer" and the classic "The Killer" of John Woo <br /> <br /> Almost every aspect of the film is plagued with anguish, with the three main characters suffering as if the weight of the world were on their shoulders, and firmly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations. Yi Park in particular, as the kind of socially retarded and too emotional killer, so beloved by modern cinema, is slightly ridiculous, from his blatant incompetence at work to his amusing attempts to discuss Impressionist painting with Hye Young or his hobby for the cultivation of flowers. This languid passivity makes the film's central romance a bit difficult to swallow, and Lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is destiny that unites the characters are more of a coincidence of poor quality. <br /> <br /> Fans of Jeon Ji Hyun should keep in mind that her character is much closer to her role in the grim supernatural drama "The Uninvited" than in "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstruck", and while she does everything possible to show some extravagant faces here and there, her performance is certainly more tenuous. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from brilliant production values, and Lau makes good use of the Amsterdam landscape, playing with the contrast between the gray, almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the field. Unfortunately, he tends to use too much slow motion for some of the emotional scenes, which when combined with some of the images on the postcard give the film the feel of a perfume advertisement. There are some surprisingly violent action scenes, although they are few and far between, and although they are well organized, they seem to have been launched as a last-minute idea and do little more than briefly increase the pulse. <br /> <br /> Despite its flaws, "Daisy" makes visualization attractive, and the story is faced almost in spite of itself, mainly by a morbid fascination to see which of the men with whom Hye Young will end, but to see who will die in it. your arms. The self-complacent melodrama works well enough to mark all the correct boxes for the genre, and the film works perfectly well as a lustrous and pleasantly pleasing romance. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that the DVD presents the director's cut. of the film, which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but also rearranges some of the scenes, making the narrative less linear. Although this new version is perhaps too long, surely it is superior, because without these changes, the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered an even more murky development of the character. <br /> <br /> Wai Keung Lau (director) / Jae-young Kwak (screenplay) CAST: Woo-sung Jung ??.
