I thought that this movie was pretty good. It was at TCM (Turner Classic Movies) at three o'clock in the morning of one night, and his unconventional humor kept me until five o'clock. Kelly performs wonderfully in this role, especially with Grandma (whose joke almost made me laugh out of my seat). The main actress was fine, but the father was able to keep his character isolated from the marital conflict and kept the humor. If you like a good old and unconventional movie, I would recommend it to you. Unlike the other comment, I like Gene Kelly. He was the perfect lead actor for many of the early musicals and I think that in this role, his charisma oozes. One drawback is that the dance scenes get a bit long, but if you can overcome them, you're safe.
