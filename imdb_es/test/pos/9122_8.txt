There were several theft movies before this one and, in fact, the likes of Rififi were an obvious influence, but The Red Circle is more than just a simple entry into an overpopulated genre and with this film, director Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to create something. that excites so much on the surface and gives your audience something to think about. Being cool is such an important feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters, and Melville offers that with this movie en masse; The tone of the film is also very relaxed and Melville allows most of the film to bubble under the cool exterior. The story has several angles, but the central character is Corey, a thief who is released from prison. His release coincides with the escape of the infamous assassin Vogel, who escapes from the nose of Police Commissioner Mattei during a train trip. The first thing Corey does after his release is to steal some money from his former rich boss, and the second thing he does is to recruit Vogel and a shooter to help him get a jewelry heist. But Rico and the police are hot on the thieves' queues ... <br /> <br /> The film is screwed by four excellent central performances. Alain Delon is calm and calculating as the anti-hero of the film, while Gian Maria Volontè seems formidable in his role as a fugitive murderer. François Périer is also good as a dubious owner of a club, while the real outstanding performance comes from André Bourvil in his role as police commissioner. The film lasts almost two and a half hours and is not exactly an exciting journey. However, the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements. The film features crime scenes, such as filming, but is kept to a minimum. The first two thirds of the movie are really building the scene of suspense robberies towards the end. Rififi was most famous for its robbery sequence, an intricately designed scene in which no one speaks a word. The theft in this movie is similar in that it also has no words, and I must say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; but Melville's ability in the direction and calmness and the compact form in which they unfold make it possible. The film is reduced to an exciting climax that completes it very well. In general, this might not be attractive to all crime movie fans, since the action is more than a little slow; but The Red Circle is an excellent movie and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
