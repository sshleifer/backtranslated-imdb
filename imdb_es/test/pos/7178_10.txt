A film of high intelligence and activity. In addition to being a strong capsule of time and personality of the 60s, the film is also a real surprise in its cutting-edge themes and the unique presentation of the power system in a group. William Greaves names himself for the role of authority in the group. Ask the members of your team to film and film and continue filming. First the two actors, then the team that films the actors, then the whole group, including passers-by, policemen and, finally, a homeless man who has been living in bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks. <br /> <br /> Greaves edits the film (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting bow and motivations. Do not expect this movie to bore you. Each member of the crew participates to talk with the conversationalists and often they are expressing the thoughts that the observer has when watching this movie. Greaves is doing well with the integration of multiple camera shots using synchronized three-in-one images and other methods of changing attention. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie will only be effective if that is what you are looking for. : if you are looking for an abstract artistic film that feeds your egoistic ego without having a point, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a movie that makes you talk and think long after about the desire for honesty and sincerity in the documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency that follows from it, then this is the perfect movie.
