A real surprise It's not exactly the family entertainment of "Disney." A little violence, many tense moments and a great story, based on facts. The theme of "Night Crossing" is, determination wins. Without losing sight of their objective, two East German families risk everything, in their daring balloon flight to freedom. The story is heartbreaking and moving. Time is not on your side. The East German police are approaching and the result is far from being true, until the end. If you are looking for a nightly entertainment that does not contain nudity and limited violence, I recommend "Night Crossing". It's pure entertainment. - MERK
