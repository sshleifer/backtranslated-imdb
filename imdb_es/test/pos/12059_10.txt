I have not seen this funny show of a fox in a long time, and the wait was worth it. The children in the program have something that I can relate to in each episode, and even my dad will sit down and see him. It is a show that is not for all ages and that is not for children. It's like standing but at the next level. The things that everyone says are things that everyone says and actions that everyone does. It says things we all think, but in a well-rounded form of presentation. The first time I saw the show I could not believe I was in the fox, and that it was allowed to remain in the air after a few episodes, from the choices of Hilary's boyfriend to those of Kenny's boyfriend, well worth it.
