I do not know if it's fair for me to review this. I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence. I have never understood that the film industry makes heroes with members of the Mafia and murderers in cold blood. When The Godfather came out, I thought they had broken the mold, but the decades have produced a series of well-performed mafia movies with big stars and directors doing them. This is obviously low budget, but it is certainly well done. At some point in all this I feel like I want to take a shower. If such characters really exist, it is difficult for the soul. I always intellectualize that humanity will rise above this kind of thing. This type of garbage has to be stopped. I hope that people who go to movies like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious. I feel more or less the same with Slasher movies. Why do we love death and dismemberment? To be fair, I'm judging this by the acting and the direction, and for what it is, it seems to work pretty well.
