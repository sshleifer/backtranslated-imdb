Things I like. Steve Zahn, like Gus, fits in the paper, copies the gestures of Robert Duvalls that make him feel comfortable with the Gus fans. (Some of the other actors copy the style of their predecessors in this series as well). Karl Urban, he looks stern and hard, but he can also make a joke and smile, which T.L.Jones did in the original series. The gear, the guns, the clothes, all accurate, or very close to the exact period. I will never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon tie in their chuck car in Open Range. The Comanches are actually riding bareback, instead of hiding a modern chair under a Navajo blanket. And they are not painted as politically correct and peaceful pastors, but as a proud warrior people. There are some silly scenes, but it's better than another variation of doing something stupid to not win a million dollars in reality shows.
