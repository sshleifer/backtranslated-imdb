"Pink Flamingos" was revolutionary for its time, and even today it is still difficult to see. It's not that I did not like the movie, it's funny; but it is very repulsive and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as much as he can. The story is about Babs Johnson (Devine), she is the dirtiest woman in the world. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and daughter Cotton. Not to mention the fat Edie who is obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a crib. Then there's Connie and Raymond Marble, two disgusting perverts who are jealous of Babs. They yearn to overcome it in being the dirtiest person in the world. This means that your janitor permeates the abducted women and sell them to lesbian couples, show people in public and even send a bold message to Babs by mail. Babs defends himself to show that he is the most upset person in the world. That even includes incest, murder and eating dog crap and other sick sexual acts. It is a movie that is fun for the whole family. (Does it depend on where you live?) Look at "Pink Flamingos", but do not forget your bag. Also for more perverse and strange sexual and bodily functions, also see "Sweet movie".
