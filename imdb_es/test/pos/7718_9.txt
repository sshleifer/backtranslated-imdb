I just came back from watching this brilliantly funny movie. <br /> <br /> granted, part of the reason I loved it was because I could point to the people and places I knew ('I walk there every day!', 'I work there!', 'I've had drinks there!', 'Hey, that's our mailman!' etc ...). but, even so, if you want a 'feel good' with a little spice (excuse the pun), this is the correct answer. Relationships, culture and, most importantly, love are intertwined within the plot. <br /> <br /> With Prestaron (where the movie is established) recently it became a city, it is good to see this work that presents the place. And adding to the feeling of lifting. He is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north. <br /> <br /> fabulous!
