this film explores if it does not create a completely new genre with perfect imperfection: hilarity, truth, fun, talent and circumstance that make of MAGIC. <br /> <br /> from creative musical numbers to free comedy that incorporates the best actors, if I had not known better, I would have thought that there was an elaborate script here. <br /> <br /> What you get: A strong wind meets with God's conversations and something so new, fresh and charming that it becomes your own entity. <br /> <br /> The peters and the fallen give stellar returns and return your energy immediately. The rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ....... only small actors, and everyone involved here should get a pat on the back, go out to dinner and be considered for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> well done!
