This junction of THE SEARCHERS is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen, filmed by a Briton in a strange and unknown Mexico. It is often said that the best films about the United States are made by foreigners, who can approach the familiar with the eye of a stranger. But this crackpot movie is something else. Although it is apparently set in post-Civil War America, it is not an America recognizable by myths, cinema, television, etc. The film has an air of timeless fable, while dealing specifically with Western mythology. <br /> <br /> Director Harvey uses the title horse as a focus to interconnect stories, all related to the traditional western clash of primitive and civilization. The first seems to have the advantage. The vast thicket and the desert landscape of the film is uninterrupted, ripe for the allegories of the mind. The only brief sites of civilization are a diligence of missionaries and landowners, and their hacienda, both of which derive from behavior that is not civilized. <br /> <br /> The basic story is interleaved in three stories. In one, an aimless deserter, Pike, who had lost his business partner, steals a miraculous horse, the Eagle Wing, named for his grace and speed. In the second, an Indian, White Bull, owner of this horse, dodges a diligence and kidnaps one of its occupants. In the third, the Spanish men sent to find it ignore this search in favor of a murderous and plundering wave. <br /> <br /> Although he is a revisionist Westerner, the treatment of the Indians is problematic. Unlike Pike, his character is never explained, he is always inscrutable, he is denied a voice, except for an unbearable piece of song. When it is not a strange Other, it is a symbol, whose role is not completely resolved, in one moment a wild brute, in another personifies nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But Pike points out at the beginning that the film will attend the period of primitivism before civilization. In many ways, the film resembles 2001 - A SPACE ODYSSEY, especially its opening sequence. Part of the power of the film lies in the connections made between the three disparate characters, which forces us to see the mythical struggles and searches from a different perspective. Indian culture and Catholicism are linked by superstition, ritual, greed and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic. White Bull is demonized by both Pike and the kidnapper as a "bastard", who unknowingly reveals the tactic of illegitimacy used by the white colonizers who infantilized the natives, becoming themselves "necessary" parents. <br /> <br /> Unlike a traditional Westerner Concerned about making history, civilization and progress, this film is a double story of detectives, questioning the past, the clues, the remains. <br /> <br /> What gives this film its singular uniqueness, I think, is, in spite of Maltin Racism, its British character. The climate confrontation is more like an Arthurian joust. The film itself courageously avoids dialogue for the most part, creating the kind of visual and auditory upholstery that Malick missed in THE THIN RED LINE, and something that few Hollywood directors would have dared. The existential duplicate and the search motives are more European myths than American ones (it resembles another film by British Harvey Keitel, THE DUELLISTS). <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing is the use of nature. Most Westerners use the landscape as an imposing background: there is little sense of actually living in the West. In many ways, EAGLE'S WING is like a movie by Powell and Pressberger, with nature a powerful and pantheistic character in its own right: alive, dangerous, hostile, beautiful. There is a sublime scene that resembles A CANTERBURY TALE, when the jewels left as a White Bull trap in the trees are suddenly blown away by the wind: there is a disturbing, jingling, magical and exciting effect that reminds the Arabian Nights that a horse. Opera. Sincere
