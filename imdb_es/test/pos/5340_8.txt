This scene shows how Wallace's experiment in using his invention of brain manipulation works terribly wrong, creating the "Were Rabbit". His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better, therefore, he created a "brain manipulator" machine. He risked his own life to help solve the Tottington rabbit problem and, more importantly, to overcome the overcrowding of rabbits that are collected and stored in his basement. Although he thought his experiment worked, however, it resulted in more pressure on him and Gromit to find a solution before the annual vegetable competition risked his life again. Gromit, who is a faithful and silent dog and a loyal assistant, is continually thinking of innovative ways to save his master, since his crazy radical inventions are terribly wrong. What is interesting in this movie is trying to identify: who is more enterprising, Wallace or Gromit?
