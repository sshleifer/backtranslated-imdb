I love that kind of movies. Blood, revenge, lots of action, very dark, corny and more. But this does not deliver the genre you could expect. When I saw Kite Birds and Ichi the Killer before, I had fun watching that, but why not this one? Dead or Alive: Final is a decent anime and it's not hard, and do not even expect to be naked in this movie. At least add more action to entertain the audience. Even the drama was not so good. Well, I do not want to spoil the movie or the plot. But I felt that Dead or Alive: Final is a bit nerdy. So, no more to do. I do not recommend this movie at all, but I recommend it for people who love decent and well-directed anime. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine and University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
