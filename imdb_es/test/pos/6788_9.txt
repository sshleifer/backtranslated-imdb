My family watches this movie again and again. Even our 3 year old son loves it. I like the "goodness" in the movie. Giving the stranger an opportunity ... showing good will to someone who obviously needs some unconditional acceptance. The film gives a feeling of goodwill and victory. Another aspect of the film that makes it so attractive is the personality of the Velvet brothers. The bird lover. The lover of insects. The lover boy! Very cute and happy movie. There is one thing, however, that is irritating. This is how Mrs. Brown often makes Mr. Brown look silly or reckless. She, sometimes, comes out as if she knew everything, and he like an imbecile, and he is not. Pity to put that in such a beautiful story. However, we will continue enjoying this wonderful and old movie.
