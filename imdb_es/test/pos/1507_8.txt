In the late eighties and early nineties, the decline and death of independent video companies such as Vestron and Media effectively shut down Italian horror films for much of its American public. Coincidentally (?) Italian genre films also decreased in quality and profitability. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, films like Primal Rage, "sequels" like Beyond The Door III, Troll 2 and some Dario Argento movies appeared on video but most remained unpublished (until the DVD) in the United States during almost a decade or more. The films of these lost years became much sought after and commented on among horror fans. <br /> <br /> Of these films, Cat In The Brain is probably one of the most exaggerated due to Lucio Fulci's legions of fans and the fact that he was not only directed but also starred his idol, the Fulci himself. <br /> <br /> Although not entirely the best of Fulci, it is still better than most of his later efforts. Your rabid fan base will probably love it. Italian terror and giallo fans could also enjoy it, depending on their tastes, but I'm not sure about anyone else. People who only look at things from Hollywood may not want to spread the word about the many reviews here. <br /> <br /> One thing that I personally found fascinating were the scenes that show the only lasting contribution of Benito Mussolini to Italy, Cinecitta Studios. The name is instantly recognizable to any fan of Italian films. Until I saw him here, I could only imagine what it was like.
