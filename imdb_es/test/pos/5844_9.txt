Oz is a great series, one of the least valued televisions. It has a certain relationship with the telenovela in the sense that something bad is always happening, and what fascinates is the development of each instance of evil. From my conversations with people who are currently in prison, it sounds true. Each interaction has some machination working in the background. Behind every action, there is a scheme, a plan to make someone else. I like this series so much that it is one of the few TV shows I have bought completely, on DVD. <br /> <br /> And, Yes, I agree with the writer before me who commented that there are elements of satire in it. The character in the wheelchair who offers his jaundiced vision of life does so with a certain ironic humor.
