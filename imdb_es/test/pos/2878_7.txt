I expected this movie to stink, but what I got was a good slasher / gore movie. Most death scenes are appropriately brutal. Teenagers are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of all. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but does not add much to the film more than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally credible as a fearsome monster. I saw the "turn" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> But what really stood out was the address. Gregory Dark could have a career in a legitimate movie ahead of him. Apart from abusing the horror movie "speed cam" (you know, how is it that the boy's face trembles fast?), There are some good shots here. Camera angles and environments really emphasize Kane's size, making him look even bigger than he really is. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a story or deep characters, it's not like that. But that's not what the Slasher films are about. If you're looking for some good violence, or if you like bloody movies, look at this!
