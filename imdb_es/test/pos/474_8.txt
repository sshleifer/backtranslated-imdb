Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung in a singular way until they find another soul as tortured and / or as bitterly beautiful as theirs and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ONLY a brutally honest look at two tortured souls intertwined for a moment of understanding and unity only to be torn apart by the differences in the unity between pain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when the soul is dead or, similarly, it is too alive, too awake for reality. It's the life NOT the one you imagined behind the eyes of passers-by. This film explores the pain that hurts us all, the frown below the happy facade, the pain underneath. The ugly instinctive animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and factual, and then Bechard sprinkles a touch of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix, knowing that both remain in all of us. Bechard, the writer, is an expert observer of the human condition and, due to his non-critical attitude, presents life in a light that we often protect our eyes but long to see and understand. He, as director, focuses on the nuances of the spirit of the actors that shine through the character they are playing so that the actors become familiar with the emotions generated by each situation. This is the most accurate and written representation of the characters of the experience of a man and a woman that I have encountered so far, although the meeting of two characters is probably not the "normal" encounter. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack encapsulates in each letter of the songs what the characters will let their hearts spill if they are capable and strong enough. It is the real voice of each character through the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of emergent emerging artists ready to explode in the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with problems: those of us who admit that we have problems and those of us who hide it. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy exploring the darker aspects of life with Mr. Bechard, both fascinating. Creative and realistic vision of life and the characters that rotate in it.
