I will freely admit that I have not seen the original film, but I have read the work, so I have some background with the "original". If you take away the fact that this is a new version of an old classic, this film is smart, witty, fresh and hilarious. Yes, casting decisions may seem strange, but they WORK. <br /> <br /> I am a staunch feminist, and this movie did not offend me in the least, despite what other women might be saying. This is NOT a movie for men to see (so, ladies, do not drag your boys to see you with you, that's just cruel); Women will get jokes, situations and relationships. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the depth that Annette Bening gave her character ... she did an excellent job. Debra Messing was adorable, and Candice Bergen was fantastic. Meg Ryan impressed me less ... she brought the excitement to the table, but her comedy was less strong. The female cast is strong, and definitely a kind of laughing comedy. I enjoyed this movie very much and I intend to see it again with my mother. Women will understand.
