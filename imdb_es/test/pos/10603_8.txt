I did not know what to expect from this. I always considered Bam Margera and the CKY team a knuckle team dedicated to doing stupid things for entertainment. I did not know that they could act. But all those who acted in this film achieved good performances. The hilarity of the 'aaaaagh!' The scene mixes with the depression of Ryan Dunn and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend to perfection. Sometimes the movie some scenes seem useless, but at the same time they are fun. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh, but this movie may not be appealing to those who prefer detailed stories and a series of twists and turns.
