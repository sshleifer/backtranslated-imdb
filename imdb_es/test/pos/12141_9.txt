Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a French gangster movie that does not deal with style. That's why he has style. Because the film is so unimportant and so practical, it becomes increasingly interesting. And because Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura, we end up emotionally involved in this taciturn, hard murderer who loves his wife and children, has a meeting with customs agents on the coast near Nice on the night that neither he nor we We wait, and he is as willing to shoot a policeman or a traitor with as little emotion as pulling a little fluff. First we meet Davos in Italy with his wife and two young children, one of approximately 9 and one of 4. <br /> <br /> "This man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death in absentia," they told us. "As he had run for years, he had seen his resources dwindle, even as his anxiety kept him moving, with the Italian police approaching every day, France was once again his best bet, maybe they had forgotten him." <br /> <br /> Davos was a great gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. That was several years ago. A theft to give him money to go back to France is very bad. Now he is hiding with his two children. He calls his friends in Paris to help him. He and his children need to go from Nice to Paris, but the police are chasing him and they have put obstacles. For the two best friends of Davos, time has passed and they have moved on. They do not want to put themselves at risk, and for what? Obligations of fees can be cautious. So they hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to pick up Davos and the children in an ambulance, then drive to Paris with heavily bandaged Davos and hidden children. We are on a trip where the options of Davos are increasingly limited, where he must find ways to care for his children, where he realizes that there are no more ties of friendship, where treason is likely and where it is possibly his only friend. It's Eric Stark. <br /> <br /> This somewhat cynical film works so well because it does its job without worrying. There are no trench coats with raised collars, nor are they interspersed with the melodrama of the gangster code that so many French directors have loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who was once someone, who is now sliding down to be nobody, and who reacts with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura dominates the film, but when paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo, a curious chemistry happens. Ventura like Davos is somber and worried about taking care of his children. He feels humiliated by his situation. He is a tough man who sees killing someone, if necessary, as part of the business in which he finds himself. Belmondo as the young thief who is initially sent to be a dispensable driver and ends up being a friend to tell, provides the brightness that prevents the film is just one more walk through the elevator. Belmondo was 27 years old and looks younger. His unlikely star power as a lead actor (broken nose, sunken jaw) shines from the screen. He makes Erik coincide with Ventura when they share a scene. And the scenes of Belmondo with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes his girlfriend, radiate affable charm and sexual attractiveness. The end is a bittersweet destination, and without a stylistic position in sight. We hear Davos say: "Abel left, there's nothing left." It would be worthwhile to see Classe tous Risques to know what he means. <br /> <br /> There are many good films of French gangsters. I'll place this right there with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of the best performances of Lino Ventura, see Army of Shadows.
