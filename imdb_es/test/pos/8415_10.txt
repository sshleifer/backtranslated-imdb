I had not heard much about this movie, except that it was the National Award and the Oscar entry. It is a Marathi movie, I can not distinguish the orange apple in Marathi. But when I saw the film on DD1 on Sunday night, they hit me. Now I am not a judge of cinematographic techniques and acting skills. But I've seen a good number of films, of various genres, and for an average viewer, I recommend this movie. The feeling is very earthy and realistic, although there are some melodramatic moments. Look at it to feel human. Lately I have not seen any movie that moves, especially in the Hindi cinema. The most important achievement of the film is when the child returns home. The camera moves to reveal the child, with black glasses, having lost his eyes, the child hears the other children splashing in the water and begins to applaud. I was amazed. And the two hours I spent watching the movie were worth it :-)
