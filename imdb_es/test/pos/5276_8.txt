Okay, if this movie had been made much later in the history of cinema, it would not be worth it. However, in 1898, the films were in their infancy and almost all of them were quite boring and they did not have a real story to tell, but they only showed normal people doing everyday activities. If you see them today, almost everyone is bored and very, very short, often less than a minute! And so, in light of this, this short clip from a movie is pretty good and could make you laugh. Two types, a miller and a chimney sweep collide with each other: they fall and throw flour and coal dust on top of each other as they fight. That's it: the movie is over before you know it.
