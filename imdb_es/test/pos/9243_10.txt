Fascinating behind-the-scenes look at how a really good movie can be made if the producers, the director and the cast simply "refuse to give up". These guys found serious obstacles throughout the two years of the project (tiny budget, problems with the script and with the scriptwriter), so the finished product was not what was imagined for the first time, but probably turned out to be more interesting than the movie they saw. He set out to do, which shows that the punk mentality of "just do it" ... with or without support, money or help ... decipher on the fly and do what you want to do. I really liked this documentary film and I know that the spectators will see and learn things they did not know before. This film is really "unique" ... it is difficult to classify because it has pieces of "science fiction" and "suspense" and also "how to make a movie". Tell the truth about how movies are made, what can go wrong, and how to overcome. I especially liked the music written by Ed Ivey. These guys know how to produce a good movie in a shoe chain because they are creative and they know how to build accessories, trolleys, staging, lighting with what they can clean ... pretty amazing things.
