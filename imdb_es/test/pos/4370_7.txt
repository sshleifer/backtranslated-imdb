The retrospective is a wonderful thing. Much disdain when it first appeared (inspiring the famous review 'Me No Leica'), this precursor of "Cabaret" can now be seen in comparison and is not bad. It's certainly not a classic, but it has its own whimsical charm (the film version of "Cabaret" follows this plot, while the stage version changed the plot a bit). One should, of course, resist the temptation to laugh when Christopher Isherwood, of Laurence Harvey, (keeps the real name of the original author, God knows what Isherwood thought about it), describes himself as "a confirmed bachelor", and while Harvey is a completely inadequate man. 'hero', (he is virtually asexual), and Shelly Winters unfortunately badly known as Fraulien Landauer, (the part played by Marisa Berenson in "Cabaret"), Julie Harris is a perfectly wonderful Sally (she is a lovely piece of comedic acting) , and Anton Diffring is first class like Fritz, the German Jew in love with the character of Shelly. Of course, if "Cabaret" had never appeared, you might wonder if this would see the light of day again. That it has been revived may not be a cause for celebration, but it is perfectly acceptable anyway.
