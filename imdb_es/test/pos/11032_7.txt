I remember this movie, it was the first movie I had seen in the cinema, the image was dark in places where I was very nervous, I was in 74/75, my father took me to my brother and sister to the Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England. I remember the tigers and the large amount of snow in the film, also the appearance of actor Dan Haggery of Grizzly Adams, I think one of the tigers is shot and killed. If anyone knows where to find this on a DVD, etc., let me know. The cinema has now become a gym that is a great pity, since the nearest cinema is now 20 miles away, I would love to hear from others who have seen This movie or any other like it.
