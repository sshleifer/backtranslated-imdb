I am a fan of the B movies of the 80s in which the hero is a bit bad, a strong man, who finds love, and this film offers it! <br /> <br /> Towards the end, I do not know how Sharky will not be killed (and he does not get beat up! I think he's portrayed realistically). However, he does it and it is not through an exaggerated trick 'Die Hard'. The team of "past" with which he works joins, hence the title. His team is made up of all the characters: people in the sidelines at work because they do not conform. These representations are fun and friendly, they have a real feeling for them. They face an ice man from a murderer, with a good team of their own. The result is a great black cinema.
