A brilliant horror movie. Completely horrible and very scary too. The Thing is a remake of John Carpenter, but please, do not let this discourage you. It is simply brilliant. The beginning of the film makes the spacecraft of the alien rush towards the Earth centuries before humanity crossed the planet with an explosion that unleashes the title of the film in a surprising bright blue and white that says "THE THING". It is one of the best opening credits for a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The cast of actors who play on the team of twelve scientific men is a joy to behold and the locations for the configuration of your Station in Antarctica are visually stunning on widescreen DVDs. It must have been great in the movies. I'm sorry I did not see this on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who, reluctantly, becomes the leader of the men who try to combat a monstrosity that changes lethally and has infiltrated its base. All the actors in this are really good and create incredible scenes of paranoia and tension as to who has infected the thing. My favorite scene in the whole movie has to be when Macready tries all those who are still alive to detect infections, it is tense, terrifying and finally spectacular. I love it because it's fun too. <br /> <br /> Special mention should go to Rob Bottin for his incredible makeup effects and the changing designs of alien shapes themselves. If you did not get an Oscar for the best visual effects at that time, then you should have done it. This is also debatable as to whether this is the best John Carpenter movie ... it's certainly a dreadful masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge. Sit back and watch The Thing, a masterpiece of terror from flame-throwing heroes battling the shifting gore and limo towers. <br /> <br /> Absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten.
