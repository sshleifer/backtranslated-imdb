I was one of the few who went out of his way to see this in the theater. I've thought about it frequently since then. After two DVD displays, I am pleased to say that it remained perfectly. Like any great comedy, I laughed more at each presentation, both in anticipation of the jokes, as well as after capturing things that had previously been lost. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge does it very well by creating incredibly comical characters and adapting them to their world so that they make sense. In Office Space, the environment makes the characters believable. The future of Idiocracy gives you the freedom to write incredibly stupid characters and make them work. I'll be waiting to see if they release a better DVD with some real features before buying it. But this movie deserves support on DVD that was not offered in the theater.
