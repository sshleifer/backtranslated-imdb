If you are a child of the 80s and you have not seen this movie, you have not been able to be a true child of the 80s. How not to love those big squirrels (do not forget the chippettes), the lines and the songs? Years later I can still sing every word of every song. The story line is great and much better than movies for children today. It's pure fun and it's worth paying the rent, even if you're an adult.
