I just watched this movie last night, and I must say that I loved every minute of it. If it is taken in the spirit of a parody of Bond-esquire films, it is truly superior. The real comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness. The misogyny, cultural insensitivity and almost laughable machismo of films of this genre are used for the greatest comic effect. It also calls the illogical and formulated elements to the task, since Agent OSS 117 constantly learns incredibly fast difficult things (like Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument), while missing some pathetically obvious clues. Some of the lines in the film made me laugh for hours after the movie was over ... and I must say that I learned something ... interesting ... vocabulary in French that would probably make my teachers quite exasperated with me. use. All in all, I found this movie excellent. Intensely fun and the first movie I've seen that really spoof all aspects of the spy movie.
