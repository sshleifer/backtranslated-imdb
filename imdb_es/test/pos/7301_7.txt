A novel by Jane Smiley, loosely based on KING LEAR by Shakespeare about the Cook family and its dark secrets. The director Moorhouse seems tamed in her approach, allowing the characters to step forward and bow. And how could you be wrong with the talents of Pfeiffer, Lange, Leigh, Firth, Carradine and Robards?
