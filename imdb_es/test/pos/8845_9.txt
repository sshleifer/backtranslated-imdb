This being my first John Carpenter movie, I must say that I was very impressed by The Thing. From the beginning, the film attracts you, and never decreases the tension. The special effects and the models of the film are well maintained even today. Aside from Kurt Russell, he was not familiar with any of the cast members, but they were all exceptional in imparting fear, paranoia and desperation to survive. The universal DVD has a lot of interesting extras behind the scenes. Highly recommended, 9/10.
