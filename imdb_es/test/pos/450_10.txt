Most people will consider that the best performance of Yul Brynner was like the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND IN ME. . He also showed him advantage as a "talkative singer" and a dancer. Finally, as was his Broadway Tony Award-winning performance, the film also allowed us to capture some of the great Broadway performance. <br /> <br /> But he made other films that showed his talent, as well as THE REY AND ME. His comic turn Once again with feeling was quite pleasant. This was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA, or his Ramses in LOS DIEZ MANDAMIENTOS. However, he was terribly close to being a successor to Eric Von Stroheim in the 1950s as "the man you love to hate". A certain vulnerability in his performance and roles made him a film public, even after his best years as a star backing him, and he retired more and more to repeat the King of Siam on television and on stage. <br /> <br /> For me, his best performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr, Jason Robards Jr., Robert Morley, EG Marshall, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film is set in quite modern times: the barrel of gunpowder that was Hungary in 1956, when for a moment it seemed that the Iron Curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of the Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his followers. But the Hungarian revolution collapsed due to the bad moment. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks to crush the revolt (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers). The West stayed on the sidelines and let this happen: England and France had been caught up in the Suez crisis, and the United States had rebuked them and Israel to Israel for attacking Egypt. Due to the actions of three close allies of the United States, it was difficult for the West to condemn the excess of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation, and the Hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in it. <br /> <br /> In the film, Brynner is the greatest Surov, a Russian intelligence officer who is waiting for some of the leaders of the Hungarians. revolt, one of which is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes may be receiving assistance from some Westerners on a bus trip through Hungary, led by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson and Howard, and Kerr). The latter stay in a hotel while the bus is repaired, and Brynner mingles with them, hoping to find a clue to Robards' whereabouts. But Brynner is human: he tries to ingratiate himself with these people (all people see him as a monster), and in sequence, when he has drunk too much, he confronts them with questions that have annoyed historians since 1945: How is it possible (including if one observes that Russia had Stalin in charge) that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? The allies, in general, had worked well together from 1941 to 1945, but after Yalta and Potsdam all kinds of mutual suspicions arose. Did they have to do it? Surov is a good officer, but he is divided in half by the loyalty to the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary that he supports, and his growing fondness for Kerr, who is hiding Robards but is also willing to notice the side more human of the greatest Russian. And as the film reaches its tragic climax, we see how Surov has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty or will sympathize with Kerr, Robards and the other Westerners who want to leave. It becomes a real struggle for him, and he may win too late. It was a great film about a tragedy of post-war Europe, and possibly the most reflective role that Yul Brynner has played.
