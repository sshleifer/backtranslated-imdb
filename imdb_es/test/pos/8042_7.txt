This is definitely a quality movie with a classy cast. As for the films about Carlos the Jackal, it overcomes the weak efforts of Bruce Willis in 'El Chacal' to a bloody pulp, then spits them out. I'm a little surprised that this movie has not attracted more votes, something like a "sleeper" obviously. A pity because this movie is definitely worth seeing. It is intelligent and never boring. See it, 7/10.
