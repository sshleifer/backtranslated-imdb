"House of Dracula" is not that bad of a movie and sometimes it's pretty decent. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Upon arriving at the home of Dr. Franz Edelmann, (Onslow Stevens) in his house by the sea, Count Dracula, (John Carradine ) discreetly seeks a cure for vampirism. He begins to work on a potential cure involving blood transfusion, the werewolf, Lawrence Talbot, (Lon Chaney Jr.) arrives in his state in search of a cure for lycanthropy. Working with the two patients, discover a possible cure in a mold found near the laboratory, and after searching the area, find the Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) buried nearby. By becoming obsessed with reviving him, Dr. Edelmann continues to neglect the requests of Dracula and Larry, and after demanding that they receive his treatment instead of him working in the Monster, they confront each other in a climate confrontation. <br /> <br /> The good news: this was a pretty decent movie. There is a main idea that is quite creative and imaginative. This is the first film that openly proposes the idea of ​​vampirism as a disease of the blood, and that can be transferred from person to person through the exchange of bodily fluids, something that would be taken up by later works of the genre, but rarely so directly. . There is even a microscope slide of the parasite that is believed responsible for the disease. It works on some fairly well-used ideas and is presented as a rather ingenious idea, even if part of the execution is a bit stale. The fact that each of the creatures has at least one prominent scene is a very well-made idea. The Werewolf has a wonderful scene in which the doubtful members of the search party are transformed into a prison cell and go crazy. Dracula's initial appearance of appearing like a bat and flying towards a lying figure that sleeps and then appears in human form seems really impressive. The monster's clutter is handled well and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused. The big bat that Dracula transforms into always seems decent for once, and it's done quite realistically. It is a completely decent matter. <br /> <br /> The bad news: there are several things that were not so good in this case. The fact that the film combines so many potentially intriguing arguments and ideas that it really does not know what to do with them. There are several different background stories that must be mixed together and that must be clear enough to blend well and appear coherent. This really does not have any of that. The plot is quite flimsy and does not really give a preferential treatment to any of the stars, but focuses on one another and then includes the three in the end. Monsters only seem to engage each other for the least possible reason, which is a great distraction. The ending is, for once, a big disappointment, and it seems completely changed at the last minute. There are some other small things that were not so spectacular, and they almost also contribute to this. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: it's a pretty decent movie and manages to spend most of the time with an entertaining style. Nowhere near the classic state of each monster's debut features, but it's a good enough watch for monster fanatics and universal movies in general. <br /> <br /> Today's ranking -PP: Violence
