What can I say, this movie is amazing. it has its faults like all movies, for example, trembling tombstones in a cemetery, a sliding board clearly visible during the scene of the death of the penguins, Max Shreck losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the scene of the image consulting, Batman losing his black eye Makeup suddenly between shots so you can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman, the dialogue is recorded but played and spoken differently than how it was first spoken and, finally, Catwoman's Suddenly he knows how to use a whip without. Any training at all. These faults are minor compared to some of the ones you would see in Batman, for example, where, obviously, you can see the enigma waiting for your signal or Val Kilmer's hair change between shots. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so worthy of an 8/10 is the great performance because the performances are absolutely incredible. Michael Keaton returns to his role as Batman and has much more to do in this film. He looks more comfortable on paper the second time and is on par with the actions of the villains. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin in the grotesque penguin man instead of the non-threatening character of the comics or the television show because now the character has more depth and has a much more interesting story that is generated from the basic need of the family and the feeling. accepted and wanted. This gives us an evil character for whom we feel sympathy because he was rejected for being what he is, which is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as a Catwoman. she is elegant and sexy, and she is also a villain for whom she is a victim. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is such an interesting character even though he is not even in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is much better than the first and Danny Elfman has more opportunities to show. of his musical talents this time. The sets are amazing. They are detailed, striking, sinister, gothic, unique, obscure and many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. the costumes and make-up are great and obviously they worked hard to make them and all the work is worth it because the robe suit is better, the cat suit is amazing to see and the makeup and effects of the penguin are so convincing . The penguins look very realistic and they play with good results. The script is really good and the story in my opinion is plausible. In general, due to all these factors, this movie deserves an 8/10 and is my favorite of all Batman movies
