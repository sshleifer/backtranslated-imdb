Robert Florey and James Wong Howe gave him a terrifying and expressionist look. The scenes are recorded from strange angles, especially scenes that involve the figurative and literal dame killer Zachary Scott. His sociopathic behavior presages another excellent medium budget movie, "The Stepfather", for more than two decades. <br /> <br /> The full cast is excellent, though (although it's not your fault) it's hard to think of Joyce Compton as anyone other than the singer in "The Awful Truth." Scott, Bennett, Emerson, DeCamp (especially, and although he plays an older woman who looks beautiful) - could not have been overcome. <br /> <br /> Establishing a story of spooky female tenants in a psychiatrist context is a risky trick that is worth it. Nothing cheesy at all. Beautifully. Nothing cheesy. <br /> <br /> The resolution is a little pat, unfortunately. No Emerson is meeting with Bennett. That makes sense. But Scott is sent too fast. I see him more as a character of Mr. Ripley, who could have escaped everything, botulism, murderous murder, jealous sisters, and disappear into the great world beyond this story. That would not have stopped the essentially happy ending of the secretary and her boss finally coming together.
