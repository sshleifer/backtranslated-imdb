I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic. It is also directed by the legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan, who also plays the role of Jarvis in the film. Listening to the recent blogtalkradio show called AARF show (Robert Morgan is a co-host) says that because it has become a cult classic and does well in film conventions, there may be plans to make a continuation of this movie. . I think he said that two of the original stars have signed up and he hopes to have some more. Robert is a good man and I hope he does well. He has dedicated more than 50 years of tireless work as a researcher at Sassquatch (which is also one of my interests) and author. Check out his paranormal program and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II sometime in the near future.
