I did not read the book "Scarlett" and when I saw this mini series I enjoyed it a lot and I thought it was not necessary to compare it with GWTW. The story may differ from the book, but who cares is a movie. Even in the credits it is based on the book, it is not the book. The film is clearly unappreciated by the criticism that other people write, but they can not even spell the names of the main characters. <br /> <br /> The performance at Scarlett seemed excellent to me. Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were excellent. They took the characters and gave them a touch. Now, as far as other people are concerned, they are compared to the great Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Obviously they did something fantastic, but the protagonists of this film are completely different people who have their own acting methods and who should not be pressured by what people have to say. If you wanted some actors to do well, then you should have directed the film, I'm sure other actors would not do as well as these with the chemistry and intelligence they brought to these roles. The cast of casting stood out with its grandeur, and Jean Smart steals the scenes that enclose with his genius of comedy. <br /> <br /> The locations in the film were very beautiful and it was great to see Scarlett go to all those places in the movie as she causes problems and other things. Also the scene in which Scarlett speaks with her father's grave was very dramatic and I thought from that moment that there were two BIG actresses who gave birth to Scarlett O'Hara. Not only Vivian Leigh, but also Joanne Whalley. <br /> <br /> The film and the book may differ, but you should not take into account that this is a sequel to one of the best films ever made, otherwise, you will think that this has to be like Gone With the Wind and you will not like this movie. But this is an understated classic that is different from GWTW, it's your own movie. Also keep in mind that "Tomorrow is another day" ...
