Nurse Charlotte Beale (the lovely Rosie Holotik) has arrived at Dr. Stephens' clinic for madness ready for a new job. What she does not expect is to find another supposed doctor in her position after Stephens is attacked by the manic "judge" Oliver W Cameron (... in a joke, every time he faces a situation beyond his control, he retires to repeat his name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick) who is not sure if Beale is right for her establishment. After a long discussion about the position (which is a very uncomfortable scene, since the two debate about Stephle sending a letter from Stephens to get a job at the clinic, Masters reminds him often that he is no longer in charge). works in the nursing position, but the good doctor may not be who she seems ... <br /> <br /> The assortment of crazy people includes Sam (Bill McGee) a simple-minded child-man who was the last victim from Stephens lobotomy, Jennifer (Harryette Warren) a woman who needs an adult to comfort her while rolling on Masters heel like a puppy, Danny (Jessie Kirby) is a nuisance who often tries to steal the fake baby from disturbed Harriet (Stretcher) Carr), Allyson (Betty Chandler), a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and jump to any man she sees, and "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Feagin), his typical case of a soldier who has not escaped the madness of war . <Br /> <br /> The film shows Masters' unorthodox methods for running the clinic and allowing patients to wander. free with the doors of all rooms without questioning locks ... and, not to mention, the fact that Oliver still has permission to walk despite only cutting Dr. Stephens with an ax. And, what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens? Ah ha .. <br /> <br /> Tacky's 70's trash is a lot of fun if you like a distorted movie brand. I am attracted to strange movies about mental rejections because of their unpredictable nature ... you never know what the hell can happen, especially in this case where you are allowed to roam often without supervision. Some consider the low budget a responsibility, but in the case of this film, I think it improves the experience. With cheap photography and weak production values ​​(being shot by peanuts in a ramshackle house in a horrible place) it seems more creepy and I felt like a voyeur watching madness through a camera lens on the outside looking towards in.
