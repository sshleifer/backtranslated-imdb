I like "Hack". Think of the "lone Ranger" reincarnating as a taxi driver from the 2000s, a decent but flawed guy, in Philadelphia doing the best he can while looking to solve problems from a troubled past, and have the synopsis. David Morse is almost perfect as Olshansky. It helps people, but instead of riding "Silver" in the old west, he drives a taxi through the streets of contemporary Philadelphia, without handing over silver bullets. The cast of support is first class and well above average. Sometimes, the witty dialogue almost reaches the level of the classic 70s series, "The Rockford Files." This show deserves a return, hopefully in a better time than 9 p.m. Friday (east).
