It's one of the best movies I've seen this year! I do not agree with the person who said it is boring. Of course, some people may find that this movie is not terrifying at all, but I personally had a very good time. This film alternates very well the scenes of sex with terrifying scenes. There is also a good touch of humor. For example, when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father, and then her husband says "how can someone abuse someone like you", and then tries to put her in bed for sexual games? D Very funny! I recommend this movie to everyone, and by the way, sorry for my poor English (I'm from France).
