The title of my summary covers my criticism enough. <br /> <br /> This is for me what Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was for someone 5 years older. While I was missing that little wave of pop culture, I embraced the line of toys and television. series that was Mighty Max with both arms. <br /> <br /> Do you want to know how I was doing? I went like Mighty Max for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Thank God for the internet. Thanks to Demonoid, last week I was able to see this great show of my childhood for the first time in more than a decade. <br /> <br /> I'm seeing it right now, having been surprised to recognize Rob Paulson from Animaniacs, and I also love celebrity humor in "Tar Wars". 4 minutes in, and have already mentioned, by NAME: Clint Eastwood, Governor Arnold, Dustin Hoffman, John Wayne and Ace Ventura. Cool. <br /> <br /> Damn, it's only when I write this that I realize there is NO WAY IN HELL that I can give this series anything less than a perfect score. Any imperfection has been lost in the mist of time. <br /> <br /> This is my childhood. This is genius. This is the powerful one.
