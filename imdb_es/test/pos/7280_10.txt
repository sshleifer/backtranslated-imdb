The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was prepared. A quality film all year round. <br /> <br /> I guess you would love this movie just for its action, but I liked it more than that. <br /> <br /> This is a pure suspense / horror movie. It offers a more complete script than most horror movies. I thought, at least the version of the United States, ended brilliantly, and it was great in everything. The story felt honest and brutal. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent and tight script that keeps the action moving, with credible characters in largely credible situations.
