For those of you who are looking for the follies that characterize a silent comedy by Harold Lloyd, this is not the movie for you. What The Cat's-Paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd who tried to establish himself in the sound. <br /> <br /> For me, the closest comparison to Lloyd's character is that of Peter Sellers in Being There. Despite all the education that Lloyd has received in dealing with the world, he may well have been raised in isolation, as Sellers was. <br /> <br /> But where he was raised was like the son of a missionary in China and I do not know how much Christianity he and his family could teach the Chinese, but the young Harold has learned the wisdom of the Chinese philosopher Lin Po, who quotes constantly as an aphorism of fortune cookies. It turns out that Lin Po turns out to be an intelligent guy. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Lloyd's father, Samuel S. Hinds, has decided that his son needs some education in the modern world of 20th century America and sends him back to being the guest from the pastor of the local church that sponsors the mission. The pastor there is the perennial candidate of the "reform" movement of that city of Stockport. But as soon as Lloyd arrives and the pastor dies. <br /> <br /> Now the reform movement is a sham and the pastor is a gossip from political bosses who need a straw opponent in every election. They decide that Lloyd could be a better person than the person who just died. <br /> <br /> Of course, in this type of movie, the word is not such an easy proposition. In fact, Lloyd constantly quotes Lin Po, the way Charlie Chan used to dispense wisdom is an adversary for the criminals who run Stockport. In addition, Lloyd wins the admiration of Una Merkel, a lady as cynical as Jean Arthur was in Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith. <br /> <br /> The Cat's-Paw is still a good political satire, although it did not establish Harold Lloyd as a big name as it was in the silent movies. A good cast of players was selected by director Sam Taylor led by George Barbier, who plays a political boss who discovers Lloyd and actually shows a run of honesty in him.
