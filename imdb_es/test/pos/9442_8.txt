If you really want to terrorize people, choose the devil as your subject. After all, a good part of the population believes that he is real. Therefore, it is connecting to a strip of preexisting religious and mythological flesh. And it will surely cause enough nightmares in your young audience. <br /> <br /> This episode had all the appearance of a Hollywood blockbuster. In fact, after I finished watching it, I went to another channel that was playing a recent Bond movie and, frankly, I could not split a hair between the differences in SFX. With a minimal distribution, restricted by its location in a space station; Complete with overwhelming panoramic views of an implosive universe, it was as claustrophobic and intense as Alien or Event Horison. The outer black hole made him feel as if the black weight of dark matter pressed the station to the planet and to whatever was sealed inside. And as the horror intensifies upon learning that Dr and Rose are stranded, the sinister Ood begins to channel a disembodied voice and then the characters begin to be eliminated one by one ... <br /> <br /> This has all The best qualities of the cream of this new effort of Dr Who. Girl in the fireplace and the empty child. Emotionally attractive, scary and humorous, everything without looking cheesy. This is much more frightening than any number of flying Daleks. But you have to ask, is this visualization really suitable for children? This is not a family episode. Pity the poor father who has to put his children to bed after this. I'm not sure I want to see what happens next!
