Woohoo! My mother bought me this movie because it was for sale very cheap in some store in my city, and she knows that I love horror movies. First I looked at the cover and sighed, thinking it was an ordinary B movie trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made the big mistake by seeing him alone, my parents and my brother were asleep and it was too late. After watching the movie, I was so scared that I was shaking ... I did not even dare to upload and take the videotape from the VCR! I slept with the lights on ... <br /> <br /> The main story of this film is about some teenagers coming off the road and have to spend the night in the forest, telling stories of fear ... The first History is really scary, and it makes you hug a very strong pillow if you look at it alone. The second story is also scary, but not in the same way as the first. The third story (my favorite) is really, really creepy. I scared most of the stories. This is a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle. One night when there is a storm outside, he goes to the nearest house and knocks on the door. A girl opens and she is silent. I do not want to tell you more, but you will have chills when you look at it (I might add that my heartbeat was really abnormal when I saw it). The main story of "Campfire Tales" has a really interesting and surprising ending. I know some guys said it was horrible, but to me, my boyfriend and my friends loved it, and it's been a long time since we got scared ... rating: 10/10, by the way, it's NOT like Urban Legend in Everything, It is much more terrifying.
