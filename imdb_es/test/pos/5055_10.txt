"Laberinto de la pasión", with the possible exception of "Matador", is the best film by Almodóvar. It shows your unique personality at its best and least censored, before it starts to become more popular. Almodovar is almost the only modern director who can approach the wonderful brand of madness Preston Sturges. It does not make sense to try to explain what the film is about, the real point is the willingness and ability of Almodóvar to take his situations to the outer limits of sanity and, sometimes, also of plausibility and taste.
