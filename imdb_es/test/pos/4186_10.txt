A very strange experience, psychedelic, esoteric (and I said strange? :). <br /> <br /> But at least on one level, he did exactly what he was supposed to do. It narrowed the gap between the silly and manufactured Hollywood image of the teen pop idols that was the Monkees television show and the adult, which grows and evolves musically, and yet it's a bit silly Monkees from the 70s and beyond there. <br /> <The most important line of the film is that of Mike Nesmith: "If you think we are plastic now, wait and see how we do it". That the Monkees were tired of all the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of registration. They said it over and over again in the interviews. They needed to be re-manufactured, and what better way to unravel the bunk beds and hilariously from the same machine that created them. And at the same time, they commented to our whole society (news, movies, art, everything) and said: "Hey, why choose us? It's not all this manufactured at one point or another." These are the Orwellian "proles" (the Monkees represented the "all men" pursued, even in their most stupid version in the television series) pulling the "Big Brother" pants and kicking him in the ass that deserved it. <br /> <br /> Beloved The ideas, I loved the music, I loved the effects, I loved the movie. But then, as Peter Tork says in the film: "But then, why should I talk, since I do not know anything?" :)
