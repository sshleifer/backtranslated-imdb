Hello! Being able to speak in Cantonese, this seemed very funny and I was able to make all the jokes that one can not get due to language barriers. The fight scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie. However, I have my criticisms. First of all, I think it's not as good as the first A-GO Project AND SEE IT NOW! :-) The reason is that the SPOILERS ARE NOT READING IF THEY HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE !!!!!) because in Project A, Jackie ends up fighting against her enemy; The man he is sent to kill, Sanpao. That's what he's been trying to do the whole movie and the showdown is spectacular. But in A II, although he fights with Chan, the confrontation scene between Jackie and his enemy is not long enough and most of the action is against the Empress's men. They are not "bad" enough and have only played a minor role in the film with respect to Jackie, so although their fight sequence is spectacular, they are not the ones Jackie is hunting throughout the film, so that leave the viewer somewhat dissatisfied. However, this is only my humble opinion, so do not take it word for word, go and see for yourself! It's a great movie in itself! Take care of yourself and hope your admiration for Jackie grows! Sincerely, Ian PD. Do you know the police chief in A II? It's the same guy in First Strike. It's good to know that you're still getting stronger!
