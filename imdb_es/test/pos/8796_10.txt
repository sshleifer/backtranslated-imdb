Hello everyone, all I have to say is that Human Traffic and all its characters are so real that they are fun. I live in Australia (Melbourne) and finally I'm out of the club and I miss out on the whole lifestyle of the weekend. This film explains everything that is happening now in the world. So I just can not stop seeing it ... it used to be exactly like Moff, that's what my friends said and I had not even seen the movie. I left the holiday weekend behind about 3 months ago, after 4 years of intense activity. I went to a party to change my life. I was in a DVD store when I saw Human Traffic and I remember that my old friends were talking about it, so I bought it to see what all the fuss was about. I saw it 4 times in a row because I could not believe that someone had made a movie that explained everything to a T. Anyway, this movie is by far the best and funniest I've seen. It's funny because it's very true in everything that happens in the movie ... And Moff is a legend! That's all I have to say ... :) Enjoying 11/10 took my socks off because of how real it was, it's exactly what's happening in the world ... hr rm i chatters a lot <br /> < take care of everyone ...
