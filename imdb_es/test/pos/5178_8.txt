My whole family enjoyed this movie, including 2 small children. Great values ​​without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or blasphemy. In addition, no special effects were added for a trillion dollars to try to divert viewers from a poorly written story. A small and funny family movie. We especially like the songs in the movie. But we could only listen to a part of the songs ... Especially during the final credits ... I would love to buy a CD of sound tracks from this movie. This is my fourth Bill Hillman movie and they all have the same guidelines as those mentioned above. With all the movies you do not want your children to see, this Hillman man has no risk. We love your movies.
