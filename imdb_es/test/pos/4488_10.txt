It seems that there are two types of people in the world: those who think that "Five Characters" is one of the best episodes of the series and those who are so cool that they know they stunk because they were very smart and already predicted the "Lame" twist to the end "(which apparently, in their little minds, is the only reason why there is Twilight Zone: to create turns). <br /> <br /> There are many unconvincing episodes in the series and I am not one for Qualify all episodes of TZ 10. But this is certainly one of those that deserve such a rating.It is claustrophobic and colorful.The suspense is built and we can not wait for the secret to be revealed at the end.But whatever that secret is, That these people are, it really does not matter, most of the beauty of the episode is to bring that in. It would be just as powerful if we never discovered what these strangers really are in a strange place.
