Tim Robbins did a masterful job directing this film. I say this because it avoided convention and clich√©. He also supervised the excellent performances of Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more surprising, Robbins is not condescending. He just tells the story and lets the events play in the viewer's mind. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form their own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial issues of our time, without being manipulated unfairly in any of the directions. I can not recommend this movie enough, 9/10.
