For those of you who have wondered what a monster movie in an art house would look like, do not ask anymore. The DAIMAJIN trilogy, circa 1966, was precisely one of those series. More epic samurai of the era than anything else, these three films also present one of the most monstrous deux et machinas (literally). There is not a single facet of these unpolished gems, from the stage to the performances and craftsmanship of the filmmaker. Even special effects are handled with a skill well above average, and are integrated (in most cases) almost perfectly into the film (s). If you are a GOJIRA fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who likes a good movie regardless of genre, I recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
