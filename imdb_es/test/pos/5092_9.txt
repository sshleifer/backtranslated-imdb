30 years after the original movie, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" became a musical. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved school teacher, Chippington, whom her dear wife calls Chipston. <br /> <br /> O'Toole was excellent here and received another Oscar nomination. You have to ask yourself what Peter O'Toole has to do to win an Oscar. He has lost the coveted prize 8 times now. You must also ask yourself if you lost in 1969 to John Wayne for "True Grit," which was really a testament to Mr. Wayne's long career and popularity. This year was also marked by the excellent performances of Richard Burton, "Anne of the Thousand Days", as well as Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight for "Midnight Cowboy". <br /> <br /> Surprised to see Petula Clarke as Mrs. Chippington. However, as it was a musical, a beautiful voice came in handy and also made a good performance. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the scene when Chips continues in class despite the news that his Beloved has been killed in a bombing. He never told him the wonderful news of his pending promotion. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and music only enhanced a truly memorable experience.
