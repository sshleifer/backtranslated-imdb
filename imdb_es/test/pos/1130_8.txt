I saw the pilot episode of this with high expectations, I just graduated from college and went to "real life". I was not in a fraternity, but I was in many of my best friends, and I was able to participate in many of the parties they did at home, so I know to a certain extent what happens. <br /> <br /> This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life, or university life, although it does have a lot of truth, although for the most part it is exaggerated. If you look at the program for the value it contains as a television program, and nothing else, it is very entertaining, like movies like Old School, Porky's, Animal House, etc. If you see it, it is a chronicle of all your Experiences in your own university life, they will probably leave you wanting more, or you get angry because they dramatize too many events.
