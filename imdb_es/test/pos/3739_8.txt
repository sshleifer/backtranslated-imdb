That's right, we have a 2008 movie with themes of "Brief Encounter" and "The Bridges of Madison County." It is basically the story of the lost loves, the redemption and the triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> The performances of Richard Gere and especially Diane Lane are very good. Gere offers the kind of restricted performance here as a doctor who is looking for a meaning, after a patient dies on the operating table. Lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a good young son, who has separated from her wandering husband and has also suffered the loss of her father in the same year. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn steals the show in a Gere encounter scene. He is the afflicted husband and tells his love to his late wife, it will bring tears to his eyes. <br /> <br /> Fresh out of his triumph as a mother who agrees to "Doubt," Viola Davis appears as an understanding. Friend in the movie and literally hangs his hair down in a fairly benign performance.
