In September 2000, I saw 'nurse betty' twice at the international film festival 'film by the sea' in Vlissingen, the Netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept smiling all day after having seen it for the first time and almost all night when I took the film as the final taste of the festival. In short, what I knew about 'Nurse Betty' was that Renée Zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap opera star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock à Renée Zellweger. A strange mixture of romance, violence and roadmovie. And for everyone, a story that takes other directions every time you think you're on the track. Many soap opera lovers will love the "nurse betty", both the movie and the character! - but they can bring all the friends that are not soap, because they will enjoy the story even more by the hard and humorous lines - freeman and rock - by the cruel scenes, the suspenseful aspects and the beautiful images. And I am sure that in the end everyone will love "Nurse Betty" for its captivating and innocent charm !!!
