When this program aired for the first time, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another program of "fat man, skinny woman" that seemed to populate the networks at that moment. I was only "good" at the initial visits and I did not see him again; however, once it came into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was aired twice a night), and I tell you that the more you watch this show, the more fun it will be. Once you see how all the great supporting characters connect, this show will make you laugh out loud. Each new episode that I see is more creative than the previous one: people who only see it a couple of times will not notice it. The writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they seem at first (this is far from "According to Jim"). First of all, Kevin James is hysterical, incredibly charming and a talented comedic actor, as is the cast of cast. Leah Remini has an excellent timing, and Spence, by Patton Oswalt, is one of the funniest characters in the show. And, of course, Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur. I was surprised to read the comments that he was the worst part of the program; It is a gigantic part of why this program is so great: its delivery of these ridiculous plans (completing the character of crazy dad) is more than funny. And the screams: the best episode is when they show him as a child shouting "Lemon Icee !!". In that episode, during which Carrie takes him to a therapist in hopes of being cured (so that Doug feels less stressed), guest actor William Hurt decides that Arthur screams because he was never validated. The last part of the episode where Doug hits his childhood in a therapy session is more than fun, it's one of the most creative scenes I've seen in a comedy. I feel the strange need to defend this program, because it is very underestimated, while "Friends" was sometimes fun and "Raymond" has some great episodes and characters, both lacked the creative touch that "King of Queens" has. At a time when most situation comedies have canned jokes and are generally mediocre, "King of Queens" continues to push the envelope of comedy and shows a true comedic genius. Critics of this program obviously do not understand it, or have not seen it enough to give it a chance, because anyone with a really comical and creative sensibility has to laugh out loud while watching. It's certainly on par with my other two favorites, "Seinfeld" and "The Office" in their ridiculous tone. It's the Arthurs, Kramers and Michael Scotts on television who keep us watching and laughing out loud.
