I usually do not comment on movies or TV shows, but I had to post a comment about Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Naturally, here in the UK we are around 2/3 up to the 3rd season and although I have managed to see the last series of season 3 (through other means) I am still stuck every Friday At 9pm. <br /> <br /> Since the first episode of season 1 I have been a big fan of this program and I own 3 seasons on DVD, yes, I can not wait for season 4 to start in October. <br /> <br /> So, why do I love this program so much? Well, I agree with the last poster ... James Caan, I know that a person can not form a team, but Big Ed Deline was created for Caan or maybe it was the other way around, I read that the producers were considering Martin Sheen for Ed Deline ... No way! ! I also agree that the character of Caan is becoming very smooth, I also preferred the hard no sh sh Big Big Eddy D that we saw in season 1 and 2, it seems that it has softened. <br /> <br /> As I said no one forms the team by itself and, of course, the other cast members Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSure / Mike, Vanessa Marcil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda, all contribute well, even external cast members such as Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch, who can appear 6 or 7 times during a season can fit so well as if he had been in every episode since the first day. <br /> <br /> This program has it all, drama, action, suspense, laughter, romance, ostentation, glamor and big celebrities who often play themselves. <br /> <br /> Many may disagree but this is one of the best digital TV shows and I hope it continues for a long time after season 4.
