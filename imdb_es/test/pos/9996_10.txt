This film gives golf a high rating, it was well acted and well directed. Giving you a view of the history that some non-sports fans will enjoy. The historical factor only gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really well done. I'm in the Northeast and I've seen Brookline as a fan, and as someone who loves the game. The movie was well done on all levels. A MUST SEE 5 stars. The acting was excellent, Disney has another winner in his bag of great movies. If for no other reason, watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people who may not see hope in their lives. I would tell you the configuration, while in the late 1800s and early 1900s it is very realistic. The costumes and the dialect were also in the mark. Above and beyond the call of duty for a golf movie. A must for fans and non-fans alike.
