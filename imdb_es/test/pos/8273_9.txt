When it was aired for the first time at Masterpiece Theater, it had a profound effect on me. It is beautifully filmed and acted. I immediately read Mary Webb's book, and it's still one of my favorites of all time. Janet McTeer is wonderful as Prue, and she hoped that she would become a regular in the British dramatic scene. I guess she chose to focus on the British stage instead. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that with the American success of Janet McTeer years later (with Tumbleweeds) this movie was again available to us. Unfortunately, it has not yet been released on DVD. If someone is listening, please, make it available again.
