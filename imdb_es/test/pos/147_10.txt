Of the Korean movies I've seen, only three really stayed with me. The first is the excellent horror A tale of two sisters. The second and third, and now the fourth as well, have been all the Park Chan Wook films, namely, Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, and now Thirst. <br /> <br /> Park reminds me a bit of Quentin Tarantino with his irreverence towards the convention. All of his films are impressive, but not in a free sense. It is rather as if it shows us what we do not expect to see: typically situations that go radically against the morals of society, such as incest or a devout, libidinous priest who sucks blood. He also has an artistic inclination for cinematography, and his films are among the most beautiful I've seen. <br /> <br /> The thirst is all that, in the case of said priest and the repressed and unconscious woman. falls in love with - and more. It's horror, drama and even comedy, as Park disarms his audience with many inappropriate but humorous situations. As such, this might be his best job for me, since his other two films I've seen lacked the element of humor that would have made them more palatable for replays.
