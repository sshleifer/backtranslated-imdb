I discovered that this is an underestimated and silent Spaghetti Western (also known as DEAD OR LIVE). Despite the modest credentials (apart from multi-band co-producer and producer Albert Band, the only notable member of the team is the composer Carlo Rustichelli), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three American stars (the newcomer Alex Cord is a ambiguous antihero, while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan lend a mythical quality to the proceedings), as well as the unusual plot (involving a crippled protagonist, an amnesty ruse covering a strategic cleanup of the city, and having the law finally next to the gunman against a horde of Mexican bandits). <br /> <br /> Are there several difficult action scenes in your hand? Is the film crowned by an excellent climax in which the trio of stars is besieged inside a burning cabin? plus a couple of scandalous moments that are something like a trademark of Spaghetti Western: from the middle of the street, Cord sees an armed man hidden in a window reflected in a whiskey bottle; a man who helps Cordon escape is repeatedly submerged in a pool of oil by the villains. Nicoletta Machiavelli also leaves a good impression as a village girl with whom Cord is staying; Is the supporting cast, then, sprinkled with familiar (though largely anonymous) faces? all of them essentially gender accessories. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of the fact that the English-dubbed version of the movie on the R1 DVD of MGM / UA was cut: the runtime fooled me. be listed on the back cover; The movie only lasted 99 minutes and not 118 ?? Apparently, the character of Cord is killed in the longest Italian version!
