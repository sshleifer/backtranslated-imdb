Stan Laurel considered PUTTING PANTS IN PHILIP as the first "true" movie of L & H. THE SECOND FIRST YEARS was the first 'official' movie of L & H, but this was the only one in which Stan resigned himself to acting (he had signed with Hal Roach Studios as director and 'gag-man', before certain situations - between they, Oliver Hardy's accident with a leg of lamb that led Stan to replace him, and the extra money that the performance would provide for him and his new wife, Lois - triggered his historic return to interpretation, as well as the writing and direction ., editing and participation in other production areas), but also realized the fact that he was part of a team that worked well together. This, therefore, is a historical film and very important in the history of comedy. <br /> <br /> It's also a surprisingly funny little silent movie; rather different from what Laurel and Hardy would be known and what they are most immediately associated with today. The characters of 'Stan and Ollie do not appear - the Scottish Stan Laurel plays the nephew of Oliver Hardy, a respectable man from the city who is reluctant to be seen with this strange looking guy in a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls . There are some very funny moments in this charming and well done little movie, and the performances of these two Kings of Comedy are accurate. Look at Stan's little 'scissor kick' and his smile says, "Well, what will we know?" when he sees the girls, or the haircut at the airport, for example. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can, with background music from the Beau Hunks Orchestra (available on VVL video releases) that improves the feel of the 1920s and is very, very nice to hear . It's a brilliant and underestimated little movie, so I said it was "surprisingly" fun.
