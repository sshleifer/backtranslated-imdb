I recently read the story to see how these two coincide, and if you can believe it, this movie improves Balzac. History moves, I think, to take home the idea that Colonel Chabert is a man who has suffered a lot and, nevertheless, returns home, not as a hero, but as an outcast. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned At first I was confused if Chabert was similar to The Return of Martin Guerre. No. Balzac firmly establishes that Chabert is the real deal. However, the interesting thing is not him, it is not him, but how his wife and society treat him. <br /> <br /> I think this is a timeless story of men who are going to fight for their Country and when they get home time has left them behind. Chabert is a tragic figure that the amazing Gerard Depardieu made even more poignant. I do not care that I've been in 1 million movies, it's captivating. <br /> <br /> Fanny Ardant has a horrible character to play. Once she became a prostitute, Rose has used her feminine wiles to climb the social ladder. Are your emotions true for Compte Ferraud? I think they are, and maybe they are partner with their social position at that moment, and you start to feel some empathy for her. <br /> <br /> Fabrice Lucini is slowly entering my heart. He is exceptional here as Derville. <br /> <br /> I think if you can get this movie jewel, you will not regret it. French cinema at its best.
