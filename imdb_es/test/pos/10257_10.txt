"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies. I think I saw this movie years ago on nightly television with my mother when I was little and I thought it was very funny. This movie was also referred to as a "black American graffiti". Glynn Turman is wonderful as Preach and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs is excellent as Cochise, Preach's friend. There are also other great characters, and this movie has a lot of humor. From the beginning of the film where Cochise goes to Preach's house to prepare for school until the sad end of Cochise's funeral, this movie will make him laugh all the way. There are many scenes in this movie that I like a lot. The scene in which Pooter (another of Preach and Cochise's friends) goes to the zoo with them and throws the gorilla's feces into his shirt (very coarse, but also fun), the first scene in the corner cafe, the neighborhood party in the house of this girl who became a mess due to a fight, and some others are wonderful to watch. This film even has a wonderful album of soundtracks, which contains many hits and wonderful Motown artists from the early sixties (only 6 songs in the soundtrack were made in '75, while the rest were from the '60s) . The film is mainly about two friends who dream of getting away from their impoverished and rough neighborhood after high school, but their future seems almost out of reach, due to their innocent ride in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for, and Preach's relationship with his girlfriend, Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis) almost puts herself in danger. Get out and rent or buy this movie and get ready for a lot of comedic entertainment! Get the soundtrack, too. It's very fun too!
