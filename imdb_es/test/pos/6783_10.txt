This game is one of the best horror games / shooters I've played. The plot is a little choppy, but the game never stops sending you a lot of chills and excitement. Many people abandoned the game when they discovered that there are no cheat codes and that very few health and ammunition potions are found. But in reality, after having gone through the game once, you are more familiar with the monsters and the different rooms, so you can easily pass the second time. The puzzles are great, not too difficult, not too easy. There are tons of different monsters so you never get bored. And there are a lot of play areas. You really feel like you're in a good Stephen King novel while you play. It is beautiful and spooky. Choose this cheap game and have fun.
