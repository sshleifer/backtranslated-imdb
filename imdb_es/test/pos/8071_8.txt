Some would say that La Antena, by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, is an exercise in anachronistic uselessness; that, although the silent films to which Sapir pays homage were at the forefront of the cinema when they were made, today they are out of date, which leaves La Antena as a meaningless rarity. <br /> <br /> I would not agree. Fervently. La Antena combines the conventions of the silent film with the technology of the 21st century, which makes it the last exercise of postmodern cinematography. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the timeless "The city without a voice", that's what it's called because citizens have been left speechless by Mr. TV, a dictator / media mogul with the painted hair. The city resembles the headline in the seminal Metropolis of Fritz Lang (1927), perhaps 100 years before that film. It's all expressionist skyscrapers, television antennas and animated billboards. <br /> <br /> Citizens of the City are applauded by La Voz (The Voice), the only person with the gift of speech. With her face perpetually wrapped in a hood (maintained even when she is naked), La Voz is forced to sing on Mr. TV's television network. But when Mr. TV makes a plan to steal the written word, La Voz and his son without eyes join with a renegade family in an attempt to restore freedom of expression to the people. <br /> <br /> La Antena is nothing more than pure cinema. Loaded with the conventions of the silent film, Sapir has to rely on images to tell his story. There is sound, especially in the almost continuous score of Leo Sujatovich. It evokes the best of silent film music, as well as naively delves into the death of the film, like the sound of a car's horns or the rhythmic ra-ta-tat-tat of the shots. And, underlying the whole movie is a familiar buzz, as if it were showing on an old projector. <br /> <br /> There is also a good amount of dialogue. But instead of using intertitles, Sapir has the words of the characters that appear in the frame. They are larger or smaller, fill the screen or float docilely in the air, depending on what is said. Think of a more imaginative version of the subtitles in Night Watch (2004). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, words do not distract from the images. Which is very lucky, because La Antena has some of the most creative and original images we've seen in a long time, all captured by the sumptuous black and white photography of Cristian Cottet. There are the expressionist urban landscapes. The hooded singer and her son without eyes. There is the abandoned antenna of the city, which looks like the decomposing remains of a colossal spider. And there is the sinister Dr. Y, whose mouth is shown on a television screen attached to his face. <br /> <br /> La Antena has been criticized for trusting too much in its images, while sparing in allegorical depth. But, again, I would disagree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a swashbuckling mind control machine, or the boy without eyes apparently crucified on a Star of David, feels out of place, a bit exaggerated in what is otherwise simply a fairy made. story. <br /> <br /> But the lack of open symbols (apart from the two previous examples) works in favor of the movie. It allows us to make our own decisions: to decide whether to infer a political meaning, to see La Antena as an allegory of fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies and the power and responsibility of the media; or simply take the film at a nominal value, as a visually surprising adventure through a world that is both unique and familiar. <br /> <br /> The sacrifice of explicit depth in favor of unique images may seem like a compromise. But really, when a movie looks as good as this one, it's hard to worry. There is more imagination and art in each painting of La Antena than Hollywood can shake a derived stick. Evoking films of almost 100 years may be useless, but by doing so, Sapir can show us what is missing in today's movies. He may be telling us that it is time for another artistic revolution. And you may be right.
