In this era in which almost all other news stories involve discussions about waterboarding, images of Abu Ghraib or accounts of forced detention in Guantanamo Bay, the "interpretation" of Gavin Hood is almost as recent and timely. The movie as always is likely to come out of the entertainment mills of the mainstream Hollywood. It is not, in any sense of the imagination, a perfect film, but it does not deserve the opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from the entire ideological and political spectrum. <br /> <br /> The term "the" delivery "refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest anyone suspected of terrorist treatment, and then secretly taken to a foreign country for interrogation and torture for a period of time. Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living in the United States for twenty years, he has an American wife, a small son and a new baby on the way. Probably to be a terrorist, but one day, without warning or explanation, Anwar is captured and transferred to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his participation in a terrorist organization that Anwar claims to know nothing about. On the downside, "Surrender" occasionally wobbles in his storytelling skills, often bothering him a little more than he can chew in terms of plot and character. ostensible is Douglas Freeman, a rookie CIA agent who is taken to observe the "interrogation" of Anwar at the hands of Egyptian officials. The problem is that, as conceived by the writer Kelley Sane and promulgated by Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems too naive "boy scout" to become a very plausible agent, and does not have the screen time he needs to fully develop. as a character We know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, in the end. He "follows the movements," but we learn very little about the man within. Therefore, without a strong center of gravity to keep everything together, the film sometimes feels as if it is falling apart at the seams, with elements of history flying in all directions. A similar problem occurs with the anguished wife of Anwar, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never know much about, apart from what we can see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have proven to be good actors in other circumstances, but here they are surrounded by a restrictive script that rarely allows them to go beyond a single recurring note in their performances. <br /> <br /> What it does "However, the interpretation" a ultimately powerful film is the extreme seriousness of the theme and the way in which two plot lines that run at the same time are elegantly linked together in the final stages of the film. It may be a bit more artificial story than we might have liked on this subject, but, well, this is Hollywood after all, and the film has to pay ANY deference to the expectations of the mass audience if it is to illuminate green shape let alone see the light of day as a complete project. <br /> <br /> Two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film: Omar Metwally, who makes palpable the terror of a man trapped in a real life Kafkaesque nightmare. who can not wake up, and Yigal Naor, who makes a surprisingly complex character with the main interrogator / torturer. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles. Special mention must also be made of the warm and rich cinematographic image of Dion Beebe. <br /> <br /> Does the film simplify the topics too much? Probably. Stack the cover in favor of the victim of torture and against the evil forces of the government? Definitely. (One wonders what the movie would have been like if Anwar really was a terrorist). However, the film has the guts to step on controversial ground. He is not afraid to raise risky questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political positions he takes. Reflect openly on the issue of how the nation clings to its principle of "civil liberties for all", so hard won, against terrorism and fear. And how much value is needed for people of good will to finally stand up and say "enough is enough", even at the risk of being described as appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power? (The film also does not deny, in any way, the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism.) <br /> <br /> Therefore, to reject the "interpretation" of the hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. The "interpretation" may not be perfect, but it IS good, and it has something important to say about the world we live in now. And that only makes it worth seeing.
