Well, I just saw Buster Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and, despite the raw way in which everything seems to be happening with almost no logical reason, I found many reasons to laugh. Like when Buster asks the butcher Fatty molasses, Fatty makes Buster pay again, Buster says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses, Fatty dumps the molasses in Buster's hat and takes the money, Buster tells him Go back to the head. Stuck, Fatty tries to remove it while the molasses falls to the floor, Buster's feet are now stuck in the floor and so on. Probably not read funny, but on the screen was very funny, as there were more slaps that involved the launch of flour and a subsequent sequence that takes place in the boarding Fatty's girlfriend with Fatty dressed in clothes of drag and Buster helping Fatty's rival also with strength. As I said, many scenes do not make sense, but the images, especially those involving Arbuckle and Keaton, are laughs even today. Recommended tours for Keaton finalists.
