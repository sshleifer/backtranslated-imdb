Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses his parents and other relatives in a horrible car accident. She begins to live alone as an independent woman without receiving help from her relatives. She has a boyfriend named Rahul (Anuj) and is about to marry him, but she retires due to the behavior of her future mother-in-law and due to the lack of confidence shown by her boyfriend. Anand (Raja) joins his neighborhood. And it begins to make Roopa feel comfortable and safe. The rest of the story is about why Anand, MD of the richest corporate house in AP, has decided to reside as a neighbor of Roopa and what follows next. <br /> <br /> This movie has a freshness that I rarely see it in Indian movies. Although the story is slow, you get to know her. Congratulations to director Shekhar Kammula for such an impressive address! Bright music and background music composed by K.M. Radhakrishnan adds to the quality. Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa has given a wonderful performance. I think she was the best choice for this role because of her non-glamorous appearance and her amazing histrionics. Anand as Raja has done well too. I've seen this movie three times and I've thoroughly enjoyed it every time. It's a class apart from the daily dose of action movies that we get here. Highly recommended!
