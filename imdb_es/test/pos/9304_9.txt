There have been numerous productions that speak of the development of the atomic bomb. Robert Taylor's film UP AND BEYOND (interservice propaganda that actually waves the flag, if you believe in this, you think that the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, directed the whole show!), NBC produced ENOLA GAY (probably much closer to the brand), and the BBC television series, OPPENHEIMER, with Sam Waterston in the lead role. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY adopt the same approach as the BBC series but expanded it; avoids the "Gee Whiz" technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on human aspects; The personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide swath of mythical but rather typical people who were part of it. <br /> <br /> With reservations, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, introducing a dream academic, Ivory Tower. who struggles to relate their contributions as a physicist to their inclinations to see the world in a broader social and moral context ... only for that struggle to be won by a dominant lust for personal power and glory. On THE DAY AFTER THE TRINITY, it became clear that Oppenheimer saw himself as a "superior being" by virtue of his vast and vast intellectual prowess. In the end, it was the fall of Robert Oppenheimer; he saw himself as a kind of "Philosopher / King," a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightly SHOULD) prescribe "wisely" what was best for the rest of the world. Development and deployment of nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, wisdom does not dictate the actions of nations or the direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does not grant temporary power. When he tries to exert such a nonexistent power (as Oppie discovered when he opposed the development of "The Super", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have the power. <br /> <br /> I I found myself failing Schultz's character in a way; his Oppie is also exposed to the Manhattan Project, in spite of the doubts and fears that tore his intellectual base. The real Oppenheimer would have had to take a different approach; At the beginning, I would have had to reach the firm resolution that the project would result in a final good. The ugliness it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to achieve that final good, and it must be ignored ... at least until the end of the project, when there was free time to evaluate the gains and losses. Oppie clearly did that, and it resulted in his controversial post-war statements that science had now known sin, and that was a knowledge he could never lose. <br /> <br /> As the project progressed, such considerations had to be set aside if he wanted to maintain his sanity. <br /> <br /> Because of this ambiguity, Schultz's character is weak, Scared Little Boy who could NEVER have served as "Quick Break Coordinator", since Oppenheimer unofficially dubbed his office. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman's take on General Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a brave performance, if possibly a LITTLE LITTLE on top. <br /> <br /> Groves was a civilian training engineer, but above all he was a SOLDIER, and a general to boot. He is used to DEMAND that things go his way ... driven intensely, a spoiled and spoiled child who has tantrums in the drop of a hat, who defeats his country and is not too proud to fall on his knees and pray. In other words, very much like the REAL soldiers (that is, NOT civil engineers), also known as George Patton. The MISSION of Grove is not only the first, it is your ONLY consideration ... the feelings and the egos are condemned, with the exception of the OWN ones, of course! <br /> <br /> Groves could not admit it, but he knew very well that he needed Oppenheimer; Military rank meant nothing in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to travel. <br /> <br /> Once again ... I have to criticize the script on this, and for the same reason. <br /> <br /> Actually, Groves was already Oppie OWNER; If he did not, Oppie would never have been chosen for the position in the first place. The story speaks of MANY cases in which other scientists, some as stellar as Oppenheimer, simply moved away from the recruitment efforts of Groves. At one point, Groves was so desperate that he proposed WRITING the physicists he needed! <br /> <br /> Groves' attempts at the film to maneuver and control Oppie were UNNECESSARY ... they only exist here as a dramatic device that, in fact, helps make the movie's environment ugly. <br /> <br /> Kusak's "Michael Merriman" is a composite of several real characters, but they are from a different period of time. Several investigative accidents similar to those described occurred in the POSTWAR weapons investigation. <br /> <br /> Merriman's radiation overdose creates another ugliness in the film, but it's IMHO, necessary and quite accurate. People with weak stomachs will have difficulty handling hospital sequences; All are TOO MUCH real. <br /> <br /> The main idea that is presented, but not convincingly IMHO, is the great truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed up were young, idealistic and naive, as well as talented. Most were on their first out-of-campus camp excursion. For them, the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the limitations of budgets or "excessive" bureaucratic supervision. <br /> <br /> It was not only his brilliance, but also his youthful exuberance that produced the atomic bomb. <br /> <br /> Here is a lot to make the reflective viewer feel very uncomfortable with this movie. Anyway, if you filter the Hollywood BS (there's not much of that really), this is probably a pretty accurate view of the interior of the Manhattan Project.
