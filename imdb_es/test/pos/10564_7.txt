I'm not exactly sure why I ordered Netflix's "Fingersmith", probably because I enjoy the BBC dramas, it was on a list of recommendations. I had no idea what I was about to see. The plot, which I will only describe in general so as not to spoil anyone who sees it after reading my review, has more twists and turns than a mountain road in the Rockies, the kind that usually appears in "caper" movies. They are very unusual in a period drama. Having not read the novel (and I do not intend to do so), I was not prepared for the surprise that the first segment ends on the DVD and I was also surprised by the turns and subsequent turns. However, it is very well acted by the two young directors (by Sally Hawkins, in particular, by Sue and Elaine Cassidy by Maud) and, in key supporting roles, by Imelda Staunton as the mother figure in a house of thieves and by Charles Dance as the rich uncle who collects pornographic materials and rescues the young Maud from the madhouse where his mother lived to be his secretary. The lesbian affair between Maud and Sue is the "big news" in the movie, but it's not really its centerpiece. The centerpiece is a plot to steal the fortune that Maud must turn 21 years old. The twists and turns in the plot add tension, although not much credibility, to the film. However, it is likely that no viewer doubts that Maud and Sue will somehow end up together, in an unlikely manner, as the credits advance. While one has been educated as an ady, and serves as a collector of pornography, and the other is a pickpocket posing as a maid, the author obviously wants them to live together at the end. It is a little difficult to swallow, since each one has conspired to deceive the other. Despite these reservations, I really liked the movie. It does not deserve the praise that others have lavished. The most frightening and interesting scenes take place inside the house of madness where one of the two young girls has been confined until she manages to escape and return to London to take the story to its unexpected conclusion. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress, capable of transmitting the changing and cascading emotions of her character with her facial expressions and her eyes. We will undoubtedly see more of her. I certainly hope so.
