I was dragged into this series with the same assurance that the sea would drag me into its claws. Although it started slowly, I discovered that the realism in the representation of the ship, the variety of characters and the animated dialogue continue to observe me. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, grow and change on this trip and I wanted to be there for it. I was not disappointed. The series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in between, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was a lot of emotional overlap, interaction and expression, relentless and compelling to observe. The movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes, causing the characters to get sick in a moment and adding humor to the next. <br /> <br /> Edmund Talbot is a complex character, like the one we do not have. see often We can know where the captain or Mr. Prettiman is, but they are older men, established in their ways. Talbot was young and arrogant, still learning, proving himself and being tested. He struggled to get along with others and made mistakes like a real person would, but he had a heart that could be touched, that grew with every hard teaching experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; It's too weird in movies and television.
