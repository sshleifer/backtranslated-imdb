I have enjoyed this movie since I was a child and I still do it. I also liked Batman forever back then, but the real difference is that THIS movie did not have a date when I grew up. I noticed some scenes in this movie that did not make any sense like: 'Hhmm ... the crowd is angry. Hears! Where did they get those tomatoes? Then I thought: 'who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway! "<br /> <br /> The original Tim Burton Batman was also great, but it was a little cheesy in some parts and I did not like all the actors.This movie improved in almost every respect with a wonderful cast, a more Gothic and without Prince's involvement. <br /> <br /> Today, many fans of Christopher Nolan's films do not like Burton and claim that Nolan's films are more serious and, therefore, more Loyal to comics, I do not think this is entirely true: "There has never been an adaptation of Batman's original concept, which was a vengeful criminal killer with a weapon." Batman has taken many forms over the years and has seen his stupidity in the 60s (and a little bit with Batman and Robin) .A director is free to choose the type of Batman that he will portray whenever it's good. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman does not necessarily have to Be serious, this is a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. He managed to create a perfect balance between stupidity and darkness that surrounds the whole idea. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Nolan's movies and I also love those (especially The Dark Knight). There's just something in this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and, in doing so, he sought an explanation for almost every aspect of Batman. That's too much for me, I'm more of a fan of the more abstract version of Batman. Burton's films are more theatrical and focused on the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My conclusion is that you should not compare the Nolan with the Burton movies. They are just different and it is up to you to decide which one you like the most. My respect is for both directors.
