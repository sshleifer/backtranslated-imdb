Hey, there's an army sergeant. I'm sorry, but being a SGT in the Army and being in the Army National Guard does not qualify you to comment on a Navy movie. You are not a Marine and just because you wear a uniform does not mean you can relate to being a Marine. We are simply the best, we have the hardest training, yes, we have great heads about ourselves, but when you are the best, you like to show off your things. I was in the invasion of Iraq and in Falluja. I fought with the soldiers. You are not "qualified" to say anything about my Marine Corps. I hate being the one who starts with "which branch is better", but has no right to say that he is qualified to judge a Marines movie. Oh, yes ... we are drilling instructors ... not Drill SGT. That's the biggest track that you have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, we no longer "curse" the recruits. Tell me, how are you cursing someone to make him a better marine? How will I beat someone to make a Marine a better Marine? Yes, it's a nicer children's camp because of what I went through. But we are dealing with different times and people. We are training people who are above all more intelligent than the recruits of our generations. We want more intelligent recruits, no more bad ones. And anyone who signs up to be a marine in the first place has the dedication to be the best that their country has to offer. We do not have to reinforce that in Bootcamp. The Marines come to Bootcamp wanting to be murderers. We do not need to teach them that by demoralizing them by insulting and beating them. At least that's how I feel. And yes, I am "qualified" to say that. I have been on the battlefield several times and have trained marines and recruits who finally ended up on the battlefield. But, again, what do I know? I was there, done that, I have the shirt. Army SGT ....... get a clue!
