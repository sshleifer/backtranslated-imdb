This is the central caricature of the three (between Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) And it's the weakest of the three, although it's still pretty funny. It simply depends on a gag for too much of the action. Still a good caricature. I feel a clear sympathy for Daffy in this case, which is weird to me. Daffy is so clearly overcome that it almost becomes painful to see him sometimes. Good caricature in an excellent series. Recommended.
