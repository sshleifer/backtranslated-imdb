Watching this movie always reminds me of how I remember summer, God! so long ago The whole scene involving the "night to morning", from the procession of the canoe to the end of the trip, is beautiful, and Tripper's story about the homicidal maniac is an urban legend from my youth. A very entertaining film, made many times better by the terrible sequels that followed.
