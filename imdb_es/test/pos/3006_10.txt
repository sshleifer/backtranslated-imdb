I loved this show. I was waiting for it to come out on DVD ... it never has. Does anyone know how to get the program available on DVD? I've contacted Lifetime TV and some others and nothing. Please let me know if there is any way to have this series on DVD. He would be the first in line to buy it. I really got hooked on this show. I do not understand how many other television programs are available on DVD but not on Any Day Now. I'm sure there are many of us who would love to have this series on DVD or even on VHS. I thought about contacting the production company. Has anyone else tried to contact someone to get this information?
