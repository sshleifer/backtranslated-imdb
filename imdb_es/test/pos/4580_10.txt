I came across this movie by accident. I mean, how else could I find out? I was not promoted at all by the studios, I did not even hear about their release from my normally connected friends. After throwing my money into so many bad movies this year, I wish I had seen this in theaters instead of the DVD. Mike Judge is the master of disguising the delightfully intelligent humor in a pack of low eyebrows. Just look at "King of the Hill" for a while ... it's an ostensibly redneck mood, but it's a very subtle hit in rednecks at the same time it's very nice. I read the motto of this film and immediately ordered it through the Internet. I really do not understand where these negative reviews come from, except maybe Carl's Jr. This movie is not only hilarious, it's also balanced. The moments of lightness are interspersed between the graceful visual gags and the blows in our current superstar / corporate culture. Sure, there's a bit of humor, but it's just there to laugh derisively. The premise is only semi-plausible, but since when did that matter? I do not see people despising "Futurama" because the premise is very similar. Just watch this movie. If you do not laugh, then something is really wrong with you. Maybe your father works for Gatorade or something, and the movie offended him a lot. Maybe you're an idiot. Probably the latter.
