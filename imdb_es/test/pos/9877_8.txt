Halloween 666 (1995) The producer's review! <br /> <br /> Start Halloween 666 with a summary of the horrible end of Part Five. If you thought that the last chapter was dark, it will really blow you away. A mysterious "Man in Black" has raided the Haddonfield Police Department freeing Micheal Myers. In the process, poor Jamie Lloyd was kidnapped by strange cultists. What do they want with her? Who knows, but let's say that your long suffering will end soon. Dr. Loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to prevent Michael Myers from killing more innocents (good luck). A friend of Loomis, Dr. Wynn returns after a break of four sequels to help the good doctor. Another old face of the guest stars of the first part too. <br /> <br /> This dark and sad sequel was dismantled during the post-production edition. For some reason, distributors felt that the final product was not worth the average time of horror movie viewers. So they decide to silence him. Then, after leaving the film on the shelf for several months, he put an egg in the box office. No matter what they did to the movie, they made it worse. They should have left pretty well alone. Hey, the film company knows better than the filmmakers now ... is not it? <br /> <br /> Producer's Cut: Highly recommended <br /> <br /> Release date: Not recommended
