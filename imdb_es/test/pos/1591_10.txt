<br /> <br /> This film is a summary of Visconti's obsessions: the decadence of nobility, death, the aesthetic search, homosexuality ... Everything mixed with the melancholic domain. Slow pace just to make you more able to contemplate all its beauty (which is in music and images, as well as in history), this is the kind of film that we can not enjoy more, brave, deeply personal and intelligent. The genuine fruit of a genius like Visconti.
