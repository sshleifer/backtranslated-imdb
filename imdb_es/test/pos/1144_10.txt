I saw this movie at school and I loved it. Based on a true story, this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a movie. Seriously, I could not find anything wrong with that. A definite advantage is how it was filmed. Set in Morocco in 1904, the Wind and the Lion are full of moving images, like the Great Raisuli on horseback, especially. The cinematography was impeccable, the editing was clear, the costumes were beautiful and the scenery was impressive. And I have to mention the music of Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal. I've used this phrase a lot recently, but Goldsmith is not my favorite movie composer at all. Your score here is so exciting and exciting, it shows the true musical genius of man, and this gem of a score should be at the level of Goldsmith's best scores with Legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patton and The Secret of NIMH. <br /> <br /> The action is stimulating and the script is intelligent and sophisticated. The address is handled with sensitivity as well. The performances were also amazing, with Sean Connery, always the picture of charisma and softness, magnificent as the Grand Raisuli, almost dominates the entire picture on its own. He is joined by a fighter Candice Bergen, a cunning John Huston and a captivating Brian Keith in one of his most discreet performances. The story is quite accurate, maybe flimsy in some areas, but with the acting, the music and the visuals are so good that I do not care. 10/10 Bethany Cox
