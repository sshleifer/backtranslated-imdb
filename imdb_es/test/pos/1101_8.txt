OK ... so, 15 minutes into the movie, there's still no dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie came to me in a padded Down Under jacket, with encrypted Sharpie information on the front. I'm a programmer for a North American festival, and our boss sent me a MOD LOVE message as a possible headline, taking priority on the distant Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface. <br /> <br /> I immediately thought that "this movie is not for us" (there is no dialogue for the 15th minute?) but I kept seeing anyway. Good good good. It was built and built and built, and in the middle of it I participated in this movie, because, like when you go to the zoo, at first you are reluctant, but when you get to the dangerous snakes, you are totally 'there'. <br /> <br /> This film has a dangerousness, it does not look like the much publicized WolF Creek, but because it is totally 'other' in all shapes and forms, and seems to weave a Web composed of all the fantasies of most of those who did it for the first time, for example. - gloomy weather, intrigue with red neck, odd splices, spooky music and a plot that, although imperfect and basic, has a little in common with one of the "great Australian films", that is, The Cars That Ate Paris, by Wier . But MODERN LOVE is not really a very Australian movie in the sense of the evil of Ocker and the playful self-domination that permeates many of the films of that country. It works in a nightmare realm from the beginning. There are no cell phones, no brand names, no iPods, no middle-class urban angst - just a guy married to a good looking guy, an old Volvo and a little boy who has strange teeth and chucks things around. Oh, and it's set in a strange seaside town where everyone looks a little 'bad'. Photographed by Nick Matthews (2:37) and music by Tom Huzenroeder (Ten Canoes) MOD LUV succeeds where many Aust. The films fail, that is, they stand firm without taking into account the country "abandoned by God" from which it comes out. Instead, he delights in a twisted but entertaining riddle that the film itself can not solve, and here lies the weak link ... What the hell does this movie have to do with "Modern Love"? The last few minutes of the movie seem to give an answer, or at least hints at one ... and when I sat down for a coffee and ate my Hershey afterwards, all I could guess was that the helper of this movie, Alex Frayne. We will probably have a lot of fun with this.
