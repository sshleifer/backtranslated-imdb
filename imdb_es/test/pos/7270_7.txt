When I sat at the cinema to watch this, I expected to see a kind of ironic-style action movie, which had been implicit in the trailers. However, very soon it became clear that this movie was trying to be more. <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not approve of movies that try to entertain in as many ways as possible. For example, this film tries to mix the action with the comedy, the romance, the joy and the seriousness of all at the same time. Most of the time this type of approach does not work in movies (just look at Batman Forever), but I was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they did. <br /> <br /> The final result is a very entertaining film that should attract the most mature cinemagoers. (However, the weak of the stomach really should be warned one or two scenes). Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller get a brilliant double act and Ken Stott is an excellent villain. This, mixed with superb costumes and some decent action scenes makes it a very nice watch. <br /> <br /> However, the big disappointment here for me is that having 'The Gentleman Highwayman' there was a real opportunity for a good dialogue, but the script definitely lacked punch and there was little laughter. OK, the lines were not terrible, but for me it does highlight a problem with recent British films; ignoring some notable exceptions, the scripts that are written today are still relatively mediocre compared to some of Hollywood's efforts.
