The Emperor and the Assassin (with English subtitles) at 161 minutes is long, but time is full of a story that barely fits in it. Golden scenes of palaces and dusty yellow panoramas of Chinese landscapes constitute a true story of the unifying King of China, circa 300 BC. An intricate plot with a variety of twists and turns is played with excellent performances by the cast. The simple wish of the King Qin of a unified Empire for his common people is fulfilled, but not without betrayals, conspiracies and counter-marches, and yes, bodies. Many bodies. This epic tale of the beginnings of China is an excellent way for Westerners to see little-known Asian history. The legacies of Emperor Qin include the thousands of life-size terracotta figures that are still being excavated today. As a historical person, this film makes it clear that the Qin Emperor must be considered along with George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar, to name some of the greatest conquerors / statesmen in the world. I recommend seeing The Emperor and the Assassin, especially on the big screen.
