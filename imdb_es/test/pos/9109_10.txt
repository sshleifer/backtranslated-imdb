Calling all D-sciples! Grab your friends, go to the theater and see the hell out of this movie. From the initial sequence until after the credits, you will laugh breathlessly. <br /> <br /> This film is a wild journey through the history of the D, and not just a list of the things they have done, but a chronicle of their rise to power. I'm a big fan of Rage Kage (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black), so naturally I loved the movie. <br /> <br /> It's useful to know about the program they had and their first CD, but it's just as fun if you do not. From the funny and vulgar lyrics, the oscillating rhythms, the huge amount of smoking marijuana and cameos, to the absolute madness that is the story line, this is a movie for D-sciples and novices alike. <br /> <br /> Many of his songs are referenced, like Two Kings, Tribute, and Kielbasa to his many audio tracks like Cock Push-ups, all the fans of the audience will say that I remember him as new. Comers saying "That's hilarious F'ing!" I highly recommend this movie to any body that has ever made rock. This film is certainly in high competition for being the next "This is Spinal Tap". One of the best of all time.
