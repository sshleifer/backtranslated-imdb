I remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of suspense and turns. It grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the entire movie. I've been thinking about this movie for the past few years and I've registered with video stores to see if it's available, but I've never been able to find it or anyone who's heard of it. I think this kind of film is timeless, and I know it would be enjoyed by a new generation of viewers. I hope this appears in the video soon as it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as in the 70s. <br /> <br /> It is very rare that a television movie can do so much. Of an impression, but this was done and still does after so many years.
