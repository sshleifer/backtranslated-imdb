Let me move away from many comments I have read here and say that this film ranks as one of the five best Bonds, along with His Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia with Love, License to Kill and Only for Your Eyes (the ONLY the At the moment Roger Moore really played the role of Bond, instead of walking around, of course, Sean Connery takes care of everything, as co-author, co-producer and at his best performance since From Russia With Love. , and obviously enjoying himself, his performance is mature, confident and with the right amount of humor, which contrasts with his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking through You Only Live Twice, and his choppy and choppy cartoon game known as Diamonds Are Forever! <br /> <br /> This is an imaginative touch-up of Thunderball, not counting the sets and machines that overwhelm the characters and the plot. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings her unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on an eye patch, a SPECTRUM ring or a boring uniform. Kim Basinger is athletic and charming, Barbara Carrera is dynamic, and for once, we have a great Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey. The representations of M and Q are original, and the addition of the awkward agent Small-Fawcett is fun without falling into the slapstick. <br /> <br /> Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his locations (the Bahamas and the French Riviera) without losing sight of his actors. Although close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and lapses in continuity, Kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even its director, Terence Young, did not like). Obviously, fans will miss the trademark of gun-barrel and the 007 theme song, but they are, after all, owned by Eon Productions. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Michel LeGrand has not composed the most memorable score, but he captures the atmosphere of the places without being excessively intrusive. It is not surprising that his best moments are in the south of France, with his French love song (in the health spa) that is particularly attractive. And tell me, how many really remember the music of Moonraker? Personally, I would prefer to forget the Man with the golden gun and A View to a Kill! <br /> <br /> The people of Eon can make fun of this movie if they wish. (Yes, Octopussy made more money). At least Connery's mature 007 did not move through the jungle with a shout from Tarzan. He did not rejoice with a Bengal tiger, nor did he fight against the charming snake "Indians" with a tennis racket. Despite the desperate efforts of Eon to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman made a good movie, one that I think Ian Fleming would have appreciated. <br /> <br /> If, however, I would rather see James Bond let yourself be kicked in the shins by a dwarf, take part in another tedious fight with "Jaws", jump into bed with Grace Jones, or lead a chase of fire trucks through San Francisco, this is NOT the movie for you!
