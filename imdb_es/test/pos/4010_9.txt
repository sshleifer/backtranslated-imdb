My favorite show of all time! Yes, I thought this was great, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I had (AAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW, for its acronym in English). It was well written, funny, except when I wanted to be serious, and just a great show in general. But since we could not afford to keep Nick, I could not watch any episode after February 1996, and maybe that makes me think more about the show than I should. For me, it's more the epidemic (now that does not seem spelled right!) Of having to say "Goodbye" to someone you love, and you KNOW you'll never see them again. And I keep thinking that, because as far as I know, there are no plans to release this on DVD in the future ... yes, life is bad! I've found out for sure (although you can find a strange episode here or there ... but I did not like pirated copies of things either). <br /> <br /> So I have enough of my sad life. : (... most children in seventh grade do not NEED powers like Alex can make them go through life (it's not realistic, of course) but, again, how many cities have extremely evil chemical plants that are willing to Is there anything for "Progress at ANY cost?" Wow, it was fun to watch this show! Although I agree that the dialogue is a little more developed (and even a bit politically correct at times), my favorite parts were when the children had some reason to enter the plant (a videotape or something) like the children's version of "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six" (which years later I was hooked on that series of games for the same reason, probably) the "security" team of the plant that is desperately trying to find the "accident child" ... very bad guys (at least when I saw the program for the first time ... they seem more sympathetic to me now). I feel enough I'm sorry for Larisa Oleynik, I'm not sure if she cares about this kind of role, but I will not remember her. <br /> <br /> Oh and BTW, the actor that Aaron Peirce's "24" games are also here as school coaches or something ... too cool! Maybe I can get the producers of that program to get Larisa in the next season of "24". I only mention it because Jack Bauer is my other television hero and I would love to see things crossed, hahaha :). Both are located in California, so I will continue dreaming ... Now I can see it. "Leave me alone with that suspect for a few minutes ... no, I do not need a car battery!"
