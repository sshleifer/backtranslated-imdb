This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and their influence on them is obvious: in dialogue, places, photography, direction and political philosophy. Photography is remarkably confident. The management is elegant and for the most part well done. If you liked the first Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller, you will love "Oz". The address also reminds this critic of the contemporary work of Edgar Wright. That similarity suggests that "Oz" was way ahead of his time. Critics of 1967 hated it and the public stayed away: the 1960s Australia, like the 1940s in the USA. In a certain way, it was the place where conformity was important, whereas this film is very different from what the spectators would have expected, especially after reading the promotional Posters. It is very probable that this film is more attractive to the contemporary public: it is still strangely clumsy and timid, but in a contemporary European way instead of an Australian one of the sixties. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared on the Australian television series 'Prisoner') plays her role with less passion than her contemporaneous Jacki Weaver could have, instead, Dunstan's character in this film conveys some rather capricious force of Australian women most famously portrayed by Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell on the Australian television series Neighbors and then developed into later roles in her career. Men will also enjoy this film, which presents several male themes differently to most other films from the mid-sixties of the United States or even Australia. In particular, Bruce Spence (who later played Tion Medon in 'Star Wars III', Trainman in the 'Matrix' movies and the helicopter pilot in the films 'Road Warrior' and 'Thunderdome') plays a central role and Sustained role that solidly supports the rest of the cast. This movie is worth seeing only because of the performance of Bruce Spence. 7/10 for some minor continuity problems.
