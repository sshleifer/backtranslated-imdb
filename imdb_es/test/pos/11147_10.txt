This film is exceptional since Marlene & Raymond present outstanding performances. The performance in this film is the greatest strength of the production, but the script, direction and editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exists between the two stars. If you like Marlene and you like Raymond, you'll love this movie ... (it's a classic that compares to Casablanca). <br /> <br />
