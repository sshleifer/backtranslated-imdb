Tim Burton is, in essence, an expressionist filmmaker, disinterested in the dimensions of the character and obsessed with the Gothic scope, opting for the style over the substance incessantly throughout his career. However, as his style is so touchingly endearing, I, like many moviegoers, forgive all the innumerable flaws that can be found in many of his films and absorb me into what are essentially hundred-million-dollar art films. <br /> <It is almost embarrassing for me to see a poetically and emotionally involved spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when the audience to which the franchises are aimed are 15-year-old, half-witted boys. Batman Returns should have been as commercial as its predecessor, guaranteeing the attractiveness of the box office and the cheap emotions (actually very expensive), being entertaining without really involving your audience. If this had been the result, then Tim Burton would surely have been required to direct a third installment. Instead, Burton offers something that can only be really defined with the phrase, "out there." <br /> <br /> From the melancholy opening in which a couple of high society launches a prison-like sea bass that contains their newborn deformed baby. On a river, it's clear that Batman is back, it's not a picnic at Buckingham Palace. Cut to thirty-three years later, during a political speech delivered by the business magnate of the bad guy, Max Shreck (sinisterly represented by Christopher Walken), the attack on the Red Triangle gang of the Gotham City Circus. Batman (Michael Keaton returns to the role) makes his first appearance wearing a new logo, which eventually saves the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and emailed to support the baby's political return, now a fully developed penguin man (Danny DeVito with a horribly perfect make-up), whose motives for return are suspicious only for Batman. <Br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Shreck tries to make fun of his curious and awkward assistant Selina Kyle (played perfectly by Michelle Pfeiffer, who frankly deserves more recognition for her performance) that transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman, in look for revenge and ports. , for some inexplicable reason, a deadly revenge against the Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is devastating. The production design is impressive, and offers a city frequented by Gotham with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's score supports the film brilliantly, from invigorating to tragic. The tone and direction of the entire film itself is intensely melancholic, filmed as a sad nightmare, the direction of Burton overshadows what is right in a diabolical script with a plot almost totally irrelevant and, at the same time, perfect for style Burton's visual of filmmaking. . And while Burton's action sequences struggle for euphoria, the real emotion lies in the directional choices that show the fall of each of his main characters, the disappearance of the penguins, the mental state of Catwoman and the lonely destiny of Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> Warner The brothers hated him while the critical and audience reaction was mixed. After all, they wanted a sequel to Batman, not a strange and somewhat frightening horror movie, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan tries to kidnap and drown a group of babies and vomit everything that can be described as green mucus. The production company wanted a function for the public, something for the McDonald's clan to promote their happy meals, not a movie of irredeemable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats that wake her up. unconsciousness when chewing his bloody and frozen fingers. <br /> <br /> It is easy to understand the great disappointment that followed the release of Batman Returns. The movie never felt like a Batman box office hit. It is questionable if Burton really knew who Batman really was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared that the film fit his usual themes of beautiful art direction and misunderstood and lonely characters that rarely meet the standards of the society. expectations. That's why Burton could not create a great Batman movie. He did, however; create a nostalgic and impressive film, which remains one of my personal and nostalgic favorites. <br /> <br /> This may not be a great Batman movie. But it's a great Tim Burton movie.
