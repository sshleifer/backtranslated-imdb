Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yes, it is difficult to keep your mind out of this captivating beauty (giving a radiant performance of perfect image), since it simply has tongues wagging. 'One Night at McCool's' is a bizarre and quirky black comedy with old-fashioned nuances in its familiar but skilful and chaotic narrative, which has three men wishing the only woman and is taking advantage of it to their advantage. When you see Tyler, it's no wonder why they're in love and would do anything. That is something to see "their dreams" happy and living. "Like Tyler, there is something quite intoxicating in this feature in which we see people like Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who is great) and especially Michael Douglas (who interprets the murderer hired with tranquility, but a questionable hairstyle) Really have a good time with their roles.The plot consumed opens with the three main characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) telling their story of how they came to be with this divine presence and the final effects that it is having on them to bring them to an insane climax There is an unpredictable chain of events (which goes from the fruity to the sensual), where everything will be virtually joined by a certain ironic twist (snowball) for the characters (who see them leaving their comfort zone reserved to meet this girl.) Howard Zwart's direction is colorful and balanced, balancing the quick-fire gags of the script and frantically funny, if it is in complicated situations. One of the best comedies under the radar of the last decade, which will have it under Tyler's control.
