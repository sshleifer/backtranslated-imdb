MICHAEL from 1996 is a warm and winning fantasy comedy that presents one of my favorite performances of the John Travolta library. Travolta offers one of his most amusing and enjoyable performances as Michael, an archangel whose quiet existence in the house of a lonely innkeeper called Pansy (Jean Stapleton) is interrupted when Pansy reports Michael's presence in his home to a newspaper similar to "National Enquirer" and the editor (Bob Hoskins) send reporters (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to verify it. Hurt, McDowell and Pastorelli are very good as the jaded news team who have difficulty accepting that they have met an angel, but this is Travolta's program and he rules as a pastry chef, sugar eater, who smells like biscuit, cake . Beloved, lover of Aretha, pursuer of bulls Michael, an angel that simply is not what you think when you think of the angels. And you have to love the scene at the bar when he and the ladies dance "Chain of Fools". I love this movie more and more when I see it, and it is mainly due to the completely winning performance of John Travolta.
