I have a little hobby of finding really cool pictures out there that are quite unknown, and then letting people know them. This is at the top of my list to spread this summer. This indie movie (and I mean indie, not Miramax, Fox Searchlight indie) may be easy to miss in the big celluloid labyrinth, but if you want something completely different, you have to take a look. <br /> <br /> Basically, I thought it was totally cool. I should have known from the cover of the DVD, front and back, that this was going to be something totally different, but EVERYONE says that their things are different to get hooked. Well this really is totally different. It's in your face: beautiful, terrifying and unashamed to tell you to wake up. War, peace, 9/11, poetry, even a kind of music video set in a "patriotic" song of yesteryear and a rare type in an RV. Do I need to say more? Only veil
