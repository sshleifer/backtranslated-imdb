This was an excellent movie! I saw this at the IFF of Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic, and there won a prize. This is the first movie I've seen of Jan (the director), and it impressed me. It's a great story about love and family. The film has a great balance of comedy, romance, drama and suspense, all in one. I will not reveal anything of the plot, but this is a well made movie, and I would see it again if I had the chance! The cinematography / editing is excellent, the film simply flows and the characters are warm, and they are the type with which one can relate. I hope you can enjoy this movie like I did. If anyone knows where I can find this in the United States, or if they plan to release it on a DVD soon, please let me know!
