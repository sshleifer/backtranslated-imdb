I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character lies, but that is why he is called "a great liar". Although this child flees to Hollywood, he does not give children the idea that they can. In addition, not only does it for fun or to get away from nothing, it does it to regain confidence. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was just a big advertisement for Universal Studios, because I liked the way it gave an inside view of how children are who do not know how great it is to make movies. <br /> <br /> It has good music and funny characters. This family / comedy is totally fun for children and parents alike. It has humor, emotion and real life difficulties like lying. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Big Fat Liar" sends a moral: do not expect that lying is easy.
