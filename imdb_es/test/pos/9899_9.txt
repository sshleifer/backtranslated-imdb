The moment this movie was released could not be better, particularly in light of all the turmoil in this current world. The film is a moving, endearing and witty piece. If you have siblings and still have living parents, this will be good for the viewer. If you have lost your parents, then it will touch you deeply. Laughs come frequently, the ensemble cast works very well together and they are believable. This movie is written intelligently and the lines that come from each of the actors make the viewer laugh out loud frequently. There are moments that will also bring tears to your eyes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who respects the importance of the family and can follow a smart movie.
