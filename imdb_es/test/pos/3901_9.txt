This was a fascinating movie, one that really appealed to me. I am a big fan of William H. Macy, and he presents a wonderful performance. His great sympathy, along with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a feeling of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to collapse around him (and, by extension, as a confidant and silent witness). It took me several minutes to relax once the movie was over, I was so wrapped up in it. <br /> <br /> Good performances too, not just with Macy. Arkin was pretty good, as was Cromwell (he was surprisingly fierce). In short, I recommend this movie to any Macy fan and / or murder mystery. But you may want to prepare to feel a little guilty.
