This is another of my favorite Columbos. He has a top-notch cast, including John Cassavetes, who was never more handsome or sexier, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy and Blythe Danner. Now there's something I've always wondered: was Gwenyth Paltrow born when this episode was filmed, or was Danner pregnant at the time? Thanks to IMDb, I have my answer: I was five months pregnant. Now I can really feel old. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner was apparently to use the social connections of his mother (Loy). He has a lover on the side, Anjanette Comer, a prominent pianist, but she announces that she wants more. She's tired of being in the back street. On the night of his concert, he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide. Columbo picks up some problems immediately. One thing he notes: "You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, a body and a career ... Where is the man?" It's wonderful to see Falk and good friend Cassavetes together. There is a very funny episode at the vet with Bassett from Columbo. Everyone in the cast is great. <br /> <br /> This is one of the episodes that made Columbo the classic series he became.
