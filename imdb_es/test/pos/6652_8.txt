It has been a while since I saw Cold Mountain, but I knew I had enjoyed it immensely. Although it takes place during the last days of the American Civil War, it is not really a war movie. It's more of a romance / drama. .and it works, mainly because of the performances. Usually, I do not like Nicole Kidman, but I liked it here. I thought he was very convincing in his role. I also liked Rene Zelwegger, which I'm generally not a fan of. Judy Law is good as usual. The cast of cast. There are some great representations of support, also many. There are also some impressive scenarios in the movie. And there are also a lot of very beautiful musical pieces. The story is sad and tinged with tragedy, but it is a story beautifully told. For me, Cold Mountain is an 8/10
