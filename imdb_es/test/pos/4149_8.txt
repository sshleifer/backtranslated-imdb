This review is in response to the presentation asking how correct the film was ... <br /> <br /> I watched this movie last year and found it inspiring for hopeful immigrants, like my Italian grandparents who came through Ellis Island in the Early last century, would undergo all kinds of invasive inspections just to enter the United States. <br /> <br /> It was certainly revealing, since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while they were there. My grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived. <br /> <br /> I just returned from a trip to New York where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island and the museum actually guides you through immigration. evaluation process: the filmmaker obviously did his research, up to the exams and the medical team, the questions and the puzzles. They are all there in the museum. Even the wedding photos and the review boardroom - Actually correct! Anyone with immigrant grandparents should watch this movie. Inspiring to say the least.
