I thought Eastwood's most unusual role was The Bridges of Madison County, but that was until I saw The Beguiled. He manages to carry it out, giving a very good performance and so does the rest of the cast. The direction is imaginative, given that the film was made in 1971 and if there had not been some plot holes, which the director seems to have difficulty concealing at times, we would be talking about an excellent film. However, it is still powerful. <br /> <br /> 8
