A young Frenchman gets uprooted when he becomes an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona and returns as a better man. It sounds boring? No way! The film is full of colorful people, all of them stereotypes (the British idiot and his racist brother, the sexually liberated Dane, the ultra-organized German ...). In this case, however, stereotypes are brilliantly made. You feel like you know people like that (I know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife, and they're like the characters in the movie!), They feel like REAL PEOPLE! <br /> <br /> Go Watch this movie and enjoy the subtitles!
