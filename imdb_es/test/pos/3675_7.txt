This is one of the strangest movies I've seen in a long time. Usually, if they are so strange, I retire early and I rarely regret it. Luckily, I clung to this one. While I can not say that this is a great movie (it is not), I can say that seeing it is like a good trip with acid, just a few really horrible moments and the rest full of "Did I just see it?" admiration. Many laughs loudly moments. A great cast of characters with exceptional Meredith Eaton as the dwarf daughter-in-law with an attitude. Keep an open mind.
