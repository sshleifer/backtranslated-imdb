I like money! I came across this brilliant movie at a local video store last week. I was not sure what to expect. I brought it home, I configured the player and then I started my trip to stupidity. The first time I saw him, I laughed a lot, without really laughing. It was not until the second time I saw the movie that it really began to dominate me and the humor was much more fun. It reminded me of Austin Powers, the first time I saw it was fine, then the real fun started telling people about it, just talking about every scene and setting. I'm making all my friends see this movie, everyone I know. This film may very well be one of the most accurate "Futures" movies ever made. This movie is more than just 84 minutes of entertainment, it is a warning for the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, the fantastic mind that Office Space brought us has brought us a vision of life in the automated future. Luke Wilson's dead bread humor as "average" Joe improved the movie much more. Watch this movie and once you're done, READ MORE! Write more! Think more! For the sake of the futures, if it is not for yours!
