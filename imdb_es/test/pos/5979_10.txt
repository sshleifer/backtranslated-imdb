Shepitko is the wife of Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov, who directed the 1984 film COME AND SEE, better known commercially, generally considered one of the most realistic war movies in history, without exception, notable for its poetic intensity, but I think which lacks the internal complexity of this even greater Russian film, which examines not only the external graphic horrors, but finds truly inspiring images that focus on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute madness that takes place within these beings humans, whose end is simply inspiring The bullets fly and the bodies die in a skirmish with guns in the initial credits, where the intensity of the film never stops throughout the duration, focusing on somber faces, exhausted soldiers without almost nothing to eat, a population terrified under occupation, Hungry children with petrified mothers s, all thrown into an immense landscape of endless white snow. Like CRANES ARE FLYING (1957), this presents a retreating Russian army, a traumatic shock at the beginning of the war when they were almost eliminated. The Russian countryside has been invaded by the German Nazis, who are terrorizing the citizens, stealing the food they have and forcing them to make their eyes and ears informants. What the Russian soldiers are hiding under the protection of the forests, but are forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms. This film follows two soldiers who, from the beginning, find themselves on an almost impossible mission, since there is little food left in the winter. One is healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin as Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov as Sotnikov, is held back by a tubercular cough and, finally, a bullet in the leg that almost leaves him for dead, but his partner heroically rescues As they move through the snow to their knees, they crawl in some spots with insufficient protection against the rough elements, like many other Russian films, nature itself becomes its most difficult enemy. <br /> <br /> Spoilers !! It all comes down to a matter of survival. When they arrive at their destination, the farm has been demolished and abandoned in a state of rubble, pushing forward into the territory occupied by Germany, where the next farm is attended by an elderly Soviet collaborator who fears Nazi punishment. The partisan soldiers think he is a coward but they go on, where they are finally captured and taken to a Nazi camp in a nearby town and kept as prisoners, along with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who helped to hide them. Tarkovsky's unconditional, Anatoli Solonitsyn, appears as Portnov, the interrogator, a Russian professor from a nearby academy who became a sympathizer of the Nazis. The Russians who torture and execute other Russians are the depth of the depravity of war and Solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role for which he is perfectly prepared. As far as we can see, while the Nazi officers jovially chatter close to each other, he is a stranger even among this group, seen instead as a kind of dreadful businessman in black cloaks who usually sends men to their graves. The public is not free from witnessing acts of torture in Sotnikov, who offers nothing but contempt, while Rybak speaks freely, hoping to save his life, but both are condemned to die, although Rybak is offered the opportunity to serve the German Reich as a police agent The mother, the elderly collaborator and a child join this group, spending one last night together with life, where together they discuss the merits of a soldier's mission, of being a patriot , a mother, a coward or a collaborator. Each seems individually driven by a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov offers himself as a disinterested example, trying to confess his guilt to save others, where the properly chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption. <br /> <br /> By the next morning, Portnov seems slightly amused, mocking them for his sudden willingness to talk, but spares no one except Rybak, who changes sides to maintain his life, rationalizing on his thoughts that if he is alive, at least he has the opportunity to escape. But there is no escape from this torment. What happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace, as we witness the betrayal of the war without firing a single shot, as the execution by hanging becomes a public spectacle, where villagers at the tip of a gun they are forced to witness. The rhythm and heartbreaking intensity of this film are relentless, as there is never a moment without an imminent threat, with a magnificent shot from Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko), with perfectly composed landscapes and a lot of movement of camera, much of a short distance using portraits, especially that of a fierce boy at the end watching the condemned, who establishes a surreal connection with the next generation without uttering any words, accentuated by the psychologically horrible music of Alfred Shnittke , which resembles the transcendent but furiously disturbing monolithic Music of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The sound design of this film is very advanced and singularly modern, where the use of sound outside the screen continuously exposes the nerves of every moment, dogs bark, winds blow, bullets shoot, Nazi conversations in German do not translated or laugh sadistically for his impotence. , which only elevates the horrible tension to insane heights. In many ways, which resemble DREYER'S PASSION OF JOAN DE ARCO (1928), here is an absolute madness, the relentless realization that you have no other choice, but you are bound to make one anyway. The inner nightmarish thoughts are expressed without words, where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes, where the voices continue to reverberate inside the heads of the living as an explosion of endless echoes, but only silence fills the cool winter air with a revered reverence. and a deep sense of loss.
