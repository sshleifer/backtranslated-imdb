It is almost impossible for me to sit down and write a thorough review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people know some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries of this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think about them, and imagine myself in their world, the more I capture their subject: that we are more linked to each other than we would like to think to ourselves, and all that is needed is a bit of luck. to launch some events. In BLUE, Juliette Binoche played an afflicted widow whose plan to live her life without connection to the past made her meet someone unexpected. In BLANCO, an act of cruelty breeds an unlikely friendship between two men who, against all odds, will conspire to take the perpetrator to justice and the full circle. And now, in RED, all the elements of fate and the apparent coincidence are applied to the meeting of a young Genev√©s model and a retired judge who has the habit of meddling in the lives of other people. <br /> <br /> This young girl is appropriately named: Valentine (a luminous Irene Jacob), who has this glow over her and even smiles openly while working on the dance floor. It is not that she is without luggage: she has a boyfriend, invisible, who also demands to know what she is doing at all times, has a brother who worries her, and rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on his image. for a huge billboard. She strikes a dog while driving and takes care of her so that she can recover her health, but when he takes her to the owner, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he does not want her. "I do not want anything," he says coldly, and elements of BLUE suddenly reveal themselves when this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and apparent and floating freedom, performs the surveillance of innocent people. This male version of Juliette Binoche's character in the first Valentine's discharge: she says she can only feel sorry for him as she walks away in horror, but a casual event has her back in place, and this is when she begins to reveal who is he. , and his great loss. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Kieszlowski is developing a parallel story: the story of a young man, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), about to become a judge and who lives all over the world. Valentine's street, but they are still missing. Chance is the word. As Valentine won the big prize in the history of the grocery store she visits, the elements of chance dot her life and that of Auguste. He has a girlfriend who also provides people with telephone weather reports. One of them happens to be the old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste, and he has never met her. Just as God, or Prospero, is slowly creating a storm that will break the walls of this current state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression "We meet again." It is this parallelism between the young judge and the old one that makes RED so beautiful and transcendent, because time is, in fact, much more fluid than we would like to consider. There are people we know in life who, if we had only been born in similar time frames, many things would be different. <br /> <br /> Such is the case of Valentine and the old judge. I think that there is definitely a strong brotherhood of souls that unite them in a close bond: she is that woman he did not meet, by chance or not, and it is, whether he knows it or not, trying to make peace. , that is why he risks revealing his vigilance and becoming the social outcast. But it does not end there. One of the many links between the three films is the character of an old woman walking towards a large trash container. Where Julie did not see her (and would not have helped her in any way), and Karol fresh out of his public humiliation mocks his thought: "Someone is worse than me", Valentine is the one who helps her. Fragility in need can occur anywhere, and Kieszlowski even applies it here in a secondary character. <br /> <br /> Now, RED is much more than a story. Valentine, the old judge, Auguste, even Rita the bitch: these are not characters limited by the narrative. An American version would ruin the idea and commercialize casual encounters and even result in a stupid ending. RED is so devoid of a linear and definite plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have been diverted in so many directions if a crucial element had not taken place at the exact time and place. <Br /> <br /> Adding to the concept of characters that reflect each other despite deadlines or location is the subject of sexual betrayal. This is also an important element that defines the character of the three films: in BLUE, Julie's husband had a lover and also betrays Olivier when it is clear that she is emotionally dead. In BLANCO, Dominique makes Karol listen to her on the phone (which becomes an important device in RED) since she has sex with a man while the Brigite Bardot CONTEMPTO card looks on. In RED, the story of love and betrayal by the old judge is re-enacted. And all this time, the image of Valentine's billboard looms over them as a harbinger of things to come at the same time that Rita, Valentine's dog dog, carries seven puppies, life renewed for the six main players in this trilogy complex, obviously filmed with care and love Why do I say six? You will have to see the movie and ask yourself.
