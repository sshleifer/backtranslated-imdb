Well, the movie turned out much better than I expected. It's not boring and it's nothing original. It really is not a silly romantic comedy. The situations in which the characters are put are very unusual, of course, we are still talking about a movie, but the main characters are really plausible. Donald is, of course, an exaggeration, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a means to prove something. The end is not one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, morals that contain garbage pieces that you can usually see in movies of the genre. I really liked it and I'm hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. It is worth a watch. In addition, it is better directed than other films, the story line always stands up, the characters stand up. And they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them as an artifact given by the god of holly, yada, yada. At the end of everything, you really see yourself going through everything, the movie makes you feel something, you can even learn one or two things. It is not the idiocy that moistens the tissues and produces hope. It's a good movie, not a consolation prize for tearful women around the world.
