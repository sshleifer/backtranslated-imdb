This movie is a love story set in the war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just watched the movie yesterday and I want to have my own DVD as soon as possible and watch it many times. The story ends when it started. She was very happy that he came back and was proud of her for being a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband and her lover. The character had many nuances. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have happy endings. Apart from the angle of the love story, I thought about how a beautiful, serene and peaceful island had been affected by the war and made me realize the real devastation that war can have on its people ... the government takes the decision while people suffer. His father was a very polite man and he wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams. I loved the scene in which she complains about not getting a dowry and I also loved the scene in which both experienced the earthquake. They were survivors.
