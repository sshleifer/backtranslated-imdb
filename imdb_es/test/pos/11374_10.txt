Boogie Nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films (although it does not fit into that genre): the rise and fall. We see the emergence of several individuals, some of them from total darkness, to great heights ... and then fall into disgrace due to their excesses. <br /> <br /> I think this is the first feature of the writer / Director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it's a great start! I saw elements of the influences of other directors, such as Robert Altman, but the film has its own originality and plot development. <br /> <br /> Character development is the best feature of the movie. I really identified with all the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. All the performances were brilliant. (It was especially good to see a small part played by a real life veteran, Nina Hartley). <br /> <br /> Basically, this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result of being one of the best films of 1997, which was rejected at the Oscars (probably due to the "reason", as they would say, the theme and the general conservatism of the Academy).
