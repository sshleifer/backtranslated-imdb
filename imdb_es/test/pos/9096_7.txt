Originally I was a fan of Tenacious D from their first album and naturally I heard some songs from The P.O.D. and I was quite disappointed. After watching the movie, my view has changed. The film is quite funny from the beginning to the end and I found myself committed to it even though it really was a stupid story due to the attitudes that KG and Jaybles represent in the film. <br /> <br /> Much more entertaining and fun than the movies I've seen in theaters lately. former. Saw III (boring and dragged), Casino Royale (path to the homoerotic) that I've really enjoyed in previous versions. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed Borat, you'll enjoy the story of The Greatest Band on Earth.
