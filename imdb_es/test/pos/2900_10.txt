I bet I see this movie 4 or 5 times a year, and I will do it more often, now that the Hollyweird magnates have put themselves in the shape of putting it on DVD, because it's a classic with a capital "C"! This movie is timeless! How can people pay $ 10.00 today to see the JUNK coming out of Hollyweird with movies like THE Egyptian; THE TEN COMMANDMENTS; BEN HUR; CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD on tape; DVD; and cable movie channels; I could go on forever, but this movie is great, and for an unknown relative, Edmund Purdom takes the film as Atlas took the world. The story is wonderful, the acting is first class and the graphics at the end are so powerful, that you sit in your seat for a few minutes, just trying to let the words penetrate! Really a knockout of a movie. I would give this 15 stars if they would allow me! They do not do it that way anymore, but they should do it!
