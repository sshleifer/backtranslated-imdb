The first time I saw it was when it came out (1994), and the last time I saw it was just before writing this review ... It still makes me laugh with my brain ... after all these years, I was not disappointed. . Truly the most intelligent Bollywood comedy ever made. This is an Indian movie that deserves its place in the Top 250 of IMDb. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan probably in one of their best performances in comic roles. What makes this time less classic is its comic time and its wonderful edition ... The jokes are refreshing and not cheap ... This is a film really advanced in its time. If you have not seen it yet, ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
