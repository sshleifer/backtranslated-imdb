A rich old woman calls a divorced coquette to lure a Lothario away from her stupid granddaughter who is soon to be married. <br /> <br /> LET US BE GAY is an interesting little domestic comedy that presents a bit of sour dialogue (courtesy of the famous screenwriter Frances Marion) and good performances. Although perhaps a bit clumsy, sometimes, this can be attributed to difficulties with early sound technology that tended to limit action and movement. <br /> <br /> Norma Shearer can be credited for appearing in this supporting film, instead of using her undoubted influence as the wife of Irving Thalberg to insist on only category A photos. She is especially effective in her first scenes, where the disheveled flat makeup makes it almost unrecognizable. His extreme transformation from goose to swan could only happen in Hollywood, but it's unprofitable to spend a lot of time worrying about it. <br /> <br /> Rod LaRocque does not behave like Shearer's adulterous husband. Very popular during the days of silence, the conversation fans were not especially kind to him and his career would suffer. Here his role is not at all sympathetic and one has to wonder what masochistic impulse moves women to desire so much the CAD. <br /> <br /> The magnificent Marie Dressler is present as an eccentric widow from Long Island. As Frances Marion's great friend, one can easily imagine that the part was written expressly for her. Full of cranks and crotches, she is very humorous. However, the tremendous warmth and essential goodness that would soon make his biggest Hollywood star go down to a large extent. <br /> <br /> Among the cast of support, Hedda Hopper qualifies as a furtive society snake, like Wilfred Noy playing a comic. Butler. Movie experts will see little Dickie Moore as Shearer's young son and old Mary Gordon as her housekeeper, both uncredited.
