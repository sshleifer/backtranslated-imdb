Although the concept of a 32-year-old woman portraying a 12-year-old might be a stretch for today's sophisticated audiences, in the 1920s this was what Mary Pickford's fans wanted and expected from her star favorite The opening scene shows Annie's disheveled character as the apparent leader of a multiethnic street gang in a comic "battle" with a rival group. The vision of a young girl who is hit in the jaw and beaten can be a bit crude, but the scene is interpreted in such a way "our gang" that it would be difficult to take this seriously. Anyway, Annie can distribute it as well as take it. Once Annie returns to her tenement house and replaces her street clothes with a more childish outfit, it becomes more difficult (especially in the close-ups) to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street hedgehog. However, for those who can muster the required suspension of disbelief, the rest of the movie has its rewards. Hesitating between comedy (Annie's gang organizes a show) to feel (Annie plans a surprise birthday for her father Irish policeman) and tragedy (her father is killed on her birthday), the film gives Mary the opportunity to Show a range of emotions that would please your fans of any era. <br /> <br /> Of course, the required "happy ending" is finally achieved; the evildoers are arrested with the help of Annie's friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her friends who are walking along a busy public road on a sunny day. Which is a good way to finish a Mary Pickford movie. <br /> <br />
