This is "Citizen Kane" by Burt Reynolds. Tragically nothing in which he was involved approached "Sharkey's Machine". I thought he put everything he had in it. It's a movie that is in love with movies. The opening sequence in which Detective Sharkey rescues a hostage bus on his own is a very exciting piece of cinema. Everything moves so quickly once it has started to go wrong, that it seems to take on a life of its own, a brilliantly achieved effect. It seems cold, tense and dangerous in the streets of Mr. Reynolds. The police station seems dirty and tired, full of desperate people on both sides of the law, screaming, cursing, trying to make deals or just stay alive. To this low world descends the recently degraded Sharkey, a reward for a failed drug attack (caused by a corrupt policeman), he and his team are part of the squad of vice presidents. The information they gather about a corrupt politician takes them to the world of high-class prostitutes and ruthless drug barons. Upon seeing the apartment of one of those prostitutes (Rachel Ward), Sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall (I know, I know) and when she finds the body of a woman with her face shot in one of the rooms, she thinks . It's her. (Well, I said it was a movie that loved movies). The scene in which she walks on him works perfectly, even if you've seen the original. The film is full of good touches, particularly I like the war history of Charles Durning, acted subtly and filmed in sharp contrast to Sharkey's abduction and torture, which is properly severe and brutal. I must mention Vittorio Gassman and Henry Silva as two disparate but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming characteristics. They are "full of" every time they are on the screen and they are not a loss to society when their time comes, the end of Mr. Silva is really special. As mentioned, this is a Clint Eastwood movie that Clint never made. The greatest compliment I can do with "Sharkey's Machine" is to point out that, in my opinion, Clint Eastwood could not have done it better. The soundtrack is of an equal level of high, with Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other first class artists. Randy Crawford's "life on the street" plays behind the title sequence, and I can never hear it without, in my opinion, seeing Sharkey walking on the sidewalk. Like other correspondents, I never understood why this movie was a bit unsuccessful. I hope it is due to a critical review, especially at a time when so many films and police shows without a quarter of their energy, freshness and pure joy. Vivre are praised from the rooftops. If you're ever tempted to think of Burt Reynolds as a one-trick pony burned, place "Sharkey's Machine" on your video machine. I promise you will not be disappointed.
