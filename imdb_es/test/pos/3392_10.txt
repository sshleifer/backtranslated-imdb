Even for a 17-year-old student who loves history and glimpsed emotion and excitement in the childhood years of this series, his arrival on DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South is really a series about friendship, love, honor ... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I saw a look at this series on television when I was about 8 years old. I thought that this seems exciting. Too bad, I never had the opportunity to watch book one and two on television in the Netherlands. When Book Three was issued as a late-night series in the Netherlands in the summer of 2004, I knew I had to watch the other two series. For most people, book three was a big disappointment, to my knowledge. Well, since I've seen the book one on DVD, I must say that until now it is the best of the 3 complete books. For all the young people who only see the luxury films like The Patriot "Oh America for freedom" there is a more realistic vision to see for them here ...
