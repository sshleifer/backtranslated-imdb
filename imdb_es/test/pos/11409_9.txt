I was recently at a pajamas birthday party with five other girls my age (eleven). All of us, thinking it would be a harmless little movie like Jaws decided to rent it together with Rat Race. (We saw the Rat Race after When a stranger calls to relieve our fear). We put the movie at 11:00 at night and we went to bed in our sleeping bags hidden behind the sheets for most of the time. I screamed five times, which is unusual for me, as the movies scare me, but never enough to scream. <br /> <br /> We were all terrified of leaving the bedroom, since we were all positive, the Stalker (Jenkins as we call it for some reason) would reach us. I played a bad trick; Once everyone fell asleep, once Rat Race ended, I hid under my sleeping bag and said in a low and humble voice: "HAVE YOU REVISED THE CHILD?" They all screamed like nuts and they were so scared. In general, I would rate this movie with a 9. The only thing I did not like was that 1. There were too many false alarms when Jill believes the Stalker is there and 2. The children never woke up during the whole event until Jenkins kidnapped them and hid in the closet, at which point all they did was cry like babies. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the thriller. But one thing: I AM NOT BABYSITTING PAST 9:00 PM NEVER AGAIN AGAIN!
