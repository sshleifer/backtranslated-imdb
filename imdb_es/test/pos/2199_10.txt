The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers such as Charles Dickens and more contemporary writers such as Edward Gory. As a musical, it naturally looks more like the musical Les Mis√©rables. Both deal with the bleak effects of poverty in the Industrial Revolution and the collapse of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in a very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the composer who can adapt to any style. To be sure, it has had its successes and failures, but there is one thing about its programs that can always be counted on: they will be something unique. Who would have thought that someone would write a musical about a barber who cuts people's throats and turns them into meat pies? Sondheim did it, and he did it wonderfully. The whole show takes place in a factory, to suggest the ever-present catastrophic effects of the misery of those who are at the bottom of society, and this satisfies the needs of the show perfectly. The walkways and handrails move to suggest streets, corridors and bridges. The techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh, with visual hands and configuration changes. Then, to top it off, choose the great Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn with his operatic baritone voice, like the killer Todd, and you have a stellar musical vehicle. The rest of the cast moves perfectly through the cliches of the love story to perfection, except for Johanna and Pirelli, who sound too forced. If Johanna and Pirelli from the Broadway show could be here, it would be perfect. Hearn performs while singing more than Len Cariou on the OBC album, and the accents do not sound so forced here. In spite of everything, Sondheim's score never fails to underline the dark seriousness of the story. As I said, it can adapt to any style. In Follies, it imitates the style of the shows of the 30s and 40s, in Pacific Overtures captures the subtle art of Asian music, Into the Woods draws the attention of the 32 Disney-style bars, and Assassins covers the history of music U.S. Here, however, he does wonders in making his score clearly English, from lounge songs to operatic duets and soliloquies to society waltzes to Gilbert / Sullivan style patterns. And still, the show is still extremely serious, although it provokes more laughter than any musical comedy. Still, it is a grim warning about the evils of revenge. This is where this film makes a mistake, by cutting Judge's solo in which he is scourged because of his crimes. Without that, the judge is just a conventional villain, and the point of this film is that there are no direct villains. Both Todd and the judge learn, too late, the horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions, and Todd loses everything in his obsession. This is due to the chilling repetition of the bleak but dazzling Sweeney Todd Ballad, which ends the show with Todd and Lovett coming out of the grave to tell us that the ending is the same: in a world full of Sweeneys, revenge only breeds revenge . "Go to the story of Sweeney Todd, serve a dark, vengeful God, seek revenge can lead to hell, but everyone does, and rarely as well as Sweeney, as Sweeney Todd, the diabolical barber of Fleet Street."
