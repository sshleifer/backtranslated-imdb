It is a mistake to refer to any movie of this era as a horror movie. Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as dark fantasies taken from the works of early German romantics such as E. T. Hoffman and others. In "Der Mude Tod" by Fritz Lang (also from 1921) the personified death removes a young man from his girlfriend, but in Lang's film the destiny of the characters can not be mitigated by the behavior. None of the young lovers deserve to die, but they are destined to circumstances to meet only in death. <br /> <br /> In Victor Seastrom's "Korkarlen", however, repentance is always an option. Fate can be altered, and deferred death, through the choices of the characters. Although the scenes of Phantom Carriage collecting souls are genuinely mysterious, these horrible images of Death as the great leveler are compromised by the offer of Death in the true monster of this story, David Holm, a brutal drunkard who, due to a perverse hatred humanity, transmits tuberculosis and emotional misery to all the people with whom it comes into contact. <br /> <br /> New Year's Eve Holm is down in a fight with a drinking partner. As the first person to die at midnight, Holm must become the driver of the Phantom Chariot and collect souls during the new year. The Phantom Carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who had initiated Holm on his way to ruin, comes by his soul and takes him on a journey of personal discovery. Along the way, Holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my disappointment with the end of the film is a critique of Selma Lagerl√∂f's novel about which the film is found. based. But he would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape his destiny, and see that his repentance comes too late to prevent his wife from poisoning her two children and herself, and to see Holm suffer the consequences of his sins at be forced to collect their souls. It would have been an adequate punishment and a more immense horror than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterable nature of destiny is not the message; The redemption is. The driver of the carriage allows the spirit of Holm to return to his body, and rescues his family at the precise moment. His repentance smells of Scrooge's repentance in "A Christmas Tale." <br /> <br /> If the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the images of the film. The special effects are amazing when measured according to the standards of the day, and are still maintained, which is more miraculous if one considers that these double exposures were created inside a camera with a crank. In addition, the restored movie on the new Tartan DVD looks fabulous.
