There are many movies now on DVD, but the producers had forgotten some important titles for many viewers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the wide-screen era, deserved the great successes of the great epics. Many people of my generation learned a lot about the history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas. (The first time I heard of them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), the same thing happened to me. Egypt or Rome saw many "bad" epics of the time. many production values, excellent use of color (De Luxe color was more Brigit and sharp than the common Technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong, but in any case, the film was made to give us an idea of ​​life in the Ancient Egypt and was In a way, the engine to go out and buy the novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best, if not the best historical novel ever published. The excellent score of Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann was also outstanding. I saw this movie many times as a child, it was not the blockbuster what the Fox studios wanted after the huge success of The Robe, in CinemaScope and Stereo it was an amazing show. I have the Lasser Disc.m version The only way to see Ito in its wdises screen format. Soon hope will appear.
