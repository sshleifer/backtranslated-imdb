This movie is the one you fall in love with. Alfred Hitchcock will always remain above any director of his time. The most influential aspects about his films are pure simplicity and Gripping Drama. The other best thing about Hitchcock films is Definite & Gripping End. <br /> <br /> Anything that is said about "The man who knew too much" is less. The cinematography, the acting, the dialogues and the camera works are magnificent in this film. The song "Que Sera Sera" will finally remain in our memories for life. The movie is so nice from beginning to end that we never know when it ends. Rarely would Hitchcock include humor in his films, this film has comic scenes that fit into the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely brilliant and as good as Vertigo.
