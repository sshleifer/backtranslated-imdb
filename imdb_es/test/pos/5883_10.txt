This film tells the stories of several couples who are facing life after the Second World War. Through many moving accounts, the public learns how the War has changed people, while their human spirit triumphed. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where a young serviceman, who returned home as a double amputee (after losing both arms to the elbow) is sure it would not be good for his girlfriend, who still wants to marry him. His girl simply said that she would help him with the things he could not do, but that they would be fine together. Moved by this true demonstration of love, the man hugs his girlfriend with tears. <br /> <br /> The scene in which a service man asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. When initially dismissed as "high risk," a senior banking official takes over and says, "You fought for our country and you kept us safe, that's good enough for me, your loan is approved!" "The best years of our lives" won 6 Oscars, including a special statue for the disabled actor that showed us that life continues and will continue to be worth living, even with a serious disability. This movie is a joy to watch again and again. A true classic! Highly recommended!
