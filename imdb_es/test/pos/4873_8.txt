Remember that friend in college who always insisted that you rent the rarest movie possible? This is the movie I would have done if I had the chance. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you exactly what Sea of ​​Dust was about. It pretends to be the story of a doctor who is dragged by strange events in the "Black Forest". He goes there to help, but ends up getting caught between two young women, who seem to like it. But that's just scratching the surface. This is the kind of movie where random things happen ... and it's not a good thing. People are constantly beaten and stabbed. There are a couple of little girls who seem to have left The Shining. Tom Savini is a kind of imaginary religious figure who decides that he no longer wants to be imaginary. He has a plan to conquer the world by sharing the suffering of Jesus. <br /> <br /> At some level, this is a movie about sex. It is one without nudity, which was a disappointment, but there is no doubt of intention. On another whole level, it is a drug addict's paradise. Unexpected things happen so often that they stop being unexpected. When the doctor walks the birth channel of his girlfriend to be reborn, it will simply be attributed to the crazy nature of the film. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the movie is pretty neat. Some of the points are hammered again and again. If you are seeing it with a group of drugged friends, this could be an asset.
