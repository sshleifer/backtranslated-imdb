I admit that this movie was horrible, corny, sexist, poorly folded and badly edited, but I loved it anyway. The first time I saw this movie was when I was 14, and it has stayed with me ever since. For your information, this is very similar to hard porn as a souvenir. It certainly made my juices flow. This film gives a new meaning to Swedish erotica. It's a funny version of human sexuality seen by hot aliens who, I believe, are only looking for sperm for their dying race.
