We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film and Video Festival and we liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie deepened the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and, most importantly, fear of our own deficiencies. <br /> <br /> The three main actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo fit well with their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three, as it seemed real. <br /> <br /> I think Barbora Bobulova is a standout. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an easy way out. A greeting to the Italian team that put together this movie. Highly recommended
