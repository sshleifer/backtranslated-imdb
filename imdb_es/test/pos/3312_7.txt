Although dated, this movie is definitely worth seeing. I saw it about eight times when I was a teenager when it opened and changed my life ... I just HAD to live in New York. He has excellent opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis singing "Romance is still ... best of all ..." that rivals those of West Side Story. There is a pretty forced performance of the first REAL supermodel in the world, Suzy Parker (sorry, Janice D.), but it's great! It also offers a bit of information about the American customs of the late 1950s: our obsession with (and repression of) sex (in the workplace, nothing less!), Romance and marriage before the liberation of women. It represents an era in which New York was at its best and a super malicious performance by Joan Crawford is just the icing on the cake.
