Ali G earned his fame on the small screen, although the big screen has not lost either. Ali G Indahouse is a fun and funny laugh per second, like on the small screen. He has not lost any of his character or stupidity, and behind all that, none of the films is a fluff without a brain either. The human side of Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of ​​Ali G running for PM is bright, fresh and fun, and the incessant stupidity of Staines gangster man mixes well with the harsh world of politics. . The movie is also full of brilliant new characters, and instead of one interview after another, we get a proper comedy movie that never gets repetitive or boring. So, why did not I give him ten stars? Well, the end was fun, but also failed and failed, none of that made sense. And in part, the film became offensive in trying to be funny, but that's Ali G for you, if it's not offensive, it's not in itself and it's totally ruined. The big screen debut of Ali G was a success in my opinion, and should have entered the average rating range of 6-7 in IMDb. But it could have gotten worse too, and people are forced to have varied opinions, especially in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> In general, Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious British comedy at its best, and More fun, and the smartest. A great job! 9/10
