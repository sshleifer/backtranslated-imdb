This is a film so revered and studied, a classic among the many of Hitchcock, you do not have to convince him to want to see him again. However, you think: can it stand even when the huge trick of the plot (and intelligent and surprising) is not a surprise? <br /> <br /> Yes. <br /> <br /> And to begin with, there is The beginning, a profoundly beautiful and skillful story of the whole story, the essence of it. Two taxis, two men with their shoes, each one walking on the train, sitting facing each other, and, alas, a mistake, a little push, and the conversation begins, and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, as it is in many horror and suspense movies, light and cheerful. However, we know that when entering the film this will not be the case, so we are already worried. After all, what will go wrong? <br /> <br /> A lot. In the style of Hitchcock, he is a purely innocent man (almost always a man) who faces injustice, who is trapped by circumstances that threaten what is most valuable to him. The innocent in this case, the tennis player Guy Haynes, is played with an innocence that is credible: his collegiate courtesy in that first scene, for example, when he realizes that the other man is a little cuckoo, is just what you or I could do. The not so innocent man is the spoiled, self-absorbed and frighteningly intelligent child, Bruno Anthony, played with absolute brilliance by Robert Walker. (This strange performance is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock Witcho, played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho). So from scene one, on the train (and the train, really beautiful!), We have both tracks and we have the mind. A story from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote the books behind the two films by Mr. Ripley. And it does not hurt that the script was co-written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economics and intelligent dialogue. And the crime. <br /> <br /> And, of course, there is something more than the first scene. What score? Well, that smart person from the daughter of a senator (I thought it was fantastic) is Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, who is still with us (as of 2009, she also had a role in Psycho). And there is a characteristic reference point for a key scene in the movie: the tennis courts in the Hamptons, which we know as the site of the US Open. The last fantastic complete scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves in a kind of slow and constant montage, accumulating the suspense making it surreal. The fear gets fatter positively with the children who laugh and the old man who crawls underneath everything. And when it collapses in an accident, everything is projected on a set, one of the most naturalistic uses of a director known for not caring about the realism of his back projections. <br /> <br /> The photography is perfect. Hollywood impresses without being so stylized (as in some noir movies) that it is an object in its own right. Look again at the first scene, or the shooting (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the public believes is murder. This is a sophisticated construction. When we are not completely surprised that Bruno is in bed, that only proves that the director has us on alert. Something unexpected is always expected. <br /> <br /> Are there faults? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falsehood you can accept (or embrace) as a beautiful style. The scene in which Bruno is suffocating the old woman at a party is brilliant (the woman, played by Norma Varden, is a caricature so believable that it takes your breath away) and is tarnished by looking at the senator's daughter and becoming a deadly trance for his glasses, and his resemblance to his previous victim. This is an idea of ​​mid-twentieth-century psychology that invades many of Hitchcock's efforts. (The end of Psycho, to begin with.) <br /> <br /> The Wikipedia article on the film intelligently emphasizes the consistent duplication of things in the film, from the main characters to the murder victim and the daughter of the senator. This echoes in many ways: two men take him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park, and so on. You can do too much of this, but it provides an aesthetic consistency above and below our conscience. Do not forget, there are supposed to be two murders: it's the lack of the second murder, the inability to create a duplication in that case, which makes Bruno unravel. <br /> <br /> Walker, the actor had emotional problems and institutionalized a year before this film was shot and, just after, died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts. Although he appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his concert tour. Farley Granger had a long career that never saw him enter real stardom, although his style may have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works, especially in They Live by Night. <br /> <br /> And if you look at this for the first or third time, look for the chilling and hilarious scene in the tennis match where the heads of the crowd move from side to side in unison, except Bruno's. He is looking outward without moving his head directly towards us. As the preview of the film says, after this movie, you will not talk to "strangers on a train".
