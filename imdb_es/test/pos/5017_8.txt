What is in certain films that generate such polar opposing reactions? <br /> <br /> Some people here have called High Roller "disgusting". Some have called it "extraordinary" (like me, actually). <br /> <br /> Why? I think it's because movies like this do not make heroes become idiots, or the glamor of degeneracy, and some people just can not deal with that emotionally. They NEED a hero. And I would also add that if they are players or poker players, they can feel personally betrayed when their existence is not justified. <br /> <br /> High Roller NOT in a poker movie. It is a movie of people. It's not perfect, but it looks good, it's well written and it acted beautifully. And best of all, it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's what makes some people so angry.
