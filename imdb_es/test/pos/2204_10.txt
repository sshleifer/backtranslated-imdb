Even if you are not a "theater person", I recommend you see this. Based on a play by the same name by Christopher Bond (which, in turn, had been based on an ancient legend of London), Sondheim did a wonderful job in bringing it to the stage of musical theater. The score is simply incredible: by far, the best in Sondheim, and probably one of the best written scores for a musical. The show was broadcast extremely well, my only complaint is that Betsy Joscelyn plays Johanna. She's good, though, and she's a very versatile actress, but she just does not sing "Greenfinch and Linnet Bird" too well. But other than that, everything is phenomenal: Angela Lansbury * played * Ms. Lovette's role, and she does it very well. George Hearn was a good replacement for Len Cariou in the lead role, and Ken Jennings offers a great performance as Tobias. The end will give you chills. A highlight for a wonderful show.
