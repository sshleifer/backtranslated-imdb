I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen so far for Naruto. The action was much better than the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to you at a faster pace. It was amazing, the choreographer was excellent and most of the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The story line is something new for Naruto. but it's basically the same as the first movie. in the series you see them fight against other ninjas, but in the movies (1 + 2) you see them fighting against the machine of massive destruction. It's good to see them fighting against something that is not ninja, and it was great to see another power that is not chakra. and how other people from other lands fight across the ocean. Sakura also finally killed someone who is stronger than her. (She has really become strong) It was much better than the fillings of the series I'm seeing now. When you watch this movie, the fast action scene will surely make your heart beat. With new jutsu and claw in the movie, you know it's good. And the music was good too, but I think I'm missing something. But the final theme was an advantage. (Dind Dong Dang) I think it was a very good song. I recommend it totally. <br /> <br /> In general I give this movie a 10, because I love it. If you decide to see it, enjoy it. Hahaha
