I saw the movie at the cinema when it was released, then I watched the VHS tape over the years and, while walking through Target, I saw this DVD with "Pushing Tin" for the exorbitant $ 5.50. <br /> <br /> There's something about this comedy that really caught my attention: how Kelsey Grammar, "with a tattoo on his own", is an unorthodox commander who inherits a rusty diesel submarine and a gang of fanatics and misfits. He faces the best of the Navy, a nuclear attack submarine from Los Angeles, and his former captain (Wm Macy). <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern plays the bad guy, Rip Torn, the admiral who performs the exercise, if he does not. Do not laugh hysterically during the segment "run in silence" with the cook, well, you have a different kind of humor than mine. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, the operator says "DB" without explanation, apparently it is an internal knowledge obtained from a former diver's advisor. Thanks to Google, I learned that with the arrival of nuclear submarines the old salts would use the "DB" pins - Diesel Boats Forever. <br /> <br /> A friend of the Navy said that many of the technical aspects are not correct, but who cares, is one of the funniest movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> I do not. You think a clairvoyant is needed to know who will win in this exercise!
