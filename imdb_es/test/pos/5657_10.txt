This is one of the most anti-traditional war movies I've seen. Instead of the typical movies that emphasize glory and perhaps superhuman characters (like John Wayne), this film is the exact opposite: it highlights the dehumanization that ALSO occurs in the war. History refers to the Japanese who are stranded in the Philippines after the United States returned in late 1944 and early 1945. By the time the film begins, the Japanese have clearly been beaten, but due to the insane logic of Bushido , you can not afford to consider them. Surrender. In one of the many moving moments, at the beginning of the film the main character is told to report to the hospital, since he is not able to fight because of his tuberculosis. The problem is that the hospital will not accept it, so his commander tells him to go to the hospital one more time. And if they do not accept it, they should fly with a grenade! Well, this happens only in the first five minutes of the movie; much worse things happen to this soldier and the few laggards because they will not surrender. In addition, there is a case in the film in which a soldier DOES try to surrender but is shot to death. This happened much later in the war because very often the Japanese soldiers surrendered themselves to explode when they approached. In addition, the film shows the most vivid representation of starvation and madness that accompanies any movie you've seen. In addition, cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal accompany this film very rough, realistic and depressing. You just could not have made a better movie of this kind. Horrible but great.
