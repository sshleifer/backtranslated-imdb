After I read that, at the time of its release in 2002, it was said that its budget of $ 47 million, or 327,000,000 FRF, made it the most expensive French film in history. However, Astérix et Obélix contre César (1999) had a budget of $ 48 million, or 274,620,000 FRF, which supposedly made it the most expensive French film in history. " Colorful of everything I've seen. I loved the sets, the clothes (especially those of Cleopatra) and the atmosphere of the movie! He is so happy and cheerful! I found the jokes smart and fun and I have to consider that this movie is in my favorite comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> The cast is also excellent, with Monica Bellucci (who is very beautiful like Cleopatra) Gérard Depardieu, (great Obelix! Christian Clavier, Jamel Debbouze (I saw for the first time in "Amélie Poulain") , among others! :) <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie even for people who do not. I do not know Asterix and Obelix comics. You will have a lot of fun! :) <br /> <br /> also known as "Asterix and Obelix: Missão cleópatra" - Brazil
