The representation of the marines in this movie is right. The action scenes are some of the best produced in content accuracy. The uniforms and armament of the American and German troops were perfect. The costumes and armament of the Berbers were also perfectly accurate. This film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes that show Roosevelt firing and the rifles he was using were beautiful. Obtaining so many vintage weapons in such good shape is a testament to the attention to detail and presentation in which this film should be considered. Millius is a genius.
