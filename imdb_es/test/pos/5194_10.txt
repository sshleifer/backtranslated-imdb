Describing Stalingrad as a war movie can be a bit inaccurate. Surely it focuses on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history, in the most extensive theater of the most expensive war in terms of lives, money and material that has ever happened. Yes, it contains action scenes that represent bitter battles and terrible destruction. The visceral narrative and the harsh images make it more than a war movie, even more than a film against the war. Stalingrad is, instead, a film about absolute and undeniable hell. <br /> <br /> The film is full of visual descriptions of the worst kind of war, one that is intensely personal and close, where days are spent taking an apple from the city. , just to have it resumed in a surprise assault. The early form of modern urban warfare that the Germans called Rattenkrieg (Rat Warfare) is described in brutal and intransigent terms. The war of the characters in the tunnels of the sewers, the courtyards of railroad and of building in building in the hell of the bomb of the ruined Stalingrad, only to be defeated by the implacable Russian winter. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the theme of Nazism and the German vilification in that period in the way that many other films from Germany and the rest of the world do. His characters are a group of soldiers dragged by the winds of war and who simply try to go out with themselves and with as many of their living companions as possible. The characters do not fight the Soviets for any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet Communism, nor for a great dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They fight only because if they do not, the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy does not, then their own officers will certainly do so for refusing to fight. This portrait adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> A kind of ground-based companion for Das Boot, Stalingrad frames the epic struggle of World War II from a personal perspective and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a kind of tragic hero for the circumstances and a brutal government that would pervert its sacrifice.
