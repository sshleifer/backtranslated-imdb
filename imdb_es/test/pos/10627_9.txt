I totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who criticized the movie. After reading the book, I was impressed with it although this is a kind of literature that you really can not LOVE (similar to the writing of Hubert Selby). I expected to be surprised, but the effect was more subtle than this. Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi-layered character. There are many scenes that focus totally on her and her subtle changes, and I can imagine a few actresses who would do well, with so much contempt for their own reputation or image. There is this coldness, distance, cruelty and, at the same time, there is impotence, pain and pain. There is a person who is in control and controlled at the same time. Maybe this is not realistic, although when you read the newspaper you will read much worse than this, but there is a truth that is very difficult to bear. I think it's an excellent movie, but I did not like seeing it. It's not boring, but there are times when I wanted it to end. By the way, his male counterpart is also very well acted (and I think also well chosen).
