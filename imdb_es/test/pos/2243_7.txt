Starting where he left off, Doctor Who, Rose, his alternate dad, Mickey, his alternate counterpart Ricky, and Mickey's small gang of rebels are at the mercy of this version of Cybernetics, this second part of the 2 Cybernetic arc. The episode feels more like an episode of Doctor Who, unlike the previous part that honestly felt more like an episode of the "Sliders" show, which was a great program in its own right. The bow as a whole was nice enough to subscribe to the maxim of ANY Who is good Who, but at the same time it is inevitable that this compares with the Dalek episode of the previous series. And such comparisons would only make it seem like a minor job, just as it is. I feel that this story could have been made in an episode. Remember that in the first part of the review I said that this kind of stories that deal with alternative realities usually have no lasting repercussions, well, that is not the case here, but the changes in general feel marked and do not really agree with character. <Br /> <br /> My rating: C +
