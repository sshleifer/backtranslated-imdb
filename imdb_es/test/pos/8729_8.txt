I'm surprised by the relatively low rating that this movie has. It is a comedy and romance film shot by someone besides Billy Wilder, but he does a very good job and even won an Oscar. <br /> <br /> It is Ingrid Bergman's first film in the United States since the 1950s and even though she is no longer the young bomb that was in her early films, she presents a difficult role quite generously. This movie shows that he had multiple talents beyond his good looks. <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn, who won an Oscar in this, her first film, since the supporting actress is very good as the latest sophisticated and quirky lover of the Playboy Dentist, love them and let them Walter Mathaw. Goldie is a delight for all the senses in this role that with a great cast made her a star for this first career prize. <br /> <br /> This movie is not very deep, but it is a jewel that has stood out. The test of time very well. I'm not sure why his average is as low as I give him a solid 8.
