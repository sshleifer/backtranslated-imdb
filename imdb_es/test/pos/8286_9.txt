"The Chipmunk Adventure" is one of the best animated films of the 80s. Alvin and the Chipmunks always interested me, since they were what really got me into rock and roll. None of the Chipmunks have bad traits. Alvin is really the star and has all the cool looks. Theodore is the sensitive lover. Then there's Simon (my personal favorite), the smart one who is often a party lover. I also like the Chipettes a lot. There's Brittany, who, like Alvin, is one who's always trying to be so popular. Then there's Eleanor, who, like Theodore, is sweet, sensitive and loves food. Janette is the only Chipette who does not look much like her counterpart; She is very naive and very clumsy. <br /> <br /> In Chipmunks' first full-length movie, David Seville goes on a business trip to Europe, and leaves the guys with Miss Miller while he's gone. While playing an arcade game, Alvin loses against Brittany and then says that if he had the money, he would compete with Brittany around the world for real. Without the knowledge of the children, a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister, Claudia, who have been trying to find a clever way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash, heard this conversation and said they would let them run Around the world for $ 100,000. Alvin and Brittany accept it and go on the run. <br /> <br /> This adventure movie has many great songs. "Off to See the World" created for an appropriate theme for the movie. Then there is "Getting Lucky", one of my favorite songs in the movie. "My Mother" is probably the most brazen song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "Wooly Bully" is the only cover song used in the film (the rest was completely original). Then, of course, there is "The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll", which, in my opinion, has to be one of the best musical numbers in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> I used to watch this movie very often, until my recorded tape of her died. Although I still watch the movie. This is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on vacation to a foreign country for the first time. It will give you an idea of ​​what kind of things you would expect from a trip around the world. Definitely one of my childhood films, and one that I would recommend to fans of the 80s and Alvin & the Chipmunks.
