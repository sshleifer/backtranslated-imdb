GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie linking game of all time, but is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter that has hit the gaming console market. If you are not aware of the plot of this game, that is not a problem, since it is essential that it is the same James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was launched in 1995, two years before the launch of this game. <br /> <br /> This is a game that is full of techniques and styles that would be imitated in many future games, and gives the player a wide variety of challenging objectives and challenges. The A.I. it is intelligent (especially in more difficult configurations) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulties for any player. <br /> <br /> The introduction of logical hit points on your enemies is a great feature. Even the bosses in this game can be brought down with a well-aimed shot to the head. It is this kind of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak away, sneak out, sneak out the henchmen as you go, or give alarms and have to go through massive shootings. Because of this, there are many ways to improve the game and unlimited possibilities of how to perform your tasks. AKA: You can take easy ways or difficult ways to overcome the levels ... and if you do not have a strategy guide, you will have to discover those paths for yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you wish) to waste a day). <br /> <br /> This is one of those games that the more you play, the more you can assess your contributions to the gaming industry. Every time I play it I realize aspects that have been replicated in many of the following FPS games. So, if you have a Nintendo 64, dust off that imbecile and ask for a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and as a casual player, I can say that this game is highly recommended for all Those who want to get in the shoes of James Bond, or simply enjoy an impressive and intense gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Also be sure to be aware of your brother game, Perfect Dark, which is also found on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar uses of weapons.)
