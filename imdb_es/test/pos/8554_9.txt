I stumbled across this movie while changing the channels on the teevee late one night. It has continued to interest me some twenty years later, due to the important lesson of real life that teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And although it tells a true story that takes place in World War II, it is amazingly appropriate for the ugly things that happen in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you thought that the "ethnic cleansing" as it is called today, has something to do with race or ethnic origin, you will think differently after seeing this story. <br /> <br /> I suppose I had been naive enough to think that evil follows any set of prescribed rules. Evil is the same as evil. <br /> <br /> This movie teaches a valuable lesson, and I highly recommend it, for example. Groups of churches or civil rights organizations. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's too easy to find and rent, but I'd really like to see it again, because there is an incredible scene in it that gives a totally involuntary but interesting view of the banal complexities of the "experience" of the race. " In this scene, the protaganist, who was taken prisoner by the Nazis at the beginning of the war, is "discovered" by an authority of the SS race, and entered into a room. There the two play a kind of guessing game, where the SS officer can determine where our hero comes from (the character of Anthony Quinn) and where his ancestors come from. Well, "come and discover" that Quinn's character is not a member of an "inferior" race after all, but on the contrary, he is a perfect and archetypal arian! Which does not mean much to the character of Quinn, who is more interested in talking about the cities, rivers and mountain ranges that the SS guy had just named ... However, being a perfect Aryan archetype has its advantages . Among other things, you can leave your job in a slave labor factory where you use striped rags, and in a slave modeling job where you can wear custom-made Nazi uniforms. Yes, it sure is a better concert for a guy who always appreciated wearing nice clothes ... until the allied armies arrive and recognize his face by the covers of magazines. <br /> <br />
