Well, it's safe to say that subconscious cruelty is a rare movie. Supposedly a perception of the human mind, subconscious cruelty comprises four macabre and strange tales of the extreme. The first segment, entitled 'Ovarian Eyeball' is really just a warm-up, but it's good because it gives the viewer an idea of ​​what to expect from the next three segments. Just see a naked woman lying on a table, while another woman cuts her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball! I have no idea what the point is, but it certainly does for a visceral visualization. The following story is the best of the group, and deals with the theme of the "old" sick movie of incest. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He feels rejected for his pregnancy; however, he wants to have sex with her and, naturally, gets away with it. This story is highlighted by the monotonous and "in fact" narrative, as well as by the end, which does not stop offering the shocks. This segment is well executed, well filmed and easily the highlight of Subconscious Cruelty. <br /> <br /> Naturally, the next two sections are not as good as the second; so the only way to get there is down, but director Karim Hussain still manages to get something out of the bag before the movie ends. However, he does not do so immediately, since the third segment is the weakest in the movie and he simply sees that many people have sex with the floor. It is very surreal, and therefore memorable for the same reason; but there does not seem to be much point to see it, and I wanted something more morbid after the second section. However, the film ends at a high point, while I'm not entirely sure what the point was, the final segment presents the best images of the film. This segment focuses on religion, and certainly not for anyone who values ​​it. Director Karim Hussain has achieved something here: while this collection of four 'extreme' stories do not come together as a whole, the film almost looks tasteful when filmed in such an eloquent and eye-catching way. The director seems to have been imitating the highly respected surrealist director Luis Buñuel, although with gore, rape and incest; And if you ask me, he has not done a bad job. Not for everyone, but definitely worth it for extreme fans!
