Even a decade after "Frontline" aired on ABC, as far as I can tell, the "topical" programs continue to use the same tricks again and again. Time and again, "Today Tonight" and "A Current Affair" are hidden behind the facade of journalistic professionalism, and yet we are fed only by tired stories about weight loss and unreliable merchants, shameless network promotions. and useless sunsets of celebrities. -pieces. Having often been subjected to that void without entertainment between 'The Simpsons' at 6:00 PM and 'Sale of the Century' (or 'Temptation') at 7:00 PM, I was very aware of the little tricks that these The shows would use to attract ratings. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, four comedians on the rise? Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner? They were also very aware of all this, and created their frustrations in one of the most hilariously funny media satires I've ever seen on TV. The four artists had already met with comedy success, their most memorable television season was at 'The Late Show', the brilliant Saturday night variety show that lasted two seasons from 1992 to 1993, and also featured comedians Mick Molloy, Tony Martin, Jason Stephens and Judith Lucy. <br /> <br /> "Frontline" has a set of colorful characters, each with its own distinct and peculiar personality. The current theme program is headed by Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), an ambitious, pretentious and silly narcissist. Mike works under the illusion that the show is playing a vital role for society. He is always convinced that they "maintain their journalistic integrity". and its executive producers have excelled in making him believe that. Mike is basically a puppet to take the news to the people; from time to time he realizes that he is being guided by the nose, but generally this thought is eliminated by appeals to his vanity or the promises of a promotion. <br /> <br /> Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) is the oldest Reporter in the program. She is constantly worried about her appearance and her public profile, and, if you have to believe the rumors, she has had a romantic relationship with almost every male celebrity in existence. Another equally loving reporter, Marty Di Stasio, is played by Tiriel Mora, who memorably played the inept lawyer Dennis Denuto in the Australian comedy classic, 'The Castle'. Emma Ward (Alison Whyte) is the line producer on the show, and the only bright light of morality on the "Frontline" set. Then there is the highly amusing meteorologist, Geoffrey Salter (Santo Cilauro), Mike's best friend and confidant. Geoff makes a living from always agreeing with Mike's opinion, and from laughing out loud at his jokes before admitting he does not get them. <br /> <br /> In each of the series of three seasons, we are invited to a Different EP, Executive Producer. Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence), who unfortunately died in 1995, directs the program during season 1. He has a good moral, and is always kind to his employees, and yet he is more than willing to put this aside. please the high ratings. Sam Murphy (Kevin J. Wilson) arrives on the set in Season 2, a hard, soft-spoken producer who knows exactly how to chain Mike; The last episode of the second season, when Mike finally gets the best of him, is a classic moment. Graeme "Prowsey" Prowse (Steve Bisley), EP of the third season, is raw, nasty and blatantly sexist. It is, therefore, extraordinary that you eventually come to love you. <br /> <br /> With its cast of exaggerated and distinctive characters, "Frontline" has a lot of fun satirizing topical programs and their dubious methods to get scores. . Many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply, often implementing many ideas from the plot of recent real-life situations, but this never detracts from the program's current ten years later. Celebrity cameos are plentiful, with some of the most memorable appearances, such as Pauline Hanson, Don Burke and Jon English. Beware the hilarious appearance of Harry Shearer in the episode of Season 2 "Changing the face of current affairs," playing Larry Hadges, an American hired by the network to reform the program. <br /> <br /> Particularly in the third season, I noticed that "Frontline" had an extremely rough form of black humor, uncharacteristic for such a cheerful comedy show. The genuinely funny moments are born of Brooke being surreptitiously bribed to abort, murdering a crazed gunman and Mike treacherously betraying the hopes and dreams of his best friend, only to be told he is a good friend. The final minute of the series? Minus one additional scene during the credits, which was probably added only in the event of a fourth season? It was probably the best and blackest ending of a comedy series I've seen. <br /> <br /> Below is a very tentative list of my five favorite episodes of "Frontline", but, make no mistake, all a half hour is an absolutely hilarious and forceful satire. <br /> <br /> 1) "The Siege" (Season 1) <br /> <br /> 2) "Give 'em Enough Rope" (Season 2) <br /> <br /> 3) " Addict to fame "(Season 3) <br /> <br /> 4)" Basic Instincts "(Season 2) <br /> <br /> 5)" Add sex and stir "(Season 1)
