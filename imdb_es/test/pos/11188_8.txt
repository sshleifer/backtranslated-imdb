One of the classic low-budget films of the 70s, this movie was found in a video store in London for only 50p. (Interestingly, the package lists the movie star as 'Charles Bone', which sounds like a porn star, but once the role of the credits is obvious, the image is aligned on the far right of the TV screen , so that all the cast members lack the last letter of their names) <br /> <br /> From the moment the narrator presents us in an unconvincing way the situation in which the desperate tenants of a dirty apartment building in the city of New York know that you are waiting for a roller coaster ride fromage. The address is from the school 'Ed Wood one-take': if one or two extras looked at the camera crew, what the hell? <br /> <br /> The films end with a plot twist that puts The Usual Suspects to shame.
