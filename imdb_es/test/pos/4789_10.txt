Every time this movie used to be broadcast on nightly television in the late 70s and early 80s, I always had time to sit in front of the TV and watch it. To see the lovely Kate Jackson, the handsome Richard Long, the "great" Polly Bergen whom I've never seen anywhere else, except for this movie for television, the handsome Tom Bosley and another "great" who never I've seen out of this movie. , Celeste holme. This is truly the ship of love on a cruise to murder and make chaos and the boy was always good! And every time I saw him, he always forgot who the real murderer was. <br /> <br /> As expected, someone here is already criticizing the movie as if it really was a great help to anyone. This is a great television movie and it's worth watching it every time. I can not say that about half the movies I've seen this month. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the chance to see it on TV someday, which is not likely, see it. In light of "The Girl Most Likely To" that will finally be released this year on DVD, there may be hope for a DVD release of "Death Cruise."
