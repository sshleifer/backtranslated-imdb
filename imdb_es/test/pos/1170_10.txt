This movie is well launched, often silly and always fun. Lemmon and Matthau work their magical equipment perfectly. Brent Spiner is just a riot like the selfish tyrant of a cruise ship manager. From the first "hare krishna" to the last "you should pay fifty dollars for calling you two stallions", I thought this was a fun comedy totally entertaining
