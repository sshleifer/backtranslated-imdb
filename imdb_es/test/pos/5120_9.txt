I saw this movie just because I did not want to leave my 9 years old and her friend in the theater alone. Honestly, I went in hoping to enjoy a good nap, but I found myself fascinated by the movie. I would recommend it to anyone who asks! Roy's mother was on one of my favorite television shows of all time years ago, playing a siren (Maximum Bob). She was very cute in this movie. The three main characters were all excellent young actors. I also enjoyed watching and listening to Jimmy Buffet. The movie itself was quite beautiful, showing something of what makes Florida so great. I'm glad I ended up going to this movie. And to think, I was disappointed that I could not take them to see "Stick It." I think this was MUCH better!
