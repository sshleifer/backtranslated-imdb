Directed by the younger brother of the great director Leo McCarey, this is a pretty good short of Three Stooges, nominated for an Academy Award. Here the puppets are doctors called Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine and Dr. Howard. They are not the smartest doctors, but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they are managed for duty and humanity. <br /> <br /> I liked this short. It is not one of the best, but some moments are fun. A joke that is repeated more than once works every time. The part where the head of the hospital should operate is excellent. Saying more would spoil some of the jokes, so you must see for yourself. Just another short ticket from the Three Stooges.
