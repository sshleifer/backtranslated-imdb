The movie was good. Actually the only reason I saw him was Alan Rickman. Which he did not do with the southern accent, but he did quite well. I knew that Emma Thompson did really well, definitely took away the southern accent. I like the whole character in my opinion, none of them did wrong, another thing that I noticed. I have read all these comments and no one has commented on Alan 5 0 o'clock. What made it look even better and practically had one in the whole movie. I would give the movie a 9 out of 10. Another one of my opinions is that the movie would be better if there was no sex. I was still fine. I love the scene where he says "Aw sh * t" when he's sitting in his car and sees them in his mirror.
