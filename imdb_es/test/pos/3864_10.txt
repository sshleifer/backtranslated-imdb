Set in Paris in 1910, an old and rich opera singer decides to give her fortune to her beautiful cat Duchess (voiced by Eva Gabor) and her kittens, but the jealous butler Edgar comes up with a plan while kidnapping the cats. And he leaves them in the field. Fortunately for them, with the help of a stray cat and an independent cat named Thomas O'Malley (voiced by Phil Harris), it helps them get home, especially when meeting some of their good friends, such as the Scat Cat (with the voice of Scatman Crothers) and try to thwart. Edgar's plans. <br /> <br /> Very animated and avant-garde animated film about the death of Walt Disney with a couple of nice melodies like the memorable "Everybody wants to be a cat", good voice acting and a fabulous animation. Time even in these times of computer animation. It is not one of Disney's best animated films, but a Disney animated favorite and one of the few gems of his day that works well, highly recommended.
