I have not seen each and every one of the films that Burt Reynolds has made, but this (which I just saw for the third time) may be his best work. He suffers only from some slow stretches; Burt perhaps tried to make it more "artistic" than it should have been. On the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the usual clich√©s in the presentation of the role of "hard police" that plays (note, for example, the scene where you try to kiss Rachel Ward for the first time, or fear). it is expressed just before the final confrontation with the indestructible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and those two ninja killers are three of the most memorable villains of the suspense cops of the 80s. The film also has some extravagant touches, a surprising amount of humor, a brutal and exciting fist fight and many good shots directed. (***)
