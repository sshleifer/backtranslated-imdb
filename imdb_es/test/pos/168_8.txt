This nice and perverse 1980s teen body count film can not reach the astonishingly folded pinnacle of the deeply disturbing and criminally underestimated movie, "Devil Times Five," "Devil Times Five," but it's still a childish killer opus. The slender, but useful plot focuses on a trio of maladjusted men: two spoiled children and an angelic-looking, but angelic-looking child, all born during a solar eclipse on June 9, 1970. When the stranger The antisocial trio, which remains united in a tightly autonomous and exclusive circle, turns ten years old, suddenly they go crazy and declare an open season in the unfortunate and innocent local yokels of the old Californian suburb of Meadowvale. . The screenwriter and director Ed Hunt, the incompetent and incompetent hacker responsible for clunkers as wonderfully miserable as the wonderfully stunned "Starship Invasions", the unusually crazy parable of the watchman of Jesus Christ (!) "Alien Warrior" and the incredibly foolish "The Brain" "It does a pretty solid and capable job here: the killing scenes are plentiful and reasonably brutal (the arrow gag through the eyes is especially unpleasant), there's a lot of free nudity and soft sex, a considerable amount of tension is perfectly created and maintained, some pretty dolls of dark humor mark the twisted chaos and the surprising and somber end manages to be truly shaken. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first-class cast further elevates the procedures to the perfectly observable and absorbing: Jos√© Ferror as a small town doctor, the future of "Jake and the Fatman", TV star Joe Penny as an amateur astrologer, Lori Lethin from "The Prey" as the babysitter's heroine, Susan Strasberg as a perrael school teacher Michael Dudikoff, from "American Ninja", as a Chowderhead rider, and Cyril O'Reilly (the loner misanthropic vampire in the melancholy and melancholy "Dance of the Damned") as a lecherous teen boy who pockets while doing what you think with a hot naked girl in the back of a parked truck. Billy Jacoby (who starred in the direct scourge of the late '80s video as "Dr. Alien" and "Demonwarp"), Andy Freeman, and especially the strangely lovely Elizabeth Hoy, are really creepy and convincing like the terrible evil Chrysler troika and amorals of the rugrats. And, yes, that is none other than Julie Brown, the cheeky comedian who scored a surprising success in the Top 40 with the fun and novel song "The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun", as the charming, empty, full-bimbo redhead bimbo that It makes a great, totally strange, but still sizzling and very much appreciated naked striptease while dancing in your room with a loud rock song. In general, this baby is classified as a resistant and satisfying slasher element.
