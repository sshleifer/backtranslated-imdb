Yes, you can see the Babette Party as a kind of slap in the face of Puritan Christianity, but it is much more than that. The surface story of how a talented Parisian cook flees Paris after one of his revolutions by the middle classes and is on land in Jutland, in northern Denmark, is simply the fat that allows the development of the deeper story. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist, one of the small armies of people who are led from one pillar to another over the centuries by fatuous, vain and arrogant politicians, who kill beauty for profit , something that politics always does. the Arts, which simply institutionalizes creativity for propaganda purposes. <br /> <br /> Babette is in her last legs when she arrives at the small town where two virgin sisters reside who see their dwindling flock of devotees as their dead father pastor. They live on salted cod and black bread porridge. <br /> <br /> Babette shows these simple pious people that God is in pleasure and sensuality, as well as in mental purity and behavior. It also shows how that mental purity can lead to control the phenomenon, something we all know in these days of the neo-authoritarians in the government that would limit our personal freedoms because they are somehow a crime against the state, or as they would say. us, humanity. <br /> <br /> Babette prepares a French dinner to celebrate the centenary of the late Reverend. The daughters and their flock believe that it is the devil that comes among them and agrees not to notice the food or drink. <br /> <br /> It is at this point, in the preparation of the meal, paid for the profits of Babette in a French lottery, that I begin to break up. It is a provoked commotion compared to the daily vulgarity and mendacity that flood our consciousness from morning to night through the media and energy dealers who maneuver to gain an advantage over all of us here in the dark. <br /> <br /> The simple sophistication of Babette's art confronts all the pretension that is shown in our modern society, and it hurts to see her represented so exquisitely in this splendid film. <br /> <br /> It's, along with Fanny och Alexander (Bergman), my favorite movie, but I can only see it from time to time because, like a rare bottle of wine served with Blinis and fresh oysters, it's something that does not It must be exaggerated. <br /> <br /> A great, great movie that should be in the library of all movie lovers.
