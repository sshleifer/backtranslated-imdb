Well, it took them 4 tries, but finally they did it right! In this fourth sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! Well, first of all I applaud you for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt that he never served the role of Karate Kid. I would have preferred to see Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in that role. Macchio turned out to be what turned out to be the best movie of the series, and look at where his career is now! Instead, put in a girl! They have Hillary Swank, best known for playing a variety of parts of sheman in all the movies she is in. I personally do not care about your teeth, but that is a personal preference. But still, look how Karate Kid 4 launched its race in orbit! She won an Oscar freakin. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile, where is Ralphy? I should put in some amateur porn tape like Screech or something like that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. As a self-proclaimed master of Karate, I have been the proud owner of a white belt for the past 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls ... well, except for Judo ... but that's a bit gay. So for precision purposes, I think they should have stayed with another man for this role. I was thinking maybe Dennis Franz. It would give the paper the depth it requires. <br /> <br /> Maybe you listen to my suggestions and make the right adjustments in Karate Kid 5. It's too much Pat Marita is not anymore. I was thinking maybe Justin Guarini is the perfect replacement for the adorable Asian partner Mr. Miyagi. He will give "Wax on wax off" a completely new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA funny eh? Anyway, if you are looking for an exciting movie full of Karate and triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Do not waste time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you! This is the Karate Kid for all ages!
