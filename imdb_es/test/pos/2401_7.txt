I saw the movie with tears and smiles alternately. The anger arose in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the bombing of 12 days. And living in the country right now with my parents, who have been living in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we are now much better, and it would have been better if the American had not brought the war here. Upon seeing the film, I learned more about the different types of wars the United States planned in Vietnam and the disasters they caused. <br /> <br /> The series seems to do well interviews with real people. But I do not like that some people only give generic opinions, like the analyst near the end of the series, I forgot his name. <br /> <br /> There should also be more documentary images, such as life in the army camp of South Vietnam and those in the North (if possible). There is also a sudden change from the year of 1972 to 1975 (I am not sure that the intermediate has been censored, because I watched this series on television).
