No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert "Famishius Famishius" Coyote tries to get the Road Runner "Burnius Roadibus", we always know what will happen, although our sympathy always remains with WEC. The highlight in "Hook, Line and Stinker" is a Rube Goldberg style scheme that WEC expects to finally finish RR; but, of course, you know what happens. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Wile E. continues with a hilarious activity in fanaticism (defined by George Santayana as redoubling your effort after you have forgotten your goal), while Road Runner almost never becomes aware of the potential danger, or lack of it, in which he might find himself. A true classic. <br /> <br /> And yes, the second name of the coyote is Ethelbert. I learned it from "Jeopardy!"
