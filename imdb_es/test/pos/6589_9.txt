I was very lucky to see this film as part of the 2005 Melbourne International Film Festival a few days ago. I must admit that I am very partial to films that focus on human relationships and especially those that focus on the tragic side of life. I also love most of the Scandinavian film offerings, often there is a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. The construction of characters in this film is extraordinary for its details and depth. This happens despite the fact that we find a lot of characters, all with very particular situations and personal locations within their community. The audience at the end of the screening was very silent and thoughtful. I'm still playing some of those scenes in my mind and I'm still surprised by its power and meaning.
