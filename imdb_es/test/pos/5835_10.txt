Series about life in Oz, an experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate the prisoners. There is gay sex, rape, torture, mutilation, murder, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... all in your face and with all your strength. <br /> <br /> It's also easily one of the best written dramas ever seen on TV and almost all the actors are just great. Since this was on the wire, there were no restrictions on what they could say or show. There are many racist comments flying here, but it is for all races. In fact, the white characters go wrong (especially the Aryans) and the blacks come out better (the Muslims who love peace). Hispanics do not have a strong role and there are NO Asian prisoners. All the prisoners seem to be stabbed and ready to kill anyone at any time, but you still find yourself sympathetic to some of them. Even prison guards, counselors and doctors have serious problems. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this BUT rent it, do not buy it. I have the entire collection and, to be totally honest, I do not think I want to see it again. TV is amazing but so dark, dark and depressing. I guess I have to sell everything online. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10.
