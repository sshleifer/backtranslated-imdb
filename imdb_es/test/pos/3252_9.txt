Brilliant movie! I'm sorry to say that it looks a bit like Pulp F. but that's what it was like in the post-pulp era. Many images are automatically compared to this just for being a gangster movie. But this is well written, funny coincidences, common gangsters who are family men, they look like something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is about a guy in Australia who is getting confused with a criminal band from the hard core, and ends up in debt and deep. To help him, his deceased brother (does anyone remember Val Kilmer in True R.?) To pay off his debt and escape the gangsters who are on his way. The mobsters are cold-blooded, but take the time to play chess and focus on the education of their children. They also serve their grandmother's tea while planning a bank robbery and have trouble doing with their children during the robbery. So a comic gangster movie with Heath Ledger in good shape (although I'm not a fan), and Bryan Brown in great action as a gang leader.
