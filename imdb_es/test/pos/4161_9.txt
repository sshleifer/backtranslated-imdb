Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a poem with a visually striking tone that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It's a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Entwining dreamlike and symbolic images with gritty realism, Emanuele Crialese's latest film (Respiro) is like an impressionist painting: a cinematographic representation of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents. The "magical and mysterious journey" of Crialese occurred as a result of his visit to the museum on Ellis Island, the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in the photographs he saw, and his investigation of the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants. <br /> <br /> Guided by letters he read about immigrants sent to relatives who stayed at home, Crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who could see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal. For Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his eldest son, Angelo (Francesco Casisa), the United States is a distant dream of which they know nothing. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown postcards of Salvatore's youngest son, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), a deaf mute, who represents the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk, sit under a money tree, or harvest giant onions and carrots. <br /> <br /> After getting rid of his animals in exchange for shoes and suits, Salvatore, his two sons and his elderly mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) undertook their adventure with more hope than fear, but the equation soon changes sense. As they climb into the boat and settle into their third-class management compartments, the most talked-about scene in the film takes place. Using a superior camera that shows a large number of people standing, as the ship moves away, the frame is divided into those on board the ship and those who bid farewell to the dock and the way they are separated it implies that they are being torn apart of everything that is familiar. <Br /> <br /> On board the ship there is a mysterious English woman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialese does not reveal his past nor the reason why he travels to the United States, but he seems to agree with the beginning of the modern world in which they are entering. Although they look at each other cautiously, Lucy becomes interested in Salvatore and asks him to marry her to allow her to enter the country. The trip is treacherous with a violent storm hitting the ship. Rolled in almost complete darkness, the passengers in the direction are thrown against the side of the boat and, later, the bodies lie entangled and twisted in the ground as in a massive massif of Totentanz. The rite of passage through the immigration process on Ellis Island does not become easier and Crialese attacks the way in which illiterate peasants, in the name of preserving "civilized" society, are forced to put together puzzles, perform mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical exams to show they are "in shape". <br /> <br /> A marriage mediation ceremony feels like an auction block and young women are crushed when compared to overweight middle-aged men. However, this is the only way they can enter the "Golden Gate", as single women are rejected unless they have a partner, apparently to avoid the threat of prostitution. Through the fog, immigrants can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no Statue of Liberty that asks for the tired and the poor, the humble masses who yearn to breathe freely. However, in your imagination, the river still flows, waiting for you to enter. Although the end is ambiguous and a door opens to a blank wall, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we all must take. The old world to the new.
