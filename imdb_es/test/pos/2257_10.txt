I thought that this movie was amazing. I was a bit skeptical since I really had no idea what it was about, but it was a beautiful story. I cried a lot and I also laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> I think it is very important that films about the Holocaust and how it affects people are being created (it only happened 60 years ago!) I have been in Germany and Eastern Europe and I have studied the Holocaust, so this movie meant a lot to me. I think this movie did an incredible job of capturing this story (I will not go into details, I do not want to spoil it), but I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that, I know this may sound clich√©, "but it will change your mentality about things.
