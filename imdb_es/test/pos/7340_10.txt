The Gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber plays Jane Hawkins, a world-class former gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns a living as a certified masseuse. <br /> <br /> The promotional material leads him to believe that the plot revolves around Jane's accidental meeting. with a former teammate. Although this meeting takes place, that plot is secondary to the main plot, which involves Jane, her husband and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women develop an act of the type performed by Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other: Jane has more experience with heights and has tremendous strength in the upper body. Serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, she is also capable of incredible physical feats. <br /> <br /> The movie works because we can understand how Jane would become Addie, who is affectionate and compassionate, while Jane's husband has taken her for granted during the many years of their marriage. <br /> <br /> Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. They are clearly acting really, and the results are so excellent that we can believe that they would really be a success in Las Vegas or anywhere else they traveled. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension between women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air. A woman with a negligent husband and an attractive partner creates an explosive situation, which is not resolved in a clean and orderly manner. <br /> <br /> Of the six films we saw at Rochester, NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this was the best. It will work on DVD and it is definitely worth looking for on large or small screen. NOTE: Stay for credits!
