After the overall success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television allowed Barbra to create an even more elaborate track as her second special. Streisand wisely, to continue with the innovative success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, your second special should raise the level even more in inventiveness and spectacle. Not in vain, he got it once more. Even more impressive, Streisand managed to mount this great production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA. <br /> <br /> Once again, the special is divided into three different Acts. The on-site filming of Bergdorf Goodman departmental store was so successful in the first special, that Streisand and the company decided to film at the location once again for the first act of this second special. The location decided on this occasion was the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which would allow infinite opportunities for Barbra to "enter" different works of art that would correspond to the songs that are performed. In addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that made this location possible, the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to take advantage of color filming. <br /> <br /> After the recording of "Draw Me a Circle", which is against. In the opening credits, Barbra then rushes through the museum wearing a maid outfit to the trends of the "Yesterdays" of Kern and Harbach. He stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becoming the character that is represented and singing a thematically appropriate song. Streisand performs a bittersweet interpretation of "One Kiss" by Hammerstein and Romberg, while Thomas Eakin's CONCERT SINGER delivers an incredibly rural performance of Chopin's "Minute Waltz" as "Marie Antoinette." performs a harrowing version of "Non C'est Rien" as an anguished Modigliani girl. However, the highlight of Act I is when Streisand compares the profiles with the bust sculpture of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti, while singing a Tour de Force version of "Where or when" by Rogers and Hart. The combination of Act II circus allows Streisand to interact with various farm and circus animals, while singing several songs with farm / circus / animal themes. Some highlights include Barbra singing "Were Thou That Special Face" to an elephant baby, performing "I've Grown Acustomed to that Face" as a serenade to a piglet, the camp "Sam, You Made the Pants to Long" sung in a group of baby penguins, and Barbra comparing profiles with an anteater while singing "We have a lot in common". Streisand also sways on a trapeze and jumps from a springboard to the "Spring Again" chorus, and then slows things down by performing a disturbing version of "I Stayed Too Long at the Fair" while sitting alone on stage. Barbra also has the opportunity to show her poodle Sadie in this segment, and even speak a little French. <br /> <br /> Act III concert is once again the highlight of the hour. Dressed in a slender white wool dress, the concert segment takes place in a unique design stage with a partial staircase that leads nowhere. Streisand opens the act with a sensual version of "Anyplace I Hang My Hat Is Home" by Harold Arlen, before launching into the sincere versions of the familiar "It Had to Be You" standard and the rarely heard "C'est Si Bon" (It's so good)." Then, Streisand really surprises the audience with an incredibly powerful octave rendition of Sweet Charity's ballad "Where Am I Going", from which Streisand delivers the definitive interpretation. Streisand also presents the ballad Richard Maltby, Jr.-David Shire, "Starting Here, Starting Now", just written at the time, which contains a passionate voice of Streisand that is among the best vocal performances of his long career. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, Color Me Barbra was a showcase for the growing power of Streisand's mega watt star. Despite the presence of even more visual glare, Streisand herself is always the main attraction. Her voice sounds as beautiful as ever, and this special was the first to show how amazingly color photography is. Just like MY NAME IS BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another resounding qualifying success and spawned another of the five best soundtrack albums that sold gold. In a few words, COLOR ME BARBRA challenges tradition and emerges as a sequel that is almost on par with a classic original.
