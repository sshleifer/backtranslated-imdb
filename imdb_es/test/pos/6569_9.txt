"Uzumaki" takes place in a small Japanese rural town, where people are going crazy. They go crazy because of the vortices and spirals. The crisis is getting worse, because people are becoming snails and vortices appear everywhere. "Uzumaki" has to be one. of the most extravagant and original horror films I've seen. The plot is really intelligent and the bloody scenes are very funny, since the film is not taken too seriously. "Uzumaki" is beautifully photographed and the use of colors is excellent. The characters are nice and there are enough surprises to satisfy fans of Japanese horror. Despite some funny scenes, the overall tone of this movie is quite dark. "Uzumaki" is not as good as "Ringu", "Ju-on" "or" Audition ", but if you like Japanese horror movies, you will not be disappointed.7 out of 10.
