The 15 Park Avenue of Aparna Sen is a film about the nature of reality. <br /> <br /> A delirious young woman, prone to imagine things and hear voices, possibly out of sheer boredom, is considered schizophrenic by her educated father and her older sister educated and obsessed with control. Controlled, apologized and treated as an invalid (even out of love and affection), she has the possibility of developing as a normal person. When a child offers to marry her, his father and his stepsister try to convince him passionately not to take that step. A traumatic experience, caused mainly by his protected existence, finally takes her through the line of no return, and lives full time in her own delirious world. <br /> <br /> The family and society around them are intolerant of their delusions, and want to repress them with medication, electric shock therapy, anything, even if they all have delusions of one kind or another. <br /> <br /> His mother does not see the irony of allowing a ghost hunter to treat her with delusions. His stepsister is a professor of Physics, who teaches, among other things, Quantum Mechanics, a topic in which a series of experts accept parallel universes and many more dimensions in space than the 3 we see. A friend admires an experience with a saintly person who says to hear amazing voices. Far away, George W. Bush has real or false delusions from Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, and he is allowed to invade Iraq. <br /> <br /> As some spectators have already pointed out, Aparna Sen avoided attacking the mother of all delusions, the main religions, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> In other words, accepted reality is what the majority or the influential minority believe. That has been the case since the beginning, and many more powerful people than Mithali in the film, including Bruno and Galileo. They have suffered as a consequence. <br /> <br /> The controversial and difficult ending of the film was necessary to show that it is a film about the nature of reality, and not the case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> All the actors have had great performances, but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma have excelled. Aparna Sen has produced a prominent philosophical film.
