This short film aims to focus on a topic sociologically known as cultural shock. The film presents the condition of average Romanian in democratic Romania who discovers that life and problems are not different from the communist period, and if he wants something, he must bribe to obtain it. <br /> <br /> So our main character is fired after a long time, he is around 50 years old and needs to get a similar job, but the only job available is an inferior one. He is forced to take it for lack of money. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that you have to live in Romania so that this film is as real and tragic as it seems.
