What I got was something better. <br /> <br /> Like many movies that I have commented recently, I have been waiting for this for a while. Especially after watching one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, "Blue Spring", which is easily found in my 20 favorite movies. I loved the "9 Souls" trailer, and I thought it sounded really good. I did not hear anything bad about it. Now I know why. <br /> <br /> This movie starts as a kind of comedy, then, during the last half of the movie, it quickly becomes something else. It becomes more dramatic when each of the characters faces their own tragedies. Each character has enough screen time, and you're worried about what happens to each of them. Although there are 9 characters that we have to learn and worry about, Toshiaki Toyoda accomplishes this brilliantly in just two hours. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Blue Spring" I expected the soundtrack to be at least a little as good, as it was in that movie. I got my wish, because the soundtrack of "9 Souls" was also incredible. The music used in each scene, more specifically the most dramatic, is simply wonderful. I loved every second. <br /> <br /> I was not sure if I wanted to see another Toshiaki Toyoda movie, "Pornostar" or not, but after seeing this, I will. Insurance. Also, because I read the plot, and I think it sounds very good. I'm looking forward to it. On the R1 DVD of "9 Souls", there are two interviews with Toyoda. He says he has completed another movie and wants to start writing the script for the next one. I can not wait for both of you. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. You must see it. Now.
