I can not praise this movie enough. I had a lot of that handheld camera in first person with tremors that I love (and some hate because it makes them sick), like REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie by its type, but I did not even realize it because the movie was very interesting. With just showing the images of a work of a paranormal reporter, the film keeps the rhythm, turning it into a real-time experience for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Although I would never call this film the "most terrifying horror that has ever been made" I have to say that it is without a doubt one of the best I've seen. The fear factor here is built with details in the images, camera failures, linked events that give a very mysterious and disturbing tone to the film. The horror is more in what is not shown, but it is left to our imagination. The ending is perfect, and keep in mind that you can have nightmares later. However, a second visit is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Watch this only in the dark, do not expect anything and you will have fun.
