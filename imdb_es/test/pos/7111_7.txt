A year after the release of the media "House of Frankenstein", Universal launched another Monster Mash where all its famous characters would collide again. "The House of Dracula" will reunite Dracula, the creature of Frankenstein and the werewolf for the final battle and finally close an era for the study. Directed once again by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula" presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and offers a better-constructed (though still flawed) story that, while far from perfect, is a further closure appropriate than the previous movie. <br /> <br /> The story ignores most of the events in the previous entry, "House of Frankenstein," and introduces a new angle to the story. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of having to hide in the sunlight, asks for help from the brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a doctor famous for his research in biology. Edelman becomes fascinated with Dracula and soon begins an experimental treatment. Meanwhile, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), the werewolf, visits Edelman in order to get rid of his curse. Soon, Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood is also developing an illness in him. The discovery of Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange) in nearby catacombs will bring more confusion to the mind of the brilliant scientist. <br /> <br /> After the previous monster clash, it's good to see that the series goes back. To the roots and delivering a gothic horror almost direct, returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this type of film and away from the comical relief of previous entries. The story (by Edward T. Lowe Jr.), has many interesting themes, such as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both in search of a cure, but with different purposes) and the growing madness of Edelman. Probably one of the most interesting topics is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a beautiful but deformed woman who helps Dr. Edelman with the hope of getting cured of his condition. <br /> <br /> Principal Erle C. Kenton is back again and this time she finally captures the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that apparently was lost in the previous film. Despite the low budget, Kenton creates a Gothic horror that, while simple, is quite effective and even manages to present old companions as these characters in a new way. Although never at the level of the originals, "House of Dracula" regains the charm that used to have the horror films of Universal Studios, and Kenton ensures that at least for the last time the monsters receive the opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The cast is very good this time, with Carradine, Chaney and Strange repeating their roles (although Strange's role is considerably smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. The addition of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast brought tragedy and drama back to the series, with Stevens giving an excellent performance as Dr. Edelman. A small cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as the spooky Steinmuhl complete one of the best horror movies that Universal has had in years. <br /> <br /> "House of Dracula" is a good addition to the series, especially after the mediocre "House of Frankenstein". However, it's nice to see Kenton back in shape in a somewhat serious horror movie, and although the plot is quite original, he suffers not only from the budget, but because the film tries to do a lot in a very short execution time and wrong. results It is true that the characters have very clever narrative lines, but the film devotes very little time for each one to develop, and the film seems very hasty and disjointed. <br /> <br /> Although far from perfect, it is also Far from being the worst of the series. "House of Dracula" is a good closing of one of the best moments for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls wandered through foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to horrible monsters. Later, the monsters would return to "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a completely different context. After the disappointing previous entries, it is easy to discard "House of Dracula", but give it a try and let the monster roam for the last time. 7/10
