The reason why this film is not better known and more appreciated by me seems to be because of its theme. Due to its controversial subject, this film never had a great suitable release and even today it is still quite unknown. However, it is not that the issue is more controversial now. <br /> <br /> Basically, in essence, it's a movie about a white man who befriends a black man. The friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic, but the way it is portrayed in this film makes everything feel very real. We see how these different ethnic groups mix with each other, as if it were completely normal. Unfortunately, of course, in those days it was not considered normal. Seeing a black man talking to a white girl and having fun with her as a friend must have been hard to see, for example, for some proportions of his 1957 audience. <br /> <br /> You can really understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and continues to be respected by both Hollywood society and the black community in general. Of course, it's one of the reasons why he also received an Honorary Award at the Oscars in 2002. In his films, he often fights against discrimination and prejudice problems, with "For the Heat of the Night" as the best example of this. . A true role model, which has certainly inspired many African-American actors, to this day. But besides that, he was also a great actor. Yes, he is still alive, but he seems to have completely withdrawn from the movies, since his last accredited role is since 2001. <br /> <br /> This movie was Martin Ritt's directorial debut and he was not He gave too much film to spend on his movie. The studios were probably also a bit reluctant, mainly because of their concept and / or because it was Ritt's first film. Or maybe it was simply due to the fact that MGM was not so big anymore and had left behind his best days. Since the 1950s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had the reputation of making movies that were not too good and cheap, while in the first years before it was one of the largest studios with many acclaimed stars and directors. , who made many award-winning classic movies. Fortunately for them, their reputation is beginning to change again and every time the MGM logo appears in a movie, people no longer expect a minor movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, even with your limited budget and limited resources I managed to make a great movie of this. The movie is very simple, with only a few characters and a simplistic plot. However, the film still manages to capture you with its history and its themes, without ever starting to preach or anything about it. It also makes the film effective with its themes. <br /> <br /> It really is a movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
