What a surprise. A basic imitator of the classic comedy 'The Nutty Professor', only more naughty. The funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright funny like the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the crazed Hyde sex. <br /> <br /> The only scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: <br /> <br /> "how dare you to take advantage of my innocent daughter. "<br /> <br /> Jekyll responds," but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. " <br /> <br /> Lanyon replies, "Oh, well, in that case I was * * your brains out!"
