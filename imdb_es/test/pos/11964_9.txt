When one thinks of Soviet cinema, Eisenstein's propaganda masterpieces or Tarkovsky's somber meditations usually come to mind. Sure they are excellent movies, but in general they are not the most entertaining material that exists. However, the countries within the Iron Curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals as much as the states. In fact, from the 1930s to the 1970s, forty of these extravagances of song and dance were thrown into much adoration by the public. However, they are completely unknown in the West, so this documentary tries to rectify this situation. He does an excellent job of showing these films and putting them in the right cultural context. Although I've never been a fan of musicals, this documentary seemed completely convincing to me from beginning to end. This shows that, no matter how many films you manage to see in your life, you are only touching the surface of what is there. <br /> <br /> As for the movie clips themselves, they are very interesting. entertaining. While some of the musicals are blatant propaganda that shows the workers singing about how much they love working under the regime, some of the films (particularly the later films) seem quite complete from the point of view of production. Also, everyone is extremely enthusiastic about how strange they are to my Western eyes. There are some similarities between them and American musicals that I'm used to, but the strict presence of a message from the government gives them a surreal advantage. They certainly do not resemble the musicals made in the West. This documentary is one of the strangest and most entertaining films I've seen in recent memory, and it's a must-see for any movie buff.
