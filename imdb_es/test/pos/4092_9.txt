I recently bought Lost Horizon on ebay, I have vivid memories of the number of Things I Will Not Miss since childhood (I'm 29 years old). Recently I also finished the novel on which it is based. I was pleasantly surprised to find a true hidden treasure. A wonderful cast brings so much warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly narrated story, subtly updated from the original movie (and for now an entity quite different from the much more intellectual and stimulating James Hilton book). Sally Kellerman, in particular, has a radiant presence as the suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes, who gradually warms to the charms of Shangri-La. Only Liv Ullmann is frantic in her wooden representation of the school teacher (a much more suitable role for Julie Andrews.) The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hussey are bent is not important, as it is almost impossible to say. Songs vary in quality, the music is far superior to the lyrics, but it's still a vibrant and fascinating movie that really deserves a proper release on DVD and much more recognition.
