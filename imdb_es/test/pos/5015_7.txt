This movie was well acted and kept my interest in the main character of the whole movie. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu were alive today! This movie shows a picture of how he would have felt in the life of Stu Unger. It was interesting to see how connected they were growing. I would have liked to see more details about Stu's party, his ability with games and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But in general, this film was well made, it acted well and the story touched many facets of a life that was filled with many events that were bigger than life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth renting.
