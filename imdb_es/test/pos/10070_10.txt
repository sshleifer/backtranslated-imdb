Do not listen to what critics have always said about this cute and charming little movie. Madonna is BIG in this intelligent comedy. I worked in a video store for several years and suggested this movie to many clients, nobody NEVER returned it and shouted at me for telling them to rent it. Everyone enjoyed it forever. Actually, it is also a great movie for children.
