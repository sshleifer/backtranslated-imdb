I remember when I first saw this movie. I was babysitting for a friend of my moms, and one of the children suggested that we see it. Thinking it was the downright laughable "Prince of Thieves" that they were putting into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom. What I received was a shock, a pleasant one, I admit it, but still a surprise. <br /> <br /> Now, you all know the legend of Robin Hood, right? I'll explain it to you a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, stealing money here and there and giving it to the people who needed it, while seducing the beautiful Maid Marion and bothering the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John. That's the basics! Now, with the revision. <br /> <br /> This movie was released in 1993, and is a takeoff of the entire Robin Hood legend and a capture of the Prince of Thieves in particular. <Br /> <br /> Following the legend, Robin de Loxley met for the first time in an Arab prison during the crusades of the third century, and together with a 'Moro' as they were called in those days, he executed a clever escape with a cellmate Asneeze. <br /> <br /> After escaping, Asneeze begs Robin to look for her son Atchoo, an exchange student in England and to take care of him. This Robin swears to do! Robin returns to England. <br /> <br /> He returns to his house, to Loxley's castle, and finds himself walking away from Bailiffs' chariot, and goes through the painful revelation of his father, his dog, his cat. , and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate for a familiar face, he finds the blind Blinkin family sitting on the toilet with a jazz magazine in Braille. Hilarity continues throughout the film. <br /> <br /> As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and the Rottingham Sheriff, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes on King Richards' kingdom while he is far. <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with the films that Mel Brooks has previously directed will have a small idea of ​​what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula: dead and lover, and the young Frankenstein. All jokes, ranging from visual jokes to wonderful witty comments, are exactly in the right places throughout the film, with never more than a minute between laughs. <br /> <br /> Cary Elwes (by the way, the only Englishman who plays Robin Hood in a movie), that many of you will know about Princess Bride, brings his daring bright-eyed presence to this film and does a job wonderful. From an extravagant heroic posture to a perversely sexy look, he is incredibly funny. And the man looks better in tights than me! <br /> <br /> Richard Lewis is as funny as the prince and arrogant Prince John with the constantly changing mole. He manages to get the mariquito boy's behavior to perfection, and his noisy vocalizations in the United States are great. Throughout the film, a mole on his face constantly changes position: it begins on his left cheek, then on his right cheek, then his chin, then his forehead, before returning to his original place. This is a subtle joke based on Alan Rickman's mole when he played the sheriff in Prince Of Thieves. <br /> <br /> Roger Rees, since Rottingham's sordid sheriff is wonderfully viscous and nasty, and has big lines all over the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some faces here with which you will be familiar with other Brooks films. For example, Robert Ridgely, playing the executioner in this film, also played the executioner in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He also likes to add subtle references to his previous films; With several in this movie, Brooks fans will easily notice. Those who saw History of the World part 1 will recognize the music of the song "Men in Tights". In addition, when Patrick Stewart arrives and becomes entangled with Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) pronounces the line "It's good to be a king", one of his lines in World History. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is wonderfully funny, even those with only a few lines give them a great depth of warmth and humor <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so wonderfully warm and Funny in my opinion are all improvised scenes. Although there was a kind of script, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, like the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prays for Rottingham in her bed, and he falls through the ceiling, landing right where she wanted him, that was totally devised and thought by the two actors. <br /> <br /> There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerized camera tricks. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack It's memorable, with some very funny songs, and a couple of corny love songs. You'll be singing 'Men in tights' or, at least, making him hum you for weeks. <br /> <br /> The rating is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the movie, except in the use of double meaning, and an expression of sh! T, and the violence is minimal. In fact, I would dare to say that it does not exist, apart from some comedy scenes. <br /> <br /> A very funny movie that adults and children will enjoy equally!
