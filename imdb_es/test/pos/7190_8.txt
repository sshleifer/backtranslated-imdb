I do not know about the English version of this movie, but the Norwegian translation is the funniest movie I've seen in many years. The characters say so many funny things and make so many strange references to current events that I'm surprised they still have more options, like the architect who can never say the name of the magician Miraculix correctly. It becomes things like Malcom (i) X and "utenriks", which is Norwegian for foreign affairs. <br /> <br /> Like the word "utenriks", many of the translations do not give any meaning in English, and probably not in French, so the translators must have invented their own jokes, and they have done very well . Of course, they have a very good foundation to build, with a movie that is simply comical from start to finish! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with a good translation!
