Married to the Mafia was one of the first VHS tapes I had together with Coming To America and Grease. I still have good memories of this movie after all these years. Hell, I still have the VHS of this movie in good condition. <br /> <br /> The story: undercover cop Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) is sent to spy on Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer), the wife of the dead. member of the mafia Frank "Cucumber" De Marco (Alec Baldwin). Later he falls in love with her after realizing that she is innocent in all this. Angela not only has to deal with the unwanted advances of mafia boss Tony "The Tiger" Russo (Dean Stockwell), but she also has to deal with her jealous wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl). <br /> <br /> Married to The Mafia is fun and still keeps your interest when it is not trying to be fun. I like the small blows that are taken in the life of the mafia (the jealous wife of the mafia, the mafia boss who does not realize that he is not a magnet of chicks, etc.) and you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last fun phase of Johnathan Demme before he got serious and gave you gems like Philadelphia and Silence Of The Lambs (the best thriller of all time). If you're in the mood for comedy, Married To The Mob is an archer. It's better than the trash that goes through comedy nowadays (epic movie, date movie, Meet The Spartans, disaster film, etc.).
