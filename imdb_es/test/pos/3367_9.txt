I have to say that some of the other reviews of this movie that I have read show very little understanding of the same or the original television series from which it emerged. Dad's army was a situation comedy and, therefore, he had humor and, therefore, it is likely that he put a smile on the face of the situation. However, the series conveyed many serious messages, such as the episode 'Branded' on fanaticism and ignorance that was attached to conscientious objectors. The film was true to the series and was simply like an extended episode. Therefore, I am afraid that the critic who claimed that Columbia improved the mood was quite wrong and let's be honest: the BBC comedies of this period undoubtedly surpassed what came out of the United States. Also the comments that refer to the propaganda were also out of place. The Homeguard were people considered unfit for the front line service they still wanted to serve. They were very brave men who knew they were condemned to death as soon as they registered when Hitler announced that anyone who did would be executed when Britain was invaded. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify things, since it is always good to talk and comment on what has been seen instead of compensating as it progresses.
