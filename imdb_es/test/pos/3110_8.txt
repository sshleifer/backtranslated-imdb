I recently saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between the character of Jacqueline Bisset and the character of Michael Brandon. The rented version did not have this scene in it. I imagined this? <br /> <br /> Or, is this part of the "cleaning" of films where some are modified to exclude portions that some people think are not "appropriate"? <br /> <br /> I love this movie: it's exactly like the friendship between a friend and me, and we've been friends for 25 years and we've seen it together. Her husband also thought it was us. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Joan
