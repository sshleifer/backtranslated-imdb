It's fine, I'll say it. This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. This statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is just a waste of film. But what most people do not understand is that this movie was meant to be mean and cheerful. I mean, did people really think that a movie about a murderous snowman was going to be a masterpiece? Just look at the "scary" hologram on the film's cover and you will find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which, in my opinion, was just as fun), this film turned out to be a scandalous journey into the depths of cheesy dialogue, bad phrases and horrible special effects. And everything is made to give laughter to the spectators. It certainly worked for me. <br /> <br /> For example: Anne Tiler (to her worried husband): What makes you frown so fondly? <br /> <br /> If that part of the dialogue does not make you laugh, then you have serious problems. Who in their right mind would pronounce those words in real life? Of course, nobody because it was meant to sound ridiculous! Just take a look at this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and I hope you see what is so much fun about Jack Frost 2.
