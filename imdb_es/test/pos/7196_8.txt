I just found a copy of "Mission Cleopatra," which is not as easy as you might think for someone who lives in the United States. So far, I've only seen the first 10 minutes of the movie, and I can safely say that I laughed more in those 10 minutes than when I saw the whole of Asterix's first live action movie. I'm watching the dubbed version, and although the dubbing work is a bit disconcerting, the film seems very funny and true to the book. I see that people here have said that the dubbed version is much lower than the subtitled version, that may be true, and after seeing the subtitled version (also on my DVD) I may have to come here and alter my review. As it is, however, I think it's a very entertaining movie, and more than compensates for the mess they made with the first movie.
