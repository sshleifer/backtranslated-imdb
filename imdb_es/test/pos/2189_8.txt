Well, I'm not the biggest Sondheim fan in the world, so even though I have the cast album and I've listened to it several times, I've never seen this show and I have not seen the Tim Burton movie version either. I felt that I wanted to see something more faithful before I saw Burton and give him a chance like a movie. This version is not a film at all, it is a work filmed with some of the original members of the cast, including the most important performance of Angela Lansbury as Nellie Lovett. This is one of those performances that is like a conduit to the heart of the Broadway magic and the theater itself. She must have had so much fun with this role. Sweeney Todd himself is not played by Len Cariou, who originally did it, but by George Hearn. Hearn does a fantastic job; his voice is not as good as Cariou's, but it seems to be a little wider. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had really was with the character of Johanna played by Betsy Joslyn, and to some extent her lover Anthony played by Cris Groenendaal. Joslyn's voice can not hold high notes, but I was not completely sure if that was the point, since I'm not very familiar with this work. More importantly, I'm not sure if the story of "Sweeney Todd" really has enough weight to hold some of the music, but fortunately the whole thing does not seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators. As a joke, and a bit of comedy in the vein of "Grand Guignol", it's quite nice. I do not think it's such an important job as "Company" and "Into the Woods" or some of his other shows. Part of the music is quite spectacular, but in other points it seems to exist in a world outside the show. <br /> <br /> I will not say much about it here because it is a movie website and This is not really a movie, but just a work that has been shot in a movie. Maybe there were 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera, but that was it. People will want to see this, because it retains the legendary performance of Lansbury, which deserves its legendary status because it is a hilarious and insightful performance. George Hearn can also be proud of his version of Sweeney. This would be a good movie to show children over 5 years old or more to be interested in musicals because blood and cannibalism will really surprise them. Watching a performance filmed so expertly and so faithfully makes me wish that more efforts like these were made over time with the musical theater, because I prefer shows from the 20s to 50s to those of the later era. "Sweeney Todd" is an exceptional show of its time, however, miles and miles above the madness of AL Webber.
