Best Years of Our Lives is a movie that slipped under my radar for years. I had heard about her, but I never had the chance to see her. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I could see it without cuts and without commercials. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about this movie was how quickly it was made after the war. The film deals frankly with the people who were wounded in the war, both physically and mentally. He manages to encompass almost all varieties of war experience within three characters. <br /> <br /> We have the Air Force officer, who was a veteran of the bombing campaign in Europe. Due to the horrible rate of attrition among the bombers' crews, the Air Force at that time had a reputation for causing officers to rise quickly in the ranks. Such was the case of this guy who went from being a fool of soda to civilian life to a captain and bomber of his B-17. He also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, called "battle fatigue" at that time. <br /> <br /> We have the serviceless Army that served in the Pacific and suffered the horrors of that campaign. His story is opposite to that of members of the Air Force in that he passes from a prestigious job as a banker to a humble grunt in the Army and rises to the rank of Sergeant. From the stripes on his sleeve, it is clear that he is the highest level of Sergeant, however, he is still on the front line. <br /> <br /> Finally we have Navy Marman, who is part of the faceless support staff. , commonly known as REMF (Rear Echelon MFers) by the line mates. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical injuries when working as a mechanic under the decks on a Navy ship, his ship is hit, presumably by a suicide bomber and sinking with the loss of 400 lives. He is taken out of the water but his severely burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks. <br /> <br /> BYOOL tells the story of how these three are in a transport plane that they have tackled for the home and how they are readjusted. in civil society. <br /> <br /> What impressed me the most about this film is that, despite the obvious problems faced by the three protagonists, it never descends into melodrama. The child of the Navy, played by a real amputee, is placed in situations in which we can feel sorry for him, but the script never lets us feel that emotion. The Army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story points that out, but he never stops at it. The captain of the Air Force struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the pharmacy where he drinks soda (now bought by a large chain) and accepts degrading work to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife. <br /> <br /> The script offers many opportunities for all these characters to reach a dramatic climax with regard to their difficulties, but that avoids it perfectly. But for the score too dramatic, the director has trampled exploit the obvious. <br /> <br /> In a scene that well represents the whole movie, the daughter of the army sergeant (Frederic March) is having an argument with her. Father and mother regarding the captain of the Air Force. Despite their marriage, they have fallen in love, and she is determined to break the marriage that is obviously problematic. Now we have seen thousands of typical scenes of this in which the father gets angry with rage and the daughter ends up running to her room crying, banging on the door and falling on the bed. Later, Mom appears, comforts her daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In BYOOL, this scene unfolds completely differently from the cliche I described earlier. Sure the conversation is heated, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion about the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialogues I've seen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, BYOOL is highly satisfying Movie, with honest performances by the entire cast. Technically, it is well filmed, the frame of editing and cinematography, but never eclipses the exciting narrative. Despite the score, which is clich√© and too dramatic, I give this film the highest rating that clearly deserves
