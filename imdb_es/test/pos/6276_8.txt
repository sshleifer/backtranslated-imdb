The Jazz Singer is one of several films made in the late 1940s and 1950s about the Jewish experience in the United States. Apart from Crossfire (1947) and Gentleman's Agreement (1947), which dealt with anti-Semitism, they generally had a musical-theatrical background. These films include The Jolson Story (1946), Jolson Sings Again (1949), The Eddy Duchin Story (1951), The Eddie Cantor Story (1953), The Benny Goodman Story (1956) and Margorie Morningstar (1958). The main actors in these "Jewish" movies were always played by non-Jews. For example, Larry Parks, a non-Jew, played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly to Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done so that the Jewish theme is palpable for a majority non-Jewish audience. The jazz singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish, although she plays a non-practicing Jewish in the film. The key to her experience is that when she attends Golding's family meal before entering, she says: "I have not been to a sadder Easter service since I left home." <br /> <br /> The film is about a Son singer who has just left the service after seeing action in Korea. His dilemma is whether to become a singer, a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theater. His choice of theater leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> However, there is much more to this movie than this. This film was made after Rosenberg's trial during McCarthy's strollers and the Hollywood blacklist. Therefore, in this film the Jews are shown as good loyal citizens and <br /> <br /> they are essentially American. The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. The friends of the singers also talk about baseball, in fact, one of them is a Major League referee. The synagogue dates back to 1790 and it is said that George Washington visited it. Therefore, Jews present themselves as an integral part of American society. Nobody in this movie has an Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. In this movie you can watch her sing "Lover" and "Just One of That Things" wonderful. Danny Thomas is quite credible and acts and sings the part very well. The comic routines could have been omitted. Yes, the movie is clumsy and sentimental, but it's worth seeing. I enjoyed it a lot.
