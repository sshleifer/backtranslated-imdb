I do not know what movie or version Jeff saw, but this whole movie was amazing, not just Poitier and Going. The story was fascinating, suspenseful and attractive. And for the guy who complains about historical accuracy, make yourself real. Yes, there were some black police officers in Indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of Indian territory. As a general rule, they did not "patrol" but exercised orders against criminals only. It seemed strange to me that Corby did not seem to have "any" Indian friend. I know your number decreased, but it still seems strange to me. Even when Corby returned to his village, his Indian cohorts remain anonymous and nameless.
