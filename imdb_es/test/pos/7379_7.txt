This was an interesting study on social sexuality, as well as the "dark interests" of man. <br /> <br /> Although I can not say that the wife was a strong character, she was the wrong choice for the part, in my opinion, she was a rich girl looking to escape from her life of drooling. In fact, she was a rebel and never fully matured for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman). It is obvious that he married her for her money and to cover her sexual desires, which is a taboo. Rickman played his part perfectly, his flirting with the young man and his subtle nuances of homosexuality. The young man was gay up to the hilt! When he did Marilyn's impersonation that should have told the wife everything. He was perfectly cast too. He has a con man written about him. <br /> <br /> I was not crazy about the end, since I knew what was coming. However, in general, Rickman's performance was excellent, Reedus was good, Walker was fine, but he had doubts. For a gay-themed movie, it was normal, but at least not brazen. It's worth seeing if you do not have "Truly Madly Deeply" hanging around.
