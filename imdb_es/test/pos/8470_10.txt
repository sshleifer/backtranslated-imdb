The first spoken image came back from oblivion, and now you can hear it and see it! In the autumn of 1894, at Edison's laboratory complex in West Orange, New Jersey, William Dickson, Thomas Edison's associate, tried to combine two existing technologies (the phonograph and the kinetoscope) to record sound and image together. In the event, Dickson could not synchronize the sound and image reproduction, so this experimental film was never released to paid audiences ... and, consequently, (unlike many silent films that Dickson made for Edison at this time ) has no official title. The silent image (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the Library of Congress for years, known to film historians as a mute curiosity. It was also known that the "soundtrack" had been recorded in one of the crude wax cylinders that languished in Edison's National Historic Site ... although nobody knew which one. <br /> <br /> But now that has changed. Recently, the curators located the wax cylinder, which had been broken into several pieces. These were reassembled: a reproduction was obtained and the sound was digitized. The veteran editor of the Hollywood soundtrack, Walter Murch, cleaned the background noise and modified the digitalization to synchronize it with the image of the film, which Murch had digitally compressed at 30 fps. At last, the sound and the image are synchronized! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the voice of a man off the screen who calls: 'Are the rest of you ready? Ahead!' (The invisible speaker remains unidentified, but it was probably Dickson's assistant, Fred Ott.) On the screen, Dickson plays the violin in an immense funnel mounted on a tripod (one of Edison's sound recording devices) while at his side, in view of the camera. , two male lab assistants embrace for a quick ballroom dance to the music of Dickson. <br /> <br /> The film lasts just 17 seconds: enough time to marvel at this raw technology before being provoked to laughter at the sight of two men cuddling in each other's arms. Speaking of which, here is a WARNING: a well-known but extremely inaccurate reference book ('The Celluloid Closet', by the late Vito Russo) includes a magnification of this film and identifies it as 'The Gay Brothers'. That's wrong 'The Gay Brothers' is a completely different movie, made by Dickson in Edison's lab during this same period. 'The Gay Brothers' never had a soundtrack: it's a short fiction film about two brothers who are NOT 'gay' in the sense that Russo meant it. The late Mr. Russo, for his own reasons, wanted us to see Dickson's experimental sound film (possibly the first musical film!) As an artifact of nineteenth-century homoerotism. (Hmm, what about gay men and musicals?) Sorry, but there's no such content here. <br /> <br /> This vitally important film deserves a rating of 10 out of 10. Many times I have maintained that no 'lost' film should be considered unrecoverable unless it has been deliberately destroyed: I am pleased to report that this film is finally available to the public, as its producer intended, more than a century after it was filmed!
