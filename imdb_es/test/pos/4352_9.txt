Warning: Herzog is a filmmaker and, as such, tends to be a bit too dramatic. So the obsessions about closing doors may or may not be a real part of the character's life, but the dramatic adornment of a filmmaker, or at least both agreed at the premiere in San Francisco. But Herzog's usual fascination with character, dreams and perseverance are well suited to this story published for the first time in Soldier of Fortune, and now it is a complete autobiographical book. (The Soldier of Fortune's commentary provoked loud boos from SF's politically correct audience, and both the filmmaker and the main character had to assure the audience that they had just seen the movie, that SOF's interest was misplaced. )
