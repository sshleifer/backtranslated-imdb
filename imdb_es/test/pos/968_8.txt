Big Fat Liar is a great watch for children of all ages, including adults. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and I recommend it to children 10 years old and younger. The laughs never end and the adventurous plot is also pretty good! Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is very funny! In general, a well made film for children to enjoy and have a great time.
