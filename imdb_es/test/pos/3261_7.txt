"Two Hands" is an entertaining and funny story about the Australian lowlifes. The script contrasts the world of quick money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstances. In a subtle way, we are asked to reflect on the concept that important events in our lives are sometimes generated without us being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of destiny and circumstances lead Jimmy, the main character, to situations that lead to the realization of his superficial dreams and, ultimately, to the understanding of a more personally promising world. <br /> <br /> The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with insight of Heath Ledger, is a child who grew up without an opportunity. The well-paid crime world offers the most attraction for your dull senses. The love and help of friends guide you to a higher plateau. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed and acted. The gang of criminals swings between friendly and despicable, keeping us interested in their crazy pranks throughout the film.
