I was plagued by nightmares related to Sesame Street and the Muppet Show during my childhood. I loved the programs, but when I slept, I dreamed of muppets not very different from those of television ... but not exactly those of television. <br /> <br /> They spoke without words and laughed and sang while singing. eating each other and killing each other. They would take a bite of their pretty felt flesh and it would tear, followed by arterial bleeding. NICE! But that was the past ... I LOVE THIS SHOW! A few years ago I watched Peter Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES program and I wondered why there was not a similar job out there. Well, here it is, as sick, twisted and, somehow, socially powerful the vision of the Hobbit. <br /> <br /> If you like this program and you have not seen MEET THE FEEBLES, get it on Amazon or one of those movies. source. A treat awaits you. <br /> <br /> By the way, Clarence would totally kick Triumph's dog ass.
