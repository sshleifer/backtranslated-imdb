This was the best movie of 1998 and one of the best of the 90s. Yes, it is a Goodfellas scam. But as the saying goes, good poets borrow, great poets steal. And the PTA has brilliantly stolen some of the best, plus some great touches of their own. I gave this one ten (which is very rare for me). <br /> <br /> The main reason why I mention this (because I could have been delirious all night) is because of all the people who have seen it on VHS. standard problem ... what are you thinking? This deserves the full screen experience. Look at the proportion in which it was filmed! I saw it 5 times at the cinema and I did not bother to watch it on video. <br /> <br /> Nuff said!
