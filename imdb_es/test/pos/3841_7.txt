I've seen this movie only once, several years ago. But I remember that I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ahead ** An old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats. His butler hears this and plans to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune. He puts drops in his milk. When they wake up, they are miles away. They must travel back home before it's too late. With the help of an independent cat and other accomplices of the animals, he evaded the butler and thwarted his plan. <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10.
