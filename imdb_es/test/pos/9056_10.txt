Normally I walk away from film festivals and I do not enjoy slapping comedy, but I must say that this picture was great. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz from the TV show "Numbers" and Lorraine Bracco, Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were at their best. This is a comedy at an incredibly high level with visual, spoken and satirical interludes that kept the audience, and me, laughing through a deeply rooted plot. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mr. Parness for dealing with a delicate but real, subject in a way that can be enjoyed but totally absorbed by his audience at all levels of intellect. The plot remains intact throughout the film and the comic relief is added to the message without being placed so thick as to distort. The mixture of segways is done perfectly and the product in general has a good taste. <br /> <br /> I can definitely state that this film is one that will go a long way and should be seen by the public of all ages; The problem is real and so is the powerful impact of this production.
