At this point, the game is obsolete, right? <br /> <br /> The jokes are already made. It's over. The creative genius that drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> The game is still intact, the jokes are here, friends. Sure, they're all refried, but so was Monkey Island 2. And 1, for that matter. <br /> <br /> The difficulty is well located, somewhere between 1 slightly easy and 2 ridiculously difficult. The ship fighting in the subgame is very inadequate, in the subgame tradition. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When you are asked for your membership card for an exclusive beach, always select "You do not need to see my ID". It's worth the price of the game by itself.
