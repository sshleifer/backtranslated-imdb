This movie is great The best performance I've seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurðsson is the best Icelandic actor, and of course Hilmir Snær and Bjorn jörundur. Good music and sound. A cold and hard reality about the struggle of a man who has many problems and the people in his life. The black humor mixed with a great performance and this style of European art films, works, meets in one of the best Icelandic films ever made. I tell you: "Look at this movie, you will not regret it". I gave him 9 stars. If you see an Icelandic movie in your life ... Look at this
