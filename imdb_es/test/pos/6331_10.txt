Although it is not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word, it is more rewarding than any movie full of laughter but lacking in substance. I do not think Bergman's movies can easily be classified into narrow genres, even the lightest ones are quite complex. This film, despite its light touch, poses a series of problems related to marriage and its deficiencies and what happens when the flames start to die, etc. I do not communicate personally with all these issues as I am sure others. But the atmosphere of the film is extraordinary, you almost wish it did not end. I must admit that I was dragged by the Bergman of the fifties, after having come to know most of his later and innovative efforts. Before Nykvist, von Sydow, Ulman, etc., the maestro produced some of the richest, hottest and most moving films I've ever seen. Although it is a remote possibility, I have seen this kind of love for humanity, in its complexity, only in Fellini's films of the same period. A lesson in love with Smiles of a Summer Night is worth seeing for Bergman fans, to have a complete picture of man's abilities, and for those who love cinema with a heart. May he rest in peace!
