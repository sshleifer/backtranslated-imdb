If Western Union is not exactly the true story of the Transcontinental Telegraph construction, it certainly captures the spirit and dedication of the people involved in the project. <br /> <br /> Dean Jagger is the man in charge and one fine day he is thrown from a horse and has some fractured ribs. Randolph Scott, a fugitive outlaw, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and brings Jagger to help him. Later, he is hired by Western Union and works for Jagger. <br /> <br /> Jagger also hires an oriental young man played by Robert Young, who is an engineer. Young is doing one of his few films outside of MGM for 20th Century Fox. Both Young and Scott become friends, but the rivals of Jagger's sister, Virginia Gilmore. <br /> <br /> Western Union has a lot of action, enough to satisfy Western fans. The telegraph team has to deal with the outlaws, the Indians and the labor problems of their garden variety. <br /> <br /> Slim Summerville as the timid cook and Victor Killian as the border character assigned to protect him has some of the funniest scenes. Both provide a good comic relief. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving. Western Union is a solid western entertainment.
