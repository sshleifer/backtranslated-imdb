The movie that John Waters gave us is one of the funniest movies in history. Yes, it can be serious, but it is full of hysterical moments that nobody has done since then. The infamous dog scene has to be one of the highlights of cinema. It is not a movie for those who are easily offended, it is one of those movies in which you always see something new. Divine performance is worth the reputation. Mink Stole is hysterical. This is the film responsible for the Farrely brothers and the whole Gross-out comedy genre. I know it sounds a bit extreme, but think about it. Before this the comedies were very close and almost identical. After this movie, the comedies became strange and strange, but in a good way. I would give it 15 out of 10 if I could.
