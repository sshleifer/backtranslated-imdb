When I sat in the theater almost crying to myself, dismayed by the atrocity that Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> Hanks and Company are back for the Seels-Prequel Angels and Demons, and have learned the lesson. <br /> <br /> Act wisely, everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as always, although he is better at this, because he works harder to give the film the feeling that it is a thriller. I think Ewan McGregor does the best job of any of the actors. He may even deserve a nomination in March, but doubtful. It convinced me right until the end. He is dynamic and faithful, but rational, and he realizes that the Church needs to leave behind her past. The minor actors also do very good jobs. <br /> <br /> Technically and visually the film has improved a lot. The cinematography is much ... much better, and the visual effects are excellent. The final sequence of explosion at the end is excellent. Howard does a masterful job and takes it through a tour of Rome. <br /> <br /> On this occasion, Ron Howard does an incredible job to keep the story moving, without getting bored with a history lesson considered in denouncing Christianity. The movie also makes you feel that there is more at stake. In our weak minds, discovering whether Jesus had children or not, is not that high on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion that killed thousands, including the Roman Catholic Church. Part of the reason why I think the story is so fast is because of the excellent score. I can not say enough about the score. It was epic at times, like something from The Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it felt like a Bourne movie, which is a good combination. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this movie is that it's ridiculously far-fetched The chances of Carmelengo being someone the age of Ewan McGregors are highly unlikely, and the chances of a Cardinal with an adopted son being chosen Papa are even more ridiculous. Not to mention the whole Antimatter issue, which has not yet been created, and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003 ... Film more important than the Da Vinci Code. This is a thriller for those who love history and mystery combined in one.
