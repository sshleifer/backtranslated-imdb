I saw this movie with my mother, and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (not to mention it's funny because of the support of the cast!) They never make movies like this ... ever! My favorite part is when Grace (Minnie Driver) finds out about the death of her boyfriend's wife, and she has the heart of the deceased wife and shouts: "WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO GOD?" I think everyone (no matter who you think) has thoughts like that from time to time. But while it is silly, I could make you believe in true love and destiny once and for all. (Sigh) <br /> <br /> The comic moment between Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi will make you laugh (especially in the scene mentioned, it's terrible, and yet very funny!). They make a good pair, and I hope to see them soon soon. 10/10 stars
