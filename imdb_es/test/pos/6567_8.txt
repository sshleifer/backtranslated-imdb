It turns out that I read all the manga published in English by Junji Ito. I saw Tomie's movie and it was a big pile of smoking turd. THANK YOU Uzumaki really does justice to manga. I think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this movie, since many screenshots and camera angles are exactly like in the manga and it is interesting to see how the characters in the book are played in the film. This movie reminds me of the strange indiana. The end differs from the manga, which I expected. Kirie looks like her manga counterpart, and her man friend adapts very well to the set. Very scary, I must admit that this movie feels like a feverish nightmare, like the one you had when you were a child. Is not it really scary at all, but strange, if you understand me? Another great horror of Japan, get yourself a copy.
