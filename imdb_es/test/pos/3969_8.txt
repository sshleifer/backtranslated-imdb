A movie for teenagers of 2006 is accepted that is carried out by the type of announcements of Mac and PC. The movie is about Bartelby .B. He gets a boy he has rejected from all the universities he has applied for, so he decides to create his own university and invites all the other people who did not. The problem is that hundreds of people register at their school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $ 5.00 at a sale and I've always seen it. In general, this film is a must for fans of all comedies, as it is fun, witty and just a good movie. I rate this movie a very fair 78%. GO ACCEPTED MAKE A SEQUENTIAL GUIDE BUT MAKE SURE IT IS NOT SHIT.
