This film, with only two characters, brings him closer to these two people, the interrogator and the prisoner, that most films take him to any character, although it is well prepared. <br /> <br /> The sheer confusion, terror and pain that the character of Madeleine Stowe suffers is deeply disturbing, as is Alan Rickman's sadistic but charming interrogator. <br /> <br /> This movie is too possible and it develops to a shocking climax, the effect of the movie as a whole You are sitting quietly at the end. It will persecute you for a long time.
