Having seen this without knowing all the fuss surrounding the main character, even without knowing that it was based on real life events, I must say that I am impressed. "Murder in Greenwich" is an above-average production for a film made for television: the performance is uniformly excellent, Christopher Meloni in particular stands out for his outstanding performance and the teenage actors excel in what are difficult roles. The idea of ​​the dead girl that narrates the film is a stroke of genius that elevates the film from simply good to excellent. The script is exemplary for what is essentially the fodder of the movie of the week and the cinematography is beautiful.
