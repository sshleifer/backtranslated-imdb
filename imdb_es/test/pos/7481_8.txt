I love the premise, but its reproduction value is only for certain parts (the initial scene, of course). Some characters are a bit scandalous, but they are entertaining. I think the Ballping sh-t was pushing him. I know it was to show that Nick and Casey were living poorly in Los Angeles and to show why Casey abandoned the lifestyle, I just think the history of the flashback could have been better. Also the Jamaican guy who raps on the phone is smart and entertaining, but once again I think the story was told. It really seems incredible. In fact, I think Swordfish (the other movie that Woods has written) more than some of the parties on Thursday because the government keeps the secret all the time, and has established organizations that the public will never know. <br /> <br /> Thursday is the best Quentin film I've seen. I think Woods is imaginative, intelligent and talented; however, his work needs more maturity to reach even the level of the script of Natural Born Killer (not from Stone's movie). How old is he anyway?
