Here we have the inimitable Charlie Chaplin, who abandoned his slapstick to address the serious issue of anti-Semitism and intolerance in general. It portrays two characters, the sweet and innocent Jewish hairdresser, a war veteran and the relentless and ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel. The Jewish ghetto in this country is not safe for long, due to the whims of Hynkel and his armed thugs, who habitually mistreat their residents, or leave them alone, depending on their mood that day or week. The barber is among them, but befriends his former commander-in-chief, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), who seems to be silent for a time, until Hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. He seeks refuge with the Jews in the ghetto, especially the barber, and the young fighter, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The premise will be: who will be the only one among these Jews who will risk their lives to get rid of Hynkel and his friends? We do not have to guess too much to know the answer; the barber is a dead man for the dictator, and is equipped in his image, accompanied by Schultz, also with full military equipment. Hannah escapes with several of her friends from the ghetto to the country of Osterlich, where Mr. Jaeckel's cousin (Maurice Moscovich) has a farm, and they can live in peace for a while. At this point, Hynkel himself has been arrested by his armed forces, believing that he is the famous barber. The latter, meanwhile, has been accompanied with Schultz to a podium, to make a speech announcing the conquest of Osterlich. The next ten minutes is the pure Chaplin, who speaks from his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigrates greed and hatred. Although Chaplin began production of the film in 1937, some ingenuity can be forgiven. Apparently, he did not know the seriousness of this persecution and hatred, and said that if he had known in all its extension, he would never have made the film, because he probably believed that he would have trivialized the situation. He has a wonderful supporting cast: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell as Garbitsch, his aide-de-camp, the ever-wonderful Billy Gilbert as the clumsy Herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie as the dictator Napaloni, his rival for the conquest, veteran European actors David Gorcey (father of Leo), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene that choreographed with a balloon, with only a musical accompaniment is pure, luminous and luminous inspiration too, it is Paulette Goddard at the end of the film, smiling through her tears. I've seen this movie before, but there's always something new for me. Last night, when it was over, I sat crying. I challenge anyone not to move because of it.
