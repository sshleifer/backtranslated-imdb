This is a very good black comedy, with a great vision of how different people have a different perception of the same situations. The three main characters met a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, which is a different male fantasy for each of the three men. Each of the three men goes through the same situations, but when they tell other people, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. That's a very good concept, probably not completely original, but it works very well in the movie. The plot is very good, very strange and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. The acting is just as good, none of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league. The comedy is very black, black in some scenes, and many people will definitely be offended by it, but fans of the black comedy will probably enjoy it. In general, this movie is not for everyone's taste, but most people who like black comedy will probably adore it, as it is definitely one of the best black comedies. 7/10
