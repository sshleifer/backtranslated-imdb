This is probably the best Clint Eastwood movie. Here the action is minimal, but with a good performance. Eastwood, a Yankee soldier, is wounded and taken away by the students and teachers of a school in the south, where he is hidden and cared for. Shortly after his recovery, all the ladies wanted to have fun with him, and some of them were successful, including the school principal (Geraldine Page). The erotic scenes are coming until the ladies discovered that their "macho" was shared by several of them, so they got angry and poisoned him at a farewell dinner. Geraldine Page, although somewhat older, could play a very suggestive role as head of the school, a woman with more failures than happiness in her life.
