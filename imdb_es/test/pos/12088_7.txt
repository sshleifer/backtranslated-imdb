First of all, I must point out that I really liked watching this documentary. Not only did I have good music, but the shots and the editing were also wonderful. However, all these positive things about the film do not change the fact that it plays with the Orientalist clich√© "East and West" that bothers many Turks like me. Granted, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very elegant way, something good, something that would show European and American ignoramuses that this country is not just about murdering Armenians and Kurds. However, the problem with the film is that it looks at what it defines as "this" from the eyes of the "west". I mean, as a jazz musician says in the film, maybe there is not an east or a west, maybe it's just a myth, a lie created by the leaders of the "western" countries to keep alive the fear and hostility So could I continue to rule the world and "keep the cash flow"? <br /> <br /> Why do not you think about that?
