From the beginning of the film, I found myself laughing trying to keep quiet, so I did not wake up anyone in the house, this did not continue so much during the rest of the movie, I did not find everything completely "laugh out loud" Funny , but still I found certain things quite funny. At first, I had to hold back my laughter when he dropped the Hand Grenade grenade by the hand. Then there are scenes in which you will only smile, like when Barber falls from the ceiling to someone's apartment, I can see that it is quite funny, but in today's days and in the time that has been done enough, it did not feel original. At that time, I'm sure it was. I loved Hynkels (Hitlers) outbursts of furious German with the beautiful and subtle English translation. <br /> <br /> The final scene is discussed savagely because, well, it is absolutely true and it is very well constructed. Although the film is sixty-eight years old, the final scene is still relevant today, if this does not show how wonderful a Chaplin writer is, then I do not know what he will do. The performance in this particular scene was quite good, Barber transcended the message to perfection and makes you realize the serious nature of the film, at the same time enjoying the comic side. <br /> <br /> Another element of this movie It is the fact that this was such a brave movie, that you almost feel it ahead of time. Of course, Chaplin did not know what was going to happen after 1940, he was not aware of the Holocaust (obviously), he also said that if he knew that he would not have made this movie. The fact that this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting, it is more interesting that it was not anti-Germany which would be very easy to do in those times. Chaplin could easily make this a propaganda movie, but he did something instead. more, he made an honest movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone interested in this movie to see it, as well as those who have studied or are studying Hitler and World War II to watch this movie. It's entertaining, to say the least, it does not have an annoying antiquated feel that some movies of the era had. Unlike most "comedies," this movie actually has a message that it tries to convey to you. Watch this movie, it will be better to have seen it.
