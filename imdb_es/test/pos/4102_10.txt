I saw this movie a few years ago and I quickly bought the soundtrack because it was simply excellent. The music of Bacharach is captivating and should receive the recognition it deserves. The cinematography is impressive. The critics hated it, but they also hated HOME ALONE. I have not found it in the video, but I welcome anyone who can find a copy.
