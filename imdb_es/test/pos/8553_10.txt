This movie ... I saw it 15 years ago and in recent years I could not remember it anymore, nor the name or anything else, only that it was a Romanian country man played excellent by Anthony Quinn. The impression I have of this drama will be eternal. Finally I found the name of the movie, I hope to buy it. And honestly this movie is worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was very young when I saw the movie for the first time. I asked my friends if they found out about this story, but nobody would know anything about Anthony Quinn playing the role of a Romanian peasant. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him that it was a good "race" but that, in fact, the German was cheating him. For a few dollars you will not get rich if you buy the movie, but it will be rich if you have it.
