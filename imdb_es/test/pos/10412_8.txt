I think it's great how Chiller took this series and showed it to this generation. The making of films has come a long way, especially with special effects and so that one can see archived programs that they never knew existed, they will surely be able to see the progress compared to now. MONSTERS is neither lame nor spectacular, but it is entertaining. Creativity is needed for the types of stories that were created and each generation seems to have its own horror series. This particular series was not as horrible as Friday the 13th, the series, not as oriented to adults as Freddy's nightmares ... it was something that a whole family could see and still have a laugh and a fright at the same time. I'm happy that Chiller Channel shows it in their lineup, I'm almost caught up in the episodes that I missed when I was growing up.
