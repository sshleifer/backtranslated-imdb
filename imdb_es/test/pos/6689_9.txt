Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of his generation, maybe the best. This in combination with another amazing actor named Jeff Bridges, can not be bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-PAX" is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years. To begin with, the film has a brilliantly written history. It's part of what makes the movie so cool. The other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the film is the performance. The Spacey-Bridges combination really works. <br /> <br /> This was the second time I saw the movie and I'm sure it will not be the last time. "K-PAX" has it all. There are moments that are extremely funny, parts that resemble a real thriller and others that are reminiscent of high class dramas. I think this movie deserves a much higher rating and many more awards. Great movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10
