Woohoo! I chose this from the rental rack because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in 'Trainspotting'. This is a phenomenal movie; It has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and ingenuity. When I was not laughing, I was on the edge of my seat. This is definitely a film I would recommend to people who appreciate intelligent dialogue and a new perspective of the eighteenth century. This movie has everything to make me happy!
