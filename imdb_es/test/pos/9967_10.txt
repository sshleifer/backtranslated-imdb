The Merchant of Venice, by William Shakespeare, is about a Jewish moneylender and his link to extract a pound of meat from the wealthy merchant Antonio, the winner of a debt. The Jewish moneylender, of course, is Shylock and Al Pacino offers him such an imposing performance that even leading actors like Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins vanish in the background. The film is set in the sixteenth century in Venice and the director Michael Radford is based on the setting, the mood and realism to tell his story, rejecting the luxurious period costumes or a modern setting with rock music to attract a wider public. <br /> <br /> Radford divides the duration of the three hours of the work into two manageable hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background. In the opening narrative, he tells us how the Jews came to England, were subject to further persecution and were finally expelled from England. They were forbidden to own property, they could only make a profit by lending money to interest, and they were forced to live in a Venetian "geto", a forerunner of the darkest events to come. In the film, merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spits Shylock out in public, but is not ashamed to go to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggested lover Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) to court Portia properly (Lynne Collins), a rich heiress. Although Shylock has been insulted by Antonio, he agrees to lend the money without interest for three months on condition that the loss of the bond gives him the right to obtain a pound of meat from Antonio's heart. <br /> <br /> The game is mainly a drama of hate and revenge, but like many of Shakespeare's plays, there are also touches of broad comedy. Here the comedy involves three couples of lovers: Bassanio and Portia, Gratiano, Bassanio's friend, and Nerissa, and Lorenzo, another friend of Bassanio, and Jessica, Shylock's daughter. Portia offered herself to the person who can choose the right treasure from one of the three boxes, made of gold, silver and lead. The Prince of Morocco chooses the gold, the Prince of Aragon the silver and both are disappointed. Bassanio, however, loves her for herself and opens the lead coffin to find the portrait inside. The Radford adaptation conveys a remarkable sense of time and place. The Portia residence in Belmont suggests one of those splendid summer houses with immaculate gardens and artistic treasures that hang from every room and contrasts with the dirty look of the city of Shylock with its damp alleys. <br /> <br /> When it is clear that Antonio can not pay the debt, Bassanio returns to Venice, leaving behind Portia. When he arrives, the loan is in default and Shylock is demanding his pound of meat. Even when Bassanio, backed by the wealth of Portia, often offers the amount in reimbursement, Shylock intends to take revenge not only for the loss of money, but for a life of outsider status. The duke, who sits in the trial, will not intervene as Portia enters disguised as an attorney to defend Antonio. It is here that the film reaches its dramatic height when all parties come to court to reach a final resolution. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Venice is not only about an unpaid debt, but also about the separation of Jews from Christians. Society and its desire for belonging. It has been one of the most controversial works of Shakespeare and analysts have long debated whether it is an anti-Semitic work or simply a work on anti-Semitism that reflects the prevailing vision of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is definitely a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that Shakespeare considers his defects as human, not Jewish, defects. The duke recognizes that he is simply a man who has not attached himself to the compassionate language of the Torah. <br /> <br /> In the monologue, "I'm a Jew, do not you have Jewish eyes?" Paint us, do not we bleed? If you tickle us, do not we laugh? If you poison us, do not we die? , Will not we avenge ourselves? ", Shylock shows a universal humanity, expressing the equality of all men. Although we are horrified by the sentence you want to fulfill, we can feel your pain accumulated over the years. The performance of Pacino gives a new vigor to the text and his person, often exaggerated, is replaced by a more friendly and discreet attitude that brings understanding to his cause. During an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival last September, Radford said about Pacino. "" When you work with a brilliant actor, you have a great machine. It's a bit like driving a powerful car. You must dare to do it. "He has dared and we are all beneficiaries.
