The first time I played around 98 'or 99' when I was with my friends. I thought the game was really great, and I loved it. <br /> <br /> The game is simple. In single-player mode, you go as James Bond and complete missions in different places, such as an arctic wasteland or a city. My favorite was one with a tank. In two-player mode, you and a friend choose any character they want and fight. In the area where you are, you will find ammunition and weapons to help you. From pistols to rifles and lasers, and even their fists work. <br /> <br /> Again, with player two mode, there are many places to go, and some to unlock. I find this game really fun, but also very entertaining. Because you never really know where your opponent is, and it's amazing to see him behind a door that you go to. <br /> <br /> This game receives **** stars (1/2) or ***** Very good! Go play it sometime!
