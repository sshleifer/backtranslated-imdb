I saw the original rough screen showing 4 times in Gencon a couple of years ago. I was delighted to have done it, my daughter is in the movie. <br /> <br /> I stayed in the back of the room with her watching the much younger fans sitting on the edge of the seats, very quiet, not wanting. lose a line. The next ovation was like watching the fans when the USA hockey team. UU He beat the Russians at the Olympic Games in Montreal. <br /> <br /> I love comedies and gags in sight. Taxi, Barney Miller, Cheers, Frasier and Married with Chilren are my favorite comedy shows of all time. Minor programs that I will not even see. <br /> <br /> This movie will do for the Gamers what Animal House did in the fraternity days, what Dodge Ball did for strange sports. Forget the lack of a mega budget to support production. This is pure art, it is very good. <br /> <br /> I could not be happier for the entire cast and production company.
