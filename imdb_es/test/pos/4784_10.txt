A caricature of Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE. <br /> <br /> STEAMBOAT WILLIE, a little rogue rogue, neglects his chair and has fun in the history of cinematography. <br /> <br /> On November 18, 1928, a young man in distress. genius debuted the world's first successful caricature with synchronous sound. We should not look back at either Walt Disney or his alter ego Mickey Mouse. The financial struggles would hold, but essentially the world was his bed of oysters and Mickey would eventually rival Chaplin as the most recognizable cultural icon of the century. <br /> <br /> As an entertainment, STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun to watch, with good work with animator Ub Iwerks and shows Mickey with all the passions and indifference of a young child. He must deal with a tyrannical captain (Pete, without his wooden leg, had been appearing in Disney cartoons since February 1925), a nutty parrot (in a few years it would be a duck) and a cute little mouse named Minnie. Together, the two rodents make music cruelly in the bodies of a goat, cat, goose, piglets and cows (a precursor of Clarabelle), all of which were conveniently aboard the steamboat. The audience howled for more and the pattern was set for the next mouse cartoons of the next few years. <br /> <br /> ***************** ******** <br /> <br /> Walt Disney (1901) -1966) was always intrigued by the images and drawings. As a boy in Marceline, Missouri, he drew farm animals on pieces of paper; Later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated ads and small cartoons for local theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series opened the way by placing a living figure in a cartoon universe. Changes in business sent Disney and Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother, Roy, became his lifelong manager and adviser. When the dealer snatched a slightly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit, the character of Mickey Mouse emerged in Walt's imagination, ensuring the immortality of Disney. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with the use of synchronized music. Soon the SILLY SYMPHONIES appeared, and the growing group of wonderfully talented animators from Walt quickly conquered new territories with all the color, illusions of depth and radical advances in the development of personality, a setting in which Walt's genius was unbeatable. Mickey's daring and mischievous behavior had captured millions of fans, but he was soon joined by other animated companions: the temperamental Donald duck, the intellectual Goofy and the intellectually energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's great dream: animated feature films. Against a storm of adversaries, Walt persevered and during the following decades he charmed children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi and Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that all his fortunes were initiated by a mouse, or that the simplicity of a child's message and a lot of hard work always work.
