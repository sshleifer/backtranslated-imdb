<br /> <br /> ********************* SPOILERS FAR AWAY *********** * ************** <br /> <br /> We Dive at Dawn is a film made in English with John Mills in the lead role. The second time I saw the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I must say that the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the Samsung screen. Could it be the large screen display that helped? <br /> <br /> I keep saying that the first segments of the film are confusing, but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission, the film also takes off! The search for the German battleship named Brandenburg and the adventures that accompanied it were fascinating and the details shown in the film are interesting! <br /> <br /> I am increasing my rating to 7/10. If you like World War II movies, I think you'll find an interesting one once the submarine starts up. Some of the submarine men also have a good sense of humor!
