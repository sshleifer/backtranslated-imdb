Well, it may be a prejudice as I grew up watching a VHS copy of this movie that is now ready to shoot and I just spent the last two hours tracking a DVD copy as a birthday present for my dad. The film is so harmless and harmless that it suits all ages ... much better than anything Disney has done in my opinion (and I used to work at the Disney Store!). The characters are nice and the prize for the best scene is a tie between the interrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly, and Smack the mosquito), and the incredible nightclub scene. The musical numbers still have me buzzing 20 years after having seen it for the first time. There is no other film I can recommend better while I take care of children, and in fact, all the children I know (thanks to my Hoppity loving parents) have seen this movie many times. You will always get the best grades for your fabulous love story, a brilliant genius and above all originality.
