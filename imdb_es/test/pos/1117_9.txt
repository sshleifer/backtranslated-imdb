A wonderful family movie and a beautiful horse movie. 75 +% entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and adorable characters. Horses are real beauties. <br /> <br /> Have the horse races as a backdrop to show that luck is sometimes just a little common sense. It shows how children can do stupid things for stupid reasons. It shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The characters portrayed realistically transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something that everyone can relate to. <br /> <br /> Andrew Rubin presents a wonderful performance as Buddy, the sensitive older brother. Something reminded me of Aidan Quinn (eyes, speech expression, facial appearance). <br /> <br /> Casey falls in love with the character because of his seriousness. Sarah Blue is also very well played by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, the father, is played by Walter Matthau and he IS the character. <br /> <br /> Although there is room for improvement in the film, it is a very nice movie and one of feeling good.
