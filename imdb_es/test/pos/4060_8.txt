SHOWTIME is a disaster, but it is an entertaining disaster. The plot is forgettable, the satire is light and the sequences of action, although well organized, are not so exciting. But I laughed. Much. The credit goes to the inspired couple of De Niro and Murphy. They have a great chemistry. Murphy delivers the sentences of a single line, De Niro surprises us with a look or a grimace. This film will have a reception similar to RUSH HOUR on the part of the critics. Do not listen to them If you are a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you will enjoy this movie.
