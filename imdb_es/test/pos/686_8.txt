This is a rough diamond hilarious. The performance and the plot are not so impressive, but the lines keep coming. This catches a lot of problems because at first glance it looks like a good movie, but it's so weird that you can not help being funny. The quick dialogue to clarify the spasms and the extravagant characters keep it ... I especially liked Sharon, the Shrooms Canuck, huh? However, the one who actually stole the show was Richard's little brother, Andrew (Ira Heiden), his shrill whining was somehow attractive. The whole movie shook.
