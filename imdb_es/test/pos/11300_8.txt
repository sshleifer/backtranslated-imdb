I heard about this movie a long time ago and finally found it on eBay for five dollars. I did not expect much, but wow, if I was ever surprised. It's the story of a boy and girl in love trying to escape from an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle, reminds me of ICO for PS2 because some shots gave him a feeling of vertigo . It seems pretty standard, but this movie is crazy It's hard to believe that such an original animated feature was made in 1952. Also, the king was probably one of the most spooky characters I've seen in a long time, with a feminine walk, strange eyes (usually crossed) and a soft but terrifying voice. The only problem I had with the movie was that the boy and the girl had no personality and almost no line except to call the mr. Wonderbird (A great green bird that speaks) to save them. The animation was fantastic in most areas, but some cells were missing from some stinking scenes. It's incredibly original with flying cops and giant mechs and even laughing out loud at times, it's a real shame it's such a dark title because it's really a good movie. Check it out at some point.
