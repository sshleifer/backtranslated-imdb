DO NOT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten jewel occupies a special place in my heart and in the Video Nasties list. The flute-sitar-rattle soundtrack is classic. The main character, although much more attractive than most low-budget stars, is a fairly standard low-budget advantage. The character of Doctor Masters is well written and well acted. Some of the minor characters are somewhat stupid, but they add to the nostalgia of the movie. It's campy. I'm not trying to lie. The character that makes this great is a Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam, one of the patients in this sanatorium who has gone mad. The blood is pretty standard, although I think the color of the blood is impressive. It's so ... Red. This film, I think, was badly received by its advertising scheme. A small soulless advertising executive put his dirty hands on him and thought, "We're going to start the AD campaign for Last House on the Left, which is fine." Kids like this have ruined the world of cinema. All the balls and no brain. In addition, the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic. Maybe there are all drunk. You will see what I want to say. A small note more. Do not buy this from the Wally-Mart dollar shelf. They have reduced it to an indecipherable level. Try to find the longest cut you can.
