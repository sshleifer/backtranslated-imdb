Romuald et Juliette is one of those romantic French comedies where they seem to break all the rules, like Trop Belle Pour Toi. The magnificent Daniel Auteuil learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to crash against his ears. The film is not a story of morality preached, but a wonderful story that will keep you hooked until the end. Firmine Richard (like Juliette) is a heroine that women will cheer, her laugh is my permanent memory of this warm and ingenious film. The practical way he has of including all his children by his different parents, especially birthdays, gives the film an advantage that elevates it above his average romantic comedy. But it is always the French who seem to show us how easy this is!
