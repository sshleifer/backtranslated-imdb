The grave robber who is sitting in his cell awaiting execution is visited by a monk who wishes to take his last words for posterity and as a warning to others about the horrible life he leads. At first, reluctant, but with his tongue loosened by the drink, the young grave robber soon tells his story, which is full of dead, undead and things that jump in the night. <br /> <br /> The horror movie with New York eyeglasses (filmed in part on Staten Island, which undoubtedly attracted the spirit of Andy Milligan who hides) is one of the best horror comedies to be presented in a time. This is a very funny movie that has just told its story in every way. The cast is first class. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake, the grave robber who tells his story. Ron Perlman is Father Duffy, the monk who takes the statement and perhaps gets too involved in the story. Both men are clearly having a great time and it shows. The rest of the cast is just as good. The music of Jeff Grace is excellent. The effects are perfect for this kind of macabre nonsense. The movie is very funny. If there is a problem with the film, it may throw your network a little wider, as the result has too many consequences. I do not want to reveal too much, but I do not think we needed the foreign body in the mix. Still, this is a lot of fun and it's something I'm pretty sure I'll visit again at IFC in Theaters where I saw it for the first time, and then I'm sure I'll pick up the DVD. <Br /> <br /> It's worth checking out.
