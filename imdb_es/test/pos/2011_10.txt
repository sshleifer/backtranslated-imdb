This was a classic of modern television! The story is like that, Bob has a girlfriend named Alice. Bob and Alicia are in love and want to get married. Bob has a friend named Owen with whom he works. Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes to hang out with Bob. Now Owen is with Bob and Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very accident prone. She too, if you have not guessed, is a little lonely. She also goes with Bob and Alice, and Owen. Sometimes Alice wants Bob to have no friends. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first season, it seemed that Owen had finally become a true long-term girlfriend. Bob and Alicia went driving the night before their wedding, left in a small car and then got stuck. Out in the middle of nowhere! What happened after? What's wrong with poor Heather? Did someone get married? Sorry, the series ended. <br /> <br /> Not even a TV Guide request made FOX think twice before putting it back on the air. It was a great show with a great cast. I loved Heather too. She looked fresh in those glasses and it was hilarious. I miss this show a lot. This is like reading a good book with the end missing ... sad.
