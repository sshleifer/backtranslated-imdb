A good romantic comedy. Errol Flynn shows the skilful touch of the comedy he possessed. a talent that probably shows something of its true joker. The comic writing about this movie is excellent. Eleanor Parker does a good job as the ex-wife of flynn whom errol tries to recover. Eleanor is also easy for the eyes. the sets exude the glamor and style of 1940 when appropriate. <br /> <br /> The comic synchronization and wit of flynn are shown with total effectiveness here, look at its double take, its ability to counteract verbally with a quick response or act like a heterosexual man, and its total credibility and sincerity where it is required, this guy could act! It's a shame that Errol did not have the opportunity to do more roles like this throughout his career, he was multi-talented to the extreme. If you enjoyed "happened one night" with gablete and colbert or one of the comedies of william powell and myrna loy, you will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> good rhythm and lots of laughs. A diamond lost from a movie.
