I saw this movie in Wales in July. It deals with the value of the Czech pilots who flew numerous missions to the RAF after their country had been occupied by the Nazis. In this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950s when these pilots are being beaten in the political prisons of Czeckoslavakia and during World War II in Britain. They were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the communist regime considered these warriors as a threat to their occupation of Czeckoslavakia. The pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against Nazi pilots. This film contains a secondary love story that makes sense because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. The end of this film indicates that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990s after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was made with the financial support of the Czech government. I highly recommend this movie.
