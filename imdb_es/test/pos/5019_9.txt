Why would this movie be so good, but would it only raise approximately $ 95,000,000 and NOT have nominations for prizes? John Travolta knows what he is doing. He knows it's Michael, a magic arc angel, womanizer and cigar smoker who came to live with a dying woman and is now in a car with the staff of "The National Mirror" and his dog, Sparky, on the way to Chicago. Then it becomes a road trip that is both horrible and great. I do not even think that the scenes of death (3 to be exact) make this a tear. The soundtrack is the best with "Heaven Is My Home", "Up Around The Bend" and "Chains Of Fools". I have great expectations about this and I say I should have had a little more respect in the 90s.
