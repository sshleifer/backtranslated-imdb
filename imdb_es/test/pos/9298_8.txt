Let's face it, Australian television is for the most part terrible, but this is a real diamond in the rough that there are not enough people watching. Chaser's team that makes the satirical newspaper and CNNN try something new by mixing live comedy, pre-recorded parodies and political satire in a show filmed in front of a live audience, like Rove, but fun. They love to cause controversy and this makes some of the shows more fun, especially when Chris tells his wife to "go" live on breakfast television and have Julian give him a novelty check signed by Saddam Heusein to the director of AWB. It has to be one of the funniest Australian shows since the Micallef Program.
