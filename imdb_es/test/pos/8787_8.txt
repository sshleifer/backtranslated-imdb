You can not help but marvel at Hitchcock's initial work. "Saboteur," for example, is so skilled and quick that it's hard to believe he made this movie more than 60 years ago. There are some elements of propaganda, but they are woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays wonderfully years later. He also gets some previews of things that Hitchcock would do later, like using a national reference point as a backdrop. This time it's the Statue of Liberty. In "North by Northwest", of course, it's Mt. Rushmore. You will also recognize the things that appear later in "Rear Window" and "Vertigo" in "Saboteur", but do not reveal the show. Robert Cummings is excellent as is the charming Otto Kruger. Look for the Hitchcock mini-western in this one. It happens quickly, so do not blink.
