Anyone who enjoys the Lynchian rarity of Twin Peaks, or any HP Lovecraft fan who knows that the most frightening things are familiar things, will really enjoy this movie. Do not see it as a horror movie in the "traditional" Western sense, but as a Grimm fairy tale. It is bloody and definitely for people over 16, but once you start to see it, you will also find yourself trapped in the vortex. Definitely one of those movies that hang with you for a few days after watching them (I'll never see my snails again in the same way!)
