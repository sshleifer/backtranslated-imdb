Bergman's Skammen is one of the most realistic representations of the war that has ever been filmed. This is not an action movie in any way, although the pace is faster and there is more action than in any other Bergman movie. Nor is it a romanticization of war or patriotism, unlike most war movies. In fact, the harsh realism and deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalties have a very contemporary feel. <br /> <br /> Skammen is a film with little light, which should be seen at night, to make it work. . Many of the effects are transmitted indirectly, but with such efficiency that some scenes compete in intensity with a contemporary budget movie, incredibly huge, like Saving Private Ryan. Of course, the action in Skammen is on a much smaller scale, but it is impressive. <br /> <br /> While the cinematographic style feels contemporary, the setting of the film feels timeless and without a doubt. The war-ravaged countryside, and even the provincial village still intact, could be anywhere, at any time. And this film is not so much about specific historical events, with specific names and dates, but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos. <br /> <br /> The performance in Skammen, though typically impressive by Ullman and Sydow, is not of paramount importance in this film, unlike most of Bergman's other films. Through much of the film they are spectators, as much as we are. Bergman has the war imposed on them and, through them, on the audience, and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions might be. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/10
