This movie kicks ass, without exception. Bam and his crue have been made with this movie. Since I received the DVD (4 days ago) I have seen it three times and it improves every time I see it. I can not wait for Grind to go to the movies. If it's something like Haggard, it will be worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> Thanks, JTcellphone
