Expectacular second part of THE ATOR !! Directed quickly by JOE D'AMATO, specialist in all types of sub-types (subgenres) of exploitation, and interpreted again by MILES O'KEEFFE. The budget of the film should have been mocking or minimal. Despite not being a better movie of his predecessor and no more entertaining, ATOR 2 does not either, has something, something that makes it entertaining. Its introduction, according to the proposal, explains the origin of ATOR with images of the first part. The script is amazing, it's like any comic of the great ROY THOMAS. has such fantastic elements within the world of the SWORD and FANTASY as invisible men, black knights, cannibals, monkeys ... the role of the villain that he interpreted brilliant. The final is very well fought. Lack more violence and blood, but it's fine. It never gets boring. It has everything that was missing from ATOR 1. Let yourself be seduced by me! 4/5
