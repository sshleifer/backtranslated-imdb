This is the Australian television series. Its a classic. The stories and the actors are excellent. Who can forget that Picker and his gramophone or Chet were ambushed? This is cult TV. The Australian actors in the series were the best of their time and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say about timeless adventure? The music and the song just fantastic. The closing credits that start with the foreground of the wheel, then Keir sleeping and pushing around and then the general possibility can not be better than that. The 13 episodes are equally solid in the description of the Australian myth and I think this is what this series has. It does not matter that the two main characters were foreigners, I think that is the key to the series and why it is so. good.
