A refreshing interview with the legendary director of photography, producer and Italian film director who died in 1999 with about 200 roles under his belt as director. A large part is spent on D'Amato's soft sex movies, including her famous EMANUELLE entries with Laura Gemser. They also briefly cover his porn career, which kept him afloat during his last decade. More interesting to me is the section that focuses on their efforts of action and horror. D'Amato has many great anecdotes about the actors and their low-budget footage, which includes a story about an assistant who accidentally collects real bones from the fake while filming in a 2,000-year-old catacomb. Other interviewees include George Eastman and Al Cliver. I would have liked to have a little more conversation about his productions from Stateside Filmirage (not a single question about TROLL 2, although it was not the cult movie that it was now).
