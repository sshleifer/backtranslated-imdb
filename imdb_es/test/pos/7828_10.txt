Undoubtedly, a complete great show that, if shown today, would attract a large number of followers. TheBodyguards had only 6 episodes and a trailer, but it deserved some more series to really update it. With outstanding performances of great talent and versatility Sean Pertwee and the dynamic Louise Lombard, really put him with the likes of Proffesionals, The Sweeney and Thief Takers. from the scrap that other TV production companies produce. I do not think it was seen on terrestrial television, like Sky or Freeview, which is a shame as if it were to be seen today, I'm sure it would get a large audience. So I hope that one day the guys on Carlton TV decide to release it on DVD, cheers, Nick.
