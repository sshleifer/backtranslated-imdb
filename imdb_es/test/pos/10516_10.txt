Bridget Fonda has disappointed me several times over the years, but she had my attention at BREAK UP. It is true that the story lacks critical details in several places, but I continued to examine Fonda for clues as to the significance of the story and she did not disappoint me. The look in his eyes in the last scene, while he gathers courage to literally put one foot in front of the other towards his uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of the performance of the face. I completely believed it, possibly because I have known and admired several "hard villains" who survived similar abusive situations. And they did it without becoming enemies of men, but that is my own hopeful projection of the character of Fonda in the BREAK UP.
