Four unhappy women leave the sad London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes to life in this charming little movie that demonstrates the virtues of a literary script and an interim ensemble. All the elements come together to produce a film that, although almost forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation for the proper resolution of the story. <br /> <br /> Actresses are absolved splendidly. Ann Harding is the free-spirited wife who yearns for "wisteria and tranquility" away from the fog of London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife who wants the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess at the castle. Jane Baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman who temporarily escaped her crowd of male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals all the scenes in which she finds herself as an old woman who just wants to be alone with her memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Men in history are also well chosen. As Miss Harding's husband, Frank Morgan has a fairly complex role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen, as a spouse of Miss Alexander, is wonderfully pompous as a man well prepared to bore England (his hilarious attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bathtub becomes even more fun with the help of Charles Judels and Rafaela Ottiano as the enemy of the castle). service). Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the best forgotten actors of the decade, is blithely eccentric as the cheerful owner of the ladies. <br /> <br /> The geniuses of the film will recognize an unproven Ethel Griffies who plays the owner of the Hampstead Housewives Club.
