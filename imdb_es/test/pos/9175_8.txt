A movie for girls that kids still like ... Yes! Wonderful. Now I can have fun, enjoy the company of my girl and not feel that I can not wait until the movie ends. Lightweight, but fun Good thing. Whatever you do, do not miss the DVD extras. This is a great file of "blind dates" too. Will Smith is doing well in this, even though he is light action, he does everything right. The movie is a bit slow of pace, do not expect too much action, the laughter is there, and also the message, but the time is a bit slow. Take advantage of the low moments to whisper or kiss, he will recover. The end makes good times worthwhile. Most of them expect fun light dishes, and see the great appearance of the actors who support them, make the film. The twists of the plot are predictable, but it's a date change, so pick up the popcorn from the kitchen and do not stop it. Expect more dates after this movie; she will want to see what's next on the line. Remember Hitch's advice! <br /> <br /> enjoy.
