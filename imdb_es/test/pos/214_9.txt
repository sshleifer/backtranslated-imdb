I remember seeing the Police Brigade! when it first appeared on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many gags in sight, the non-searchers and the scripts full of puns. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, ABC canceled the program after only six episodes. I felt that I deserved a much longer career, but an executive of the network thought that the program demanded too much attention from the viewer due to all the episodes of vision in each episode. One I remember was at the opening, where the title of the episode was different from the one shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> The representation of Leslie Nielsen by Frank Drebin was expressionless, but very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, in one of his few roles since the Mission: Impossible was not as bad as Norberg, but the only character that stood out was Johnny the Footwear, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, there were cameos from Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then Dodgers manager Tommy LaSorda. <br /> <br /> Even though the Police Brigade! He had a short life on ABC, the Zucker Brothers did not abandon the concept that was even more successful in the franchise of the movie Naked Gun. I will close with a regular closing jaw. Freeze the end right here.
