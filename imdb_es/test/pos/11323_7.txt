The BBC and HBO teamed up to create "Dirty War," a 90-minute television movie about a "dirty bomb" terror attack in London. The film is set in motion quickly, as it brings together the anti-terrorist efforts of both the terrorist and the government in the film, leaving little room for secondary arguments of human interest. On the terrorist side, we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly and deployment to detonation. On the government side, we see public relations exercises and training, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation response and follow-up. The film also gives an idea of ​​how Al-Qa'ida terrorist cells, the radical Islamic terrorist mentality and terrorist strategies are organized. A kind of anatomy of a "dirty bomb", "Dirty War" incident will answer many questions that lurk in the minds of an increasingly aware public of this insidious threat. (SECOND)
