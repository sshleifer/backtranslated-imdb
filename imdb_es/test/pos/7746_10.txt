I completely fell in love with "Living in A Big Way" when I saw it for the first time! The reason # 1 is because I LOVE, I LOVE, and I am a HUGE fan of GENE KELLY. He was such a wonderful dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention his extremely handsome appearance and his sensual personality. I love your role in this movie. He was a gentleman. This movie showed his wonderful talent for acting. I also enjoyed Marie MacDonald. It was the first time I saw or knew anything about her, and this excellent movie also made me a fan of her. Actually, the whole cast of this movie was nice and great. The mood between the butler, "Everette Hanover Smythe", and the father, Mr. Morgan; The mood of Ms. Morgan's court and, especially, the immediate attachment of Grandma Morgan and her concern for "LEO GOGARTY". And the GENE number "FIDO AND ME" is adorable. The opening dance number with GENE and MARIE is also very beautiful. I would recommend that anyone watch this movie. It will truly remain dear to your heart forever. Or at least it has to be mine. And you will fall in love with GENE again. I rate him as my favorite # 2 GENE KELLY MOVIE, and I've seen and own many of his films. They are part of my daily routine! So trust me when I tell you, you will love this movie! Watch it and enjoy !!
