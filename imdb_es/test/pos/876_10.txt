I love this movie. It is the first movie Master P. has done. It is based on the story of his life. It is low budget, but it is very good. Show how Master p grew in projects in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Not only Master P started in this movie, he was also the writer and director of Moon Jones. The DVD also has the No Limit ice cream party. This movie shows how Master P is going too badly and how he had to deal with the things around him. He also has many of the list of The No Limit Records in this movie. You should buy or rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie to see if you like rap or if you are a fan of Master P. I will not spoil this movie for you. Go get this movie as fast as you can and watch it. It will like you.
