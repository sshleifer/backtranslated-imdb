When I played the first Soul Calibur on Dreamcast, I thought it was great. When I played the second one I was hooked. And finally, when Soul Calibur III was launched, I bought a playstation 2 and the game. <br /> <br /> This can really keep you awake for hours, with a lot of characters, a lot of unlockable content, and does not mention a GREAT fighting system, this is really the best fighting game to date. <br /> <br /> The strengths of the games are mainly the game against, in which two human players fight each other, either playing as one of the main characters or as a created and personalized character. The Create Character option is broad and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the fighting style "Grieve Edge" (just kicks) you have to wear those ridiculous shoes. ^^ <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the best fighting game one could wish for. Now, I just hope the planned movie is not crap.
