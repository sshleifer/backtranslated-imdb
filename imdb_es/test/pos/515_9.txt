Now here is a movie that does something that has not been done in a long time. Take ten or more different elements with which we are already familiar (vampires, martial arts, a techno rhythm, special front-line effects, etc.), and make it something that feels completely new. In what could easily have been just a combination of "Mortal Kombat" and "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer", Wesley Snipes (it's not my favorite since then and especially because of "Passenger 57") gives a really good spin to the half human / half bloodsucker He recognizes the internal conflict, but does not stop longer than necessary. It makes Blade a character as deep as Michael Keaton did Batman. <br /> <br /> I'll say that the only part of the movie that bothered me a bit was the ever-present clich√© of that person's horror movie The Hero Knows Who Knows Exactly How to Stop the Evil One. On the other hand, you have to have that in a movie like this, so it's easily excusable. <br /> <br /> Well, Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff, exaggerated in the previews, makes the hero of Snipes is bad enough as bad. He has class, presence and enough control in his little pinky to teach Al Pacino how to mitigate him a bit. Who would think that a comic book would be a launch pad for an actor? I sincerely hope this is. And whoa! Where the hell did Kris Kristofferson get talent for acting? Do not get me wrong, but the prolific actor has not done anything memorable since "Millennium", and how many of us saw that just for the great box of videos? Well, here it is, friends, in a very obi-wanish twist, as a mentor to Blade and a father figure. And good work, too. <br /> <br /> The quality of the performance corresponds to the quality of the choreography and the special effects. Accompanied by a pulsating techno rhythm, the fight scenes quickly return and eliminate the memories of Mortal Kombat. Hears! I had a script, too! I wondered what had happened to all the good writers in the world. <br /> <br /> The two main indications for me that I saw a quality film were these; I did not feel remorse for having paid the full price to enter, such as Schumacher "Batman", "The Avengers", "MK: Annihilation", "Godzilla" or "Armageddon". (Wow, how many of them came out this year? Ugh) Also, I look forward to the inevitable sequel, according to the end of the movie. We hope they do a good job with him as with the first one. <br /> <br />
