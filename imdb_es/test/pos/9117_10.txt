I was able to see a preview of this movie through the UCLA preselection program, and let me tell you: THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLY GOOD !! I have seen many movies, but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie after as much as this one. I had a decent respect for Tenacious D before watching the movie, and now I'm crazy for them. I will definitely buy your album when it is released on the 14th and I will see this movie again. <br /> <br /> If you were on the fence to see this movie, SEE MORE, GO TO SEE IT! It is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days, as you will surely laugh during the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Apart from the comedy, the glorious and divine music that flows from KG's guitar and JB's voice is inspiring. The audience is left in a stupor that those beautiful harmonies and incredible riffs can be created along with such ridiculous (and fun) lyrics. If for nothing more than the music itself, this movie is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br /> With a beautifully coherent plot that combines in almost all aspects of the traditional "D" story and hallmarks, great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some rather impressive cameos, this movie is among the top! Go see it!
