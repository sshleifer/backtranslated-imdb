Let me say: I love the horror genre to the extent that I see each of the ones I can independently understand (except for the very low quality b-movie horrors I could do without) and recently I've become a big Los fan. oriental horrors. Little did I know that a Korean horror would be the one that tops my list surpassing the heavyweights like the Japanese Ringu (or the American Ring), or even the American quality films like the Sixth Sense and The Others, and the acclaimed Hong Kong horror of Kong 'The Eye'. <br /> <br /> Previously 'The Ring' had become my favorite horror, but I think I prefer the beauty of 'The Tale of Two Sisters' any day. The story is Extraordinary and rather open to interpretation, which allows you to repeat the visualizations, although you probably want to see this again and again just because the film is masterfully recorded ... the story is probably one of the best in the genre to date. The performance is top-notch also on the part of the whole cast and the fears when they arrive have the potential to shake you up as something inside the Ring. I found myself stuck to the screen at those points, unable to take my eyes off. <br /> <br /> However, I'm glad he did not torment me later than Sadako / Samara did from the Ring; After all those feelings are unpleasant and The Tale of Two Sisters leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling, but one that, hopefully, will not leave you sleepless, but will leave you satisfied to have seen something very special. But remember ... if you do not understand the plot after the first visualization, a repetition of the visualization is more than recommended. Personally I did not have time for this since it was late, so I flipped through the scenes on the DVD, some of them Many times until I had a good synopsis in my head and after looking at the network, it seemed that I had interpreted it quite widely. And the satisfaction of solving a puzzle like that is wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same 'level' remake (purchased by Dreamworks) simply by Korean Content and is recommended to all who see it in theaters or on the DVDs as long as they can ... it's one of the best you'll get. Unfortunately, due to the type of movie that is, there is no way to talk about the story without spoilers, so it's better to do what I did. Look at it without knowing anything, except that it is 'a tale of two sisters'! And prepare for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time.
