This, which was shown dubbed in Italian at a Rome cinema (not as bad as it sounds) after performing at the Rome Film Festival, is very much an art film and a festival film, which guarantees to enchant and delighting such audiences by their distinctive style, funny humor; ability to take the comedy out of the suffering of others; attractive and cheerful music; specific actions; surpassing the sweetness and humanity, but condemned, due to its rarity and the lack of a compelling storyline, to leave the average audience wondering what it is they are seeing and why someone admires it, how it was even done. <br /> <Br /> Andersson gives us almost a series of dry parodies. Running through them there are several themes. Money: a man at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) takes his wallet from a rich speaker who speaks on a cell phone in a restaurant with a glass of brandy, then goes and orders a set of elegant made-to-order suits; an unconditional son calls his famous father away from an elaborate meeting to ask him for another loan. A shrug worries loudly about his depleted investments, while his wife rides him in bed wearing only a shiny Viking helmet. <br /> <br /> Depression: a primary school teacher (Jessica Nilsson) breaks up in class because her husband has called her "harpy;" the spouse of the carpet seller (Pär Fredriksson) collapses before the customers because he calls her that. Several men have depressing dreams. But hey, this is Sweden. Are not they all depressed? Problems of love: a bohemian fat couple is breaking perpetually; a female groupie has fantasies about a lead guitarist, Micke (Eric Bäckman). The wives bang on the doors when their husbands begin to practice their instruments. (Music is also obviously a unifying theme.) In addition to the guitarist, there is a tuba and a drummer who are in a Dixierland band and also play marches and funerals, each scene has an additional touch of music, which links to a sequence with another.) A furious storm outside the window of many scenes, violent rain, people outside, thunder so loud that it sounds like a battle on earth. This also unifies the tone and gives the impression that several scenes are happening on the same day of daunting tempest. <br /> <br /> Andersson is a master of visual composition and medium distance static shot and the film has a hazy gray. The green look designed by DP Gustav Danielsson is perfect because it evokes the gloom of a Swedish winter, but also shines with the subtle colors of the director's wit, which ends each scene with a smile. One almost never knew that the monotony could be so beautiful. (Or maybe one did: Alexcanr Sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts). Within the scenes and in the film as a whole, there is a kind of stillness that arises from the visual style, the rhythm of the scenes and the disrepute of humanism. The big picture There is something in a totally dominated style that is soothing and reassuring. <br /> <br /> Not everything works equally well. One can feel impatient with the succession of unrelated scenes, which are sometimes read too much like the work of a Saturday Night Live writer who needs Prozac. Since some scenes move you clearly or draw a laugh, it is obvious that others fall a little flat. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are real zingers, and an obviously triumphant climax of pure magic is a dream: described and then visualized dreams were another important thread) in which the groupie imagines herself with a wedding dress newly married with his ideal guitarist, who plays a delicate series of riffs while a crowd of admirers gathers in a large window. The point of view changes to the outside and the window slides slowly, as if it were the building that the newlyweds were looking at, a train that moved from a station to take them to their honeymoon. It is a cool, subtle and quite sublime effect. <br /> <br /> Finally, one can feel that everything in You the Living (Du Levande) is a dream, including the recurring scene in which the bartender always hits a brass bell and announces the last order, with what which all the shy clients get up from their tables and go up to have a drink more. <br /> <br /> An Italian critic called this "a small and great movie", and that is correct. It limits itself in a dozen ways, but there is greatness in it. Roy Andersson is a small master (like a medieval miniaturist) of the inner comedies of the Scandanavian penumbra, and this is a movie like no other. Shown this year as a Cannes selection "Un Certain Regard", this is also the Swedish entry to the Best Foreign Oscar of 2007. It is difficult to say what Bergman would think, but Andersson worked with him; It is famous for its elaborate television commercials, some of which can be seen on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best commercials in the world". It will be interesting to see if this director, whose job is as subtle as his point of view, will start working on longer segments at some point. Meanwhile, any movie buff really needs to take a look at this. <br /> <br /> "Schadenfreude" is not the right word. That means delighting in the misery of others. Andersson is teaching us to delight in the misery of all of us.
