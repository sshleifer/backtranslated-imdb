Every once in a while, you run into a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations. Given the IMDb rating of 4.0, I really did not expect much with The Brotherhood of Satan. I hoped that, at least, it could be fun like The Devil's Rain or any of the other satanic horror movies of the early 70s. I could not have been more wrong. What I got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast that I really enjoyed. Generally speaking to avoid revealing something, the style and structure of the film are much more experimental than the direct narration so prominent in the early 70s. The Brotherhood of Satan does not hit you in the head with plot points and explanations. Much is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks. As a spectator, you know that something is wrong, but during the longest period you are not sure what it is. The unknown helps to create a much more spooky environment than most similar movies. The ending is effective with its surreal images. I was amazed when the final credits began to roll. Those who want a great final slam-bang will be disappointed with the simplicity of the ending. A minor film would have tried to pull out all the stops and probably would have failed miserably. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the film in which it is easy to forget that the director, Bernard McEveety, had worked mainly on television before The Brotherhood of Satan. There are some scenes that are so well prepared, lit and shot that even the most skilled directors could learn one or two things. For example, I have seen enough movies over the years to realize that sometimes the directors seem to have problems taking panoramic screen shots indoors. Not here. The scene in which the men are discussing their action plan in the sheriff's office is incredible. Do we see the five men at the same time? Everyone doing their thing like in real life. In a minor film, we could see all the men at once, but each one would be immobile, calmly waiting for their turn to pronounce their dialogue. It's a small scene, but it looks so natural and so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments from The Brotherhood of Satan. <br /> <br /> Finally, I mentioned the performance at my opening, so without going into a long speech, I will say that The Brotherhood of Satan presents Strother Martin and LQ Jones. Any movie with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me.
