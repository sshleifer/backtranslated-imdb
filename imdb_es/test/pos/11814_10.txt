When the movie "The Cure" begins, we learn of a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenager who lives with his paranoid mother, and who lives next to him is a boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day, Erik and Dexter connect and go to the supermarket, where Dexter has his first Butterfinger experience. When Erik finds out that Dexter has AIDS, he tries leaf tea and water to improve it. But when the cover of The National Enquirer says that a New Orleans doctor has found the cure for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to get to New Orleans in search of the cure. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Cure" is easily one of the best friendship films ever made. Shows unconditional love between a boy, his (best) best friend and the mother of his best friend. Everything is so well done, nothing needs to be changed. Not only do I give it 10/10 for being a fantastic friendship movie, it's also a sad, fun, and fun movie. And the tragic ending with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me shed a tear. Very well done.
