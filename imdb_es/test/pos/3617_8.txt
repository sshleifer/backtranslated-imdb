I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and fear. The best-selling novel by Louis de Berniere is one of my favorites and anyone who has read it will realize that there is no way in hell that a screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. <br /> <br /> Throughout the process I found myself convinced that the film had not been successful, and had eliminated the plot of the book to the point of making it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Even so, the advantages (the magnificent photography of John Toll, the great score by Stephen Warbeck, etc.) that I felt did not surpass my initial negatives (the misuse of Cage, a very diluted script). <br /> <br /> But, two days later, I was queuing up again to see Corelli, and although it's not perfect, I must admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is really brilliant in a role that even Berniere was not a completely rounded character: his carefree spirit that gives way to a shattered remorse is perfect, and complements the magnificent double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt to perfection. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer who tries to reconcile his feelings for his new Italian friends and his complex of innate superiority to those around him. And the excellent cast of Greco-Italian support brought the bathed world of Cepholonia de Berniere dazzlingly alive. <br /> <br /> After leaving the cinema for the second time, I finally put aside my passion for the novel that prevented me from fully appreciating the story of the cepholonia of the Second World War in cinematographic terms. I take my hat off to John Madden, who, despite the almost critical criticism he is receiving from British critics (any director who has had great success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these novice moans!), has managed to transfer a terribly difficult book to the big screen with such heart, enthusiasm and humanity (the fundamental virtues of the novel, in fact) that has created another classic love story that will probably only be appreciated when the Dust has settled a few years from now. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the book, like me, it is difficult, but try not to make the same mistake in your initial view. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bathe in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr. Iannis, as if it were the first time (simulate you are seeing something done with an original script), and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, you'll be eagerly waiting to have your own copy of this lovely movie on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> 8/10
