"Saratoga Trunk" is a 1945 film starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It is based on a 1941 book written by the great Edna Ferber. Subconsciously, she could have left with the wind in her brain; Parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. <br /> <br /> Set in the 1890s, Clio Dulaine is an illegitimate child who returns from New Orleans from France with a mulatto maid (Flora Robson) and a dwarf maid, Cupidon (Jerry Austin). She has been given a Countess title and claims to be a widow. Her mother killed her father by accident, and her family rejected her. Clio takes over the old farm with the idea of ​​embarrassing his step-sister and his father's wife, which is getting a lot of attention. His plan is to marry someone very rich who can give him the security and respectability he craves. Then he sees Clint Maroon (Cooper), a Texas player, and falls in love with him. The two have an unstable relationship, and he has no money, so she can not marry him, so he goes to Saratoga Springs. Finally, the Dulaine family has enough, and his lawyer gives him $ 10,000 to leave the city. She does. She goes to Saratoga Springs and chases the railroad owner, Bart von Steed. But Clint is always close. <br /> <br /> Bergman is beautiful in dark hair and wears period costumes, and Cooper is absolutely beautiful with her incredible 300 watt smile. How she could resist him is beyond me. And the scenes of love - wow, what chemistry! The cast is excellent, Robson and Cupidon create interesting characters, and Florence Bates offers an excellent performance as a socially prominent woman who takes Clio under her wing, knowing that it is a great fake. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a little time, and some of the performances may seem outdated today, but it's an absorbing story full of vivid atmosphere and performances. The end will not be any surprise. Although it is a fun trip.
