These three directors are going to good beginnings. The three stories are very well made for independent productions and capture those traumatic feelings of "leaving" when you're not really sure it's a good idea. I laughed at those veiled looks around the dressing room in "Pool Days"; I smiled at the idea that fans of Bette Midler, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand are supposed to be homosexuals in "A Friend of Dorothy" (that is, they search the shelves of CD music); and I cringed at the "jock" in "The Disco Years", whose memory of the sweet sex was now "blurry" by the liquor. Everything seemed so real. I hope more offers from this trio of directors.
