This movie is hard to hit. It follows the tradition of Pulp Fiction, but continues to succeed in sealing its own unique style. The cast is impressive, the script is excellent, and things like the strange time sequencing (Pulp Fiction-esque) are done brilliantly. In particular, I like how the images provided in flash back vary dramatically according to who tells the story at that moment. When he is one of the indoctrinated criminals, everything is flashy and great, but when it comes to the memory of the hero, everything is horrible and disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing movie, so I am extremely annoyed to find out that I can not buy it anywhere!
