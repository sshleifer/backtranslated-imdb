The best of all. What is the best of everything? It's different for everyone, but for most of us it's love. But, unfortunately, not everyone knows where or who to turn to in search of true love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes, "we are the captains of our own boats," and that's how it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. Once we make those decisions, then we must live with them. We ask ourselves, as we observe this story and we see that these women make decisions that will probably change their lives forever, would we be the same options as these or would we be wiser? Who knows?
