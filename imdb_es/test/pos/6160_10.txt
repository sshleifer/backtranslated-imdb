Nothing less than magnificent photography / cinematography in this film. The fact that you keep searching and waiting for more flight sequences, tells you that they have enough. The acting is fantastic, the stories are woven to perfection and the dogs are splendid ............. <br /> <br /> It must be rented, see or see. <Br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of the subtitles ........ <br /> <br /> it's worth a little aversion therapy <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br />
