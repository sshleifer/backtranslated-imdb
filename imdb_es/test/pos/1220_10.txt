Nice movie, a good movie, I had never heard of this movie, but I found it while looking for something to rent. I had high hopes in this movie based solely on Flex being in this movie. I have never seen it in anything that is not worth it. Faithful to form this film delivered by me. I enjoyed the story. The movie is full of great actors and actresses. The hilarious Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and, of course, Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie. I did not give him five stars because he did not discuss certain issues that I thought the film should have detailed. The problem was apparently solved, but I would have liked a discussion that solved the problems. I liked the movie so much that now I buy it after I've already rented and seen it.
