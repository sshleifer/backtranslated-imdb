This film definitely shows something and sheds light on what happens in most institutions today, and shows how a gurl alone with the help of his newspaper manages to do things, his editor has total faith in it and does not publish anything important, because it would harm her friend ... and when the right time came, she took the necessary measures. <br /> <br /> The film in general got a rating of 9 on my part, because it has everything, I mean it keeps you entertained, and also, they have acted really well, for a television movie, their performance of very High quality deserves a lot of credit.
