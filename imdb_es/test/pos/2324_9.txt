I just discovered this movie and I love it. The perfect combination of fast-moving history, entertaining characters, fun moments (but not overloaded with stupid jokes) and fun performances by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Torn and more. Buckman is especially good, and I really enjoyed watching the guy who played Stapanick. <br /> <br /> I also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, the Pampanito, to run in the best scenes and emulate it almost exactly by their sets. The decoration of the stage is really impressive if you take a digital tour of the Pampanito online and then compare it with the scenes of the movie. They did an excellent job in this movie. <br /> <br /> What an entertaining and truly fun movie!
