K-Pax is a very intriguing movie. Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really an extraterrestrial, or is he a mentally deranged human who only thinks he is an alien? That's the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self-proclaimed deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth. <br /> <br /> As the film develops and more evidence is discovered, both theories grow. credibility. His ability to map from memory the area of ​​the galaxy where his natal planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possess. However, hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, full of devastating events that could have caused such an aberration of personality. The ending seems to give the answer, but it is ambiguous enough for you to ask yourself if you really know. Normally, I do not like the lady or tiger finals, but this one is tempting. I have my own theory that fits all the clues, but I do not know that my theory is more correct than anyone else's. <br /> <br /> Director Iain Softley ("Wings of the Dove") spins the story delicately, with great skill. This is a rare example that the director stays in the shade and induces outstanding performances of talented actors for history to dominate. This does not mean that the address is technically inferior, because it is excellent. However, Softley remains discreet and offers great power through the use of subtlety, a welcome change from today's avant-garde directors who visually catch and shake the viewer as if to shout: "Look how bright I am!" <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey once again offers a wonderful performance as Prot. This is a part that is extraordinarily demanding, requiring Spacey to generate the cool and logical Prot in a minute, and then change gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next. Spacey is as credible as alien and human, which makes the spectator's task much more difficult. Jeff Bridges is also great as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot. <br /> <br /> This is an inspirational narrative for the attentive viewer. I rated it with a 9/10. If it must be closed at the end of a movie, this movie will be very frustrating. However, if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits, you will not be disappointed.
