Believe me, I wanted this series to work, but the early departure of Kevin Kilner gave a near-fatal blow after the first season. Robert Leeshock was not right for the role and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as a leader, but the series became too complicated and confusing at the time. I do not know what happened in the fifth season, what a disaster. Sometimes it's time to drop the red cape and just put the sword in the bull, if you know what I mean. The only consistent thread that kept the series together was the incredible performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in an ideal silent conflict. If it were not for his talents and well-written dialogue, they would have been two bald, bald-headed strangers in a series of B movies. <br /> <br /> If only this series could have ended in season 4 and picked it up more late for SyFy ...
