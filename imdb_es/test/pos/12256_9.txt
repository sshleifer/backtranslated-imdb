... there was "Broadcast News", and how good it was. He simply stands up and blows his barbaric buzzing in a way that resonates two decades later. <br /> <br /> There are times, especially with regard to the shabby score, when this movie becomes a little too eighty. , or a little too much "Insomnia in Seattle." Fortunately, they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> A third of the social satire, a third of the romantic comedy, a third of the drama, with three defective but endearing people in its core, is intelligent and moving and almost impossibly funny. Holly Hunter, in particular, may never have been more fun to see in a comedic role. (And yes, in this evaluation I'm including "Raising Arizona," its another stellar spin of that era.) <br /> <br /> A legitimate classic.
