The other reviewers are very far from why the Farscape program has been put (temporarily) at rest. It has NOTHING to do with the quality of the shows that "loosen up". In fact, the exact OPPOSITE is true. They kept improving and improving! :) I've seen all the episodes and when you just look at them to really amaze them how great it gets as they go, and the Wormhole & Aeryn subplots are really very interesting and they gave it MORE vibes, not less. Before it was somewhat chaotic, slow and quite aimless. They happened like the first two seasons of this type of enemy, but in the next two they tried to DO something :) Also, I've never seen such a fun mix of sexy girls and attitudes in science fiction. The blue girl, Zahn, was great, but not "sexy". Literally, they got to the point where the girls ran around with leather corsets and high heels launching extraterrestrials. Now, tell me, what could be cooler than that? :)) <br /> <br /> The real reason why Farscape went off a bit is because it cost too much, and that's a GOOD thing for the fans, because the show, seen from end to end, is really like an epic film lasting 60 hours, with all the cinematics of the blockbuster theme (ok, they use many similar sets, but the CG is great and the girls are sexxxy). <br /> <br /> Blah blah - the The real reason is because television shows have to do with profit. It's a BUSINESS, and the Science Fiction channel or whoever was not getting as great a performance in this expensive Farscape program as they could do with garbage programs like 'Stargate'. Lexx was really great until they got rid of the hot German girl and replaced her with this weird thick-skinned rarity. <br /> <br /> Anyway, yes, remember this: Farscape kept improving, until it really was like that. A small real movie every week. Then, the networks decided that people would see any old Drek piece that we put on the air as long as it's the only science fiction thing at that time, so why are we spending all this money on Farscape? reduce the budget of 'Stargate' to people and call it 'successful series' because it's like we all play every night of shit LOL :)) <br /> <br /> This is how it works. I must also tell you that Claudia Black is a really great actress. After she got her cosmetic surgery (she squeezed her baggy eyes), she looked really cool, one of those dynamic guys like Judy Davis, and sometimes sexy looking, sometimes ugly, like a roller coaster. I combined Claudia Black with Lucy Lawless in style and substance, both very VERY fun to watch, not just Chrichton :) And yes, you can say that the pregnancy was corny, but how many science fiction programs have a secondary plot of CREYABLE and DEEP that Does it actually go somewhere and progress? It was legitimately great as a romantic story: the actors in the show are great. It's really a shame that the program is in limbo for now, but I hope it will reappear in more episodes soon and in movies, because I will definitely buy them! :-RE
