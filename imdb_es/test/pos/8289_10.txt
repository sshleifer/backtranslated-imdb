To this day, there is not a movie I've seen more times than The Chipmunk Adventure, and no movie has brought me more happiness. This is by no means the best movie, not even the best animated film, but for an 8-year-old girl in 1988, it was the coolest, funniest and most exciting movie in history! I'm still just as impressed today with the musical numbers, each one a highlight song with marvelously dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80s pop (think of Pat Benetar in helium, only more catchy). <br /> <br /> Controversy has stirred up the brazenly suggestive tone of the Chipette song "Gettin 'Lucky With You", which to me seemed far more innocent at the time. However, looking at him as a rational adult, I can fully understand the concern; you have three young people in harem outfits who passionately proclaim "having luck is what it is about". The Chipettes were definitely sexualized ten times for this movie. <br /> <br /> But this controversial issue does not even come close to overshadowing the Chipmunks' animated feature-length adventure, so I encourage parents and adults without children to check out this movie. Especially if you were a child of the eighties / early nineties like me. :-)
