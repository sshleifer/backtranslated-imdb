In England we often feel very attached to British films that we like, since we are accustomed to the usual American scenarios and accents. Being from London, where Virtual Sexuality is established, I felt a strong emotional bond with her. The characters of Virtual Sexuality, particularly women, are exactly what British teenagers are, I felt that I was almost in the movie. Immediately I interacted with Alex's character from the movie, his shyness is quite common in most British teenagers, especially around girls. The virtual sexuality made me feel really good, since it is one of the only British films that is not about gangsters or the upper-middle class, but about the people who are watching the movie, average teenagers. Americans would not really feel emotional attachment, but every British teenager should see it. Anyone in London will recognize the parts of the city in the movie, it definitely has a special place in my video box!
