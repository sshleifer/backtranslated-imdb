Call it manipulative nonsense if you want, but I fell in love with that. Sure, there could have been more character development. Yes, there could have been a better cinematography and a constant "film of the week" score, but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuba Gooding adorable and touching, and let's face it, in real life, how many of us really arrived. Know the motivation of others. Not many We could glimpse a little the motivation of the coach (a very provocative dialogue in my opinion, which should not be forgotten soon), so, in my opinion, this was a beautiful tribute to a human being who left his "comfort zone" to reach another human being, and meanwhile, touched lives hundreds of times more. A lesson that we all need to be reminded of. Why is it so difficult to do what is right to do? I recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart. You will not be disappointed. And bring your Kleenex. 8/10
