Penelope Spheeris (of the fame of "The World of Wayne") left her mark with the documentary "The Decline of Western Civilization", on the punk scene of Los Angeles in the late 70's and early 80's. documentaries include interviews with punks and images of concerts (which often become violent). In general, we can see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: while the hippies became natural, the punks wanted to be as altered as possible, with the hair on tip and all. But also, we see how they are really unhappy and, sometimes, they become skinheads. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a great time capsule. We are not really sure if we want to yearn for that era or feel rejected by it. But this is definitely not a documentary that leaves you neutral. It's really worth seeing.
