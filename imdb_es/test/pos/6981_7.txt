The terror / science fiction reasonably effective to the "Alien" is quite good, given its limited ambitions. Some nice special effects and good-paced action sequences properly patch the cracks in a pretty boring dialogue. When a spacecraft crashes on a remote planet, the survivors soon realize that a dreadful terror awaits them in the darkness of the next total eclipse.
