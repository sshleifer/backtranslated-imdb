At the beginning of this film, which I found myself observing IFC late at night, I had a sense of claustrophobia and malaise. The feeling of being stuck with no way to escape was so powerful that I did not know if I wanted to keep looking ... although I did not really think I had many options, because of how convincing the situation was. . <br /> <br /> However, little by little, that feeling of discomfort decreased (although it never completely disappeared), and I was attracted to the problems of Tessa and Bobby, and really hoping against the hope that they could return to be together <br /> <br /> Really just a poignant and powerful story fits perfectly in a small package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until I examined her curiosity, so now I love it even more. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it. ... If you're lucky enough to catch it on the Independent Film Channel at some point, or cunning enough to discover another way of looking at it.
