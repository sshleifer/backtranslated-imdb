Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Filmed in the California desert <br /> <br /> with his fake patent documentary style, Watkins creates a movie like no other. Follow two groups of prisoners (one <br /> <br /> previously convicted and the other post sentenced) throughout the image. After <br /> <br /> have been tried by a military court, they have the option to <br /> <br /> serve a prison sentence or they can participate in the punishment <br /> <br / > Park (an exhausting three-day trek through the desert with nothing more than clothes <br /> <br /> on its back) while being chased by local law <br /> <br /> law enforcement officers who use the park as a live action training <br /> <br /> ground). I can not say enough about this movie. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a real documentary. This is one of the most accessible films by Peter Watkins. I advise you to take care of it. You will not regret! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
