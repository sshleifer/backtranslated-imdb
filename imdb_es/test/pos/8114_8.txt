I loved that the atmosphere was bright and airy. I loved that the main character wanted guarantees about his future, and that his roommate put it "straight" for all people. I loved the fact that they addressed the dynamics of how the members of the group of men treated each other, considering that this was led by a lesbian, the whole subject of masculinity was exposed, ridiculed, dissected and questioned. What makes a man? What makes one heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual? You're not really sure if our main character has decided who he really wants; Live the moment and throw caution to the wind. These, and other reasons, make me love this movie.
