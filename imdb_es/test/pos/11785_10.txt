So fun is the perfect way to describe this 12-minute parody of the original Star Wars. Hardware Wars is incredibly fun. It is presented as the trailer for the epic space Hardware Wars. The joke is this: imagine Star Wars played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. The characters include the "intergalactic wonder boy" Fluke Starbucker, the "mercenary and intergalactic ass" Ham Salad, Darph Nader, "villain" and many other fantastic characters. It is impossible not to laugh while you watch this treasure of 12 minutes. It's stupid but it's fun. You will laugh from beginning to end, and you will feel the need to see it again, again, again, again ... And you will laugh every time you see it! <br /> <br /> 10 of 10. The 12 funniest minutes ever made. You'll believe it lasted a minute!
