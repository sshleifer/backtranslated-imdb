Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep and intense Hamlet ever made, no other version is approaching. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors who have interpreted it. Claudius, by Patrick Stewart, is fierce and still friendly. I especially like the two nonsense that plays Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very irresponsible and yet sinister. Some may complain about the need for a strong Ophelia: she is not a strong person, that is the point, and Lalla Ward has the right nuances. Amazing. Simply amazing: each of the more than two dozen times I've seen it.
