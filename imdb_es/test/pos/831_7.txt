This is the best direct DVD effort of Van Damme I've seen so far. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent trying to stop the heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is excellent and the fight scenes are ranked among the best of Van Damme. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For more evidence, check out "Indisputable 2". Adkins is so good in fact that before watching "The Shepherd", I thought that Van Damme might not seem very credible when he defeated him on the screen. However, Van Damme holds up and, although he is not as athletic as Adkins, he can still kick with the best. All the fight scenes in this movie are very well done and the weapon battles are above average for this type of movie as well. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a bit underdeveloped. I think the Van Damme character's motives should have been presented earlier in the film, especially as to why he's wearing a rabbit. The reason why he does it is very good, but you do not discover it until the end. There are a couple of other things that are never really explained well, but this is a Van Damme movie, so you know where the priority is in making this kind of movie and it's not the development of the character. However, in general, this is a solid action movie that I recommend. So run to the border of Damme!
