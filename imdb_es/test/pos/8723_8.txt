As much as I like Walter Matthau, I felt that most of his roles adapted to his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is charming and dishonest. This role requires much more action than in most of your other roles. I liked the fact that the film was honest about how a professional can be dishonest to avoid compromise in a relationship. His main goal was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not be compromised in any way. The alibi - using his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend to be his wife. At some point in the movie, the intended Mr. and Mrs. are actually deceived into believing that they really were really married. The end was good, because a middle-aged man found it worth more to look for someone in his own age group. The film was fun, entertaining and did not exhaust itself when preached.
