Impressive at its best, intriguing at its worst, the innovative epic film 'Apocalypse Now' by Francis Ford Coppala is one of the most iconic and famous films of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest cinematographic representation in history of the United States in Vietnam. . <br /> <br /> What I like best about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is exceptionally different from any other movie of the same genre. Growing up as a movie buff, and with a particular interest in war movies, I have seen many films that have tried to portray the "images" and "feelings" of Vietnam, but have not succeeded in doing so. Films like 'Hamburger Hill' and 'We were soldiers' fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by depicting 'heroic battles' that are often tainted by the zeal of Hollywood film production. <Br /> <br /> In 'Apocalypse Now' there are no battles, no heroes or villains, there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is meant to reflect the images of Vietnam through the physical aspects of the war. Rather, it is a film that powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute "horror" of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century. <br /> <br /> The absolute brightness of the performance (in particular, the interpretation of the taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen), together with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Philippines), which provides crucial realism at the back of the film , makes 'Apocalypse Now' an unforgettable epic. <br /> <br /> Evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a vortex of mediation, 'Apocalypse now' is not for the movie buff. It is a masterpiece that requires multiple visualizations to be fully appreciated.
