I was very impressed with Nurse Betty all the time. It has a great set of characters, an original plot and an ending that I should have seen coming but I did not and that pulls the strings of the heart. <br /> <br /> If there's something in this movie that helped me understand it. the majority was the interaction of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. These two are great and my heart warms up when I see that Rock is not going to make a horrible Big Hollywood meal like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, there really should not be any need to criticize his work anymore. Hell, Kiss the Girls could be seen with him in him. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellwegger does the best she can with her role, and Kinnear is as good as her obession. <br /> <br /> Sweet movie with A nice touch of gratuitous violence on it to satisfy the blood thirst of man. 9 outa 10 <br /> <br />
