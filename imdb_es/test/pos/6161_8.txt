This is such a beautiful movie! It not only portrays the war, it also has friendship and love. Slama's life is full of sadness, all aspects of her life collapsed. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend made the ultimate sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I see a slight similarity to 'Pearl Harbor', which is also about two pilots who fell in love with the same woman. However, this film is much better made, because it does not describe the woman as unfaithful and easy to carry. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing and highly developed. I definitely recommend this movie to all people.
