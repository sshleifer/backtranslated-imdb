My sister, my father and I are really interested in D & D and one night we were browsing Netflix looking for a movie to see when it came up. We thought we would try and ended up almost dying of laughter. The writing and acting in this movie is so amazing! The ingenious characters, the great interaction and the fun moments kept us together all the time. I love this movie! It may not make much sense to those who do not know about Dungeons & Dragons, but nevertheless, it's a good movie. This only shows that movies do not need an astronomical budget and renowned actors / actresses to be a success. Take a look if you want a good and clean comedy.
