It must be so difficult to tell a story that does not happen much, but still attracts the attention of the audience. I think this short film achieves this with effortless quality. Rutger has an amazing voice that is very soft, wise and fatherly (I'm not gay) that recalls the qualities that Robert Redford has to narrate. The end is very sad, but beautiful. One wonders how long Harry has gone, will he feel alone and be able to say goodbye? You also get angry with Mr. Hauer for not getting involved in more jobs of this caliber. Let's hope he continues to do a good job in Holland and stays away from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing
