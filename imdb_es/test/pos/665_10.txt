It's the 1980s and teenagers are ready to have fun in an old scary house that is rumored to be obsessed with the ghost of Murder McGee. After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on a Ouija board, the children are forced to fight to the death by fighting a vengeful ghost that possesses and kills all their friends one by one. Sounds familiar? It is supposed to be It is clearly marketed to pay tribute to the classics of the 80s with the slogan: "Excessive violence, free nudity, zero budget". <br /> <br /> I can not get enough; It's pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way he made fun of all the horror clich√©s, but at the same time I embraced the fun of the films of this era. However, there is something you get with this movie that you never got with the old movies of the 80s: good acting. The entire cast was very talented and you do not see much in any low budget movie, recent or not. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I was very entertained throughout the film, and I am completely convinced that the writer / director and the cast will go a long way in their separate careers. The script was very well written and the dialogue flowed naturally. <br /> <br /> The effects were a bit amateurish and the scenes were not well lit, but the fact that this movie admits on its cover was virtually budgetless. I already know that this is going to happen. This movie makes it simple to politely ignore their faults and just sit back and enjoy. Although this is not an Oscar-winning work, it never pretends to be, and supports it. It is fun. If you like slashers, you will really appreciate this movie. If you like blood and pikemen, you will appreciate it too.
