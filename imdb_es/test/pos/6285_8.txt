When I saw for the first time that this film was going to be seen on television, it was only new from pauly shore like this joke by a comedian who wore very strange outfits in his time. I still decided to see it and it impressed me. The shore brings a fresh air to the screen. In this movie, play a college counselor who probably also needs his own counselor. Carla Gugino, in an underestimated role, plays Becca, a "midwestern farmer" with a simple family and a boyfriend from the movie clich√©. When she goes to UCLA, she meets him and he quickly turns her into a bubbly, blond Californian girl. She decides to take home to crawl for the break of thanksgiving. When Travis decides to propose, Becca needs a distraction. crawl decides to make everyone believe that he and Becca are already engaged. This leads to crawling to encourage the romance between Becca's parents, to make friends with her brother and even to make the dancers in the local bar relax a bit. I will not reveal the ending, but I liked it. Anyway, do not rent it if you want a touching performance; Rent it if you want to laugh and enjoy a part of the 90's humor that is often lost.
