I saw this movie more than 5 years ago and the subject still infuriates me, as it should. His anger and initiative were inspiring. Not that I would take over an army and kill people, but the scene in the well and in the strong domain of the rebels will never leave my mind. This is a great movie, but be prepared for the strong theme.
