This is a well-made action movie. There are many fight scenes, the performance is convincing (for this genre) and RS1 is amazing. I do not know why people feel obliged to discard RS1, I thought that its effects were executed very well and its design looked great. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I must tell you that Richard Sun is one of the worst Hong Kong actors I have ever seen. At least RS1 had the right idea to kill him. Now, for all of you who thought that Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actor ... I was not meant to be taken seriously! I just had the pleasure of seeing Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same character in the same way! <br /> <br /> Now, please, all of you who watch the winners of the highly qualified Oscars: DO NOT JUDGE THIS IS A THOUGHT MOVIE! IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO REQUIRE THOUGHT! Just to be enjoyed, that's all. I hope they do another one soon.
