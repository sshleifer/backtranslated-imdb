If you enjoy a little Pink Floyd music, you will love this movie. The score is completely pink Floyd and, of course, the element of the drug plays an important role in this film, which gives him doubts about life in the weakest moments. This movie also touches the heart with the story about love and the people around you ... there is also a great connection with the world that surrounds you with the surroundings of a personal island. This tells me that I need ten lines to summarize a movie, but I'm finished, that's all you get. That's why this movie is a 6.1, which is a great dislike for any movie with a score like this. Take a look at Requiem for a dream and the source. Scores equally good for our generation, but overestimated.
