It's less visceral than the only other Tsai movie I've seen ("Live L'amour"), but the idea of ​​doors (holes) to the emotions and the existences of others is vividly represented here, as Tsai establishes a great possibility after another. , usually with long shots, suggesting a sense of alienation in Taipei. The musical interludes, inspired by Grace Chang, are disconcerting, but mile markers that add new dimensions to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man above and below are welcome. It's not necessarily an easy movie to watch (although it's not too hard), so I warn casual viewers looking for "indie" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you want to know something about the isolation between the inhabitants of the cities of Taiwan and something more universal about the alienation of the city and the romantic yearning, watch this movie immediately.
