Absolutely one of the 10 best music movies ever! A totally essential educational experience for any music fan: especially the young rock / punk fans of today ... understanding the beginnings of any particular "artistic" movement requires absolutely understanding the roots of music, as well as the mentality and the musical environment of music. times ... without mentioning the political and social factors involved at the time. And, besides all that, this documentary is completely rock-n-roll F U N !! Do not miss it!!! That said, can anyone tell me when, if ever, "the decline of Western civilization" ... part 1, (not part 2, the metal version) will be available again ... I wait on DVD?
