In 2023, in a world governed by the economic interests of large corporations (and not by the will or politicians of the people), Kam (Bobbie Phillips) is a human hybrid and agent of the IBI (International Bureau of Investigation). It is called `sub '(subhuman), and its genetic composition is 80% human and 20% animal. She has a combination of cougar genes, which gives her strength and flexibility; hawk, which gave him a greater ability to see and hear; And chameleon, which gives him the power of camouflage. In the first film, she was a very seductive and amoral woman, who used sex to get information. I have not seen the second yet, but in this third, the story is full of action. A group of scientists has been developing a new and dangerous form of power generation for fifteen years. The investigation has not yet concluded, when one of them betrays the other and steals the investigation. The problem is that, due to its molecular instability, a black hole will be created and it will suck the entire planet. Kam saves Dr. Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann), the survival of the team of scientists, and tries to recover the dangerous invention from the hands of the "bad guys". There is a very strong 'sub' in this gang that causes many difficulties for Kam. This action film and science fiction is better than the first, remembering "The Terminator" in some parts of the plot. Bobbie Phillips is a very beautiful actress, and her outfit is very good. I am becoming a fan of this good entertainment. Fans of science fiction movies will not be disappointed. Now I am trying to buy `Chameleon 2 '. My vote is seven.
