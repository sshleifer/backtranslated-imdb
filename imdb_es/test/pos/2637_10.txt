This movie was very funny. People who expected to see a comedy worthy of an Oscar, should surpass themselves. This was a fun movie to watch with interesting and fun characters, story lines, dialogue quotes and catch phrases. I qualify a movie with a 10 if I bought the DVD or, in this case, the videotape, and I have seen it many times, and in this case, they still laugh out loud. I have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half have nothing to do with the Oscars. Once again, this was just a fun and cheerful movie. I hope this comes out on DVD. I suggest you review this movie, if you're in the mood for a crazy comedy.
