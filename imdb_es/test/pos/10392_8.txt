I was surprised by this movie. I've been renting Antonioni's films / rediscovering them, and this movie showed me the climax and the fruits of their 50 years of direction. What an eye for adjustment, color and detail! I had never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before. I had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. Yes, beauty moves me, as it moved Keats to write Oda in a Greek urn. This film is made for the mature public, emotionally and intellectually. Those who expect to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed. I will have to watch this movie several times before I can truly appreciate and judge it. This film must be seen by all the directors of photography and directors. <br /> <br /> It may be a really great movie, from the order of Kurosawa's dreams.
