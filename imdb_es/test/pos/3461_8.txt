I was surprised and touched by this emotional film that moved me a lot. I was confused, sad and happy at the same moment. I guess very few people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get some of it. The story of two friends, linked by their physical disabilities, who (as a team) overcome the medical welfare system and fight for their rights. This film shows a side that some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotionally presented. We hope that this film will help us better understand some of your wishes and that you realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you can hardly express that fact.
