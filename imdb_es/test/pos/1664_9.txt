I have wanted to see this since my French teacher recommended it to me over forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the restoration of the Criterion Collection DVD is impressive. <br /> <br /> In his scheme, this film follows the script of the past: a quartet of men diligently plans a difficult robbery of a bank vault, the robbery takes place, a seemingly insignificant little event leads to the definitive disappearance of all. Although the images of the robbery are transfixed, they occur quite early and ultimately are not the core of the film. This film is separated from the typical movie of theft by giving us an idea of ​​the personalities of the characters and their motivations: it is both a drama and a thriller. Relationships play an important role and a kidnapping is added, which gives us two movies for the price of one. <br /> <br /> John Servais interprets the idea of ​​the man Tony le Stéphanois (always called "le Stéphanois") with such fatigue of the world that could have come out of a novel by Camus. Tony recently left prison recently and is reluctant to return to the crime scene until he has a very unpleasant interaction with his former lover (who has taken care of another man) where, as punishment, he physically flogs her with a belt. . Fortunately, that scene occurs outside the camera, but you are not likely to forget it. After that sobering event, since there seems to be little hope of reviving that relationship, Tony encounters two of his former partners in crime, Jo and Mario, and decides to join them in one last big hit. They recruit the services of César, an Italian security cookie, played by the director Dassin himself, and we go to the robbery. <br /> <br /> The robbery occurs without problems. But Caesar's feminine inclination is a personality trait that is fatal to everyone involved. However, we can understand his attraction for the nightclub singer that he has fallen in love with, since there is a brilliant piece in which he plays an attractive nightclub inspired by night cinema: it has to be one of the most memorable scenes of any black movie. <br /> <br /> It was established from the beginning that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family; in fact, Jo's son refers to him as an uncle. I think, in part, to help Jo's family, Tony accepts the theft. The final scenes, where Tony saves the life of Jo's kidnapped son, partially redeems his most brutal and amoral actions. But only partially.
