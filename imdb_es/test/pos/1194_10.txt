Absolutely incredible! The humor, the amazing music and a message against the war make this probably the best movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love how smart this film is, especially in the Vietnam part of the plot. It's interesting how they make the army officers who make the project look ridiculous. Follow that with the serious situation of real war, and then the conclusion (which leaves me furious about the war); And yet, there is absolutely no violence on the screen. Wow <br /> <br /> Also, the music is really great. But what is unique in this musical (unlike Evita, or Wizard of Oz, for example) is that the lyrics do not tell the story. The mood does it (along with the visual elements and dialogue between songs): "Donna" is an optimistic song that emphasizes the happy mood, while "Flesh Failures" has an intense driving rhythm, in a minor key. <br /> <br /> Also, I realize that the LSD scene is not very flattering. Now I definitely will not use drugs (it's not what I ever intended to do). <br /> <br /> Considering all things, this is an incredible movie. The only negative comment I can say is that sometimes it is difficult to listen to the dialogue. But who cares? 10/10 stars!
