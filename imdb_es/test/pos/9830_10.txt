Random Hearts is a very well directed actor, with a script and perfectly distributed for the main roles. I discovered that it was so intense, that you have to stop and ask yourself in almost all the scenes that Harrison and Kristin are together, how their characters face this horrible situation in which they find themselves. They act with a lot of talent from both. Many people that I think did not appreciate the film for what it was, did not understand the point of the film or even understand a situation like theirs. <br /> <br /> (skip this part if you have not seen the movie yet) <br /> <br /> I loved the ending, which was a big surprise that tied the whole movie. It was a relief to see how these two good people can really come out happier in the end. <br /> <br />
