Crossfire (1947) <br /> <br /> Great Message, Great Symbolism, Very Good Movie <br /> <br /> It's hard to be totally wrong with Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan all together as the three male protagonists, and with director Edward Dmytryk putting together a complicated murder and a string of detectives. That is reason enough to see it once and even twice. <br /> <br /> You may need a second look to fully capture the plot as explained (too much) or shown in flashback (too much too) because it is a bit complicated without a good reason. But it makes sense in general, and we see from very early (probably very soon) who is to blame, and even why. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama, well done in the typical lighting of the noir and full of those little comments that make dramatic post-war films, is the social message, the anti-anti-Semitic point of all this. Limit just to preach once or twice, and it is such an obviously good point to make us see how it is done with approval and wait for the plot and the dramatic performance to take the first row. What they do, especially Young, who is a brilliantly laconic and patient detective, and Ryan, who is evil in an incredibly raw and angry way (Ryan is good at that, his typography reasonable). Mitchum, for the most part, plays a diluted version of what is famous, and the fourth known acting force, Gloria Grahame, is a large and brief presence, albeit a little expendable. <br /> <br /> Although the film is dominated by the sequence of events and the message, which grow strongly as we go, it is really easy to see only for lighting, camera work and acting, including the classic fight scene that opens the first seconds of the event. Film, all done with shadows. <br /> <br /> The archetypes of soldiers presented are very deliberate, and this could be something that people at that time were very familiar with and could relate so much to the thread of anti-Semitism. The soldier in shock was helpless (but still with intrinsic capacity), the young modest without confidence (but he is also capable), and the tired but seemingly capable veteran is there. And, of course, the angry and violent soldier who is also the product of war. The latter is also the responsibility of society, even the army does everything possible to solve the injustices here, not only because they are criminals, but because they come from the wear and tear of a terrible and long war. <br /> <br /> The audience then, more than now, could really get it, but it is still there to appreciate it.
