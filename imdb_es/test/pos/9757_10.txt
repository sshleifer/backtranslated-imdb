I do not know where this movie was filmed, but as it was filmed in the place, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. It is the story of an English girl who was taken prisoner by the Japanese in South Asia at the beginning of the Second World War, with a group of other English women. There is no prison camp for women, so they are forced to march for months from one place to another, because the Japanese do not know what to do with them. The courage and resilience of English women and the courage of the Australian soldier who tries to help them is the core of the film. This movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch it as it was shown on PBS, like a series, which actually adds to the feeling of the endless journey that this woman makes from England, through this remote island, and finally Australia. . History, cinematography, location and actors combine to make this a film so as not to get lost. My only question is why this has not been released on DVD!
