Does anyone know where I can get this video or movie for this? I've been looking for a long time to show my daughter to show it to her and I can not find it anywhere. probably because he was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk. <br /> <br /> I saw it from Disney in 1996 and I think it would be the best video to show it. a good movie that shows all kinds of emotion throughout the film. He also has a lot of actors who started their careers with this movie. If someone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and is willing to sell it for about $ 50 or something, call 201-566-0148. Thank you
