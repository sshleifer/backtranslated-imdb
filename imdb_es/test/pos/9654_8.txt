Philippe Garrel makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague, almost lost among the vestiges of its ancient splendor, but ready to resurface from its ashes if it is remembered from the past. On the other hand, those who are familiar with the themes of the director, can very well know how obsessed is with a persistent sense of loss in regard to the reality of reality. "Les amants réguliers", therefore, show us the parallel stories of "Amour fou" and a tempted revolution that was ruined under the direction of young French students. <br /> <br /> The first part of the story is about the dramatic events of May 68 in France evoked in a series of amazing sequences of plans, a kind of cinema style, which places the student's insurrection in something that is not an enviable light against a black background. <br /> <br /> There is much that can be said about the peculiarities of black and white photography used to describe the battle between students and policemen, where high contrasts confer an unrealistic atmosphere to sequences and darkness it approaches the excited bodies that surround them in mystery. The images, completely devoid of words, show the true consistency of the myth, a fact of brute violence, increasingly accentuated by the exasperated reality of the film's filming. The individual does not tell anything at all here: he tends to disappear in the mass. What really matters in these scenes of struggle is the meaning of mass suggestion, the blind fury of youthful assault, sinister praise of the power of the mob, even if they are conceived as separate entities, apart from any kind of emotion, with the cold and violence. Far look of an entomologist with the intention of cataloging his insect collection. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story is described in a more calm and intimate way. It highlights on the horizon the anguished portrait of an egocentric generation in search of their lost time, completely disenchanted with the individual values ​​of men, inclined to turn on their own axis between the opium fumes and making a funeral oration in praise of their recent defeat. <br /> <br /> "Les amants réguliers" seems to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great Robert Bresson, revised and corrected by the particular sensitivity of Garrel without moving away from the main argument, trying to expand in general perspectives on the subject of human disappointments that, although painful, can lead us to the truth. In my opinion, when trying to penetrate deeply into the substratum of history, if a man lets go and touches things with an ear, he will probably find that he can draw the dark side of his being with terrible and irretrievable consequences.
