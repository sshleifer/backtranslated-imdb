First of all, you should see this only if you do not care about the lack of subtitles, pornography, perverted sex and total, horrific and really shocking depravity. I mentioned perverted sex, but calling sex in the second half of the "curly" movie would be a big understatement. It's more like a punch in the face if you're not prepared for this type of illness. Having said that, I can revisit this morbid piece of pseudo-tobacco of the genre brought to us by our Japanese compatriots. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be quite basic, almost non-existent: a girl is hired to perform in the amateur porn movie. Do not expect much in the first 30 - 40 minutes. There is a dialogue: if you do not speak Japanese it will not mean much to you, that seems to be an occasional conversation between the girl, the team and the artist, then there is some pornography (direct sex), and after the scene is over, the artists and the crew take a break. And then ... it starts to happen. <br /> <br /> It seems that the girl is told to play one more scene, this time tied with the rope. The abuse begins: whipping, slapping, hot wax ... In the end, the girl breaks and cries. They untie it. <br /> <br /> Then we see the artists and the team sitting at the table as if nothing had happened, except the girl. She is visibly agitated and seems to want to leave. She walks to the door, sits on the floor to put on her shoes ... and that's when hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> She gets hit on the head with the baseball bat, her wound is treated, she is tied to the bed. What follows can be briefly described (I will not spoil everything for you) as a violation during the dismemberment. Think of "Flower of flesh and bone," mix it with pornography and you'll get the idea. It lasts approximately 20 minutes. The SFX are very good, the makeup too. Everything is shown, without mercy for the viewer. You have been warned <br /> <br /> I thought "Visitor Q" was a very sick movie. After seeing "Niku daruma", it seemed like a fairy tale to me. This movie is so sick, so depraved, so twisted, so disgusting that the harsher words pale in comparison to their ending. Too bad it has been published only on VHS, so there are no subtitles available. But the movie still works without them. Therefore, if you like extreme illnesses, extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre, take a look. I hope you do not have nightmares. 8/10.
