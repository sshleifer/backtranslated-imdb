I had the pleasure of watching this movie when I was 10 years old, (I already had an interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle errors in the direction of art and costumes, but above all it is the best film, to date with the appearance of Dynasty 18. <br /> <br /> The film only approaches Mika Walteri " The Egyptian ", in the plot. A good part of the text never came to be filmed, since we have to consider the duration of the race. <br /> <br /> The music of B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful! Actions as follows. The late Edmond Purdom had an excellent performance as an orphan child adopted by the parents after their years of upbringing. He affirms that he maintains himself, has the best education available and, let's face it, is an emotionally distant person, given his education and high intellect. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is fine as a humble tavern maid; honest caring and sincere. Bella Darvi, people complained about your accent, well, she's a Babylonian. It's not so obvious in the movie why Sinhue is so obsessed with Nefer Nefer Nefer. Your correct name In the book, Sinhue is enjoying his carnal fruits and takes revenge at the beginning of the plot by leaving the drugged body of Nefer Nefer Nefer with the workers of the "Casa de los Muertos". Gene Tierney, like Baketaten, is brilliant! When she tells Sinhue that he is Pharaoh, it seems that she could devour him (in his weakness). She is intense, bright and coldly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to make all people know their one God. I think we are seeing Ankhnaten through the lens of the Egyptologist A. Weigall. A vision at that time that had a pre-messiah feeling about the vocation of Ankhnaten. Did his monotheism influence the Jewish people? Do you notice Psalm 104. and other images of Egyption in the psalms? <br /> <br /> Mr. Peter Ustinov provided the alter ego to Sinhue. He is a wise street man and cunning a survivor. Excellent performance as always. <br /> <br /> Maduro never thought much about his personal performance, Su Horemheb is fine as an ambitious "super patriot" who finally causes Sinhue to murder more than one person in his quest for power, (Walteri's book). <br /> <br /> I felt that the end of The Egyptian was confusing since Sinhue's personality changes too easily. He has a living son (Toth dies in the novel), power is delivered through his half sister Baketaten, now he is a world expert and has control over international affairs. So it lit up? He could have modified the Priesthood of Amon as he was capable. <br /> <br /> But NO! Does Sinhue give everything, including the future of his son to become a ragged beggar who preaches monotheistic love? <br /> <br /> This change was too immediate and the main flaw in the script! <br /> <br /> Again the look of the film, color, most of the costumes (Nefer Nefer Nefer's golden dress was too exaggerated since she is more well dressed than the royal family), the music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I'll see this Re-shoot easily. <br /> <br /> PS I know that, by the way, you know that Horemheb did not have direct success in Ankhnaten, but I could not resist stating this fact.
