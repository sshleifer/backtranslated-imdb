During the making of this film, I once caught a statement on television about it. Something like: "Killingg√§nget is now taking away Nazism?" <br /> <br /> So, my understanding of this film was from the beginning a notion of Nazism. Recently, when I saw this movie in the TV version, I had this filter in front of me and it was not difficult to see it. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, I do not know this way of interpreting the movie since then. I heard it for the first time. <br /> <br /> These are the things I found in "Four shades of brown". In all four stories, the lack of empathy leads to disaster: <br /> <br /> 1. The crematorium worker does not show realistic empathy with dead animals or those who had to say goodbye. In the crematoria room to deal with death and fire is almost like a joyful game for him. The severity of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his son consequently, in ignorance presses a button that leads to disaster that seriously wounds his father. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: The importance of showing young people Appropriate emotions. When they grow up, they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to the good. <br /> <br /> 2. The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer. Just when she thinks she has begun to cut the strings of the teacher's hand, seeking personality, integrity and joy, he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despair. <br /> <br /> Your son has tried to rebel in creating his own life with perfection and "good taste" as opposed to the "bad" taste of his parents. The real problem that he is carrying inside is far from being understandable to him: his father's behavior happens when he chokes his own wife in his impeccable surroundings. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: Oppression breeds slavery. <br /> <br /> 3. The father who was mistreated as a child passes sadism to his children when he cheats them because of his inheritance. It steals their childhood and, in the end, even their inheritance. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: When there is no love given, you can not give any. <br /> <br /> 4. Parents abuse him. The daughter creates in her a ruthless avenger with sadistic aggression. Here the cold Nazi-sadism becomes very obvious in physical violence. It provides a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation of the actions of young Nazis with their heads when oppressing others. <br /> <br /> A possible lesson? : Can Nazism be born in a home of perverts? <br /> <br /> Can the horrible consequence of ignoring empathy in family life, in the long term, be the room for sadistic Nazism? <br /> <br /> Very rarely does a film contain so much. It is revealed little by little as I meditate on it. I consider it brilliantly "painted" and the actors are excellent. Especially the kind of nice appearance played by Ulf Brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all ...
