After seeing a preview of this movie at my local mall where there is a stand to buy foreign films, I found it very entertaining. Before watching the movie, I went to IMDb to see what ratings and comments it received. I worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative grades. Despite the exaggerations, I saw a movie and, to my surprise, it seemed incredible. <br /> <br /> The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the film are amazing. I have not seen such a good combination of main characters in a long time. I really felt for both characters and felt a strong bond. As the reading of previous publications about this film is not enough "epic" or lack of martial arts, I could not disagree more. This movie is what it is, it's not Braveheart and it's not Enter the Dragon, but it's still a wonderful movie that does an excellent job of combining history and action. <br /> <br /> Although Sword In The Moon is not Perfect (what movie is it?) it is still wonderful and moving. Just wait until the final scene, with music and cinematography together, is impressive. I just hope that more people can watch this movie to give it a fair vote.
