What a wonderful documentary! I sat thinking that this would be a repetition of the evil stories of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, but it is, in fact, a glorious celebration of a strange and twisted era that generated some truth. great movies What surprised me was the lack of apparent bitterness in the interviews with the director, since now the movie business stinks to a large extent, instead, people like Friedkin and Coppola seem to shine positively as they remember their glory days. The filming of an audience that came out of a daytime display of the Exorcist was priceless. "It was traumatic," says one boy. A great epitaph for the late Ted Demme, an exciting movie, I just wish it would be longer; I could have sat in a three-hour court.
