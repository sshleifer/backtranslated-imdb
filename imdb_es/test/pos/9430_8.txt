Dr. Franz Tobel, a Swiss scientist, is smuggled out of his home country by Sherlock Holmes so that the Nazi agents who spy on him will not have his invention of a new bomb. Arriving in London, he marries Holmes and Watson, but leaves with his girlfriend, Charlotte Eberli, where he leaves a clue to Holmes regarding the location of his bombshell, which he has divided into four parts, but The Eternal Nemesis of Holmes, Professor Moriarity, is also looking for the bomb to sell to the Nazis, and kidnaps Doctor Tobel and the track left in Charlotte, a series of code of dancers, which both Holmes and Moriarity are unable to decipher by full. . Holmes finally discovers the code key and obtains the location of the fourth part of the bomb sight, but Moriarity has the other three and a confrontation is inevitable. Very good entry into the series of Holmes with much mystery and conjecture to go. Morwell's portrayal of Atwill is more sadistic than the cunning type described in Doyle's stories (or George Zucco's performance in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but Atwill's abilities as an actor make Moriarity a pretty benevolent person. The script and the direction make this entry more like a game of cat and mouse between the two characters and that is one of the reasons why this entry is so successful. Great work in cinematography too. Score, 8
