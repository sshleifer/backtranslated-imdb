I can not add much to what has already been said, except that I will have to do it because of the minimum policy of 10 lines. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have this on a VHS to DVD Copy, but the quality is quite poor and I desperately need it to be officially published. <br /> <br /> I can just imagine what extras I'd like to see (Tim Healy's character works his way through one of those 'Football Bloopers programs would be great!). You can imagine it now, right? But, of course, it seems that most people will have to keep dreaming of a DVD release. <br /> <br /> Surely, for God there must be someone in the DVD release department at ITV who also knows something about British culture. Are you an expert on the web and have enough about them to watch IMDb now and again? Oh good.
