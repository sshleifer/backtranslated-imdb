Once again I must touch something of the opposite. Most of Ab Tak Chappan's criticisms have been extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only a little. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a "C" rating on my part. <br /> <br /> It seems that many of the accolades are based on two factors: one, that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood movie, and two, that he is trying to do things differently. <br /> <br /> The first point I could not care less about. I do not look for realism in the movies, so I do not get a higher score in a movie that shows a story and characters closer to what I think is the real world: I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy and the absurd. And so on, although I do not dislike realistic films simply because they are realistic. <br /> <br /> For the second point, I agree that it is advisable to try to do things differently. However, I do not believe that "originality" in the face of formulaism constitutes a film better or worse in itself. A film can be "original" and poor, just as a film can be formulated and excellent. What matters is how well the film does what is proposed and how pleasant or aesthetically pleasing it is to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai policeman named Daya Naik. . Naik was a "meeting specialist." The meeting specialists, who could be said to be the first instances of "Judge Dredds" in the real world, are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue, and basically they are given a license to kill, acting effectively as a policeman, judge, jury and executioner in a matter of moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), the encounter specialist based on Naik. We see him at work, interacting with his fellow specialists in meetings and participating in violence. We see him at home, trying to live a normal life in his little luxurious environment. We see him trying to adapt to a new "commissioner" in the middle of the movie. And we see his strange relationship with a notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). <br /> <br /> All this has the potential to make a fabulous and brave movie. I agree that it is good to give up the typical musical numbers and romances of Bollywood, not all films need that; The producer of Ab Tak Chappan, Ram Gopal Varma, is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or on the way in many films that he directs or produces. In addition, Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances, Patekar almost emits a Death Wish (1974), in his version of Charles Bronson. It also has an admirable cinematography: the handy things near the beginning of the film were particularly effective, for example. It has a great score that mixes more than a bad mood of Hollywood sound / crime score with traditional instruments and modalities of India. The violence is well done and gritty. <br /> <br /> There is also a decent exploration of the subtexts, including the morality of (having) specialists in the encounters, the idea of ​​following orders, and so on. It shows the specialists in encounters who have to divorce themselves to a large extent from the ideas of good and evil. More movingly, the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. Parallels are drawn between the specialists of the meeting following orders and, say, members of the armed forces of a country, and we are shown to what corrupt situation this can lead. <br /> <br /> But (you knew there was a "But" comes, does not it?) Director Shimit Amin and his writers have created a story with too many characters, too much dispersion, and that moves a little too slow. All these problems may be due to Amin and the crew watching the Godfather films, to which Ab Tak Chappan has some similarities (at least superficial), although from the perspective of a policeman. <br /> <br /> Most meeting specialists We do not get to know him very well: these are unsophisticated characters, to say the least, except Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). For starters, Narayan, I did not know who was up to at least half of the movie. His name is mentioned several times, but he only glimpsed it until the scene changed. Then, everyone would change their clothes again when they reappeared and I would have to start again to discover who Narayan was. <br /> <br /> The same thing happened with the first commissioner of Agashe. The movie was already far away in the new commissioner before he could figure out the relationships. It seems that there are new characters in each scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. Although that could have some artistic merit, since the specialists in the encounter kill mainly people of whom they do not know anything (because in their majority they do it by order), since we do not learn much about the majority of the specialists in the I find, it's hard to find characters to worry about, and that's not exactly what makes it an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The main villain is Zameer. But until about half of the movie, there are no indications of this. He does not have much more screen time than the other villains who parade in the film, and he literally "phones his performance", he finds himself in another place (Dubai) and communicates only by telephone for the majority of the film. Actually we do not see Zameer doing much. To some extent, the film depends on a couple of "twists" that require not showing Zameer doing several things, but we could see him doing other things, and many of the other villains could have been excluded. <br /> <br /> That would have hardened the film a bit, making it more focused and half an hour shorter, which would have benefited its impact. This is not an action-packed movie in any way. For at least the first 45 minutes or so, I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style, but saying, "Okay, keep up the story."
