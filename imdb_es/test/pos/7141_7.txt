It is true that this is not the best film by John Sayles (Brother From Another Planet), but it is not entirely forgettable, but for any reason other than his message. Like Batman, Wild Thing's parents were murdered in front of him, leaving him to his fate in 'The Zone', a corrupt section of an anonymous city where greed and violence reign. Instead of falling for people like Chopper (Robert Davi), Wild Thing fights for justice, uses his Tai Chi powers and strange cat impressions, and occasionally catches fire. It becomes something like an urban legend, a modern Robin Hood and a hero for all ages. 1987 at its best, LIVES WILD THINGS
