I first heard about the commander's record when I was at the console of the local science fiction convention. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks and Brian Oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels to make television on a limited budget. I must say that I felt very satisfied when I finally had the opportunity to see the show. Comparisons with Red Dwarf are inevitable, as Red Dwarf's first seasons also had a low budget (although the commander's record has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of airtime), and therefore, they have to compensate for the lack of "sweet eyes" with good writing and acting. Linden Banks, who plays under-officer Blather, does a particularly good job of presenting a serious but clueless person. <br /> <br /> The original idea of ​​Bowlsby was that the story would be told in two-minute "interstitials", which is shown in between other shows over the course of a night, although for some reason, Space did not understand what great that this idea was, so all the interstitials were grouped in a one-hour program, which Space normally showed in two half-hour episodes. The existing DVD does not include episode 3 (which premiered at Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (which was presented at VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you're in contact with your local fan community, you can Get news from a sample somewhere near you.
