A man named Jerry takes possession of an ancient Aztec doll. However, this small and creepy figure is possessed by an evil spirit, which seizes Jerry's body and pushes him to shed blood ... I have seen two other horror movies "The Dorm that Dripped Blood" and "The Kindred "Made by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow and I must say that" The Power "does not disappoint either. The plot moves slowly, but there are some effective effects of human effect and a bit The scene of a reporter of a female tabloid being attacked by arms that come out of a mattress is a hoot. I liked this low budget horror movie and you should also do it if you like the horror genre of the 80s. 8 out of 10.
