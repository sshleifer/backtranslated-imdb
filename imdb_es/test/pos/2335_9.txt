This is one of those movies in which critics really lost the mark. This movie is practically McHale's Navy for the 90s or the Police Academy at sea. Grammer demonstrates that he can play other roles besides Frasier, as he mocks and beats the Navy to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is as dark as ever, the same in all the roles he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot, but with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual, with almost every line a slogan. The film has a wonderful intelligent plot and an unpredictable script that still surprises me every time I see it. However, many of the phrases and terms of the Navy ignore my head, but it is a small obstacle to the accuracy and realism of the film and its characters.
