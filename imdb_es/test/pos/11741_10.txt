It is played by war correspondent William Holden, who falls in love with an impressive Eurasian doctor, Jessica Jones, who faces the stunning backdrop of Hong Kong. The cinematography is magnificent, since they are on a hill that dominates Hong Kong. The story is about racial tensions, society with a frown in mixed relationships and extramarital affairs. But what I love is the strong character of the heroine represented by Jessica Jones, who is a Eurasian doctor, who remains humble and firm in her altruistic mission and remains loyal to his love. Despite that, she is fired from her hospital for gossip with tall men. One day, William Holden is called to the Korean War that he covers and then, on that bad day, she receives the news of his disappearance. The ending, of course, is tragic, I cried when she went to her hill. It was a very unfortunate love. Defeat all odds, the fact that she was dismissed from her job, how her wife would not grant her a divorce, and yet her great love persevered; They experienced great love in spite of everything. Personally, I do not believe in extramarital affairs, and I think I should not have started something when I was linked to someone else and she should not have let that happen, but in spite of that, it's a really great movie. I think the heroine eclipsed the hero. Jessica Jones is sensual and gave a magnificent performance, although I found it strange that they did not hire a real Asian actress or someone with Asian blood. I agree with a criticism, Jessica Jones oozes sexuality when she leans on the floor and looks at William Holden talking calmly, but her eyes say come to see me now. <br /> <br /> It seems a pity that most of the great films were made before I was born, it seems that many Hollywood films lack depth, good acting and are completely dependent on scenes of risk and scenes of heavy sex This is truly one of the most unfortunate love stories in movies.
