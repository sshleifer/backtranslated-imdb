In the year 2000 (remember, this is two years ago, not four years ago), two men were motivated to create the most miraculous work of art on this side of the Mississippi. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious television movie that shows the story of a gang of second-rate rags (hence the title) that are pushed to the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters. <br /> <br /> Due to the motivating direction of both director Robert Lieberman and the last minute QB of the Buffalo Bills, Dan "Dale Hell" to Heller (played by the Canadian actor, Gil Bellows), often the Super Bowl snake The Bills are in the best position. <br /> <br /> With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, a camaraderie that only the sport of football can bring, and a general theory that the oppressed can compete, Second String is an excellent movie Worth seeing every possible moment that appears on TNT. <br /> <br /> The only potentially bad thing about this production is the spelling of the name of the costume designer, Jenifur Jarvis. <br /> <br />
