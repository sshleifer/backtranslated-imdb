Pitch Black is a surprisingly good movie. I was not a fan of Vin diesel before I saw Pitch black, but after seeing Pitch Black my respect for Vin Diesel has increased. He did a great job playing Riddick, a man wanted for many murders. His character is cold and he makes many decisions that surprised me, like almost in the end that Riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass, leaving everyone behind to die. I like this movie and how it deals with the human instinct. This movie is low budget, but this movie shows that you do not need incredible special effects and a lot of money to make a good movie. I think all the characters made this movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10;)
