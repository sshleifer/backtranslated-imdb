The creation of the pioneer of the comic strip Alex Raymond, "Flash Gordon", was the great father of all the epics of science fiction. This series is the first time that Flash was brought to the life of celluloid. Despite its low budget, this is a great space opera. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Earth condemned to apparent destruction, when Planet Mongo rushes through space in a collision course. Maverick's scientist, Dr. Zarkov, is heading towards the approaching planet in a self-made rocket, convinced that he can do something to stop the fugitive celestial body. He gets some last-minute recruits in the form of the ingenious athlete Flash Gordon and the beautiful Dale Arden. Once they get to Mongo, their problems really start. They are against the evil Emperor Ming the Ruthless, conqueror of his world, who has some ambitious plans for Earth. <br /> <br /> The rest of the series revolves around Flash's desperate attempts to save Earth; the various extraterrestrial cultures with which it is found; the allies he makes; Spacecraft he flies the battles he fights and the monsters he kills. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly conceived by Raymond, "Flash Gordon" presents classic archetypes of legendary myths and fables of antiquity. Here are echoes of famous stories, such as the sagas of Troy and Camelot and Sherwood Forrest. You have the handsome and elegant hero, in a quest to save the kingdom (Flash); The evil king (Ming); The wise old man (Zarkov); The lovely damsel in distress (Dale); the seductive siren (aura); loyal allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); In addition to monsters, dragons and varied beasts. <br /> <br /> Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Ming is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Dale is Helen of Troy or Gwenevere or Maid Marion. Zarkov is Merlin or Odysseus. (Or Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan are the Happy Men or the Knights of the Round Table. <br /> <br /> You have the idea. <br /> <br /> You can not help but notice how many "Flash Gordon" ideas would reappear later in STAR WARS. The cloud of the city; The world of ice; The forest moon The opening text of displacement (of the second series); There are others, but you understand the essence. All the science fiction genre has a great debt to this timeless classic. <br /> <br /> Buster Crabb is the perfect action hero, and personally I think he's better at this kind of role than any of the current action groups. stars He also played with Buck Rogers and Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton is the embodiment of diabolic evil like Ming. Sure, it seems a bit melodramatic today, but that's what the public expected of their bad guys in the 30s. <br /> <br /> Jean Rogers is the love interest of our hero Dale Arden, and I fell so in love with him her when I first saw him as a child. I can easily understand why Flash always rushed to rescue her. She is the good girl par excellence, to counteract the seductive manipulations of Aura, the bad girl par excellence. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast seemed perfectly chosen to emulate their comic strip counterparts, and despite the now silly looking FX, there was an exciting action in this groundbreaking series. <br /> <br /> A fun game and the beginning of the science fiction genre in the cinema.
