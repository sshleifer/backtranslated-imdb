beautifully built, "Traffik" tells the story of the use of narcotics and trade from multiple points of view. From the point of view of the policeman, from the political point of view, from the point of view of an addict, from the point of view of a smuggler and from the point of view of a farmer. In a carefully constructed plot, one has the impression of how everything is interrelated. From the beautiful shots in place in the poppy fields in Pakistan, to the center of Karachi, the entry points to the airports of Frankfurt and London, to the desolate buildings where smuggling takes place, one sees the massive dimension of narcotics consumption.
