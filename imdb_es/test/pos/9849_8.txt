Peak Practice was a British drama series about a GP surgery in Cardale? a small fictional town in the Derbyshire peak district? and the doctors who worked there. It worked in ITV from 1993 to 2002, and was one of his most successful series at that time. It was originally starring Kevin Whately as Dr. Jack Kerruish, Amanda Burton as Dr. Beth Glover and Simon Shepherd as Dr. Will Preston, although the list of doctors would change many times over the course of the series. <br /> <br /> The series was eliminated in 2002 and ended in a literal suspense when two of the main characters in the series fell off a cliff. Viewers wrote ITV in their thousands and a request for a final episode was created by the Peak Practice Online website. However, all the motives were unsuccessful and ITV said they would not make more episodes. <br /> <br /> Peak Practice was replaced by Sweet Medicine, another medical series set in Derbyshire. It lasted some episodes before it was eliminated from the schedules. <br /> <br /> Cardale was based in the town of Crich in Derbyshire, and the series was filmed there and in other nearby cities and towns of Derbyshire, especially Matlock and Ashover. After the end of this program, ITV tried to launch a follow-up series called Sweet Medicine, which extended the stories of different characters from the original program.
