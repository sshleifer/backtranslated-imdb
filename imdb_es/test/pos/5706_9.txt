When I tuned in to my local PBS station last night to watch "The War That Made America." I expected a boring documentary, however, I got a very good and credible recreation of the main events of the time. Now I see the reasons for the American Revolution and the role played by the Indian wars. Larry Nehring is George Washington, and he is perfect for that part. The narrative to the camera, also works fantastically. I'm looking forward to next week, to see the rest. It's good to see that PBS really uses the HD format to bring the 1700 directly to our living room. <br /> <br /> I hope that Larry Nehring will be seen more in the future, since he is such a talented actor.
