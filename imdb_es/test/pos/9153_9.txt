And nothing wrong with that! We endorse the comments of Boblipton and Snow Leopard. <br /> <br /> I am delighted to discover that this movie is available on the US DVD. UU - I've only seen her once - I persuaded the Goethe Institute here in London. to show it in his Conrad Veidt season a few years ago, and a long time to see him again. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is resplendent when he participates, as in this film, possibly because of the puncture of having a German actor recognized as aluminum foil. And Veidt is such a wonderful scene thief (does not he stick his nose in at any given moment?) This is one of the seminal films to connect 'Dr Jekyll' with '20th Century', 'Grand Hotel' or 'Midnight'; and 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari' or 'The Student of Prague' with 'The Spy in Bladk', 'Contraband' and 'Casablanca'. <br /> <br /> See it!
