This has to be my favorite movie. The script is crisp and played to the limit by an excellent Miller and the fantastic Carlisle! Sharp wit, excellent narrative and unpolished Hollywood; A totally submersible movie that makes you shoot the bad guys! Stott again stands out as the detestable Chance, while Liv Tyler really outperforms her other lighter performances like the cardigan hungry for emotion. You may not know the soundtrack by name, but anyone who has seen Top Gear, watched football or watched a TV action sequence is probably familiar with it, particularly due to Craig Armstrong's 'Escape', that you should never let him do it. Work again! The soundtrack in the first play may seem out of place in a costume / action / comedy drama, but a new observation shows that it is perfectly appropriate to give the script to the drama. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about This movie is that it is not shown enough on TV! Where is? Truly excellent, crisp and elegant, you will not regret having seen it, again and again! (Exit to turn on the DVD player!)
