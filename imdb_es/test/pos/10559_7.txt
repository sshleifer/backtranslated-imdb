I saw this series after Tipping the Velvet, for which I gave the 10/10 grade. I had read the comments of users about this and expected an equally good series, or if possible, even better. At this point, I must emphasize that this series is good, and definitely captured me through it and therefore, it is worth seeing. However, I did not enjoy it as much as Tipping the Velvet, for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Less passion, love and related sexual content. There was a surprisingly small emphasis on these elements, which I considered integral to a love story. Fingersmith felt like a watered down version of Tipping the Velvet. <br /> <br /> 2. Similarly, as in Tipping the Velvet, the story had three parts: the beginning, a shocking second part and the ending. The second part should have been the climax of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet), but instead it was almost totally omitted, perhaps due to the inability to make shocking but credible asylum content. The series should have been in three parts, with two cliffhangers, with much more focus in the second part. <br /> <br /> 3. Almost no weight was given to what Fingersmiths was and how it affected their personalities. I found it rather annoying that the series did not adequately address this central issue. <br /> <br /> 4. The ending was much more rushed than in Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith left several interesting plots open. <br /> <br /> Despite these shortcomings, Fingersmith is a good series, and well worth 7/10. However, it is not a classic like Tipping the Velvet.
