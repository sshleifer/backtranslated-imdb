This is a great show despite many negative reviews from users. The goal of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two men compete with each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun in this show is seeing the two men trying to achieve their goal. <br /> <br /> Some seem to hate the program for several reasons, but I think they misunderstood this as an "educational" program on how to collect chicks. Well, it's not, it's a comedy show, and its main goal is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. If you did not like the program, because it does not teach you anything, do not look at it. If you do not like all the clubbing, do not look at it. If you do not like to socialize, do not see it. This show is a comical show. If you fall to see others pick up the girls, well, it does not make you laugh, so do not look at it. If you are so disappointed in yourself after seeing this program and you realize that you do not have the ability to "pick up" the girls, there is no reason to hate the program, just do not see it!
