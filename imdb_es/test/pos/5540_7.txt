Michelle Pfeiffer is ideally chosen as the frustrated mafia widow in this colorful black comedy. Matthew Modine plays a clumsy FBI agent who has fallen in love with her. Dean Stockwell steals the show as the big shot that continues to haunt Pfeiffer; Mercedes Ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife. It's all very 80s, but that adds to the fun. A good little movie, but not for all tastes.
