These guys are excellent and everything they publish is first class. The musicality of this band is incredible and we should all be very grateful that we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such a domain live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it thoroughly! I recently saw these incredible musicians playing in Houston, TX and I was impressed. I have not missed any show since Windows and I have to say that they are better than ever. Everyone should embrace these boys and teach others what true musical mastery is! There will never be a trio so strong and well organized again in our life. Let's hope and pray that they will not retire soon!
