Seriously. If this had been Shack's first film, it would have been passable as funny, silly and ridiculous. The comments of light satire on the class system would make this a pleasant rental at night. <br /> <br /> However, everyone wants to compare it to the first movie, and maybe that is not fair. The first movie is a cult classic; What could possibly follow it? Nothing. So take this second film as an independent, and it certainly has its moments. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is funny, doing her best personification of Rodney-wannabe. Is he as good as Rodney? No. Are your lines so good? No. But he is fun. The rest of the cast falls online as decent, but not exceptional. You will recognize faces among the actors and ask yourself how they got where they are today. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable, but is not it the most in this genre? Again, it's not the best comedy you'll ever see, but if you like Cannonball Run fun, you'll enjoy this one.
