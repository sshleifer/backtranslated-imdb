Let's clarify it from the beginning: I'm an imbecile with the emotional sensitivity of the cubic stone. Therefore, I consider the dramas of people with disabilities, social stigma or whatever illness they have and cry over and over again like stupid films with bad taste. I mean, if you have a message, you can say it without the help of sick or unfortunate people. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this movie. These are people with incredible bad luck as is personal health, but they do not cry about it, on the contrary, they try to live and people try to "protect" or "take care of" them by eliminating them from real life. lifetime. The message is to live life to the fullest, even if the end is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: as the dramas of sick people go, this is a guardian. It's sad, but hopeful. I like James McAvoy, even if he seems to always play against the arrogant rebel. I also say that Steven Robertson played very well. Either that or he really has partial paralysis. :)
