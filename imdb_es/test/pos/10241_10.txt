This movie was very well written and it was very entertaining. There was a great performance in her as well. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (as it always does) If you are looking for a movie full of events to see this, it should be at the top of your list. There is a mixture of comedy, drama and action. You can literally feel what the actors are feeling at certain points. I was very impressed by this movie. The special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. What happens is that North America could be destroyed and Jack and his team must try to stop an eruption by destroying North America. It was a very fresh and creative idea. I loved this movie and I know you will too.
