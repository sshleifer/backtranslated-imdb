Like most sports films, it is not surprising that people who know something about sport can find fault with it. As a football referee, I still have to see a movie or a television show doing well when playing a game. "Forever" has good actors, but I think Sean Astin is a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile prison. I was very grateful that the plot did not involve the main character, turning his recruitmates into rugby players and facing Flagstaff and Highland. What comes to credulity: a police patrol car simply stops just at the moment when the evil Flagstaff is harassing Rick Penning. Although rugby is not a nationally authorized high school sport, the team is a school-based club sport, such as rodeo. That said, I find it hard to believe that high school officials allow students to play with open wounds: that is not done on this day of AIDS and hepatitis. I do not care what the tradition and the macho image are. Despite that, it was a great movie in which the teenagers were expected to act as adults (and sometimes they did). Unfortunately, too many coaches are like Flagstaff's, or worse.
