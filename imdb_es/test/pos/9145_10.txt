Armande Assante (Simon), from Soul's Midnight, who watched "The Mambo Kings" and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Along with Sexy vampire vixen, Lucilla Sola (Iris), Simon attracts pregnant Alicia and her husband Charles to the underworld of Soul's Midnight. Assante sinks his fangs into the script of the writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you enjoy watching him kill Iris. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) try to stay alive while Gore keeps his thirst for bloodlust. <br /> <br /> (spoiler alert) In today's jaded landscape, it's no wonder that a stabbing preacher is bitten. Set looks good? A lot of details at the Hotel Borgo and special effects at the end. I had a lot of fun watching this movie? It does not take itself too seriously and it looks great.
