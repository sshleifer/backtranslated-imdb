"Queen of the Damned" is one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen. The film had suspense, action, and gore. The combination of the fierce and demanding attitude of the Queen and the rock atmosphere of our star, very well acted by Stuart Townsend, makes a wonderfully made film that only this combination can create. I am always the one who advised my friends and family about what movies are worth renting and when they ask me if it's worth "Queen of the Damned", I tell them it's worth buying. This film is, undoubtedly, essential in the homes of all lovers of horror movies!
