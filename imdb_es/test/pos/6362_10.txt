To say that I did not expect much to sit down to watch "The Couch Trip" is an understatement. I had no idea what it was about. I thought it was going to be a trip to the world of sexuality when I heard Chevy Chase play the condom and the title of the film includes the word "couch trip", * wink, wink. * Then I realized that it had something to do with a mental institution and a patient who was escaping. My expectations were reduced even more. <br /> <br /> I was literally expecting a movie of smiles, the kind you smile on once and feel a little cheated. And in a way, this is a cheap comedy: it does not have the best jokes, the plot is ridiculous, but you know what? I had a big silly smile on my face the whole time I was watching her. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient in a psychiatric hospital who may or may not be mental. He gives the psychiatrist, Lawrence Baird (David Clennon), a lot of pain and misery, which leads us to believe that, after all, he is a sensible person. In the cafeteria, Burns is waiting for a reprimand from Baird in his office when the phone rings. Burns takes it, pretends to be Baird, and discovers the caller on the other line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the real Dr. Baird to show up for a radio audience called George Maitlin (Charles Grodin), who He is taking a vacation with his wife, Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird to be so bad that he even booked a ticket for him on a plane. <br /> <br /> Burns escapes from the institute with the help of a receptionist, and heads to O'Hare. He gets the Dr. Baird ticket, gets on the plane and eventually goes through the air like Dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. "People love it!" one man says, and the other responds: "It's because he really cares about them." <br /> <br /> Donald Becker (the late and great Walter Matthau) is an ex-mental patient who recognizes Burns's clothing to be trousers and confinement shirts. To keep it quiet, Burns promises Becker a percentage of his income. The secret remains closed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Maitlin and his wife argue. He returns home to finish his vacation and realizes that the man on his talk show is not, in fact, Dr. Baird, after all, but nobody believes him. He gets the real Dr. Baird, but unfortunately he has lost his identification, so the police take them like crazy and do not listen to his story. <br /> <br /> Let me mention just some of the holes in the plot. noticed while watching this movie: Burns pretends to be Dr. Baird, but he is never asked for his identification, even when he claims his plane ticket (he was robbed, he says, but they would still make sure it is Baird). If Burns becomes so famous, why did the real Dr. Baird in Chicago never hear people talk about him? The word travels. And finally, why would the police arrest Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird, that is) without following their stories? <br /> <br /> To be frankly honest, I could not care less. I entered this film with a closed mind and I was surprised, I liked it a lot. He entertained me. His ideas are essentially ridiculous and not at all realistic, but Dan Aykroyd offers a truly animated performance as a wacky half that makes "The Couch Trip" a worthwhile trip. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
