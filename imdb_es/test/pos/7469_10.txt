Very well written, acted and filmed. Violent, but not too much. Whoever edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There is not a scene wasted in this movie. "The Usual Suspects" was an excellent overall performance; This is a collection of outstanding individual performances. I rarely buy movies, but it's worth having.
