In Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock, it is clear that Big Al's fear of the police goes back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station with a note. The note said: "He has been naughty, he was imprisoned for an hour". The policemen obeyed and, since then, Hitchcock had a deep fear of being accused and kidnapped by the police. <br /> <br /> "Strangers in a train" is probably one of the best in his series of "wrongly accused". The film is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith. It's the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She was always fascinated by smart criminals. <br /> <br /> The opening of Hitchcock is very strong and it takes you immediately to the protagonists: Guy Haines, a famous tennis player, and Bruno Anthony, the aspiring delinquent. The two boys share a chemistry that at that time was probably much more than the public could chew. Bruno tries to convince Guy that they could commit the perfect murder (without leaving clues), if they change the victim. Bruno will kill Guy's wife who would not grant him a divorce, and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The reasons are, respectively, love and money. <br /> <br /> Bruno's performance is destined to be seductive and homoerotic. This is not something that was done by accident. In fact, Hitchcock released two versions of the film: one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. In the American version, the volume of Bruno's seductiveness was greatly reduced. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is a very deep film, but the most important thing is that this is another excellent Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of an exciting scene is when Guy is climbing the steps to Bruno's father's room. Hitchcock reasoned that the attention of the audience should be distracted at this point so that they would not realize what Guy will find in the room. Hitch treats us with a HUGE and threatening dog at the top of the stairs that provided the necessary distraction. <br /> <br /> The most famous shot of the film takes place during a tennis match. Bruno has been continuously harassing Guy so that he can fulfill his part of the bargain (kill his father). When Guy looks at the audience, all heads turn from one side to the other. All but one - Bruno's. He is looking directly at Guy with a "I'll get you" smile. <br /> <br /> The ending is another example of suspense. Both fight for a key piece of evidence in a carousel that spins at full speed. A worker is crawling under him to get to the controls. When we finally leave this trip and the film ends with Guy proving his innocence, we are exhausted and without nails (for those of us who still bite our nails!). <br /> <br /> "Strangers in a train" is easily one of the best films of Hitchcock "unjustly accused". Some credit him with one of the best villains (Bruno) as well. All in all, the movie may seem a little outdated, but that is a thriller lesson made by the master himself. I will not reject Leonardo, if he came to teach me Renaissance painting, neither will you. <br /> <br /> << Review published in FilmDailies.com >>
