This is possibly one of my favorite movies. It tells the story of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so she was bought by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday, the Snow Queen (Bridget Fonda) arrives at the hotel that her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then pursues Kai and follows him throughout the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him. <br /> <br /> I thought this was an excellent adaptation of the story with great performances by the entire cast. It has wonderful special effects and the story fits very well and is easy to follow. I think it's a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. I've seen it every time I've done it since it came out and I've never tired of doing it, that's why I gave it a 10!
