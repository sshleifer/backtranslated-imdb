Mishima: A life in four chapters is, in my opinion, Paul Schrader's best film to date. The fascinating cinematography, accompanied by the mystic musical score Philip Glass, added an entirely magical aura to the story of one of Japan's greatest novelists, whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this image. Like any gifted character, Mishima was worried about the serious conflicts that were self-contested, the main one being the conflict between the "pen and a sword", as the director expressed it in his final chapter, or the struggle between the sensitive poet and homosexual feelings. in a notoriously masculine society with warrior traditions that lasted for centuries, thus widening the gap between the sensitive and traditionally militant side of Mishima itself. <br /> <br /> All of Schrader's films (and those for which he wrote scripts) are basically stories of the internal conflict within a man who does not belong to an environment in which he lives. That also applies to Mishima, who, apart from education in the Japanese military school, is educated in the love of theater and words. His death consisted of these two key points of his life, it was about words and a theatrical ending in a work of a lifetime. A film like this appears from time to time, and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty. 20 of 10 !!
