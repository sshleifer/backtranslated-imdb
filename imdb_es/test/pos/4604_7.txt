The Black Castle is one of those films that has made its way into a collection of Boris Karloff and is expected to be an absolute horror movie. While there are some elements of horror within Nathan Juran's film, this is really a multi-genre piece that is very well produced and portrayed effectively. Along with Karloff, in what is a small but critical role, are Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr, Rita Corday, John Hoyt and Michael Pate. It is produced, as expected, from Universal International Pictures. In the plot, the English gentlemen of Greene travel to the castle house of the sinister Earl von Bruno {McNally}. He is following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is full of dangers and surprises at every step. <br /> <br /> This has everything that fans of the old sub-genre of the dark house / castle could wish for. . Genuine boys, good and bad, a fair maid, dark corners to do dark works, diabolical traps, end of career clock and we even have a bit old-fashioned bluff in the deal. All the actors are becoming effective performances, particularly in Greene and in the wonderfully mocking McNally. While the writing of Jerry Sackheim is lean and devoid of the useless filler that has so often clogged similar films of this type. A highly recommended film on the condition that Karloff fans understand that it is not really a Karloff movie, and perhaps most important, that horror fans do not expect blood to be the order of the day. A beautiful atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout, The Black Castle is an excellent visual experience. 7/10
