This was my first Gaspar Noe movie that I've seen and I have to say it surprised me. I do not care about the gore in general, but this is not even gore, it's a real kill. For some of you, a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting. Leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas revealed here and the dialogue are quite brilliant. When you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life to the world and the way it is given, you can not stop and take a minute to think about it. The actors did their job well, representing the general masks of a manual selection that few people found at the bottom of a sick society. The movie is full of metaphors, but I'll let you discover them. Do not look at it if you want to have a relaxed and light time. I recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or just see something different from what you find in your average cinema.
