Once again John Madden has given us a magnificent movie. A simple but beautiful story located in a true paradise and music can not be better, Stephen Warbeck delights us once again, and good performances but ......... why the hell is Penelope Cruz in this movie? I asked myself that same question while watching this movie. Of course, his Greek accent is not credible, he can not act decently even in a scene. Not even in the end did a good job, after so many events, after years, finally could see Corelli again and could not change the same face of stupidity that we had to endure throughout the film. Anyway, Cage was very good at one of his best characters; Hurt is also great in him and the rest of the cast did a great job, so the end result is a movie that is really worth seeing. This is a beautiful movie that even Mrs. Cruz could not spoil. So far I think it's Madden's best work, so no fan will be disappointed.
