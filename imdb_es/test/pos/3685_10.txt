We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and out of place ... It's not your usual Hollywood nonsense. <br /> <br /> My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and broadcast a series of new releases of violent things from Hollywood. He was about to leave when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy, and with some glitches on the DVD we finally had to move to the widescreen version and then go back to the full screen version to stop it. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is very good and was perfect for the role. And she can sing too! <br /> <br /> I wish Hollywood learned from independent filmmakers! Maybe we'll go back to the real movies. But for now, we are left with outstanding and really entertaining movies like this one! Other examples we have enjoyed include: A box full of moonlight, April pieces, Delivering Milo, The Celestine Prophesy. Most of Christopher Guest's are: Best in Show, At Your Consideration, A Mighty Wind and Waiting for Guffman
