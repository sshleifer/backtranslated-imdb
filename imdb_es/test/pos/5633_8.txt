I enjoyed this, because I can relate to him. <br /> <br /> At one point in my life I tried to make films and experienced many of the same problems that Mark Borchardt did when trying to make HIS movie. And I also went through a prolonged period of arrested and self-absorbed development, where I refused to grow. But then, miraculously, I got married and had children. I realized that being a filmmaker with difficulties was, in all likelihood, not feeding my family. So I got a decent job and did what I felt I had to do to make that happen. That is what a mature and responsible adult does. <br /> <br /> Mark has not yet faced that reality and, in that sense, is a retarded teenager. For this reason, there is a despair in him. Like Don Quixote, he seems so inept and self-deceived that he does not realize how bad he really is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and compassion for him and his circle. Mark has children and an ex-wife and bills to pay, but the film shows that he basically cares about pursuing his "artistic vision." <br /> <br /> Despite this, Mark appears in the film as a nice person, surrounded by a very interesting family and a group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many of the things necessary to succeed both in life and career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial influence, etc. However, keep going, like Ed Wood, apparently without any appearance of a clue. <br /> <br /> I suppose we are supposed to be encouraged by the spectacle of this "never say die" attitude of this noble individual, fighting against odds. And man, what odds are there! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are descendants of great film or television artists; Without a doubt, everyone will want to direct some day, if they are not already. How much space is there for an independent like Mark? It's like watching a guy hit his head with a board, over and over again. Now that I think about it, that's very similar to what happens to one of Mark's actors, with the door of the kitchen closet, in one of the funniest scenes I've seen in any movie. <br /> <br /> Despite these misgivings. And apparently the reviews, I really enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone. Uncle Bill is amazing. I have a friend who met Mike and Mark, and he told me that, in real life, these guys are exactly as they appeared in the movie.
