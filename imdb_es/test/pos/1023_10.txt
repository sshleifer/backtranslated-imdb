Although I do not like cricket and I've seen this movie for 13 years, I still think it's one of the best adult films. I remember the day I returned home from my school and sat down for lunch, I saw the initial titles of that film and then ... I was so immersed in it that I felt it was there, it really affected me personally. I still remember how I felt when I saw him for the first time, I felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, who was going through the same adolescent experience we had in those days. What I really liked about that movie is the main theme of a "shy" guy who fantasizes about "kissing" his dream girl, without offending, but if that was an American movie, he would certainly see, at some point, mainly the climax , the "shy" guy "making love" with his girl, and I really can not understand these contradictory concepts until now ... I have a simple request, if anyone knows how to get this movie on a DVD by mail, please, let me know why I need a shot of memories ... thanks
