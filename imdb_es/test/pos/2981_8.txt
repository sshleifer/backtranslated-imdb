My girlfriend and I watched this movie when it was originally released. The controversy surrounding the original release (adolescent nudity, physical intimacy and unmarried pregnancy) were issues that never touched our vision of the film. We were the same age as Paul and Michelle and we experienced many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in simplistic (sometimes) acting and cheesy emotional turns (sometimes). This movie told us in a way that a love story for adults could never have had. I still remember that I sat in the cinema with my girlfriend and I held her hand while crying during the tragic final scenes (with albiet syrup).
