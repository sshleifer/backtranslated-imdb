... with a single act. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson, congressman, a real character. During the 1990s, when communism in the USSR, the Berlin Wall and the war in Afghanistan (with the Soviets) broke down. He did it, a single denial for money, and everything fell apart. He must be remembered, so here he is. Your memorial. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. Fun, dramatic, snobby, political or just boring. Anyway, it is an intelligent film about political life, about governing the world and, above all, a lesson for the world. A lesson for all politicians, a critical point of view that refers to countries that support wars with money, weapons and words. <br /> <br /> Lesson learned: the world is not a pleasant place to live
