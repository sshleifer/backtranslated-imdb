This movie almost has it all. The action is great, it's fun, 2 great big men and a really nasty villain that I REALLY hated. There are not many movies that have BAD bad guys. Only villains mainly from comics. He really deserves a good kick. <br /> <br /> Jake Scott really has the talent of his father to know how to make great visual effects. The management is impeccable and has an irresistible carefree feeling. Normally I do not like movies set in the old days, but I liked this because it makes the point of boredom like so many other films of the time (Sense and sensitivity, It was the innocence and the worst of the absolute ... The lady and the Duke). This will restore your faith. Thanks especially to the incredible score of Craig Armstrong. The music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in action scenes it is very exciting. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and it has a very slim and slimy anamorphic 2.35: 1 image.
