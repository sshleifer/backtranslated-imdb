This has to be one of my 3 favorite episodes of the original television series. <br /> <br /> What makes it great is the battle of wit between The Romulan Commander and Kirk, as well as the first-class performance of Mark Lenard, who later went on to play Spock's father in other episodes of TV and movies. This is a case in which those around him rose to the level of talent that surrounded them, and Shatner, Nimoy and the entire cast provide an outstanding performance in this episode. and I love the direct approach that is used to show us the characters, the feelings and thoughts of those characters and the way the actors express them freely. <br /> <br /> This very entertaining episode is ranked 10 out of 10. AWESOME! Desert-Buddha
