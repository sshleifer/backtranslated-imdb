I saw the film in 1972, and like other people who have commented here ... I went back many times to see it again and again ... I think 9 times in total. Simply great is how I would describe it ... I was captivated by the soundtrack, the beautiful panoramas of southern France, the lifestyle that the children started on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had created ... of course, the powers that must be to intercede, but when I forget that part, I want to be in the movie and live like that! So good that it's now available on DVD ... it was not available for years! <br /> <br /> TLW
