I would give this movie a good grade 7. Although it's definitely not the best movie, or even one of the best movies of its kind (The Killing Fields is better), at least try to tell a necessary story. <Br /> <br /> I think the method of introducing Laura into Burma was a bit artificial. First of all, Burma is not exactly the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 1980s. Secondly, if you did Burma, your passport would not be lost. A sensible person would make sure that he knew where his passport was at all times. With that in mind, I'm sure the screenwriter knew he was weak, but he needed something. Patricia Arquette's performance was discreet, and I just did not think she was a doctor. However, at least she did not exaggerate the role, which often happens in films like this. U Aung Ko was good, but also discreet. The ending is difficult to follow, since most of the dialogue is in Burmese, with people who translate for Laura. It would have been difficult for Laura, and also for the viewer. Another advantage is the strong Asian scene of the movie, which was nice to watch.
