My interpretation is that the term "distant" is used in the sense of the opposite of "warm"; People who are not warm towards others. The film reminds me of the teachings of the Dalai Lama in "The Art of Happiness", where his main point is that the key to happiness is to connect with others. Not only are the characters in the film insular, they also lack humor, charm, timidity, calmness and hostility. These characteristics seem to prevent, among other things, forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk and deal with their problems. And as a result they are terribly unhappy. I see it as a strong vindication of the Dalai Lama's teaching (by the way, I'm not a Buddhist). If you are one of the people who thinks that their behavior is a natural response to living in a big city, then I think you may be right, but I recommend the Dalai Lama's book. The life of the city does not have to be that way. <br /> <br /> I can see why some people found it boring: drag the places a bit and the characters are not particularly nice. And it contrasts with Lost In Translation, where the isolated characters are much more pleasant and connect with each other, even if they do not connect with people in general.
