I always enjoyed "DOA", 1950, starring Edmond O'Brien and I was very curious about this movie. Dennis Quaid, (Dexter Cornell), was a teacher who loved his wife and finally discovered that he was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan (Sydney Fuller), who studied in her college class and at the same time was very much in love with him and ended up having an affair of one night and, somehow, loved him deeply. Dexter finds out that he received a drink that had bad contents and would cause him many health problems! If you like Dennis Quaid and you love Meg Ryan, you will enjoy watching this movie, Meg gave an exceptional performance and kept this image worth seeing!
