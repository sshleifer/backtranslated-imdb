Return to Me is a movie you want to have. It is a story of inspiration and family love that attracts all ages. History, although apparently impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man loses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives the heart of his wife. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver provide hearty performances as future designated lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family that surround them and that love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor, as the grandfather of Minnie Driver, is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as the friend whose wit and breath emphasizes Minnie as a "sister" is funny but warm in the scenes, especially with James Belushi as her husband. The classic scenes and the writing make this story so pleasant and moving to see it again and again. Thank you for making a film that shows families and friends as close and loving people who love each other in difficult times.
