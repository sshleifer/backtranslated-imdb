"Father Hood" is a little gem that is overlooked in a "road movie". The excellent performances of Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, two really fun "over-the-top" by Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, and an exceptional one by Patrick Swayze. The film is favored by an unconventional story, but it is very undermined by the flashback framing, resulting in an abrupt end and formula. "Father Hood" would have worked MUCH better without these "bookends." However, the film presents important themes of "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. As long as the parenting system rewards state institutions for NOT placing children, such abuses will exist. <br /> <br /> Pick up this one. It's worth the "walk".
