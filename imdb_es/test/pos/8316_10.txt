SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> I received this DVD-Documentarie on DVD at Christmas 2004. I wanted to see it and in no way disappointed. The score is memorable (my <br /> <br /> favorites were the song "Sauropod" and the song "Winters Coming"). The effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. Actually you learn something too; Stegosaurs MAY have been able to pump their plates with blood. The female T-Rexes MAY have gone to kill themselves before laying their eggs. I know there are many people who thought that this was too much based on speculation, but there will always be questions that we can only guess. And there is also a lot of undeniable and hard-core FACT. WE KNOW that some dinosaurs traveled in packs, WE KNOW that Diplodocus swallowed stones to grind the vegetation in their stomachs. Despite this "speculation" the series went extremely well. So well, in fact, that it resulted in a follow-up, a prequel and several specials. If you are a dinosaur fanatic, then this is for you. It makes the Jurassic Park look small and weedy.
