A boy who adores Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens receives, to his horror, a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the mail. I recently saw him in a class where few of the students were interested in hockey, but almost everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the Toronto / Montreal rivalry. Highly entertaining, fun and precise.
