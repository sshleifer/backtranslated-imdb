Up front, if you're tired, the first hour could be slow. The configuration of the story has a slow and natural pace, without haste, which gives us time to appreciate the type of daily life and situations in which the main characters are. Once he reached the climatic segment of history, the turn of events will keep him hooked: how things will turn out, what will happen to our precious Fanda (portrayed to the absolute perfection of veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský), how his wife will treat him (beautifully played by Stella Zázvorková), what will happen to the dear friend of Fanda Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka, Brodský's partner) and Jára, the son with a hidden and selfish agenda, blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh) !) <br /> <br /> Vladimír Michálek directed the film sensibly. Humorous, keeping the insightful script of Jirí Hubac. Thanks to the clarity of the subtitles, I could notice for each phrase 'complaining' that the wife of Fanda pronounces, there is a hint of 'care' shown / is buried between the lines - and so did the judicious judge. Fanda is 80 years old and 80 and the affection of her lasting marriage (endearing) manifests itself even in her arguments of jokes. Your joy can be contagious. <br /> <br /> This is 'Aging together 101' (at least) beyond the fifties, and the lessons learned for the sons and daughters of not taking the parents for granted. It may be necessary to rethink whether to assume that "the home for the elderly" is a means to an end, so to speak. The film shouts at us gently so we can live life to the fullest while we can. (Hint: there is joy in staying and seeing the final credits roll). <br /> <br /> We are lucky to see an occasional Czech film. The "Dark Blue World" of the father and son of Sverák ("Kolya") of 2001 was revealing with pathos. It is good to take things slowly from time to time and appreciate a foreign gem: its subtitles, landscapes, melodic scores and an attractive human story with elegant performances. "Autumn Spring" (also known as Babí Léto) is available on DVD. Enjoy!
