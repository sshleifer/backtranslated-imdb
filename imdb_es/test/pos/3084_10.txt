Cary Elwes has to say that he has a better performance than Costner in RHPOT, but anyway. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie only makes me laugh a lot, mainly because the actors really look at what they are doing and you. Just sit down and think 'what the hell are they', but in a very, very, very good way. The random bursts of songs were brilliant and well, and the musical score used really appealed to me. An excellent casting and as I said before, everyone seemed so in their roles <br /> <br /> 10/10 of me challenging <br /> <br /> 'Because unlike other Robin Hood. I can speak with an English accent '
