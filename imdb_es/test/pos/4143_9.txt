I was lucky to be an extra in this movie when I was about 13 years old during the scenes of the skating rink. My high school drama class was invited to participate. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played the music live, all day! As a musician, I can appreciate the tireless work and dedication that these guys play in their roles. They must have played those songs 20 times. It is very difficult to maintain consistency and energy in these conditions. This is visible during a cut to a close up on "That'll Be the Day," but fortunately the unprepared audience probably would not have picked it up. <br /> <br /> Skating all day, getting a day off from school and being transported back in time was an incredible thrill. I also had my first "date" in the movie. I had to walk a girl to the ticket office. Woo hoo! Even with an obsolete haircut and warm lights that melted petroleum jelly in my hair, it was still worth it. Fun things. <br /> <br /> The film is top-notch and is highly satisfactory in general. Busey plays his best role and the cast is excellent. I'm glad I participated in a great movie of the day. To think that I could have been in Corvette Summer or something like that. No. <br /> <br /> A funny and ironic ending to this is that years later, I was in a video store in Malibu watching the movie the week it was released on video. Gary Busey came in and stood right next to me. I showed him the cover and he babbled on how good it was and how it was an extra and all that. Pretty weird, but very good, for what it's worth.
