If you only see an Ernest movie in your life, do it! This is, by far, the best of the series, with its incessant laughter and intelligent humor that is suitable for all ages. The other "Ernest" movies were also good, but most people tend to tire of it quickly (though, I do not.). <br /> <br /> In this film, Ernest P. Whorrel is assigned the jury service for a murder case. The murderer, Nash, looks EXACTLY like our clumsy hero Ernest. Mr. Nash believes that this is a good opportunity to escape from prison by knocking him out for the change of identity with him, and we can see how Ernest reacts in the slammer. <br /> <br /> A great movie! If you have not seen it yet, look at it!
