I saw Asterix and Obelix in Operation Cleopatra, which was my first exposure to the live action version of classic comics. As in the comic, the whole movie is full of jokes based on puns, anachronistic jokes and slapstick jokes that rarely fall ill. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use a potion of strength to fight the Roman legions in their native. Gaul. Here they end up in Egypt helping a friend build Caesar's palace (yes, it's insignificant) in three months to prove that the Egyptians are as good as the Romans. <br /> <br /> The reason I learned this was because Monica Belluci is Cleopatra. She is good, but paper is little more than a cameo. However, even though he's rarely in the movie, I did not care, since he's so smart and the jokes so funny I was in hysteria. I loved. I liked it so much that I can not understand why movies have never been released in the United States. <br /> <br /> The import DVD has the movie in English, which is pretty good, especially if you consider that. When you see it in the longer French version, the word games (and, therefore, the jokes) are not always obvious, as they are auditory, so if you read the names wrong, the jokes are lost. Most of the jokes between the full French version and the shorter English dub appear to be exactly the same, although some have been changed sometimes for good and other times for the worse. Personally I will continue with the dubbing when I see this again, since it is easier to catch the jokes and enjoy the humor. <br /> <br /> You really want to see this if you like word games and low brow. But intelligent humor is a great comedy.
