The film begins with the promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two guys have fewer scenes together. This reduces the pace considerably. Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his first scenes. When he stays behind in the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he passes from one man to another asking for help and is repeatedly rejected, the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a child's birthday party through a fence is another moving moment. As another critic mentioned, I was also worried that the big dog would choke on chicken bones! Once Spanky and Buckwheat are in the house of Marshall Valiant, Spanky tends to interact mainly with adults and the chemistry of children is essentially lost. <br /> <br /> The Old South / Huck Finn type configuration does not really do much for the plot, except allowing the children to be outdoors a lot. Ralph Morgan is the most attractive adult, but then the other roles do not really have much substance for them. Louise Beavers achieves some fun moments with a Yankee soldier towards the end. <br /> <br /> The villains are not really enough villains and the lovers are not intense enough. However, I think it's worth seeing if you're an enthusiast of Our Gang, even if it's not for that strange curiosity of the whole piece. I give it seven stars because, although it's not a great movie, it kept me engaged all the time and I was curious about what would happen next.
