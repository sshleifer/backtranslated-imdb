You could get into the heart of the movie and say how it could not happen, or how the main character could just go into the offices and start using computers, etc. without someone noticing and really choosing the movie in pieces ... or you could just sit down with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the acting. Personally, I prefer the latter, live the real life and see the news with all its sadness and sadness, so I would prefer to entertain myself with my films and see the bad guys get their just rewards. Do not take it too seriously and you can enjoy this movie.
