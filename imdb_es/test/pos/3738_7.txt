Eichard Gere and Diane Lane come back in another story of romantic love. They are an excellent team, but somehow this film will not be among the best, <br /> <br /> The director George Wolfe, with a screenplay by Ann Peacock and John Romanao, for the novel by Nicholas Sparks, makes a great work. This is another story of 2 strangers who know each other and fall in love, then continue on their way, then when they are about to meet again and start a life together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER but not really. The tragedy happens, one of them dies. <br /> <br /> How many times have we seen it? <br /> <br /> Those who have never seen the farmers in this way hope they like it more than me. This story has every clich√© there is. <br /> <br /> The only reason why this has the qualifications that I will give you. It is due to good performance and excellent production. The cast, in addition to our 2 stars, includes Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn. all give very good performances and do the best with the material that was given <br /> <br /> There is a good sequence of storms, but it is not over, the sex scenes are well done, without nudity and almost no faults language, <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 82 points out of 100 IMDb 7 out of 10
