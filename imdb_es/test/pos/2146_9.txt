'Heaven's Gate' is not a masterpiece, which apparently was what it needed to be in the first release to justify its great cost and, most importantly, the uncomfortable and continuing dependence of Hollywood on the Auteur film model. However, 'Heaven's Gate', which is now finally seen on DVD in a 229 minute cut, is an excellent movie. It's a lethargic touch in the rhythm. But at least it's rhythm. Apart from the construction incompetence that many movies make today, there have been many films that, deliberately in their form, have been severely damaged by being hacked without worrying about the rhythm, so the films become confused and formless . Beyond this, the criticisms directed to the film have become quite retrospective. Whether the good guys and the bad guys are too obvious for a serious movie, and yes, Sam Waterston's mustache-skinned villain is a comic-opera (and not like Bill The Butcher of 'Gangs of New York'), and Yes, the townspeople seem a touch 'Fiddler On The Roof' at times, and then a dozen serious films made since then, including 'Titanic' and the 'Cold Mountain' without grace (which has certain similarities and is a remarkable The failure in convincing qualities compared to this film can be punished for exactly the same reason. <br /> <br /> Also despite the accusations, the film has a plot, a well-rehearsed plot in that. bows to 'epic' quality in a standard way, by providing Titan heroes, subplot rafts and confusion, experience storytelling more like smaller, more modest films, through moments of carefully captured character interaction two and explosions of community action in the form of a parade with good texture, as with the opening at Harvard and, more especially, the wonderful scene. where the people of Johnson County, following the leadership of a brilliant physical violinist, hold a celebration on skates. <br /> <br /> 'The Deer Hunter' was a critical and commercial success, but abandoned the mosaic inspired by the first half. as an accumulation of details, and I think in a way similar to the criticism of Robert Penn Warren's novel 'All the King's Men' and his Jacobean acrobatics dictionary, if Cimino had not had such a strong knowledge of the conventions of The epics of Hollywood, could have made a rare work of special art based on honest viewing of people within their environment. In contrast, 'Heaven's Gate' manages to twist its narrative impulse and its tension upward in a slowly expanding arc, until the end explodes, without abandoning the focus of the mosaic. <br /> <br /> The central romantic triangle, for example, resists standard inflections; James Averill (Kris Kristofferson), a decent man, intelligent but psychically defeated, competes with a young armed Nate Champion (Christopher Walken), a hot man but with identity problems, by the hand of a young Madame, Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert ). there is no shy change of opinion, no slap in the face, recriminations or typical moments of sadness, but rather a sad and distant decision on the part of Ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because she is ready to make a commitment She emerges as the true hero of the film (Huppert's performance, although initially uncomfortable, is really excellent, balancing the emotional touch with a hard spirit), trying first to rescue Nate and then reunite the immigrant resistance group in a entrepreneurial defense Subsequently, Averill is stung to action when friends die. In fact, in the process of overcoming so many traps of cliche and style, 'Heaven's Gate' successfully and voluntarily launches the defeat of defeated alien heroes, a note of grace from so many Westerners of the 70s and portrays an eventual, vigorous and spirited meeting of the heroes To a victory committed but still enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The social conflict of so many Westerners of the 70s finally hardens into a full-fledged war; where capital attempts a crushing final victory over the evildoers who stand in their way, they suddenly find a massive and powerful popular army, led by the man who played the completely destroyed Billy the Kid a decade earlier. This is what led to the film being described as the first Western Marxist, but in reality it simply deflowers a theme of the genre that existed long before the 1960s. Works of the old school as varied and classic as "The Westerner" by William Wyler, and even "Shane", tell very similar stories. It is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunman has been replaced by the romantic myth of popular revolt. In a spectacular end, exciting, but realistic and, therefore, chaotic, the camper encampment of the Ranchers is attacked, surrounded by clouds of dust sprinkled by fallen horses, twisted bodies and shots. Averill finally puts his classic education to work by stealing a Roman trick and taking the Cattle Rangers to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the Cavalry (another clearly seditious touch, but surely not so offensive after the implacable description of 'Little' Big Man 'Native American Massacre). Indeed, it is difficult to think of a more heroically American view of grassroots resistance. The only real dead center of the film is an unnecessary coda indicating the final relapse of Averill, a rather potted tragedy. <br /> <br /> Despite certain flaws and a slow central section, 'Heaven's Gate' is a supreme work, a true attempt to create a contemporary western and a new type of epic. If one still has to join the chorus that considers Cimino absurd in their overall behavior and expense, it is regrettable. When, today, failures such as 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash' and 'K-19 - The Widowmaker' see how almost one hundred million dollars sink in the drain, and there is still a label of infamy in this movie, one ponders what exactly is his severe death meant. The attempt to original style, indecent sexuality, the sense of detail so difficult to achieve, the impressive rigor of the making of films and what is being filmed, throw in contrast what is sorely lacking as a contemporary product of Hollywood.
