Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a rich woman discovers that her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). She does not know what to do and her friends Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jad Pinkett Smith) try to help. <br /> <br /> Well, there was no reason. To remake the film of 1939. It is a true classic and does not need to be updated and redone. Naturally, it was done. This has received some of the worst criticism I've seen in a movie. I love the original and I've seen it MANY times; I constantly compared it with that. Now, this is not a classic, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br /> ** LITTLE SPOILERS !!! ** First the bad: the story is old and updated (badly). Seriously, a man who cheats on his wife is nothing surprising today. Meg Ryan (a wonderful actress) is pretty terrible here. His face seems unable to change expression! I could not believe how bad some of his scenes came. Eva Mendes is also bad, but it's not entirely her fault. His paper is badly written and he has to compete with Joan Crawford from the original. The character of Smith (a tough lesbian) is shattered in an operating theater. It's funny ... but it's showing that a strong woman is torn apart when faced with an emergency. In addition, the script inserts some clumsy passages where Ryan talks to his daughter about being himself. In those moments it seems more like a movie for life than anything else. <br /> <br /> Now, this film retains the decision of the originals of NEVER show a man on the screen. This film is about and for women: men are not necessary (BTW, I'm a man). Bening is as good as Fowler: whenever he's on the screen, the movie takes a big leap. In addition, Smith is simply wonderful: he does not exaggerate (or minimize) his lesbian character too much. Messing is also good, but she is not in this much. Bette Midler is simply hysterical in a small role and Cloris Leachman takes out the role of nothing from a housekeeper. The direction is also good, especially during a fashion show sequence. I heard that director Diane English supposedly had a lot of trouble directing her first full length movie, but it does not appear in the final product. There are also some intelligent references to the original (mostly certain lines) that were inserted without problems. <br /> <br /> I saw him in an audience full of women (there were some men but not many) and I loved it. The film ends in an operating theater sequence that had everyone howling. So, this was not necessary, but it's not the disaster that people say it is. Also, people say that we do not need a movie with all the women. Well, why not? I see a lot of movies with all the guys in the cast and no one complains about that! Ignore the complaints and bad reviews and look at this. With Ryan performing better, I could have given him an 8 or 9, but as it is, I can only give him a 7.
