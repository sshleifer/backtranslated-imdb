That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I am as much of Germany as of movies. <br /> <br /> That guy is over 50 years old and until now he almost only played in mediocre television series, and even there he did not play the main parts. Obviously nobody realized, what he is capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he had an opportunity to change that, and, let's put it this way, it was a bingo! It is living proof of what a great Tarrantino launcher is. <br /> <br /> By the way: I think it's a great privilege to see the film as a German: to be able to understand everything. And the dialogue in German is written almost as well as English. <br /> <br /> Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back.
