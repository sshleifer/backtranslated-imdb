Having worked professionally with young girls in the race, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found that a friend had not borrowed his videotape. Here are classic themes: the coming of age, the distance between mother and daughter, the limited options of the disadvantaged, who is the good Samaritan, the tragedy is in each life and in the many layers or relationships. The flashbacks are significant (when Alice acquires a weapon, we know she is familiar with how to use it) and it does not end in a clich√©. The cast really "sells" their papers. It's adult material and the audio is a little too grainy. Leave it for 15 minutes to attract you.
