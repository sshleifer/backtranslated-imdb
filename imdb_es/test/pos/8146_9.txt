When they told me about this movie, I was not very happy to see it, although for the final credits, it turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is pretty graphic (man-to-man scenes, you do not see everything) it would not be a gay-themed movie if it had not ... <br /> <br /> the movie He is very happy and has some humor. Very funny parts. I highly recommend this movie, about 3 quarters through which you really feel the main characters, and I think this brings together all the members of the movie. <br /> <br /> once again, very well organized ... plus the cute Mormon.
