I recently had the pleasure of seeing this film loaded with emotion by the Director Mani Ratnam at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. I have given my highest honor to the Film Festival in this show. Make sure you do not miss the opportunity to experience this cinematic jewel ... but advance: this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as homo sapiens! A 10!
