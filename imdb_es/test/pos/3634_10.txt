I rented this movie, but I was not sure what to expect from it. I was very happy to discover that it is the best Brazilian movie I have ever seen. The story is quite strange and simple, and above all, extremely original. We have Antonio, a young man who lives in Nordestina, a city in the middle of nowhere in northeastern Brazil, and who is deeply in love with Karina. The main conflict between the two is that, while Antonio loves his small town and does not want to leave it, Karina wants to see the world and resents the place. As proof of his love for her, he decides to go out himself and bring him the world. It will put Nordestina on the map, as he says. And the way he does it is incredible. This is a good movie; It may be a bit stagy for some people due to their different editing work, but I think that is also what improves the story. It's just fun, and it makes you feel good.
