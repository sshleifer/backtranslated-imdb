Despite its ultra low budget, "Sorte Nula" is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. And I must say, a well-deserved success. What I like most about "Sorte Nula" is the intricate detail that Fernando Fragata was to keep you interested in what is happening and what will happen next. It is very detailed and extraordinarily advanced for a seemingly simple thriller of a love story that has gone awry. What is even more fun and ironic about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation, none of them knows the whole story and is left to their own assumptions making "Sorte Nula" outperform the rest. Definitely, this is not a movie where you want to go to the bathroom, because you will definitely miss something important. I think one of the main attributes of the movie should be the setting it establishes. It's scary but hilarious at the same time. I read somewhere that someone quoted this movie saying: "... it was like watching Hitchcock ..." and I could not agree more! I love movies like that, where you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING to fully understand what is happening. 9/10
