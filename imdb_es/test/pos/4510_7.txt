In the 1970s in Afghanistan, the boy Pushtun Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi) and the boy Hazara Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), who is his loyal friend and son of his servant Hazara Ali (Nabi Tanha), are brought up together in the Amir's father's house. Play and ride in the streets of a quiet Kabul. Amir feels that his wise and good father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi) blames him for the death of his mother in childbirth, and also that his father loves him and prefers Hassam. In return, Amir has great respect for his father's best friend, Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), who supports his intention to become a writer. After Amir wins a kitting contest, Hassam runs to bring a kite to Amir, but the brutal Assef (Elham Ehsas) hits and rapes him in an empty street to protect Amir's kite; the coward Amir witnesses the assault but does not help the loyal Hassam. The day after his birthday party, Amir hides his new watch in Hassam's bed to frame the boy as a thief and force his father to dismiss Ali, freeing his conscience to remember his cowardice and betrayal. In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escape to Pakistan. In 1988, they have a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduates from a public university for the pride and joy of Baba. Later, Amir meets his compatriot Soraya (Atossa Leoni) and they get married. In 2000, after the death of Baba, Amir is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from the terminal Rahim Khan, who reveals secrets about his family, forcing Amir to return to Peshawar, in Pakistan, on a trip of redemption. <Br /> <br /> I'm not familiar with Afghan culture and I did not read this novel despite my daughter's recommendation, and yesterday I decided to watch this movie on DVD. I found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and redemption, with a brief description of the recent history of Afghanistan, from a peaceful period in the 70s to our days with the Taliban. The actors and actresses have great performances, giving credibility to the realistic story. The arid places in China remember the images we see on television in Afghanistan. In the end, I found "The Kite Runner" a good movie. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ca√ßador de Pipa" ("The Kite Chaser")
