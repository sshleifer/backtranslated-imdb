I recently saw a Blurred screening test, and I'm surprised to say that it was actually pretty good. It's a movie about different groups of children, your mountain addicts, your rich snobs, your typical teenage couple, plus two geek boys and a hippie baby. Together, but as separate stories, each group travels to Gold Coast for Schoolies Week. Australia has never had any problem writing comedies and Australia is never short or the actors can play the comedy with subtlety and with the right amount of extravagance. The cast is full of Australian star actors with enormous talent and a lot of presence on the screen. Keep your eyes on Craig Horner, a young graduate, who has lost his optimism for a week-long party at his friends' shenanigans. Travis Cotten and Mark Priestly, who successfully tackle a complicated physical comedy as two disillusioned bogans and Jessica Gower as a cute but confused teenager distressed by love. Veronika Sywak makes her film debut as a dream girl for teenagers, and remains among the most experienced artists. Beware of Matthew Newton, cleverly chosen as a shabby limousine driver.
