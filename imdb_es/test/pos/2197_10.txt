I own this video, as well as the concert version of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book, like Angela Lansbury and the composer, Stephen Sondheim. This musical is operative in its scope and shows a lot of ingenuity in the composition. I certainly hope that this VHS is available on DVD! Hearn's performance is terribly friendly. The only annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of Joanna. I think this performance was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, rather than on a Broadway stage and I'm not sure the minimalist ensemble was used in New York, as it was in this production. But I found that the scaffolding dragged across the stage was quite effective in "portraying" the streets of London. I recommend this movie.
