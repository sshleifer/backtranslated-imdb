A pity, nobody seems to know this little work of suspense. Where larger budget films fail, "Terminal Option" offers many emotions, shocks and bloody violence. A small gem seen that deserves to be searched at your local video store. That anonymous guy below is absolutely right, when he says, you'll never trust hospitals again ... IT'S so effective! The good ending is not really a turn either, but it does not end as you thought it would. Yes, that's Ellen Barkin in an early role ...
