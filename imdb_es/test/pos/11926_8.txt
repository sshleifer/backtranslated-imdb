I rarely support films about intelligent teenagers who have problems with authority, but "Toy Soldiers" has grown in me with repeated presentations. This is so much a movie about Billy Tepper that he grew up and became an adult like anything else, and I credit Sean Astin and writer / director Daniel Petrie Jr. for not doing much of that, but let's leave it. move and approach you. The camaraderie of Tepper's friends, his grief over Joey's death and his joy for his survival, are all truly touching. And, I have to admit, I get some patriotic joy (and maybe something reptilian) when the men of the United States Army finally move and kick with the right foot to a group of narcoterrorists. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! And the heroic score of Robert Folk is the icing on the cake. I'm sure you could find hundreds of reasons not to like the "Toy Soldiers", but as long as we do not take it seriously, I do not see the need. This is one of the most entertaining "bad" movies of my pantheon.
