The avoidance of clich√©s is one of the main achievements of this film. When do you hear a vague outline of the story? Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona? You predict a collection of euro stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it is a well-judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, who tries to make sense of human relationships. There are some minor roles observed in an excellent way (the arrogant French neurologist, the innocuously irrepressible brother of the English girl, the desolate mother of Xavier) and some good visual humor, especially in the initial scenes that make fun of the bureaucratic complexity of the procedure of request. So, what does Xavier learn about relationships? Nothing positive. Instead of a conventionally happy ending, there is an unfortunately portentous ending about "Identity"? Xavier has become 'all the friends he made. However, this very nice movie deserves its great success. I saw him in Luxembourg with a mixed European audience, who enjoyed it greatly and even applauded at the end.
