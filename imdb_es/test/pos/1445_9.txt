Otto Preminger was one of the great nonconformist filmmakers. Like John Huston, he was a character in one of his own films, like Mr. Huston, a great amateur who slipped in and out of random acting, but the final product of his work was Undoubtedly his own With some exceptions, movies are now made by corporations, not by individuals, and as a result are generally highly polished "packs", a product in the same way that a golf ball, a can of dog food or a car is a The participation of human beings in the process is almost incidental. Such is the appetite for the product that there seems to be no end to the line of well-finished films, brilliant, superficially entertaining but, ultimately, empty that flood the innumerable TV channels and movies. Outlets There is no time for a man like Mr. Preminger to stay a little apart from the torrent of "product" and create a personal work of art. Of course, there has always been the spirit of "Art for art: money for the love of Christ" in the making of films, but now "Ars Gratia Artis" has been consigned to the cutting room of history. Today, Otto Preminger would be lucky enough to get a job in delivering pizzas in Hollywood. Half a century ago, after having made the enormously influential "Laura", "Where the sidewalk ends" and "The moon is blue", he set out to film the controversial novel by Nelson Algren "The man with the golden arm" in his eccentric and individualist. Instead of taking his camera to the street, he stayed in the studio and used stylized almost expressionist games, a peculiar casting (Mr. Frank Sinatra, thanks to his success in "From here to eternity", the young, inexperienced but incredibly beautiful Miss Kim Novak and Mr. Arnold Stang, a man whose rarities were behind her own heart, and a remarkable stage by Elmer Bernstein, highlighting the music of the West Coast jazz musicians.An Otto Preminger film always It was a complete experience, to be considered as a whole instead of dividing it into acting, direction, photography ... What appeared on the screen was the vision of Preminger, its creation and its interpretation of Algren's novel, not a story. From Algren's novel, any of the twenty competing Hollywood hacks could have produced that.From the first sequence of hi-hat cymbals that accompanies the iconic Saul Bass title sequence, we We have in Preminger's version of what is now called "La Vida", actually a murky area occupied by scammers, drug addicts, policemen, drug traffickers, stone punters. Jazz musicians, their women and their friends. The lines are blurred in "The Life", and the dog eats the dog there. The inhabitants turn around like sharks, looking for a sign of weakness to be exploited. Frank Machine (Mr. Sinatra), a professional letter merchant, former drug addict and aspiring jazz drummer is a born victim. When things get difficult, go back to the Needle. Although it leaves the habit cold in Turkey, there is absolutely no guarantee that it will not go ahead on the line. Mr. Sinatra's description of an addict in the midst of abstinence has divided the critics, but the fact is that even fifty years later, most of us have probably never seen anything like this in real life, so we do not know how accurate is the situation. The image is. When I saw the film for the first time in the late 50's, I was very impressed to see it recently on video, so it seems, to say the least, hammy. Maybe he is a victim of his own success, since many actors "do it" later. The cold turkey, over the years, took its performance and refined it a bit. Arnold Stang is outstanding as Sparrow, the friend of Machine, a performance that only exceeded in "It's a crazy world, crazy, crazy." Try to see it on the big screen and see it as the cinematic vision of a true author, a giant among the Pygmies of today: Otto Preminger.
