I must confess that I was surprised at how good this movie was when I first saw it. I had planned to see him in theaters during the summer, but I discovered in an unpleasant way that he had already left. Therefore, I expected it to be removed from theaters because it was bad. So, today, I rented it, I saw it and I really enjoyed it. The speed with which the events occurred was questionable, it could have been a little longer. I discovered that he was very loyal to the book, however, he omitted some crucial parts: the real name of Mullet Finger, etc. I felt that if I had not read the book I would not have really understood what was happening. The performance was quite good, another thing I expected to be poor, however, the police, I regret not being able to remember the name of the actor, could have done a little better. In general, I thought it was a very entertaining film and I would recommend it to all audiences.
