I decided that I needed to extend my opinion for my favorite movie of all time. Unlike other war films that focus on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer on a psychological journey of the head. Pure surrealism makes the body feel uncomfortable, but you can not take your eyes off it. Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now slowly descends its protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen) to madness, most likely in the same way that Kurtz plunged into madness. The production of this film is notorious for the delays provided by the monsoon season and by Brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines on reference cards). There is a documentary called Apocalypse Now: a filmmaker Apocalypse that shows the hell that everyone went through when doing this. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any movie. As the sheet of helicopters is heard in slow motion and the napalm is dropped in the trees, you can hear the song "The End" by The Doors. The next shot is Willard in his bed with the fan on, so the noise of the helicopter matches the fan. We are informed that he does special missions for the military, mainly assassinations. When he is given his next mission, he is baffled. "Accusing a man for murder here is like giving a fine for speed in the Indy 500." The man who has to kill was a respected colonel who has gone mad and has been isolated along with the people of the tribes. Kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must stop me. However, Willard does not go alone. They take him on a ship with several soldiers and they find several battles. On the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore "Hoorah" about the war. Willard thinks that if Kilgore is so crazy, how could it be Kurtz? There are many scenes portraying Willards sinking into madness: the attack of the tiger, the killing of innocent Vietnamese, the endless rain, the piled up corpses and the death of the members of his crew. When he arrives at Kurtz's compound, he is greeted by the townspeople and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of killing Kurtz immediately, Willard starts talking to him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand, wants to die. He is tired of war and wants to fall as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in unison, a buffalo is slaughtered with several machetes by the people. Once they realize that their leader has been killed, instead of killing Willard, they hail him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography here is absolutely impressive. The colors are free of grain, something that is rare in old movies. I can see it in silence and admire the beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> The set of actors is fantastic, and everyone interprets their role well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he clarifies his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten by war. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack and the score are disturbing, and provide the setting for the film. I wonder what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits are released. There have been many parodies of this movie, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name in a police program behaves like an idiot: "Your character provides comic relief for the program, as Um, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. " Those who have seen the film know why this is hilarious.
