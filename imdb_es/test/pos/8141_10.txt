My friend took me to a screening of this movie in Hollywood and it was amazing! It is a black cinema with an incredible performance, a great script, good music, everything was very well done and entertaining. I do not know if it will be released in theaters, but this would be a great dating movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it in Blockbuster. This is the kind of movie I love, low budget but big in style and imagination. I hope that Alexandra Holden has more important parts like the one she has in this one, she is fantastic.
