I saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when I was on HBO and I loved it. It was so much fun that I've seen it too many times to tell. I love the Stork brothers and the pitiful, ugly dog, Bosco! My favorite quote from the movie is: "It's so ugly I should go to sleep." I also loved it when the little sister hits the girls on the back and their faces stay that way. I also love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this movie. They were great. This movie brings back memories of my college days when I first saw it. I rented the movie countless times and saw it again and again. My roommate at the university and I did not get tired. Who could not love this crazy movie ?! I want to buy a copy on DVD, does anyone know where I can get it?
