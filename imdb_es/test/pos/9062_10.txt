Peculiar, vulnerable, raw, honest and a pleasure to see. I'm not here to give a summary or synopsis of the movie. I just want to congratulate this little movie with the GRAND GRAN CORAZÓN. I take my hat off to the filmmaker and he has an excellent cast. If you want to know what happens in the movie ... then go see it. Michael Parness, writer / director, has handled a very sensitive and emotional topic, Suicide, with great compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a great race ahead for Mr. Parness. This movie works. From the scandalous opening sequence to the tender and honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with each movie, we must suspend disbelief, but with MAX AND GRACE I found that it transported me easily and completely convinced me with its "surreal moments". I wish they had pushed some of those moments even more. Mr. Parness has "taken out" some wonderful performances from this already talented cast. For example, the performance of Guillermo Díaz as a patient in the asylum was hysterical and moving. Colossus Ralf Moeller, former Mr. Olympiad, as a terrified patient ... perfect. I can go on and on ... This independent feature has the power of a Hollywood big-budget movie, however, you forget the STARS on the screen as you flow with this beautifully written story. The real star here is the brilliant script. I hope to see more of writer / director Michael Parness.
