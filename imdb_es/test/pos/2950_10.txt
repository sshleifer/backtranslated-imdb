This movie took me by surprise. I make it a habit to find out as little as possible about the movies before attending because the advances and reviews provide one spoiler after another. All I knew when I entered the theater was that it was a documentary about a married couple and that the IMDb readers gave it a 7.8, the users of Rotten Tomatoes rated it with 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2. In any case, DO NOT ENTER this little gem. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents "for posterity" and at the beginning of the film they invite us to the necessary interviews with their parents, Mother Mina. , and less than next dad, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker would take us (Mike and Mina's son, Doug). In fact, I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this! <br /> <br /> Life takes twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the path. It is difficult to verbalize how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. Absolutely fascinating from start to finish and it really is a must see even if you're not a fan of the documentary genre. This movie will make you think about your own life and could even evoke memories that you thought were forgotten. "51 Birch Street" is one of those rare cinematic experiences that make a deep impression and never leave you. The best news of all is that HBO participated in the production, so, instead of playing for a limited audience of art, eventually, millions of people will have the opportunity to see this incredible work. BRAVO!!!!!!!!
