I have never read the book, but I had always heard good things about it. So when the movie came out I considered going to see it, but I never did. Now it has been released on DVD and I thought about renting for a few weeks. Last night I finally picked it up. I am very happy that I did it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amazing in this movie. The scenery, etc., made you feel like you were in Kabul. The performance was very good, although I am sure that some of the emotions were lost in the translation. And the story itself was good, pure and uplifting. Yes, the story was very sad, but at the same time edifying. <br /> <br /> And I'll be honest, like a white American ... it made me look aside from Kabul and Afghanistan that I never imagine in myself. I care when I think about it. He showed me an Afghanistan to the Taliban. He showed me a place that was beautiful. He showed me a place with good-hearted people. Community that was like a family, apart from a few thugs. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. It is one of the best I have seen in my life.
