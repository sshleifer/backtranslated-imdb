This is definitely a good movie unlike what other people are saying. Peline and I have seen the 3x movie and the ending is corny, but that's part of the package ... experimenting with death is the same as trying to challenge it, so the movie is great. For those who want to see a classic Kevin Bacon movie, see this please. Take care of yourself from Istanbul. We'll write 10 lines if you really want us 2, but we think it's a waste of time, bye. The rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we write it to meet the 10-line requirement (which is crazy), but we are kind people and, therefore, we will adapt to the rules established for us. So people see this movie not because we write 10 lines, but because it's good. And by the way we wrote 12 lines!
