Love Jones is one of the best movies I've experienced. <br /> <br /> The main element that stands out is the fact that it is very well managed. I have studied this film in its entirety: with watching movies more than once, certain things occur to you in a subconscious way: the direction of this film, as well as the writing, is elegant, current and artistic. I'm in love with the address. The scene in which Larenz Tate and Nia Long travel by motorcycle north of Chicago at night is amazing. The director of this film, deserved for his great work. <br /> <br /> Love Jones is an elegant and sexy movie. Highlight the fact that we can be people who love, who have flaws, who love to live, learn and simply be us without exaggeration. Being our natural being. <br /> <br /> The poetry is wonderful, but the story line, the dialogue and the scenes really make this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves to be seen. It is a great movie for lovers and friends to sit and watch, or, the desperate romantic (like me) to sit and enjoy only Friday or Saturday night. Any day of the week where peace, solitude and a bit of entertainment are needed, Love Jones is what I recommend.
