True love, I really enjoyed and LOVE this movie. It was fun, fun and inspiring. I just saw it on DVD. How I missed this is a winner! I mean, Flex was "That guy." I wanted to marry him. This was the first time I saw him as a direct leader and he succeeds. I thought Tangi Miller was the best of all time and I was also Felicity's head. An intrepid woman who only fears her Nana. Thank you for giving women the range of colors in your work and it looks great! Tasha Smith was an explosion! Aloma Wright had no price like Nana. This beautiful romantic comedy is "A Must See". Oh, and the newcomer Marcus Patrick is worth it, the surprise ladies ... True love. Karen
