I am beginning to explore the wonderful world of Monsieur Ozon. I have only seen 4 movies so far, and with the last one in line I realized that all of them were, in fact, lonely women and their actions. It is not a single female character not lonely in 12, and all bring a strong impact of the environment. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the only one (out of four) in which this impact is for the better. <br /> <br /> The gay theme is an almost standard part of the background of Ozon's films, so it does not capture the accent (although the look of the characters might be). Be attentive to feelings, not to your objects. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant and fleeting, really like a summer romance, and being a relaxation for thought and mind, it provides some nourishment for the soul.
