Warner Brothers significantly manipulated US history in "They Died With They Boots On," director Raoul Walsh's first-class western, "a somewhat inaccurate but totally exciting biography of cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer." The film tells Custer from the moment he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him in the Little Big Horn.This is one of the distinctive roles of Errol Flynn and one of the best epics of Raoul Walsh.Walsh and Flynn came together quite often Afterwards, and "They Died With They Boots On" reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time.They appeared as a couple in seven previous films.This black and white 140-minute oater is brilliant with dynamic action sequences , comic romantic scenes and severe dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries.One of the notorious errors involves Colonel Philip Sh Eridan, who appears as the commander at West Point before the Civil War. In fact, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point. In fact, the commander was Robert E. Lee, as the previous Flynn movie "Santa Fe Trail" showed. Another historical lapse concerns Lieutenant-General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the commander of Union troops during the Civil War. Warner Brothers introduced Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Custer did not drink or smoke. However, these, as well as other historical errors, do not detract from a truly splendid film. <br /> <br /> "They Died With Their Boots On" opens when Custer enters the West Point Military Academy in an elegant evening dress with an African-American man carrying his luggage and taking care of his dogs. After the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has become an honor guard for a future commoner instead of a high-ranking foreign general, the sergeant delivers to Custer a cadet of rank Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy from "City for Conquest") to take charge of him. Sharp plays a practical role in Custer by installing it in the headquarters of Major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridges of "Task Force") that quickly executes Custer. Naturally, the volatile Custer attacks Sharp in a public fight. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel of "The Sons of Katie Elder") is prepared to dismiss Custer of West Point for improper conduct. It turns out that Sheridan can not expel Custer because Custer has not registered. Once enrolled, Custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation promptly to fight and accumulate demerits in abundance. When the American Civil War breaks out, the West Point cadets graduate and have not completed their education and throw them into combat. One of the last cadets who went to war is Custer. Avid, as he wants to get into the fight, Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland from "Santa Fe Trail"), and pledge each other, despite Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart of "Carousel") that detests Custer's view. It seems that Bacon met Custer in a room and insulted one of Custer's friends and our hero rebuked Bacon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in Washington, Custer is desperately looking for a transfer to a regiment, but Commander Taipe has it. cooling your heels. Custer befriends Lieutenant General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet of "The Maltese Falcon") and they share an appetite for creamy Bermuda onions that become one of Custer's hallmarks. Scott not only makes sure that Taipe assigns Custer to the Second Cavalry, but Custer also appropriates Taipe's horse to reach his command. During the Battle of Bull Run, on July 21, 1861, Custer disobeys Sharp's orders, strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge for the infantry to cross. Wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, Custer receives a medal instead of a court martial. When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, Scott is surprised at the possibility that the South can succeed. When a brigadier general can not be found, Scott encourages Taipe to promote the first available officer. A mistake is made and Custer is promoted. Incredulous at first, Custer embraces the moment and breaks Stuart's advance. After the war, Custer stops and begins to fill up with the children in the local salons. Sharp appears as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to recruit Custer to be the president of their railroad so they can raise funds. Finally, Libby intercedes on her behalf with General Sheridan, who was in charge of the army, and puts him back in active service as commander of the Seventh Cavalry. When he takes command, Custer finds the seventh cavalry as a group of drunks and is not surprised that Sharp orders liquor from the fort. Meanwhile, Custer has his first race with Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn from "The Guns of Navarone") and takes him into custody. Of course, Crazy Horse escapes, becomes the opponent of Custer, and fight. <br /> <br /> Once Custer has stifled Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharp and Taipe as government agents conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the Sioux and other Indian nations. They also make sure that Custer is accused of beating Taipe in a bar fight. On his way to Washington, Custer discovers the perfidy of Sharp and Taipe, who have staggered a golden blow in the sacred Black Hills. The settlers burst in and the Indians beat the war. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men in the Little Big Horn in a confrontation against 6000 red skins. The "Stagecoach" sign Bert Glennon captures both the grain and the glory. The long shot of the seventh cavalry that leaves the fort at sunrise is spectacular. As an additional premonition of Custer's imminent demise, Libby faints after she leaves her rooms to go to Little Big Horn. "They died with their boots on" benefits from a Max Steiner score that incorporates the melody of the "Gary Owen" regiment.
