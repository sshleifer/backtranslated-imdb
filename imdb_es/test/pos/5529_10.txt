Three bizarre couples, all SIX OF A CLASS, get tangled up in a crazy search for stolen bank loot. <br /> <br /> This is a fun and hilarious comedy, with the six stars: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, WC Fields. & Alison Skipworth, George Burns and Gracie Allen, all enthusiastically committed to doing what they did best: laughing. <br /> <br /> Ruggles & Boland make another of their film appearances as husband and wife, this time more loving than usual. They were a perfect team: she, the shrill lioness, he the nervous rabbit, and they dominate most of the screen time here. From start to finish, they are a delight. <br /> <br /> Burns & Allen continue the pattern that originated in Vaudeville, perfected themselves on the radio and eventually reached television, with George, the straight and perpetual man, and Gracie, the eternal fool. Sometimes, in the movie, it tends to exaggerate a bit, but it's hard not to like it. His heart was obviously made of solid gold. <br /> <br /> While Skipworth receives a fairly brief response, only fragments of his formidable personality are detached: Fields is in his element as the sheriff of Nuggetville, Nevada. Whether it's explaining how he got the nickname "Honest John" or hanging around at night looking for the lost moola, it's never less than wonderful. Best of all, it performs its complete classic pool routine, preserving it forever for a grateful posterity. Finally, he executes what is almost miraculous: he gets Gracie to shut up. <br /> <br /> Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to rush the main players to another comedy. Only the fields delayed. I felt that now I had reached the point where I no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. Finally, the studio agreed and began the preparation of the first solo film by Fields, "TELLING ME ME" (1934).
