An amazingly heartbreaking account of the plight of two soldiers in World War II. In a freezing context, not only the fight against the Nazis and the traitors in Belarus, but the harsh natural elements, this film tells the story of two soldiers of polarized morality, one of whom survives, but finds it impossible to deal with their own circumstances and one that dies, having done everything that can be done in the face of intimidation and everything possible to break the spirit, in fact, the "ascendant" of the title. A film that should be seen by everyone, in particular by the phenomenal representations of the main characters, and the tremors (imprisonment and hanging scenes, in particular, must be seen absolutely).
