I was very excited to see a documentary about one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato has dabbled in everything from Horror, post-apocalyptic to hardcore porn. He has played the genius a couple of times with films like Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals. This documentary is an extensive and informative guide to D'Amato's films. He is interviewed at all times with English subtitles at the bottom of the screen. The excerpts from his films are narrated by a narrator (with English subtitles). The documentary proved to be very interesting when he analyzed often censored "Emmanuelle In America". Here D'amato explains the false scenes of "tobacco" in detail and recalls some funny stories. In fact, old Joe is very warm and funny, always with a smile and smoking a cigarette. The only disappointing aspect of this documentary is that he spends little time in D'amato's horror films such as Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buio Omega. He spends too much time in erotic cinema and barely touches post-apocalyptic films. But, I can not complain. It is wonderful to see D'amato get the respect he deserves. Highly recommended for fans of D'amato. May he rest in peace.
