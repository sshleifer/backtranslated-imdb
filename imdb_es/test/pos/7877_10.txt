Oh, man, this movie is amazing, it's very good, it's a story about a man who does not accept blacks so much, who sits in a bar drinking in his night and talks about hippies who are against the war , and how blacks and hippies do not deserve to receive any welfare check. This movie is very realistic, because it portrays a "Joe" guy who represented many guys at the time, and now too. The story goes like this: Joe is in a bar and rubs shoulders with a rich man who accidentally killed his daughter's hippie boyfriend. And this rich man goes to the bar to rethink what he has just done, and while he is doing it, "Joe" is in the bar ranting about the hippies and the people who are against the war. The rich man accidentally tells Joe that he killed a hippie; and, obviously, Joe applauds the rich man, because Joe hates hippies, he sees an amazing movie to see what happens next. I liked this movie, because I remembered those days in the early 70s, I liked the way the movies were filmed in those days, very good things, it's not like today's movies. Basically, the movie gives you an inside look at the mind of the main character "Joe." I like the theme of the movie ... about the hardworking man, who is bursting his ass trying to make a living.
