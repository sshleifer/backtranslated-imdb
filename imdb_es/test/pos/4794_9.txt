Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was dark for me. My first experience with him was The discreet spell of the bourgeoisie, often considered his best work, with which I felt so frustrated and bored that I finally closed the tape. Similarly, Belle de Jour, which is almost certainly his best known film and, in general, considered one of his many masterpieces, did not interest me too much. I did not hate it like I did with Discrete, but I did not like it. Third, I saw L'Age d'Or. Finally, he had reached somewhere. Fourth, The forgotten, also good. Even so, neither L'Age d'Or nor The Forgotten surprised me. Great movies, but not masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel, and I like him a little more than those other two. He is a priest from Spain now in Mexico who refuses to live in the kind of luxury that most priests live. He wants to be more like Jesus, leading the most docile life possible. He is also willing to forgive everyone for anything, and to suffer without protest. I'm pretty sure Bunuel does not sympathize with the character, and he sees it as quite honest. However, I only assume that because of my knowledge of the director, whose most famous quote is "Thank God, I'm still an atheist", which apparently said in an interview about this same film (I get this information from John Baxter book about Bunuel , if you are interested). The interviewer who pulled those words out of Bunuel's mouth must have been confused about Nazarin. Who was more predisposed to believe in religious conviction, who also knows nothing about Bunuel, could see the priest as a heroic figure. This is especially true if that viewer has his own criticisms of organized religion. The priest may be self-righteous, but he seems to be basically a good man. When you harbor a violent prostitute in your room to protect her (and, presumably, to save her soul), people begin to discover and assume that their relationship is sexual. His superiors assume the same and punish him for it. Later, he suffers even worse punishments from clerics.
