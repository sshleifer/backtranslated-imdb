I remember seeing this series avidly, every Saturday night. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music of Clannad (I still have his album Legend). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed's departure by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I think there were legends of several robins in medieval times. Another thing that I loved was the fact that it was full of young actors, I am sure that Robin and his men would have young people, since all the people did not live so much in those days. Other Robins always seem too old (Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robin's grandfather). The only sad thing was the end, it's a pity that at least they could not have made a special to tie all the loose ends and give a happier ending.
