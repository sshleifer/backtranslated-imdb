This is probably on my list of the 5 funniest movies I've ever seen! He was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was very different! He made fun of Robin Hood, and it was HILARO! I was extremely pleased with how well he put on and how well he acted. In addition to Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Houseguest, this was the most fun movement I've ever seen! I especially love the song; "We are men in tights!" If you have a good sense of humor, you will love this movie.
