This is one of the best and most undervalued movies for teenagers that have been made. <br /> <br /> I saw it grow and it was, and it's one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "Fast times" but only as excellent. <br /> <br /> There is a serious side to this film, as mentioned by other critics, it begins as a comedy and transforms into a drama halfway through. That is the beauty of this and what distinguishes it. You have it all. Humor (not unlike "Fast times"), Drama and a BIG BIG soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Personally I think that all children who are about to enter secondary school should see this, give an idea of ​​the trip. they are about to embark. Cmon, what child watching this, could not you relate to SOMEONE in the movie? However, the fact that it becomes serious at the halfway point is also great and very well done. You do not even see it coming. Definitely a lot of surprises. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> Great, humor hits the knee. (Who could forget the scene? Between Gary and stretcher?). I can still hear it: "Oh, my big strong burrito!" Priceless !! <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes between Gary and Karin are hard to see (particularly the final rough scene). There are so many women like Karen who would have chosen exactly the same as her. Think about it: how many women reject men with hearts of gold (like Gary) for idiots? I know that I have done it, and also many women that I know. This film will inspire discussion and, despite the countless times I have seen it, it still leaves me admired by filmmakers and artists. Everyone will find someone to relate to in this film or what is more likely to be more than a person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music used is simply great (many Cars, u2, many dark songs (now) from the 80s. - A dream of the purists of the 80s.) <br /> <br /> But make no mistake, it's not the music that makes this movie unique, it's the story itself, plain and simple. One of the best of its kind and a classic movie for teenagers.
