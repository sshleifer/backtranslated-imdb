What-ho! This is very good I say very well, old chap. Or should I say "ol bean"? My mastery of British terminology is a bit dusty. Anyway, my biker boots and I got into this screening with no previous viewing experience from Wallace and Gromit. I am happy to say that my boots and I left pleased to have met them. <br /> <br /> Although not as accessible to adults as Toy Story, W & G still manages to be smart enough to provide the adults with a bit of humor that will definitely rise above the heads of children. Young people who are too busy laughing at Were's rabbit burps to have some clue that something is wrong. I strongly suggest that you pay close attention every time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick flashes of puns that you will miss if you do not pay attention. My favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the monster of Loch Ness as "tourist trappus". If you ever know that you say "I can really relate to Kevin Federline," or if you are simply illiterate, you will not only miss these jokes, but you should probably spend your time learning to read. to go to the movies. Consider this as a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect of W & G is its animation in clay. Thanks to the tedious process, it took FIVE YEARS to finish the movie! According to the press releases, there were some days when the optimal goal was simply to achieve 10 seconds of full movie. People, sometimes I find it difficult to find the motivation to finish responding to a handful of emails or add titles to the images for my comments (a point that is demonstrated by the lack of images in this review); so I can not even imagine having the necessary patience for that. <br /> <br /> I really like the practical and rough quality of claymation figures. The fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice and personal touch. How can he not be impressed with the clay characters who show more expression and emotion than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves combined? The Curse of the Were-rabbit is, as director Nick Park calls it, the first vegetarian horror film in the world that should entertain both children and adults. Trusting (and like a man who prides himself on his masculinity of cold hair and shaggy beard, I hesitate to use this word) cute and (oh man, I probably should not use this word either) adorable characters instead of outdated M.C. References from Hammer, W & G is the proof that DreamWorks can create entertaining animations when you choose the intelligence over the cheap joke.
