Julie Brown demolished hilariously the attempt of Madonna to interpret a rockumental with a heartrending humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival those of Madonna. The cinematography and the sets are first class. <br /> <br /> Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own comedy injections that enhance and complement this film. The appearances of Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale, as themselves, are an added bonus. <br /> <br /> It's hard to tell if Brown's performance is meant to insult or playfully tease Madonna, although I almost do not think Material Girl finds humor. at. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Why do not you come here (to the Philippines), all they eat is a dog and I am a vegetarian?"
