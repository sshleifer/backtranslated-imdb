Even the trailer of this movie makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who easily get upset with intense material! The best performances of Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, without a doubt. This terrible story of a society with the power to kidnap and torture its citizens for ANY reason, whether anarchists or children's book writers, will blow you away. I saw it when it first came out in 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares me a lot today. It is happening now. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMDb requires ten lines to meet your criteria for a movie review. IMDb could want to get a GRIP! Some of us are a little more concise about writing opinions.
