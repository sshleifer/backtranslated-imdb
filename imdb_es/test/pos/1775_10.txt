I like the movie, it's the best pirate movie I've seen so far (forget about the silly Errol-Flynn-stuff and Pirates of the Caribbean). This movie is wonderful melancholy. I compare it to "Johnny Guitar" on the side of the sea (but 3 years before), two women who fight for a man, where crazy love could lead to one. <br /> <br /> The character of women (anti-heroine, Anne Providence, is excellent, acts without commitment as a child, lost alone in its search for a female identity of its own in a world of real men. a rather strange movie heroine, not a funny pirate, like most of her female colleagues in this genre, who do not make jokes all the time, fight for the poor and the good and only kill the stupid Spanish or British soldiers or, better said, cunning governors, but is killing all the poor prisoners of war, after she captured a ship (pay attention to this at the beginning of the film), is primitive (can not even read), is desperate and is alcoholic, loses all his friends as a result of his obstinacy and takes most of the film.This movie shows a pirate "hero" a bit (!) Little like him (or in this case "she", but there has been a female "Anne" buccaneer, Anne Boney) I could have been in a brutal reality. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite short and the story is told in an impressive way. Certainly, a movie from the 1950s has no exciting special effects for the spectators in the present (the boats swim very obvious in a bathtub), but this true drama about love (that kills), trust, betrayal, revenge, hatred and sacrifice drive us. crazy. Perhaps, even Anne is supposed to be Judas Iskarioth and Jesus of Nazareth in one person, being betrayed by her friend (the French LaRochelle) as Jesus; after feeling disappointed by the friend, taking him to the death penalty (like Judas); rather than repent of this (like Judas, who commits suicide according to the Gospel of Matthew); and in the end he sacrificed himself for the rescue of the beloved enemy (like Jesus). But, even if you are not interested in these philosophical questions of guilt and atonement, the film provides a lot of (cheap) action like sword fights and boats (plastics) on fire for a very short hour and a half.
