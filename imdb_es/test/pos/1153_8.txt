One of the previous reviews of this film ends with "Only for the big fans of the main actors or the fans of the exotic Romance / Adventure films of Holywood ...", as if those were not enough reasons to love them! Anyone who, after watching this movie, complains about Connery's accent, the lack of historical plausibility, the realism of political motivations, or any other extra-cinematic concern, simply does not like movies. Look at it and let yourself be surprised by the power of the stars of the two protagonists, the exotic, the romantic, the photography and the music, and the daring adventure of a truly escapist film. This is proof that Hollywood can "make them as they used to" when they really want it. A solid 8/10.
