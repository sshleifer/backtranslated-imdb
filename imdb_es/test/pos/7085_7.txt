"One True Thing" puts Zellweger in the middle of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to take care of his dying mother (Streep). Shadowed and laborious, the film studies the adult child and the adult vision of their parents, since little by little it is revealed that it is something less than the ideal that grew up as a child. An excellent study of characters and a production of findings with little fault, "OTT" offers three excellent performances by a trio of main actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death.
