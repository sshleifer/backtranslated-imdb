The first time I saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights in 1994 at the cinema. I went to see him because I always liked Robin Hood, I saw the trailer of this movie and I thought it was very funny. After watching the movie, I must say that it was even better than I thought. Not only is it a lot of fun, it's also a very well made movie with beautiful outfits and costumes and a very beautiful Hummie Mann score. The acting in the film is also good, Cary Elwes is funny as Robin Hood and also Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks are fun. But the best part of the movie is Roger Rees as the evil Sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best scenes from the film and also the best dialogue ("From the illegal forest to the pig, kill in it", which means "It is illegal to kill a wild pig in the king's forest"). Somehow it mixes up all the words and utters a phrase that nobody understands. Robin Hood: Men in Tights is in my book one of the best films of Mel Brooks to date and I can not say that I laughed so much about a movie like this. It's just a laugh without stopping.
