I was having a horrible day, but this movie caught me, and I could not leave it until the end ... and I had forgotten my horrible day. and the end ... by the way ... where is the sequel? <br /> <br /> the budget is obviously extremely low ... but ... look what they did with it! It reminds me of a work ... basically they are working with a tent, an "escape pod", some weapons, uniforms, camping equipment and a "scanner" thing. That's all for the accessories. Maybe this is a good thing, forcing acting and writing to have to intensify and take their rightful place in the film, such as work centers, instead of having an excuse to make CGI fights (starwars) . <br /> <br /> The CGI is fine. It's not exactly 'without problems' ... but it still works. why? because there is not much of that, and what there is, is not to take charge with an army of people from the house of effects who try to put everything they can in the shot. It attracts the imagination ... it is relatively simple, with a decent composition (especially the heavy freighter shot ... there is a long shot that must be at least ten seconds ... it tracks the entire length of the ship .. It must be a record for the realization of science fiction movies in battle sequence in the last 10 years, to have an action sequence that lasts more than 0.75 seconds, and a certain relationship with the story. 'modern', but it does not seem stupid and does not detract from the story. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, except that the characters die too fast to meet them.The captain was great, but some of his scenes They could have used another shot, I also got confused with their character losing their calm and stepping on a corpse, I like to think that the captains are calm and in control ... what was happening in that scene? The other crew was worried I lost it At that time, did you feel yourself losing control? <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot ... above all it's good ... why? Because he does not try to explain himself. Just past. It's called 'the planet', it's a mystery, do you understand? Nobody knows why there is a statue, and they do not find out either. The mysterious cult? The weird scientist with the tattoo? What do you hope to discover in less than 90 minutes? This is not War and Peace. And, thank God, it's not star wars / trek either. Without midi-chlorians, without 5 minutes of boring expository dialogue that has no purpose in history. The characters are helpless, and they are only able to discover some basic things ... it is not an episode of Star Trek in which they discover that it is Leonardo Davinci or a child like the tramp. It's mysterious, and I liked that. I do not know why, maybe I can identify more with these guys, since they do not know what is happening, and neither do I ... they do not talk much space gibberish or have magic boxes that tell them what's going on. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would say that one of the weakest moments is when the "traitor" turns against the crew and tries to "explain" the reason for the planet, the cult, etc. This is coincidence. It has some of the weakest dialogues, imho, in the whole movie, and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters do not seem natural in that scene. <br /> <br /> Ok, sometimes I felt it was a bit too mysterious, however. Like, why did the boy get fried through his eyes with lightning? That was strange. Only weird The end of 'hamlet' ... again I would have liked to know better some of these characters. And would it have been so difficult to have a 30-second rescue scene at the end? This is not a serial show, it was a movie, and we like the closing in the movies, even if they can have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet without 'flying angels singing to you to rest' <br /> <br /> Anyway. What can I say. This was worth it for the dollar that I paid in the machine of the "red box" of the supermarket. It was also, imho, a better narrative than parts 1, 2 or 3 of starwars. As I said, it attracted me, wanting to know what was happening, and I could not stop looking until the end.
