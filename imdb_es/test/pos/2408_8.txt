I've seen this movie more than once and it's worth it. For those of you who like martial arts and overcome internal conflicts, this is a worthy option. After watching this movie, I wanted to be a more productive member of society because I could relate to the inner turmoil of a girl who was seeking acceptance and who needed a way forward. Of course, Mr. Miyagi always gives his wise advice. 2 thumbs up!
