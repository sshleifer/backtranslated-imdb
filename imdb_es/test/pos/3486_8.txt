The last film of the undervalued director Alberto De Martino ("The Antichrist", "The murderer is on the phone") is a giallo really suspense, but incomprehensibly careless, containing almost all the trademarks that make this sub genre Italian genre so magnificent and addictive. to the fans There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, fake priests ??), lots of creepy moments, plot twists to the left and right, outstanding music and? last but not least ?? A handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is a kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! What about the common children's dolls that make them so creepy? When the anonymous man, dressed like a priest, assaulted a girl and the broken head of his wrist jumped down a flight of stairs, it really sent shivers down my spine! Years later, the young woman in the prologue is an adult woman tied to a wheelchair. She inherited a large amount of money, but she uses her fortune to encourage other disabled people to play sports and maintain a positive attitude. She ?? Joanna ?? He falls in love with his personal trainer and they get married immediately. Naturally, he only seeks his money and begins to terrorize Joanna by making her relive the childhood trauma that paralyzed her. The repeated images of a sinister-looking priest, guided by mysterious melodies and a children's song, provide "Formula for a Murder" a ton of real fears and the direction of Alberto De Martino is very resolute. The acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck ("The Beyond", "The Black Cat") in a glorious role of greedy villain. Due to some holes in the plot and a lack of originality, this film might not be able to compete with Italy's best horror efforts, but it definitely deserves more attention. Many Italian gialli previously unknown and unknown received wonderful DVD releases and, hopefully, "Formula for a Murder" will receive the same treatment very soon. Meanwhile, good luck tracking this baby!
