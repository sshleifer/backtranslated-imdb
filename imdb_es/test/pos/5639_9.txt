Okay, I love good documentaries, especially when they tell a modern story about Don Quixote. One warning: I met Mark Borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 while still working at Coven. But I'm going to save that story for later. American Movie, which began production soon after, accurately portrays the person he knew, albeit in greater depth than he expected or believed existed. This is simultaneously a very funny and very sad movie, and it is brilliantly executed. Mark presents himself as his own worst enemy: his childhood ambition and optimism, which I admire, are undermined by his apparent artistic ineptitude and by his strange fiscal expectations. But he is also a charismatic type. His loyal companion of Sancho Panza is equally sympathetic: loyal, if exhausted, to the core. Like Don Quixote, American Movie presents an inefficient aspect of freedom that is often ignored: that people will be attracted to professions to which they are not particularly suited, regardless of repeated failure. It's a great movie.
