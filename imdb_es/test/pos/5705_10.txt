This is a great compendium of interviews and excerpts from the films of the late sixties and early seventies that were a movement contrary to the great studio films of the late sixties. Directed by Ted Demme, obviously it is a love work for the films of the time, but it gives little importance to the masterpieces of the time. <br /> <br /> Many of the filmmakers of this era were influenced by Truffaut. , Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman, and of course John Cassavetes. Unfortunately the documentary record in 138 minutes is very short! The film is rich in interviews and opinions of filmmakers. Some of the people interviewed are: Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdonovich, Ellen Burstyn and Roger Corman, Bruce Dern, Sydney Pollack, Dennis Hopper and Jon Voight. <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern a moment of truth when he says that he and Jack Nicholson may not have been as attractive as the other stars that came before them, but they were "interesting". This sums up the other areas of this period of film making in the history of the United States. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers were dealing with the lack of funds from the studios because they expressed unconventional attitudes about politics, sex, drugs, gender. and the racial problems, and the participation of America in conflicts abroad like the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> There is a great interview with Francis Coppola who says that he had the opportunity to do "The Conversation" because the producers knew that he had been trained by Roger Corman to make a movie with nothing, so they financed his film . <br /> <br /> Another interview is with Jon Voight, who was directed by Hal Ashby in "Coming Home", a clear anti-war film about a crippled soldier plunges back into society after facing battle . Voight talks about how his work methods helped him achieve an emotional point when Ashby said they were doing a "test" and ended up being the one used in the movie. It was better because it was not rehearsed and not depleted of its freshness when rehearsed in excess. <br /> <br /> There are also many good excerpts from Al Pacino's avant-garde film "The Panic in Needle Park", and interviews by Dennis Hopper on the making of "Easy Rider", and Sydney Pollack's interviews on how make films. <br /> <br /> In general, the documentary is a perfect starting point for any movie lover who wants to see great examples of how the new voices were in the film. In the seventies. Many of the Sundance Folks, where this movie caused a stir, do not know how much the Independent Film Maker owes to the films of John Cassavetes, Milos Foreman, William Friedkin and Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> Rent it at your favorite store.
