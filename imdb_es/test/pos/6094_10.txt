With a style that recalls the best of David Lean, this romantic love story goes through the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions it faces. It is a film that pretends that one does not choose love, but that it is love that chooses, no matter who, where or when; and in addition, it is a matter of the heart that often depends on the prevailing conditions and circumstances. And so is the situation in 'The English Patient', directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune places and moments, showing that when it is predestined, love will find its way. <br /> <br /> It's World War II; Flying over the African desert, the Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane confused with an enemy plane. And although it survives the shock, it is severely burned. For his great fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and ends up in a hospital. But the existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and Almasy soon becomes one of the many patients who are transported in a convoy to a different facility. Arriving in Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay with him in an abandoned monastery. <br /> <br /> Hana soon discovers that his position is a kind of mystery man, since Almasy does not remember anything of his past, not even his own name. Thought in English, the only clues that indicate who he is are contained in a book that is in his possession after the accident, but they are even as cryptic as Hana's patient. Little by little, however, following Hana's directions, Almasy begins to remember fragments of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is further enhanced by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he was looking for, a man with whom he wishes to establish a score. But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to emerge; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas), as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And, paralyzed in his mind and body as it is, those memories become all he has left to cling to any hope, even when his life seems to be moving further and further away. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the script for this film, which he adapted from Michael Ondaatje's novel. The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean 'Doctor Zhivago' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'; A magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented beauty and greatness. In a nutshell, Minghella's film is a realized genius; elaborated and delivered with poetic perfection, seeing it is like watching a Monet come to life. From the initial frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell on her public that is binding and transporter, with a story that has an emotional beauty that is equivalent to the vibrant and attractive images that come to life with the extraordinary cinematography of John Seale; Images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer. In all senses, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a surprising emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental. Nominated in twelve categories, he deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography. <br /> <br /> If one had to choose a single word to describe the "essence" of this film, it would be 'excellence'. Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without presentations that are of an extraordinary kind; and the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term "Oscar-worthy". Nominated for Best Actor for his performance as Almasy (Geoffrey Rush received the gold for 'Shine'), Fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is almost palpable. Private and introspective, Almasy is not, by its very nature, an individual with whom the public can form an intimate connection; However, Fiennes finds a way to open that emotional door enough to let you in, enough to prove the honest passion that flows within him. And works. Almasy does not seek your friendship; However, he will gain his compassion. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas also received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for "Fargo") for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose Stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict that it unleashes within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and, nevertheless, to which she surrenders voluntarily, taking off the chains of repression to embrace a love so strong that it threatens to consume her. The reserve that Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, since Scott Thomas successfully exploits the emotional depths of his character to achieve the greatest possible effect. It's the kind of performance that attracts you and keeps you fast, it takes you beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what it should be, if only because of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion. Underestimated and shaded with subtlety, it's an excellent work by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> Binoche also offers impressive performance that affects the good-hearted nurse, Hana; In fact, it is his humanity that defines love in its purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film. His relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) allows us to glimpse a passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine. `The English Patient 'is a film that will move and emotionally fill you; One that you do not want to see at the end. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
