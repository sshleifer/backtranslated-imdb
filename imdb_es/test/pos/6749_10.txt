This is an excellent horror film B film that limits between horror and comedy. It is a scorpion genetically mutilated in outer space. Can it become more unreal? It is a hybrid between "Alien" and "Chain Saw Massacre". The film was shot in Stockholm with a cast of Americans and Swedes who interact seamlessly. Director Martin Munthe does a great job of finding the comic highlights in this script and gets some good laughs from the audience. The film was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all the qualities of a B movie horror movie. It's comical and frightening at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause. It's great to see that movies like this can still be made! I would recommend seeing it if you like this kind of movies.
