One would think that a film based on the life of the Japanese author Yukio Mishima would be a daunting task, if not impossible. However, Paul Schrader has made a film "about" Mishima that is both excellent and complex. While it is not a literal biography, Schrader and his co-screenwriter Leonard Scharder (his brother) have taken several incidents of his life, including his sucide and his work, which can best be described as an incidental picture that is visually scarce and surprising . Mishima's homosexuality is almost not there, due to the legal threats of his widow, but despite this, the film is still amazing, and one of the best films I saw in 1985. I should also mention the important contribution of Philip Glass , who did it. The score, which adds an additional texture to the film, and is superior to the one he made for Scorsese's Kundun. Also noteworthy is the beautifully colored and beautifully colored cinematography of John Bailey and the great production and costume design of Eiko Ishioka, who was in charge of making the memorable costumes for Dracula de Coppola for which he received a well deserved Oscar. Hopefully this movie will soon be available on DVD.
