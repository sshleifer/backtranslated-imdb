I lived in that area (Hoboken and Jersey City) for about ten years. This film certainly captures the feeling of that time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is correct and the scenarios are realistic. As another poster said, it looks almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I like the way he humanizes these children, who probably would have preferred to have been born in Westchester, but they fall for what the children believe. As it happens, the area is quite rough. <br /> <br /> Demonia too much to the cops, but that's to be expected. I would say that acting is also good in all aspects. <br /> <br /> It gives the viewer an idea of ​​how this idiocy occurs and how it overflows. Hopefully, the new mayor of Newark is making progress.
