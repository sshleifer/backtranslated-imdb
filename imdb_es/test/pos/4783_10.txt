This was the first cartoon of Mickey Mouse released and the first caricature with sound. It was based on a silent movie called "Steamboat Bill, Jr." starring Buster Keaton. In this short Mickey early, Mickey did not speak nor had gloves. I could only whistle and play music. The song he played was "Turkey in the Straw" using various barnyard animals as musical instruments. He touches the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and touches the tits of a lactating sow like an accordion keyboard. Captain Pete, however, is very angry and makes Mickey peel the potatoes in the kitchen. Pete's parrot flies to the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. Mickey throws a half-peeled potato to the parrot and laughs, thus closing the caricature. I was able to get this caricature on the tape and I like it a lot. I think the Disney shorts are much better than the feature films.
