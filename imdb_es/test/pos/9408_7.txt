In 1974, teenager Martha Moxley (Maggie Grace) moved to the upper class area of ​​Belle Haven, Greenwich, Connecticut. In the Night of mischief, Halloween Eve, she was murdered in the backyard of her house and her murder was still unresolved. Twenty-two years later, writer Mark Fuhrman (Christopher Meloni), a former LA detective who has fallen out of favor because of perjury in O.J. Simpson tried and moved to Idaho, decides to investigate the case with his partner Stephen Weeks (Andrew Mitchell) for the purpose of writing a book. The locals writhe and do not receive them, but with the support of retired detective Steve Carroll (Robert Forster) who was in charge of the investigation in the 70s, they discover the criminal and a network of power and money to cover the murder. <br /> <br /> "Murder in Greenwich" is a good movie for television, with the real story of a murder of a fifteen-year-old girl who was committed by a wealthy teenager whose mother was Kennedy. The powerful and wealthy family used their influence to cover the murder for more than twenty years. However, a snooping detective and a perjurer convicted in disgrace could reveal how the horrible crime was committed. The script shows Mark's research and Martha's last days in parallel, but emotion is lacking in the dramatization. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
