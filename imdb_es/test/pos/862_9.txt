Wow, Stella Shorts are great! Many customers of The State and Stella, the television show. I never knew that Stella could have improved, so they were on the Stella television show or even on Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also did not know that short comedies could be good. My favorites were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David organize a meeting with their lost cousin, Greg. I think especially that David was the most fun. It's funny when it does not make sense. I like the music in the shorts. That's something I pay a lot of attention to. They always had good musical taste. I wish they still made shorts, either that or bring back the comedy. I hope you keep doing good and funny comedy.
