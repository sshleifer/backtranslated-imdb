If you are looking for a kung-fu action movie, look elsewhere. While there are scenes of struggle, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist, who struggles to find his way into the Americanized canton. Unlike most "kung fu comedies," action scenes are used to reinforce comedy, rather than the other way around. <br /> <br /> Cheung Booi is an assertion about the farcical nature of kung fu movies, where the stars always seem to find some reason to fight. Instead of a great drama about honor and respect, the small misunderstandings cause the characters to scream and start beating each other. <br /> <br /> My young aunt, as she is known in the West, is the story of Cheng Tai-nun, played by Kara Hui, a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to prevent her possessions from falling into her hands of his greedy and corrupt brother. After he dies, she moves to Canton to live with her nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and her son Ah Tao, played by Hsiao Ho. <br /> <br /> The basis of the irony is that, although Cheng is the same age as Ah Tao, his attitude is more similar to his status as a great-aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely bad), plays guitar and goes to fancy dress parties, Cheng completely fails when he tries to adapt to his lifestyle in Canton, complete with makeup, dresses, high heels and scenes of dance. <br /> <br /> What makes this film great is its realization. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the best, if not the best director of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui won the "Best Actress" at the first Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. Also, possibly this is the best performance of Hsiao Ho. His chemistry with Hui is remarkable, and although he had a career in kung fu comedies, often working alongside Sammo Hung, he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy. As the romantic tension and intrigue accumulate in the second half of the movie, her whole face changes. It does not easily pass through life without worrying about the world. He becomes the heterosexual man and his cohorts, Kramer, Elaine and George. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that, suddenly, the comic aspects of the film disappear during the conclusion. The film moves from a farce to a dramatic intrigue with little more than a change in incidental music. But there is a certain symmetry in it. The film begins focusing on the intrigue, focused more on the character of Lau Kar Leung, and ends well as well. But the final scene returns to the comic roots of the film, giving a conclusion to both aspects of the film.
