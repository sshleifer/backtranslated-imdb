The Man with the Golden Arm, the controversial crime drama of Otto Preminger, appears among the mental descriptions of its living and architectural occupants, in a rhythmic and mooring arrangement. When opening the film, a close-up from a bar where Frankie looks through the window, already tells us the importance that the protagonist's subjective experience will understand. Lying in the direction of increasingly lighter spaces, the film shuts itself off, as the local gangster's long-duration poker game closes in daylight, is screwed in, since Frankie Machine of Sinatra has locked in a room in the famous scene of his heartbreaking struggle to beat his habit. By delving into the shapes and faces of his urban jazzy refuge, the visual traffic in The Man with the Golden Arm characterizes the biased psychological circumstances, forming an overwhelming environment, as the recurrent shots in the close-ups of Frankie's eyes keep him. <br /> <br /> The grace of this ardent drama, which surprises from the exciting opening of the crane, shows the mastery over the perceptible world that studio production allows. The marvelously dilapidated urban complexes define an independent place without beginnings or endings, an indeterminate state, of the type that in reality hardly lasts the time that this row of slip appears before being gentrified or leveled. The talent of certain performances, particularly by Robert Strauss as the wonderfully named gamemaster of the underworld Schwiefka and Arnold Stang as Frankie's faithful four-eyed lapdog, becomes this surrealistic feature in a pleasant way. The premise of drug addiction, the powerful performance of Sinatra, the forceful and forceful jazz music of Elmer Bernstein and the famous opening sequence, influential and controversial by Saul Bass, focused on the cutting of animated paper from the arm of a addicted to heroin, said that, in his time, El Brazo Dorado presses the cause of realism in the still reticent Hollywood. He is impressionistic and subjective, as I say, but his intention, his strength and his spirit are much closer to home. <br /> <br /> What most absorbs me in this movie is its appearance as a gangster movie. It has illegal card games, short cons, fights, weapons, double crosses, characters on the street, a femme fatale, an incredibly sexy gun, shaded nightclubs and the urban landscape, but it does more than explode this. Environment for entertainment. Actually, it is the perfect environment and gender to tell this story, an urban neighborhood ravaged by crime in which it is very comfortable to escape for a bottle or two, or three, or four, or drugs, a transient dose that really only It works to keep one in the dark of any lighting and all the clear scenarios that the world could offer.
