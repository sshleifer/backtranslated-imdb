I saw Culloden and The War Game by Peter Watkin a few months before and I was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same, or at least very similar, in this film that details, on the one hand, a trial of dissidents in California in the (apparently) near future, and on the other, the attempts of a group of "criminals" "sentenced to travel 50 miles of desert to gain his freedom in a" punishment park "administered by the government as an alternative to prison. Watkins films everything in a documentary style, which causes more than a little discomfort or requires a strong suspension of disbelief: how is it possible that the camera crew is with the group of hungry and parched prisoners for 2 days without offering help or sharing your experience? misery? And that is simply the most obvious example. But aside the questionable narrative, this gives a blow; There is no doubt that he has to be interested in making political films to really get involved, but the film really is not like anything else of his time: he does not make any effort, he does not offer simple solutions. The political figures of the left are certainly painted extensively at times, but not all are equal; Right-wing government officials seem a bit more caricatured, but they are even allowed to show at least a little humanity. In general, the movie gives a lot to think about and leaves an indelible flavor ... 8/10 DVD rental
