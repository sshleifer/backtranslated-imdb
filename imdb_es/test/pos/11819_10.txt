In 1996, one of the airplane pilots where I used to work gave me a copy of this movie. He told me he will make me cry. I never believed him and we even made bets. After watching the movie ... I cried a bucket! Even after watching the movie, I found myself crying in the bathroom. Actually, it was the most moving movie I've seen. I like the part where Dexter's mother confronted Eric's mother. The line was something like ... "your son's best friend has just died today ... and it will not be easy ... if you ever put your hands on him again ... I'll kill you!" The last part in which Dexter took Eric's shoe was a scene that never stopped thinking until today. Honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes watery. A story of what true friendship is about. My girlfriend also loved it ... She hated me for letting her see the movie. I cried a bucket, she cried a river.
