I'm not sure what to do with this movie, especially after watching a great movie like La Notte. Unfortunately, I saw it in German during an Antonioni film festival at the Frankfurt Film Museum, so I could not hear Malkovich's great voice. He is supposed to relate four stories about couples in Italy. However, as a good actor he is, Malkovich can not rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories presented here: a woman who approaches him in a cafe next to a store he owns and tells him how he killed his father. Then the two go home, have sex, and he leaves. It seems that Antonioni lost the subtlety he had in previous films (like The Passenger) when dealing with sex and replaced it with a cheeky nudity. <br /> <br /> However, the plot does not make sense, the film presents two things that make it observable: eyes and sweet ears. The actors and actresses are beautiful people, and the cinematography is wonderful: scenes in old Italian cities that contrast with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city (reminiscent of La Notte). <br /> <br /> However, it is what really makes it worthwhile to watch the movie. U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence", which create the perfect atmosphere in the film. The songs are available in "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1."
