OK ... you need to establish yourself! This movie is not so bad. I saw him for the first time last night and I fell in love with him! I have to admit that I have never been a fan of LeeLee Sobieski, but he grew up in me in this movie. I think Josh Hartnett is handsome, but come on ... Chris Klein is the most beautiful man I've ever seen. He made that movie better for me. Come on girls ... when you do not have a shirt and go to look for water, I know you've dropped your mouth. Yes, I know that at the beginning he is an imbecile, but in the end he realizes how he acted and learns to be a great guy. If he had not come at the end ... then he would have been crazy. I do not think it was necessary to say a couple of lines, but in general, it was a great movie! I definitely recommend it!
