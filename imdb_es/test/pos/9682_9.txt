"Family Guy" is probably the most brazen comedy ever produced. It relentlessly undermines everything you can think of, from television shows to family dramas. Best of all, it is one of the few television shows today that is really fun. <br /> <br /> The program revolves around the Griffin: Peter, the obese father whose plans are limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, even though Peter considers himself to be like that. Chris, the fat teenage son who has as few brains as his father. Meg, the black sheep of the family that is the most important joke of all. Stewie, the baby who has plans to kill his mother and take over the world. And Brian, the dog of the family, who is often the voice of reason, but often is corrupted. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" employs many tactics to get laughs from the audience. The most notable are the frequent cuts that falsify what has just been said. They are effective due to impeccable time and how they perform. "Family Guy" also uses parody to get humor, most commonly in the television shows of the 1980s. What really makes the program so good is that a person does not have to be familiar with what counterfeiting is. I'm sure it would help, but the material is pretty fun in its own right. But the show does not stop there. It not only falsifies almost everything, but also punctures its own fakes! The show is full of humor out of color. The only reason why people are not in arms about the program is probably because it mocks all races, sexes and other generalities alike. There is nothing sacred here, and nobody and nothing is immune to the satirical attacks of "Family Guy". <br /> <br /> Putting musical numbers in a movie requires a lot of time and effort, and it's a big risk. But "Family Guy" contains some great songs. All well written and performed, and of course they are hilarious (perhaps the most famous, "The Freakin 'FCC" is sticky and hysterical because it hits the classification board where it hurts). <br /> <br /> Voice characterizations are right in the money. Seth McFarlane is tremendously talented. It provides the voices of Peter, Brian (who is his own natural voice) and Stewie. The voices are not only coherent and creative, but can also alter their tone at will, so it really seems that they are spoken by three different actors. Alex Borstein gives Lois a nasal accent that is perfect for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (had he not seen him in IMDb, he would never have known it was him). Lacey Chabert originated the character of Meg, and although it was good, Mila Kunis really elevated the character with her high-pitched voice. Kunis gives Meg a new and sharper edge than she had with Chabert. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" has been compared to "The Simpsons", and that is completely understandable (and not just because they occur). by FOX). Both are satires of the life of the worker, and while "The Simpsons" is good, "Family Guy" contains a sharper advantage. The show is absolutely intrepid. There is no true sacred cow. The show reveals disadvantages (physical and mental), ethnicities, television shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially Catholicism), drug use and addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including S & M), and some of them are beyond all description. Not everything that "Family Guy" launches to the audience works, but in general, the program is always fun and, often, fun. <br /> <br /> If there is an error in "Family Guy", it is that the jokes continue. too much time sometimes. Particularly with the jokes of "uncomfortable moments", the sequences lengthen for so long that it not only stops being funny, but becomes so irritating (and long) that a fast forward button is justified. These can be effective in approximately 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes extends them to more than two minutes. One could argue that the program rewrites its rules to fit the plot, and often does (for example, Brian often acts as a person, but still acts like a dog when history requires it). But that's not a problem because the program still works. <br /> <br /> Some people have argued that the program has stopped being fun. While I agree that he is not as nervous as he used to be, I think FOX has the fault, not McFarlane and his team. The program originated with FOX, but after some lackluster classifications and the participation of the viewer, it was canceled. However, the DVD sales were large enough to be picked up by Adult Swim. The show became an instant hit, and once again it was bought by FOX. However, because the program is so big now, FOX is afraid to let writers experiment and try new things. While it's still fun, the mood is not so fresh or tense. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, check out this show. Is awesome.
