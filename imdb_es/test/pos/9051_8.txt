This 60min movie shows how fun filmmaking can be. Everything is very funny, since it represents a comedy attack without limits to the Star Trek genre. In "Hick Trek - The Moovie", a group of good guys are on a mission to stop a group of renegade cats to destroy the entire Redneck Federation. <br /> <br /> Can Captain Jerk stop the villain Fluffy? with the power of Bovine RSS and it's cow ray. She can have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! This cult classic (previously only seen in science fiction conventions) is the favorite of the party. Many funny moments!
