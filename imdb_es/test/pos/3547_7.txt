Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard, were you expecting a fun movie that the whole family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those who complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera: how often does the music of a film relate directly to what happens in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I think the directors of these films were doing: creating a contemporary setting for the old operas. For the most part they have wonderful success. With all these operas, who are you going to like them all? We could have used more Beverly Sills. <br /> <br /> Finally, what is art (even opera) without some naked women?
