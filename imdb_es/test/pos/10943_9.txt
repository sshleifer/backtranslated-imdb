I think there was too much action at the end? Do not you think that too? There was a romance, an adventure that told me to put 9 in this movie but that the place of action was too long. I liked Reeve a little. I did not understand why he had to die. I thought one of the girls will die too, but my luck! Nobody else that I liked would not die! How about you? What do you like? Actually I saw the movie twice. And after that I bought that too. It was worth it! Who did you like more (person)? The book was really, really great. And the actresses and actors too. Everything was perfect ... What was the name of the song at the end? Will someone answer my questions too ... PLEASE, please?
