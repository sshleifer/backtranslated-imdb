This movie was a gift, a night offer that came out of nowhere, so, unlike other critics, I had no preconceived ideas. I found myself glued to my seat while the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, its own development. I felt attracted to recognize my deep love and humanity as I wanted "good" to prevail, but they also forced me to recognize ironically that sometimes I was on the side of the "bad guys". The film is quite beautiful: the word "elegiac" comes to mind, and this is more than because the film begins and ends in an elegy. Far from being depressing or confrontational, for me, the film recognizes deep suffering, and then, because of its cyclical nature, with births and births and deaths, the film celebrates the fact that, to quote an Australian poet, it is "sometimes joy". Oh gods, I feel like I've written a love letter to this movie, but there it is. Hello!
