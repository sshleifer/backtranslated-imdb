I will not go to a generalization, and I will say that it is the best love story of all time, as some have said. That's fine, people feel very deeply about this movie, either you love it, I think ... or you just hate it. I do not want to say, best of all, because that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. However, I feel very passionate about The English Patient, as well as millions of people. <br /> <br /> The prizes say it all. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the critics, on many levels, however, those who chose this, could not agree more. <br /> <br /> 9-Oscars. <br /> <br /> 41 victories. <br /> <br /> 37 more nominations, make this love story at the top of the list. <br /> <br /> From the director, Anthony Minghella, the story that appears on the screen and when Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said: "Elaine, I just can not take my eyes off of that!" In this case, I do not agree with Elaine's response. But history is built and takes the right time, necessary for the case to be beautiful. The cinematography, (John Seale) also won multiple awards, as it should be. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche, until now. Well, not entirely true, I loved his performance in "Sabrina". Enchanting story of a somewhat complicated relationship, with Harrison Ford. But this was just an incredibly different character for her, and as talented as she is, she just shone in a subtle and elegant way, that's what this movie was looking for, I'm really glad it was her performance. And not another actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also spectacular in the portrait of Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! What can you say except see this picture again? (*****)
