I am a new convert, as one might say. I borrowed the DVDs from my local library. I've been interested in the samurai since I saw "The Last Samurai." My dad told me he used to see Shintaro when he was a kid. He said it was pretty good. We live up to the series 3. I love it. It takes a little time to get used to the voices dubbed in English about the characters that speak Japanese, but I really enjoy it. It is a little strange to see the slight pauses when the ninja stars throw themselves at the characters and stick to a tree or wall. I was not used to this but I am now. But I guess that's the technology they had in the 60's. I've noticed that Shintaro is kind, friendly, willing to help those in need, he's very humble, most of the time he does not notice himself ( just say it's better than the enemy ninja). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It is really interesting to see the fencing that Koichi Ose has. It's amazing. This series is for anyone who is interested in samurai.
