When the noble clan Hanabusa is decimated by the usurper clan Samanosuke, the loyal retainer Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with the eight-year-old son of his lord, Tadafumi, and his daughter, Kozasa. They are protected by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the god of the Hanabusa clan, Majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in giant stature carved from the side of a local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek revenge against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured in the attempt and sentenced to die. The priestess Shinobu, who tries desperately to save her master, threatens Samanosuke with the god's disgust, only to be killed for his efforts. Samanosuke, a vain, cruel and narrow man, orders that the statue of Majin be destroyed, in order to crush any last vestige of hope among the remaining loyalists of Hanabusa. But the god Majin, who until now has been implacably silent, has other ideas ... <br /> <br /> Daimajin is an exciting, timeless and moving fairy tale. Produced abundantly with a respectable budget, it is a film about values: the values ​​of nobility, justice, decency, loyalty, personal sacrifice and love. It is about the hierarchy and the rule, and about the consequences of not fulfilling the responsibility that the rule entails. These are things that are not talked about much in our demotic times, except when scribbling toads like William Bennet, but which are nonetheless relevant, and Daimajin shows us why. <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a perfect example of why Japanese cinema is so glorious. The values ​​listed above have a palpable relevance for those who participate in this film, as they do for many Japanese filmmakers. There is no lip service, no condescension, no irony here. Instead, there is a real effort to conjure a world where these values ​​can have life again and show what happens when they fall into disuse. Just compare Daimajin, or the Lone Wolf and Cub series, or any Kurosawa movie with the atrocious nihilistic shame of Tarantino, to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In a movie whose talent is so uniform. excellent, I would simply like to point out the majestic result of the master Akira Ifikuba, the talent and beauty of the actors Jun Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Miwi Takada; and the impressive portrait of Otome Tsukimiya. His death scene is one of the most moving and significant that I have witnessed.
