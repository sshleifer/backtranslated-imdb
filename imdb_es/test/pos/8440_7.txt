The thirty years that have passed since the making of this film have caused the suspense to weaken a little, and they will not keep the audience as attentive as I am sure they did in 1979. Although it is still entertaining enough, and it recovers part of its power when one discovers its sad relevance today (see the history of the Davis-Besse nuclear plant of FirstEnergy). With the best actors and the constant pace, one can learn to ignore the environment of the 70s and see it for the political criticism that it is. However, I doubt that it will survive the test of time. It may not be completely forgotten thanks to its cast, but otherwise, the dialogue, the configuration and the score will inevitably make a remake of this film. As the oil situation is now comparable to that of the 70s, and alternative sources of energy are becoming a hot topic, we can only hope that the current generation receives highly successful warnings about the risks of nuclear power (privatized ) How is it going.
