I remember seeing this in the cinemas when it came out, with no idea of ​​what it was going to be and being so pleasantly surprised that I promised to buy the video when it came out. <br /> <br /> Although I will not go too far in the dissection of this film, I will say that I gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the reviews of other users. <br /> <br /> What I am going to say is this: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this movie are incredible. It's the closest thing to a textbook reader I've ever seen. Once I put this movie in a party, where everyone relaxed and prepared to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed you the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Everyone, who saw the opening, stayed until the end.
