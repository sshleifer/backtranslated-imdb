A film that I have seen and enjoyed possibly more than any other movie. I saw him for the first time as a child and I loved the drama and the great climatic battle. As I grew up, I enjoyed it as much or more than before, but now due to all the components that work together to make a true classic. The acting is excellent (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), the spectacular cinematography, the script is full of gems and the management brings it all together beautifully. It is loosely based on a real event, and it shows a wave of Europe and a new emerging America to divide the "sick old man" (the Ottoman Empire) when it collapses in a different way than any other "historical" film I have seen . Humor, drama, action, love ... it has everything and deserves much more recognition (like 'The Great Waldo Pepper').
