He had lent Sarah's three films to a friend and had seen them sick in bed for a weekend. I really enjoyed each one of them. I enjoyed how the last movie gave him an idea of ​​how Caleb and his sister were when they grew up. In addition, I liked the transmission of the song "Billy-boy" that was heard for the first time during the credits of the first film, the title "Sarah, Plain and Tall". However, the only thing in Winter's End that I did not like was the youngest daughter. She was a very pretty girl, but she had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids, even compared to Caleb when he was younger.
