This is a movie that really makes you think about your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. I will not give the plot in this post, I think others have already overcome me. I hope that despite reading the opinions on this site, take the opportunity and see this movie for yourself. I went to see this movie with my husband and a friend and I must say that, after the movie ended, there was total silence in the theater. After a few minutes I looked back and everyone in the theater looked at the screen, lost in their thoughts. This will deepen your psychological abyss to reflect on several things: <br /> <br /> To what extent does society influence my life and the life of my generation? <br /> <br /> How much time does someone have? Pay for the mistakes they made? <br /> <br /> If a second chance is given, have you noticed? <br /> <br /> Is it better to live in a box or not to live? absolutely? <br /> <br /> My questions are not intended to show my approval or disapproval of Leland's actions. I do not want my opinion about them to dictate in any way what will take away from this movie, so I will not give it. See it yourself. I'm still lost in my thoughts, trying to answer my many questions from the movie. I enjoyed it a lot and I hope you do too. This film does not attempt to answer questions, approve any action or promote any punishment. This movie is trying to make us all evaluate our lives and take off the pink glasses that most of us see the world through. <br /> <br /> Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars
