Inside Dancing (Rory O'Shea Was Here) is the story of two young people with disabilities, Rory O'Shea, who is almost completely immobilized and confined in a wheelchair, and Michael Connelly, who is weakened by MS and is also confined to a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> Located in Ireland, the film begins with Rory arriving at an assisted residential center. Finally, he befriends Michael, but only after a few tense scenes in which Rory revolts against staff and other patients in the usual "film form" playing loud metal music, using profane language and hate in general. His budding friendship with Michael is based on the fact that Rory seems to be the only one who understands Michael, or at least is willing to try. <br /> <br /> Eventually, through some trial and tribulation, the request of the couple, and is granted, the right to live in a specially adapted apartment. The apartment is paid for by Michael's father who, essentially, had left him because of his disability. The two also hire an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garai) to help them in their daily lives. This is essentially where the crux of the film develops, as both develop feelings for it. Michael is hit particularly hard. Unfortunately, for both of them, but especially for Michael, Siobhan does not feel the same and makes her leave. As Michael retreats temporarily and wants to return to the Asst. In the Living Center, Rory convinces him to continue living alone. The film ends on a sad note, which many viewers may have seen coming, but ultimately, we are left with the feeling that Michael has really become independent and the future is his, as Rory pointed towards the end of the movie . <Br /> <br /> You know, I can not say that I have seen many "films for the disabled" and I do not know if they could be considered a specific genre. But there is a type of formula for them. A person is not willing to live beyond his illness until some liberating force forces him to do so and Inside I'm Dancing is really different. What works, however, is that it is probably more subtle about the peaks and valleys that the two men go through than what they might expect. There are no intentionally free moments or manipulations of "get up and cheer up." The sad parts are sad and the funny parts are fun. Some viewers may recoil a bit at the thought that Rory is the punk-haired guy with the ears on his nose like the "rebellious" cliche too perfect, but the actor, James McAvoy, somehow makes it real. The same can be said of Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart breaks, he does not seem to be invoked by a deficient script that tries to encourage the audience, but rather by a young man who feels pain from unrequited love. The kind of pain that many can relate to any physical condition. Again, these are the types of things that make the movie work and that is moving without being dominant and enjoyable on many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
