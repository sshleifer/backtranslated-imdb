If you have the chance to get this lost gem (for many years), I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has a strange mix of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation, even hints of slapstick, but it's so strange that not only was he ahead of his time, since then nothing like it has been seen. <br /> <br /> I totally disagree with people who say the movie is dated, especially with "Bamboozaled" (SP?) from Spike Lee a few years ago, which was a mistake when trying to capture the same message. (Good cinematographic realization, unconnected script). <br /> <br /> The direction of Robert Downy is brilliant, which allows many of his actors to improvise, the film improves as it progresses and the jokes boast of being successful or strangers of a line that are so forgiven like those found in a Mel Brooks comedy, just not PC "I can not believe they said that" funny. <br /> <br /> Favorite parties, commercials. The film changes from black and white representations of the advertising agency to a beautiful color (maybe 16 mm) and gets away with it. <br /> <br /> I refuse to hint at any spoilers, but if you have the opportunity to watch the DVD version, be sure to watch the Downey interview (but leave it until after the movie). <br /> <br /> My vote 10/10: the most underestimated film of the late 60s, early 70s. Thank you prince
