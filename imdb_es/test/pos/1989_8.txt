eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, in which the characters run from one kingdom to another, from one landscape to another, trying to beat a game they do not know what the objective is or exactly where it is leading them . Within that virtual reality game there are more layers of virtual reality games, questioning what reality they come from is the "real" one. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not spectacular hiding the fact that it's not going to happen. Respond reasonably to a real reality, instead, download the idea of ​​whether it is real or a video game in question even to the end. I'm not even sure that Cronenberg pretends that the turn will not be there, it's incredibly obvious in a sense it's a bit disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is its basic nature, in a certain sense. . Cronenberg is questioning reality And criticizing the game. However, the same things he uses to criticize the game make him enjoy it: violence, discontinuity, lack of focus and, in some sense, pixilation, even if there is no such pixilation in the film. I once heard someone say that Cronenberg's violence is actually a critique of hyper-violence in the media, but hides with the fact that he gets incredible pleasure in extracting new holes in humans, animals and amorphous piles of mud. biological. /> <br /> What has been brilliantly written and done about this film is the use of video game concepts (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes, the relative lack of environments or environments that do not have sense), only a few people around where you feel there should be many and vice versa, all those things, along with the reason for the penetration. It definitely deconstructs the reality of videogames in a way that is nauseating and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing videogame electronic devices with literal "capsules" of biological material that twist and move and, frankly, are repugnant to of the most important. horrible degrees. For what it's worth, this movie provokes a reaction in you. <br /> <br /> But for what? Criticize virtual reality, but it's a movie: it's your own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of the frames of video games and the design of characters, but maintains that banality. It definitely seems to worry about killing a character in a video game is more correct than killing a real human being and how video games can be confused with reality and make people not think about the consequences of their actions in real life . Again, he gets the most pleasure from tearing people, objects, beasts, things and organisms in bloody strips. <br /> <br /> Therefore, although it has a focus of key distress, it really does not do anything with that. , not really. Only what he does is present that anguish in such an original way that you can not really deny his own moment of splendor. <br /> <br /> In a way, it would be much easier to hate this movie. for being bloody and violent, because there is no good reason I can see to love him, and yet I can not ignore him as mediocre or bad. It would be easier to just not be able to take it, but as I can, there's nothing I can really do with that. I think it's a bit excessive, I really did not have to go that far, but Cronenberg's intentions are so confusing and confusing that I do not know if that was Cronenberg's fault or Cronenberg's point, and I do not know. I think there's really some way to find out, except maybe ask him directly. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
