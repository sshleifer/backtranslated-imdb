Peter Lorre delivers one of his best performances as a Hungarian watchmaker who comes to United Staes to make a new life and someday takes his girl to the other side of the big pond to be with him. Lorre's infectious optimism and bright outlook come off very effectively, which improves performance when his face is burned in a hotel fire and when no one gives him a chance to work, he is reluctant to live a life of crime. Lorre's status as an actor is rarely as apparent as in this film with his jovial and affable immigrant, for his depressing, melancholy, disfigured self-search for the truth behind what he believed the United States provided him, his soft, intelligent, better beyond his average hood, for his sympathetic relationships with a blind woman he falls in love with. The story has a good pace, has some interesting twists and gives Lorre many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does quality work behind the lens, and the entire supporting cast helps the film with Evelyn Keyes taking a particularly good turn as the blind girl. I loved the ending, and the truth, it seemed that it existed in Lorre's character despite all the negative things that society had done to him. For a small B picture, The Man Behind the Mask is a good movie for its time.
