Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). This is how the movie begins. Adele decided that she and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband for no reason. The story is about the relationship between mother and daughter. It is really profound and moving, thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated for a Golden Globe for that role. She is one of the most talented actresses I have seen, and also Sarandon. They really look like mother daughter. The soundtrack is also great. The movie is amazing * 10 out of 10 *
