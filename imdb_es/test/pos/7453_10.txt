Graphics: bright, obviously. The most impressive things were definitely not delivered in the trailers. The fighting sequences move extremely fast, but after seeing a couple of them, your eyes should be used and it will not seem so confusing. The cloud has a great variety of swords, and I would like things to move a little slower just so we could see them, because each one was incredibly detailed. Oh, and finally we can see exactly how Materia is equipped ... <br /> <br /> Music: bright too. I was a little nervous about it, since (from what I've seen) Nobuo is not the best at writing music to accompany the action (remember the Steal the Tiny Bronco sequence?), But it's brilliant and it fits perfectly. I'm glad I ordered the OST. However, they changed the lyrics of One Winged Angel, so you will not be able to sing if you know the lyrics of Carmina Burana. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: the first half of the film sets things up and presents everyone in a fairly complex tapestry, but the second half is almost completely combat fights, once all the players are in place . I would not call it a weak plot, but it's not as complicated as the plot of the game was. I think this is an effort to avoid trying to overshadow the game, and I think that's a good thing ... the film is its own entity, and should not try to overcome the original in terms of pure plot. <Br /> <br /> I admit that I expected this movie to bring FF7 to a wider range of people, but this is NOT a conventional movie. I was going to give him only nine stars, simply because he does not even try to explain anything to the newcomers ... Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene ... it sounded like her) gives a bit of history in the beginning, but it's more of a review than an intensive course. But then I realized that, for me, this movie is a 10/10, so why should I take away points simply because other people probably will not like it too ... if you've played the game, or at least they're past ? familiar with him, you should see this movie. But you do not need me to tell you that. If you're not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and win it, and then watch the movie ... although still bottomless, it's still incredibly beautiful. You simply will not get any of the internal references ... that make up 50% of the movie (that is, everything that IS NOT a fight sequence).
