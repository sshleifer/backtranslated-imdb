The problem with television today is that people have spoiled "small" television. This type of television program is the equivalent of "easy to listen to" elevator or jazz music. The typical idea of ​​"continuity" of the spectators is to remember who were expelled from the island last week and ask who will be the next to leave. Show them a program like Surface, Firefly, Dr. Who, or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and ... well, they'll just go back to Survivor. <br /> <br /> 95% of Sheep watching television do not want to destroy their brains. They want excuses not to think. They want to make sure that the "tit tube" lives up to its name ... and they do not want programs that try to go any other way. Due to this, Surface and many other high quality programs that should have lasted much longer have been successful. <br /> <br /> Viewers do not want stories, or morals, or philosophy, or anything else other than a third party. Vocabulary level of degree. They want people to eat earthworms, or "real life" series too dramatized (not so! You can not observe something without changing the very nature of what is observed) or hormonal programs that involve groups of people they have appointments and then they boast about it. friends. <br /> <br /> Today's television is nothing more than a wasteland, and the few diamonds you can get out of the dust are simply thrown away because no one knows what a diamond is anymore. The surface was one of those diamonds.
