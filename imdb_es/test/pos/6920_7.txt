This movie has to do with entertainment. Imagine your friends that you love spending time with, those you know from the inside out become a bit stupid and maybe have a character or two. That's what this movie is about. An inventive and brilliantly executed script. It's not about pleasing the masses with this, it's about having fun with a group of people with brilliant talent. Which is what I'm sure everyone thought when they registered for it. <br /> <br /> The previous review sounds completely unfair and I think the person who wrote that was in the wrong mood when he saw the movie. In a happy moment, there is great dignity if you care to look. <br /> <br /> A job well done, I thought it was a great movie. Any day I would see this before the North American norm. <br /> <br /> In a few words, it is not the best movie you will ever see, but it has many moments. I have not laughed so long at an age.
