This is fantastic! Everything, from the score, to the role of the final credits. This movie is a masterpiece. It is genuinely spooky and its effectively hysterical environment is enough to give anyone the chills. It is evident that the film was NOT rushed, and that David Schmoeller (who would later work with Fullmoon in the Puppet Master series) had a clear and concise picture of what he is trying to direct. The professional aspect of the film is amazing considering that it is a relatively low budget. It is based on shocks without effects (mainly due to budgetary restrictions), but still creates an atmosphere full of tension. <br /> <br /> Stephen King declared that this was one of his favorite movies and I can not blame him. It's one of my favorite horror movies and it always will be. This is my favorite Fullmoon movie and it has been since I first bought it a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Money well spent! I own both versions, VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> 10/10
