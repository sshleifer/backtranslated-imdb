I thought this movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. The character of Yasmine Bleeth plays a woman who has fallen in love with the character of Richard Greico. They end up marrying and everything seems perfect, except that Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however, she has difficulty conceiving. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy and will take extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was excellent in this movie and it keeps you guessing. It shows how naive one can be when he has fallen in love. Yasmine Bleeth is a good actress in this, and I wonder why she never got any further in her career. Richard Greico is very impressive as the deceptive husband and plays the part of evil very well. I wonder why certain actors do it and others do not. In general, a great movie that I would recommend.
