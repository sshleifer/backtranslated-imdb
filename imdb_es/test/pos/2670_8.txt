This brief topic brought praise from all kinds of places for their request for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> After a session in a recording studio, Frank Sinatra leaves and meets a group of children who beat another because he was Jewish. He gave them a lecture as only an American icon could about the meaning of prejudice and why we had just fought against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer. <br /> <br /> Both songs of this short song were recorded and sold out in a big way for the Columbia albums. If you are more than a dream and the song written for the movie, The House I Live In. The latter is one of the best songs about an idealized version of America, we would all like to fight. <br /> <br /> Sinatra recorded The House I Live In again during the 1960s for a joint album that he did for his record label Reprise. The album is now a rarity and should not be. His collaborators were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring and their residents of Pennsylvania with the orchestra led by Nelson Riddle. <br /> <br /> Axel Stordahl was Sinatra's chief music director and arranger during the 1940s. When that position died he finally fell to Nelson Riddle. Stordahl does the orchestration for the short and the Columbia record, Riddle for the Reprise record. <br /> <br /> Fans of Sinatra and others should listen to them together and compare them. And capture this movie that is worth every time it is shown.
