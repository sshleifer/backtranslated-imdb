If you do not mind the subtitles, you like the comedy and the really interesting characters, besides trying something different from the main American cinema, then take the opportunity and rent this movie. <br /> <br /> Two contrasting friends, (one very neurotic sweater, the other, the lonely, strong and silent type) who works for an idiotic butcher in a smaller Danish city, decides to attack his own owners and open a butcher shop themselves. They do not succeed at first, they incorporate something new into their recipe and they become an instant success with the people. <br /> <br /> That's an interesting story in itself, this clever humorous film links with even more, (friendship, romance, crime, death, personal tragedy) that makes this movie so fun but full of Numerous subtle interests that make it so fun and interesting but warm and fuzzy. <br /> <br /> What you have to mention are the characters created and the actors making them believable. You can have the best script yet. If the characters are not believable, you can sink a movie and with this, the direction, the acting, the credibility of the character and the story combine so well that they make this a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> So, if you feel like stretching out a bit, you want to see something very good but done in a slightly different way, then I suggest you rent this movie while I'm on my way to find more for writer Anders.
