Nightbreed is definitely my favorite movie, I have used more than one tape as it is. The makeup is incredible, the story is beautiful. It takes a few different turns and is not as deep as the story on which it is based (Cabal, by Clive Barker), but for a film adaptation it remains very true to the original material. The only problem with this film was the vain attempts of the producer to turn it into a film for teenagers, hence the ending changed to allow sequels * eye rolls *. Apparently, someday we will get a cut of Director who (I hope) will clarify this nonsense. Until then, I would suggest to anyone who likes the horror of a dark fantasy type instead of the Freddy / Jason / Micheal type slashers. I really do not know what would be comparable ...
