After a group of young friends experience problems with the car while traveling off the beaten track, they accept an offer of help from the lone local Slausen (Chuck Connors), owner of a nearby museum filled with historic wax mannequins. Once in the spooky attraction of the road, friends are harassed by a lunatic with a mask that can give life to the mannequins of the museum through the power of the mind. <br /> <br /> The Bad Boy of Tourist Trap is an insane cross between The Leatherface and Anthony, of Massacre, of the Texas Highlands, the terrifying child of the classic Twilight Zone episode 'It's A Good Life', while that the plot is a mixture of elements of the aforementioned MTC, Psycho de Hitchcock and House of Wax. The atmosphere and the execution of Tourist Trap, however, are so de-centered that, in this respect, it is practically impossible to make a comparison with other previous films. <br /> <br /> The continually inventive and unpredictable treatment of Director David Schmoeller for his own screenplay gives the film a clearly nightmarish quality, and with a brilliant performance in Connors left field, an incredibly spooky score of Pino Donaggio, a collection of truly disquieting mannequins with removable jaws, and the presence of the super sexy Tanya Roberts, who Passes the film in (and briefly out of) tiny denim jeans and a figure that hugs Boob-tube, Tourist Trap It is a totally unforgettable and, ultimately, unique horror experience that deserves your worship.
