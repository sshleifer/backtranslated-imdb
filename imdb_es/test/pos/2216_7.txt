This movie was a big surprise to me while I watched it at Cinequest at the great California theater in San Jose. It's a musical, which I do not normally like, but I have to say that this was different. Robert Peters, who directed the film and looked at it, did a wonderful job. During his questions and answers, he told the audience that he only had two other people for his team. Most of the dialogue was invented on the fly and he really made the film while attending another film festival in Germany! I can not say enough about this movie, the only bad thing is that it really shows that the camera works and shakes a little. If you come across this movie, take a look!
