"Broadcast News" is directed by James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, As Good As It Gets) and has a great cast, which includes William Hurt, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. All give a good performance, but they are too unpleasant to really worry about them. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the film are really brilliant, like the prologue and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason why it does not work completely is that it is a film that is based on the characters are fun instead of having fun things happen to them. <br /> <br /> You could consider it nothing more than a drama, but often too dumb to succeed there too. Still, the script makes it worth a watch. Certainly not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 10
