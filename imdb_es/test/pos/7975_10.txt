This is an excellent movie and I would recommend it to everyone. Mr. Drury's performance is top-notch as it always is and combines well with the other actors in the film. I can not give away any of the suspense or drama that is in the movie. The hell to pay is a movie that must be seen !!! The plot was very suspense. I would watch this movie again and again because it has all the elements of a great western movie. It was very authentic in the way they showed the components related to this movie that includes weapons, horses and clothes. The soundtrack is nice and adds flavor to the movie. James Drury has the right touch when choosing a movie to get involved. This is another winner for the Western genre. !!!!!
