With its ww2 timing, falling in love and falling in love, and easy to see, Kira, this is a re-atonement. <br /> <br /> This is a relationship story with focused main characters that resolve the balance between first love and quick love on the domestic front of WW2. The poet Dylan Thomas philanders makes his way between his wife and his ex in Blitz London dark and smoky and later in the wind of Wales. <br /> <br /> The ex and the next of Vera unleash each other when the poet and the soldier become a band while the girls unite and share. An easy watch that works well in the bouncing era along with a few jumps in the beat. It would work well with the subtitles in French, but it is possible that lately you have seen too many artistic films.
