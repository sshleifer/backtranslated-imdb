Canthony is right to say that this short film is just an excuse to listen to a very young Judy Garland (fourteen years old!) Singing with a slightly older Deanna Durbin (one year old). But I must disagree with everything he said, including the execution time, which is about ten minutes, not twenty (one reeler). <br /> <br /> The song is not the best, obviously; But it's nice and it's definitely worth the ten minutes to see Turner. The duo with Durbin is quite interesting: two conflicting styles that, however, fit reasonably well. <br /> <br /> The short is just a discard, but it's not as bad as the other reviewer did. Honestly, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Dafydd ab Hugh
