WHAT AN AWESOME MOVIE !!!!!!!! I left the theater feeling dazed. The movie I had just seen was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I had my eyes glued to the screen. It is very symbolic, visually exuberant, beautifully engraved and magnificently said. Basically it is two people who move to an apartment and live side by side with their partners, who are supposed to have an affair with the other partners. Assuming this, our two heroes represent what they believe their peers are doing. There is an obvious repression of feelings among themselves, with the use of vouryistic camera work, body language and symbolic stairs. It's a visual feast, and hard to dislike. Part of the story becomes a bit confusing but that is nothing. The finale is one of the most beautiful (and anti-Hollywood) finishes I've seen in my life, and visually amazing. Disturbing punctuation movies add to the mood. I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and respect. What an excellent movie.
