The film begins with the director speaking to the camera and saying that he will show a story about the children of Brazila Street, whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive. In fact, the main character (Pixote) was played by a street boy of only 11 years old. What followed was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrifying movies I've seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with "Black Orpheus") and I've never forgotten it. I do not think I ever want to see him again, it was too much. <br /> <br /> Â¡SPOILER NEXT !!!! The scene that will not leave me is when Pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus. You do not see her do it ... but take a quick look at what came out. It's almost 20 years later and I just remember that the scene bothers me. SPOILER END !!!!! <br /> <br /> The movie becomes more brutal as it moves forward and ends in the only way it can. What worries me the most is that stories like this really happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and they are still happening today. <br /> <br /> A brutal and heartbreaking movie ... but you should see if you can handle it. . I am surprised that it has a grade of R: I have seen films with X classification that are less graphic. A 10.
