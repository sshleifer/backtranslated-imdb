This is an excellent bullet jumper from the war years. <br /> <br /> John Mills leads an excellent cast of British supporters of B-movies in a single-submarine attack on a fictitious enemy warship. <br /> <br /> Filmed in black and white, it has a good rhythm and is also well placed considering that at that moment a war was developing. In any case, it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda. <br /> <br /> The mission side of the film takes place in genuine submarines. Things are narrow and claustrophobic. The actors look suitably dirty and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate. Other commentators have already drawn attention to the small authentic details, such as maintaining the cut of the boat and forgetting to read the instruments, as well as the activities of the engine room. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first film in which the debris (and a dead German is ejected from the torpedo tube to deceive an enemy destroyer.) And this is the ONLY time I've seen part of the ship exposed with the pretext of sinking, a high risk bet if there ever was one. <br /> <br /> I'm a bit skeptical as to whether or not a submarine could make its way through a cable network. It was barely twice the speed of the human walk, and the network would have had a lot of "give." In addition, the engineer was in the same work station and operated the same levers both on the surface and submerged. also, it seems unlikely, since diesel or electric motors were used and they were in different sections of the ship, or so I was told. <br /> <br /> There was a little too much coastal drama for my taste But then, this It was a propaganda effort, and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to take into account their behavior, since it could negatively affect the morale of the service and, therefore, the war effort. <br /> <br /> These little adventure problems Nowadays, films of this type are usually projected in the evening, while much more modern and inferior films enjoy the prime time. But then; It is no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our European friends (too many of them are guilty conscience), or our own leftist fascists (none of whom have fought for the freedoms they now take for granted). <br /> <br /> As an underwater movie it is eminently collectable. Better than 'The Enemy Below', I think, although less demonstrative. It is not as authentic as 'Das Boot' in any way, but it is not so rude either.
