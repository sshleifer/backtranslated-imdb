I've searched for this movie for years. I have great memories of acting and singing first class in this movie. I never knew that the reason why the film was unattainable was due to the actions of the Gershwin family: what a shame to make them to try to repress them in the American Classic! I can only hope they give in and allow this movie to be released and enjoyed by the American public. <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis, Jr. is at his best in this movie. The only other performance of this kind is that it was the same in 'Anna Lucasta', another great movie that I would like to release on DVD. <br /> <br /> Porgy & Bess contained a top-notch star. to emit. Hopefully one day you can see for yourself.
