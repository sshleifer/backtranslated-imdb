Bergman's regular customers, Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann, acted as a village couple, Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story began with an ordinary couple who fight and make up. Jan was a sensitive person, but an escapist who isolated himself from the world. Eva is a practical woman who is fed up with her husband's lack of ambition. Because Jan was slow to fix his radio, they do not realize the impending war. Of course, the war came, and the film was a fascinating study of how they mutually transformed each other through the invasion, as they were mistreated by the enemy and by their own government. <br /> <br /> There was no musical score to the film, but the soundtrack was the noise of the war. In one scene, the background shot, the explosion and the sound of the fly on planes was incredible. From time to time, Bergman focused on facial expression as a different event occurred. When something violent happened, he approached so that the audience could perceive the violence instead of seeing it up close. Very well made movie.
