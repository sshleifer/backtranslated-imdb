Watch this movie. It is really a good walk through the difficulties of making an independent film, and what happens when it explodes in the face of the filmmaker. There are many things about punk rock, and the philosophy behind that movement and its relationship with this project. so if you like old punk, American punk, you'll dig ... but, beware, there are a lot of bits of bad acting from the failed project that are incorporated ... however, sometimes they are fun. and, in fact, some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in the filming pontificate and what happened in the three years it took to put this together. So anyone who is out there to make a film, especially if you have not been to film school or have not worked in the field, you should see this and learn from the filmmaker's mistakes.
