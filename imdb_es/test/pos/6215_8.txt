In the spirit of Great Space Coaster, but a few years before. <br /> <br /> Hot Fudge was one of the shows of psychedelic children I grew up in. Seymour was a big, fuzzy, green puppet, with a huge toothy smile that almost broke his head, I remember him using a variety of Elton John-like tones. <br /> <br /> He "played" the piano, and he had a guy who looked like Jesus in a white tuxedo sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then they would make a song about it. <br /> <br /> I do not remember much else except the opening theme, Seymour and the Hippie. <br /> <br /> Nobody else. I know you remember him at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it happened in Detroit as I said in a previous post, it was not just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the Squirrel of the Magic Garden (another psychedelic program for children, if there ever was one). People always talk about the effects of the music and movies of the 70s on LSD, but it seems that writers of children's programs also received a dose.
