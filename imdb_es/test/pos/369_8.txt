I was lucky that this movie came out on TCM, so I had the chance to see it. It's pretty hard to find, despite being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its flaws, some of which Hitchcock has repeated later. First, the ending is a bit too clean and "perfect". In the last scenes, until the last five minutes, there is an astonishing amount of tension; then, the five minutes clarify everything perfectly ... very unsatisfactory. The ending is also too dramatic, for a Hitchcock movie. He is, was and always will be the master of suspense ... why would he lean towards something as low as a cheap action sequence for the end? Apart from the few flaws, the movie is great. The plot is excellent; One of the best and most universal of all time. The topic? Simple. You meet a stranger. A perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you ... you know you have someone you want (although nothing more, subconsciously) dead. The capture? He asks you to do the same for him ... will you accept this strange and ingenious arrangement? You are free of suspicion, and he too ... after all, neither of you knew the victim. And they do not know each other, either ... they're just 'strangers in a train'. A brilliant concept, and one with which almost all people can relate. The pace is good, you never lose interest or patience. Cinematography is good, but not as good as in other better Hitchcock films. The performance is impeccable. The characters are well written, credible and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the same elements he often uses; The dominant mother, the son of the mother, etc. The movie is very good, but it feels a bit watery. He did not make that extra mile famous that he would have done great. He stopped before crossing the line between the common and the audacious. That's the main reason why the movie is not good, but mainly it's still good, with the potential to be more than that. The ending leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed. However, everything that leads to the end is very good, so the film still receives a deserved 8/10. Good, but not great. Any fan of Hitchcock should see it, since it is among its best ... a little lower on the list, but it's still there. I recommend it to any Hitchcock fan. 8/10
