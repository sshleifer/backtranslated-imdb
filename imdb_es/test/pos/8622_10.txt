I liked the movie but it should have been longer. The actors did a great job. Portia De Rossi is a fabulous actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a hottie. He did not look like John 100%, but he favored him from a distance. I hope to see more of him on the big screen. He did not have John's charisma, but he definitely has a charm about himself. He has beautiful eyes and a great smile. It reminds me a lot of my boyfriend. Mrs. Bissett was too panting for me. She should have that asthma checked. I will not comment on the character of Darryl Hannah. My mom always said: "If you can not say anything good, then shut up!" so that's what I'm going to do <br /> <br /> Molly
