You know you're watching softcore with an incorrect attitude when poor dubbing bothers you. I'm fine with shit lips timing, but the sound mix is ​​really too much. Every time someone says something it sounds like there is a narrator. Either way, this is more or less the purgatory between boring French professionalism and Joe D'Amato's celestial camps that involve cannibalism and all that. Do not get me wrong, there is a good deal of exploitation in this, but there is always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's sexy. It's a bit strange how sometimes you can see your bone structure, but it still rules over your white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game the frequency with which she takes your kit. Often. Every reason is good. Each person is good. Each place is good. A scene involves a whole hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes, the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast consists of some really vile-looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for everyone.
