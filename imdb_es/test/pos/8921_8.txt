Okay, some of the plot points may be a bit obvious, but above all it's an interesting idea that works towards a tight end. The performance is solid, especially Lachy Hulme, who plays one of the central characters of this piece of set. It certainly has presence on the screen and it is interesting to see. It has a low budget feel that works for the type of thriller / horror genre that Four Jacks belongs to. The film is not about taking seriously what adds to the overall charm. The character of Phil (Dave Serrafin) has to be one of the most annoying characters seen on the screen from Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy. It's worth adding to a bunch of weekend DVDs.
