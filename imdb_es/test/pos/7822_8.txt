This is a great Valentine's gift. A beautiful boy and a pretty girl fall in love while they try to beat the competition in a bakery contest. Very romantic. I am a true fan of Costas Mandylor since its days at Picket Fences and it has not lost its appeal. Lauren Holly is still lovely and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together. The cast was also good. Seeing all those wonderful desserts that were made was a delicious sight in itself. I loved that Costas and Lauren came together to win in the bakery competition and in love. This is the kind of movie that satisfies all palates, romantic or not. Hallmark always shows excellence in its programming and this is no exception. The whole family can see this movie. It also shows that sometimes love triumphs over any adversity. I found myself sighing and wanting more for this film and also craving those wonderful desserts. I recommend this movie highly for all ages. A great gift for everyone.
