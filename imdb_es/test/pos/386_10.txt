"Strangers on a train" was one of those movie classics that I had always heard about but somehow I never really got to see it. I finally saw it a few weeks ago and, as always with any Hitchcock movie, not only stood the test of time, but it far surpassed most of the thrillers that are being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action films here: the climactic finale with the merry-go-round out of control and the two dueling villains reminded me of the great action sequence at the end of "Speed" by Jan de Bont. "Of course," Strangers "is more than forty years older than" Speed ​​"and does not have modern special effects, but the visceral emotion is there, Hitchcock was a true genius. <br /> <br /> Not so subtle gay Bruno's side (Robert Walker in an amazing performance) has taken shape in many other psycho-stalking figures in future movies, consider it a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female." She knows about Guy even before she finds him. in the train, we almost feel that his contact is not accidental, and soon he is completely obsessed with it. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock loved the Oedipal elements in his films (Also see "Psycho" for more nuances Brazen) and there's a lot of that here, Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother, his effeminate forms and his obvious homosexuality must have vanished by the censors in 1951, when homosexuals are not " allowed "to be treated on the screen; however, Hitchcock receives the message effectively when we see Bruno in the lounge on the phone with a non-male tunic, flirting with Guy and answering his mother. <br /> <br /> The deep layers of this film make it a fast-paced thriller that you can go back to again and again, unfortunately it's remaking itself as a big-budget Hollywood production, but after seeing the original I honestly can not imagine anything that exceeds the emotion of this movie.
