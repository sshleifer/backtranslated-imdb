It does exactly what you expect, and then something. The first film, was a step ahead of the television show with more serious tricks that were issued without censorship and a serious factor that had increased. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more twisted. <br /> <br /> The acrobatics have become more dangerous and spectacular, with some painful follies sprinkled with funny scenes so that that smile becomes a knot of disgust. <Br /> <br /> As always, Knoxville dominates the proceedings, but this time he has reason to take center stage while volunteering for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts, and Bam Magera is also as savage as forever. , despite having his image attenuated in 'Viva La Bam'. Surprisingly, the infamous Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to participate in fewer parodies, despite being the center in previous outings. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez, you definitely will. Enjoy this movie and you will laugh during the 100 minutes, if you see it as childish, disgusting or a sad image of today's youth culture, you will find it as offensive as ever. So f ** k off.
