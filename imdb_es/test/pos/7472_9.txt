I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit - I love it! It's like Tarantino early, but better. It really is a must, but ... do not show this movie to anyone under 18 years old. It's full of blood and sex (the rape scene is great :)). Now I'm just waiting for other films by this director and a DVD release.
