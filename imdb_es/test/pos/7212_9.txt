These guys combine the low brow with the low budget. It is glorious. <br /> <br /> Look, if you want Bergman, rent "7th Seal" or something like that. If you want to see the gross humor and sex of exploitation, this is the only one. <br /> <br /> I think Jane Jensen like Julia makes everything visible. She can really act (really well), she is a complete dream ship, and it seems that she does not feel above all else.
