The direction is brilliant, the cast is remarkable (although I would have loved to have seen a little more of Aaron Lustig (of Y & R fame), who played Paul Shaffer). I only have two small comments about the film, as subtle as they are. One- Roebuck's Leno is excellent, but his presence on stage (that is, during what appears in the recording of one of his late episodes) is a bit disappointing. Two- the distribution of obscene language. I am willing to tolerate the rude language, as long as it is not used for free, and to some extent, the movie was free. The language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of Kates, otherwise well represented by Bates, by its frequent use, and served to make Roebuck's Leno a gift for its lack of use (of course, if the characters really they behaved in this way, congratulations to everyone). However, the piece is excellent in terms of television and video. I feel that the film had potential for the big screen, but it would also have required a cast of the small parts, and probably also a different director (the aesthetic sensation is that of the Larry Sanders show, good for HBO, mediocre for cinematographic purposes).
