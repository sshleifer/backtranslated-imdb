As I said in the other comment, this is one of the best movies for teenagers of all time and one of my favorites. For me, this movie is the second best movie for teenagers of all time. Second only to the breakfast club. The latest American virgin is also the most honest teen movie of all time. It is underestimated, and almost a film unknown to many people. It comes in TBS maybe once a year, but sometimes more. The first half of this movie is a sexual comedy with some honest scenes. then the second half is pure honest, and most of the time it would be. With just a few funny scenes. In my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time. I've never heard so many great songs in a movie before. There are 4 love songs in this movie that I think are some of the best love songs in history. the movie is about a pizza guy named Gary who is a virgin. He's in high school that has a couple of best friends. His two friends are sexual teenagers. The first half of the movie is almost a sexual misadventure. who are very funny Gary is important in love with the new girl at school. Later she discovers that her best friend is dating her. He also cheats on the side. You can really feel the love that Gary has for this girl. You can feel it even more in the second half. Gary's friend turns out to be a creep. But his other friend is very good. The film shows how people can be bad. You can relate to a lot of this movie. The plot sounds like your typical teen sex comedy. But it is much more than that. It is a very honest movie. It is also very 80ish that I love. If you love the 80s or you grew up in the 80s, rent this movie. but there may be some people who do not like the '80s, but you can still like this movie. The first time I saw this movie was in 1987, I think. It is very entertaining, and very fun. It combines very emotional moments with very funny moments. It is an underestimated gem! I have the movie, I love it! I give the last American virgin *** 1/2 out of ****
