Dan Ackroyd in his best stars as Johgn Burns, an escaped mental asylum who is posing as his own trip to La La Land and presenting a popular radio talk show, while the usual host (Charle Grodin in his excellent moment) takes vacations. Along the way, Ackroyd hooks up with Walter Matthau, a crazy co-worker, and the rest is pure hilarity. Ackroyd and Matthau play very well. Ackroyd's stunning real-life wife, Donna Dixon, is on par with the trip as another. The end feels a bit rushed and artificial, which is the only thing that prevents me from giving this movie my highest rating, an 8. A lost gem of the 80s.
