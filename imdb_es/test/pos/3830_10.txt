I did not realize how much of this episode was taken from The Enemy Below until I finally saw the movie (since it has become my favorite war movie). There were also a couple of elements that were raised from Run Silent Run Deep. There is nothing wrong with stealing ideas, as long as you do something great with them. And this time Roddenberry and company did something great with this. <br /> <br /> The story begins when the Romulans violate a 100-year-old treaty and cross the neutral zone and destroy a series of Federation outposts throughout the area. , apparently to test his superior armament and his invisibility screen (and his subsequent change in the balance of power between the Romulans and the Federation, in his opinion) as a prelude to a total invasion. Kirk has to decide if it is worth risking the war to try to stop the Romulan ship or if, in fact, the biggest risk lies in letting the invaders go after they destroyed 4 military posts. Kirk wisely chooses the latter. <br /> <br /> This is our first glimpse of an enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, a warrior race, but in their honorable way, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. However, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not renounce their violent and imperialist emotions and ways, even as they progressed technologically. <br /> <br /> None of this matters to Mr. Stiles, the navigator of the ship and the boss of this episode. antagonist on board the company (the Romulan commander has his own problems with a sub-officer of gung-ho). The only thing that matters is that he hates the Romulans and Spock seems one ... until the end when Spock saves his life (naturally). This contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander, neither of whom has any personal ill will toward the other. Both men are simply doing their duty. In fact there is a mutual respect. This is the first episode of Trek that deals directly with prejudice, and it does it with dexterity (unlike the "Let That be Your Last Battlefield" season 3). <br /> <br /> Like The Enemy Below We have a classic game of chess between two ship commanders who are very similar. You see immediately that these two captains are good ... VERY good. If you went to battle, you would want any of these men as your leader. Both are honorable and decent men who are bound. However, even though the Romulan commander is bound by the duty of his homeworld, he still finds himself wishing destruction before he can get home instead of starting another interstellar war. However, he still does everything he can to get home, just as Kirk does his best to stop him. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, one of the best 5 of Trek. It has everything: a lot of action, suspense, great dialogue, good acting (I still maintain that Romulan Commander was the best Trek role of Mark Lenard), and manages to make his social comments without being too much a preacher. A pity that Roddenberry forgot the last part when he did TNG. <br /> <br /> Watch this episode and then look at The Enemy Below.
