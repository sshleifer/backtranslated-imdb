I'm a big space fan, and at almost 44 years old, I just discovered this movie for the first time. I found it in an indirect way from Space 1999, then UFO. I went to look for other Anderson creations and discovered that this was his first live action work. What a square! I actually heard about this film many years ago, but I never knew what it was called, so I'm happy to have found it by accident. <br /> <br /> These Anderson's were amazing in their writing, the execution of completely credible and realistic looking models, the quality of the performance, etc. <br /> <br /> I do not think it looks outdated at all. Let me tell you ... I'll take good old models over the fake-looking CGI crap of today ANYTIME! Seriously, most of the rocket scenes seemed real enough. They had it up to a science! If you decide to think about what you are seeing as real, it is not hard to really believe it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the amount of detail in the scenography designs, the beautiful photography, the whole look. .. man, I wish I could go back to that time! They knew how to make great movies in the 60s. Personally, today I lost all interest in Hollywood movies. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate it! Bring the models back! Think of all the people who use the style! Anyway, I'm ranting. :-) If you like good science fiction that is very well done, you will do a service observing this.
