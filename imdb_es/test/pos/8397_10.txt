What the wind took away is one of the most popular books that have been printed. It is, by far, the movie of all the films. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett made people dream all over the world and turned the main actors into movie icons. One can ask, is it really necessary to make a sequel? And ... there are some big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> Well, first there was the book. 'Scarlett' by Alexandra Ripley is, we have to admit, well written and respectful of the world created by Margaret Mitchell. It picks up exactly where we left our heroine before and delicately brings us from Mitchell's legacy to his own fantasy. In the book Scarlett, defeated after the death of Melanie and the departure of Rhett, travels to Charleston to reside with her mother-in-law in hopes of recovering Rhett's love. Their typical manipulative behavior once again evokes Rhett's criticisms and further alienates them ... until a certain boat trip that will change everything. Scarlett now carries a secret. The series follows the book quite accurately until Scarlett arrives in Ireland. From then on, book and series are slowly divided. The actual ending differs, but, of course, both have Scarlett and Rhett together. <br /> <br /> The production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the upcoming Scarlett O'Hara. Many countries made their own television shows with young actresses auditioning for the role. Finally, about twelve girls were chosen to participate in the final screen tests and interviews in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the producer did not find Scarlett among these actresses. Sad for the girls, great publicity for the program (it had already been sold to many television stations around the world before the filming began). Robert Halmi, the producer who bought the rights to 'Scarlett', said he discovered the right actress while watching television, who called her and two days later signed the agreement. It's not Vivien Leigh, but it's certainly Scarlett! It's not Vivien Leigh, but it's Scarlett! Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who starred in 'Willow' and 'Scandal', the last movie was Robert Halmi was watching that faithful night)! Her performance is not a copy of Leigh, she makes the character her own. The main difference between GWTW and 'Scarlett' is the fact that the main character evolves and grows as a person. This is the prerogative of the series, why copy something that has been done before? Taking into account that there is a gap of almost seventy years between the first and the second plot, it is natural that both authors emphasize different aspects of the characters. While Mitchell works with Scarlett to deal with the consequences of the civil war and fight for Tara, Ripley lets Scarlett face her demons. For me, this is the most interesting aspect of the series. We know Scarlett in a different way, since she learns that not everything can always go as she wants. I totally agree with the choice of Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler. He portrays it with charm and irony and is less a cardboard figure than the performance of Clark Gable. The rest of the cast was well chosen. Julie Harris is endearing as Rhett's mother, John Gielgud gives a very funny performance, since Grandpa Robillard and Sean Bean are always at their best playing a dirty character, their Lord Fenton is no exception. The bad decisions, however, with Stephen Collins as Ashley and Ann-Margret, the Belle Watling adaptation was a waste of money. Costumes, sets and locations are elaborate and convincing. The new set of Tara looked exactly the same and is a sequence in motion in the series when the house appears for the first time. <br /> <br /> Is there any point in making a sequel ... Well, six hours? of romance are for me. One to watch!
