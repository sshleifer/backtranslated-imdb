This is a film that all children should see before growing up and distorting, often transmitting ideas from generation to generation of families. I grew up in two different places, although only 20 miles away. I went to school and had friends of all creeds and religions of color during the first 8 years of my life. Then I moved to Hillbilly Country (though not anymore) where it was very unusual to even have an African-American child in your class. My graduation from high school had 2 or 3 African Americans (God, why can not I just say black? You can call me a honky or a white, or whatever!) All this political correctness bothers me like most of the Anyway!) Anyway, back to the movie, try this to see what happens when people have a distorted vision or just what ignorance or lack of understanding does to a culture or a country! This is an excellent movie that everyone should see especially children.
