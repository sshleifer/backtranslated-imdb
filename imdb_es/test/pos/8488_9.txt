A couple of days ago I saw the impressive "House of sand and fog" and I was impressed by the incredible performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. I decided to see "Ray", trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Oscar for best lead actor. After seeing Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: he really deserved to be awarded. I like Ray Charles, he was not his fan, but it's amazing how Jamie Foxx looks like him. The film has the full support of Jamie Foxx, who participates in most of the shootings, and his movements on stage seem as if he were a reincarnation of Ray Charles. Regarding the story, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long but also very nice, with many songs and beautiful scenes that mainly show a drug addict Ray Charles. My biggest surprise was discovering that Ray Charles was a heroin addict and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the film. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ray"
