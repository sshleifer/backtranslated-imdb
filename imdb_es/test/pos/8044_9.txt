The Assignment is an exceptional thriller with several twists in the plot driven by the character, instead of twists in the star, the need to organize special effects, mandatory romance and the endless car chases. However, there is a car chase here, and a dandy is. Aidan Quinn is wonderful since both the terrorist and the naval officer "recruited" to eliminate him. It is rare that a second or third level actor, such as Quinn, is given an important leading role such as this one who takes a movie. In general, a role of this type is assigned to an actor from list A with a box office draw, which is probably the reason why I never heard of this film before seeing it. Donald Sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous agent, sometimes a bit creepy, who recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is also fine as an Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are several story lines, which converge gradually towards the end, and not all at once as we are used to seeing. The paranoia and claustrophobia of this type of thrillers are captured and portrayed with moral ambiguity and terrifying intensity. The locations are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is not special, but we rarely get all the qualities mentioned above in these days, without silly and / or meaningless plot developments; unconvincing star turns; noisy, annoying soundtracks, of music video type; a villain who attacks him; and repeatedly a cast, costumes and plot that are aimed primarily at a public under 25 years. This is an exceptional thriller, that surely will not come out with its release. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
