I also watched The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I have to confess, the only reason I went to see him is because I'm a big fan of Callum Keith Rennie. And I was not disappointed. He gave a good interpretation of a rather unfriendly character and gave the only comic relief in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The film itself is the usual story of 'many bad people caught in a snowstorm'. But I had a couple of turns that made me guess. The characterizations were strong and all the cast worked quite well. The only problems I had with the cast were Rose McGowan. It was so cold throughout the film that we did not realize the personality or motivations of his character. Apart from her and some small problems with continuity, this was a well-written and well-performed thriller.
