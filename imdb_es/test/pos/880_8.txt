Jewel Thief is * THE * Bollywood crime thriller, and why should not it be? It is directed by the greatest exponent of crime thriller art in Indian cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance): <br / > <br /> 1 address by Vijay Anand 2 RD Burman music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri <br /> <br /> Even if Jewel Thief is not a Bond movie, it definitely has kindly babies . Helen, Tanuja and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos). But our sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is nothing other than Bond. He is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story almost always leads him as confused as we are. He even flirts with Anju (Tanuja) trying to hit his romantic nerve, only to be able to work in his father's shop. <br /> <br /> Dev Anand could have a double role, well, I do not want To spoil your movie or if I had not told you. That's what most of the mystery is about. Dev Anand works in a jewelry store and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work, although he is not, or at least has a perfect alibi. We wonder who did it, it is Dev Anand as 'Vijay' the person who claims to be or is 'Loving' someone we have not yet seen, but many people claim that it looks like him. There comes 'Shalu' (Vyjayanthimala) who even claims that he is his fiancé, in a tense situation that Dev Anand has to prove that he is Vinay and not Amar. While everyone wonders if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar, she is asked to remove her socks. Amar tell us that he has 6 digits on one of his feet. While we watch with great anticipation the events that are about to unfold, Dev Anand even finds time to joke. <br /> <br /> The real-life brothers, director Vijay Anand and actor Dev Anand have many movies with each other, not the best of them, but definitely the best in Crime Thriller. <br /> <br /> There are times of North by Northwest of Hitchcock, but the films are very different. Except for the confusion about who is who, a treacherous woman and many who travel there do not have much similarity. Dev Anand could very well be Amar besides being Vijay. People have seen it, they identify it wherever they go. There are too many people to make this a fraud. Finally, Vinay thinks that it is better to go ahead with being Love to discover what the truth is, and it is a sad mistake. He goes too far into it, only to be saved by the turns of the cinema. <br /> <br /> When I saw the film as a child I definitely did not have fun, the ending completely confused me. Even now there are parts about the ending that I do not like, but I would recommend this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Even as a child I enjoyed the songs that this movie has to offer. 'Yeh dil ...' - a song of defined moccasins in the voice of Kishor Kumar. I could hear 'Rulake gaya ...' all day. The same goes for 'Aasmaan ke neeche' which is 'under the sky' of Gangtok (at least the story line suggests it). 'Raat akeli hai' is the sexiest song that comes out of Hindi cinema and presents Tanuja as the seductress. 'Meri taraf dekho' - Helen's cabaret and we 'look at it'. 'Hothon pe ...' - now, there could be a better thriller of a song than this one. As the song progresses, we are more tense than ever and the words "hidden in Shalu's lips" add to it.
