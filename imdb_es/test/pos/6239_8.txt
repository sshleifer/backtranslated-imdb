Despite a silly premise, ridiculous plot devices and low budget, Tourist Trap <br /> <br /> manages to be surprising. An inventive film, beautifully punctuated, a must see. You have to throw rationality out the window to fully appreciate what the director was trying to do. If you can handle it, you will receive a pleasant surprise. Also keep in mind that this is one of the few semi-classic horror films that were not spoiled by numerous sequels.
