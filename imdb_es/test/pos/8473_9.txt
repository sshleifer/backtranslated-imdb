A masterful performance by Jamie Foxx is just one of the highlights of "Ray", a 2004 film also starring Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau and many others, who provide a excellent support for the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has several main focuses: the first is Charles's childhood: the drowning of his brother George who persecuted him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him and the strength his mother taught him - No lean, do not break, never be crippled. She finally sends him to a special school where Charles's music gift is discovered. The next focus is the artistic evolution of Charles as a singer similar to Nat King Cole, his gospel music arrangements, his foray into country music and the unique sound that became Ray Charles. The third focus is Charles's personal life: his marriage to Bea, his many issues, his addiction to heroin and his eventual rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> Because Charles lived 74 full years, many things are skipped. Although Charles was orphaned in his adolescence, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, is not in the film. While appearing on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs, his near-starvation as a musician is not covered. At one point, he found a jar of jelly and tried to eat it, but the jar broke. He was like that from below and outside. Bea shows up with him when the state of Georgia, which banned him, adopted "Georgia on My Mind" as his main theme in 1979 and welcomes Charles to his home state, but he and Bea divorced in 1977, which not mentioned. . She was probably there, though. Besides, she was not his only wife; he was married once before he met her; That marriage is not covered. In the film, we are told about an illegitimate child: there was 12. It would have been impossible to get all that and more in a movie. <br /> <br /> What is not omitted is his glorious music, which seems to continue constantly throughout the film, continuously reinforcing his genius and his art. <br /> <br /> Charles's story is compelling and keeps the public's interest at all times. Those who make fun of him like a movie made for television do not give him the credit he deserves. The direction of Taylor Hackford gives "Ray" a good rhythm, and the film has a great atmosphere and beautifully evokes the different decades. <br /> <br /> While Ray, Jamie Foxx lives in the character and makes one forget that he is a comedian. A part Foxx used prosthesis, played his own piano and spent a lot of time with Charles preparing for the role. He nails it, but he is not a personification, he is a man of flesh and blood with hallucinations of standing in the water and finding his brother's body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hating the word addicted and believing that he is not hooked; and denies his home life, thinking that his wife does not know about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the film, boy); and a man who took a terrible advantage early in his career because of his blindness, which refuses to be stepped on later. He demands that he be paid in $ 1 bills so they can be counted; When he discovers that it is a train full of salsa for the owner of a club and his partner and was almost cheated by a record deal, he makes his own deal and leaves his job. <br /> <br /> One does not marvel at Foxx's performance as much as accepting him as Ray from the first time he appears on the camera. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent biography that, like "Walk the Line" is marked with the fantastic music of the artist. Whether you're a fan of Ray Charles or not, "Ray" is something to experience.
