I loved this movie as a child. It seems I can not find it anywhere! I mentioned it to some friends the other day, and none of them remembers it! Can someone help me? My older sister remembers it vaguely. There was also another movie that I remember that was half live action and half animation, but I can not remember the name. The characters were animated and the background was real ... I seem to remember that it is a kangaroo, and I think the setting for the film was in Australia. I'm going crazy trying to get copies of these movies that were such a memorable part of my very nice childhood. Edit: I searched in IMDb for this other movie and discovered that it is called Dot and the Kangaroo! All I had to do was type "kangaroo" in the search bar below the characters, and the name of the movie on the list was like a bell that rings! MAN, I love IMDb! Thank you!
