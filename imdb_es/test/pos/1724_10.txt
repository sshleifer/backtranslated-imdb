I write this after watching the last episode aired in the UK, and for me it must be a difficult job to maintain the standard. The last episode that is shown called "Blink" has elements of Gothic horror that have to do with statues that are not exactly what they seem. The doctor and Martha do not seem like much, but that does not detract from a well-crafted episode. The general standard has been built to a high level and the last three episodes, the two parterios with "La Familia" and the last one for me have been the best that the current team has done. <br /> <br /> It's not just David Tennant keeping him together, the whole week of the support cast, week after week, they are also helping. For those who wait for series 3 abroad, the wait is worth it.
