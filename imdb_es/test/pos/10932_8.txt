"Eagle's Wing" is a pleasant surprise of a movie, and keeps the viewer interested. I did not know anything about what the British had done until I read the comments of the other spectator. I can understand why he won a prize for cinematography, since he presented himself brilliantly and had to look magnificent on a big cinema screen. <br /> <br /> He seemed to be much more realistic than most westerns, portraying how the West was more truly won. As well as the complexities of the characters he presents. The character of Indian-Sam Waterson is particularly intriguing. He seems to be brutal in the wild environment to which he is conditioned, but he shows a remarkable respect for the frailties he has in the white men and women he meets. He is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders in his lands, but he has a limit in his sense of revenge, even a compassion when he is in a position of power and observing the withered white man bent on revenge, as well as the girl. He kidnaps after capturing a stagecoach. As such, his character seems complex but congruent with the harsh lands in which he lived and which were threatened by these intruders with whom he is not cruel in his dealings with. <br /> <br /> The magnificent riding horse is a critical link & it is interesting to see how this Indian manages it, compared to the character of Martin Sheen who has it in his power and power for a while. "Eagle's Wing" is an unusual western, a genre that does not appeal to me, but I really appreciate this excellent offer, which in the second place would only qualify as "A Man Called Horse".
