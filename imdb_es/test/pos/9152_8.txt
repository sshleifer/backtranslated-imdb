The Rogue Rogue is a wonderful period piece. It represents the Paris of the 145th century with great Hollywood style, but offers a darker side to the existence there, as it would be experienced by the poor. And the snow. It is constantly spinning, which increases the gravity of the stage, brilliant! The scene is reinforced by the strange cast of characters, including beggars, cripples and dwarves. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore presents a brilliant performance, surpassed only by the magnificent Conrad Veidt, who plays a degenerate, dissolved Louis XI to perfection. And yes, Veidt grabs his nose on purpose, pushing his representation to marvelously ironic limits.
