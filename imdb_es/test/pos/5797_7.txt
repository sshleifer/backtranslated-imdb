In Russia, the ordinary teenager Vera (Negalya Negoda) lives a quiet life with her drunken father and her simpleton mother, not working and waiting for the call of a telephone operator technical course. His brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with his own family and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and Vera, always being a reason to argue. When Vera meets the student of the Sergei University (Andrei Sokolov), they fall in love and decide to get married. Sergei moves to Vera's house, but lives in conflict with his father. This relationship leads the family to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> I just saw "Malenkaya Vera", and I really liked this deep family drama. I am not familiar with the lifestyle in the former USSR, but there are some unusual behaviors that I find very interesting. The first, when Victor tells Vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her, but because they wanted to move to a bigger apartment. Another, when the family goes to the beach in a truck. Many difficulties of Vera's family and friends, the repression in the park and other situations depicted in the film are common in Third World countries. This low budget movie is very well directed and the story is very deep and real. The cast has great performances and the actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. On the cover of the Brazilian VHS, published by the Sagres distributor, there is information that Natalya Negoda was the central page of Playboy magazine. I'm not sure how accurate the subtitles are in Portuguese, since many long sentences that are spoken in Russian are limited to a short translation in a few words. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pequena Vera" ("Little Vera")
