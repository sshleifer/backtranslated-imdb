Big show! It is time for a reality show to close the generational gaps. Contestants vary in age, some seem old enough to have seen the movie when it first came out. And others, they seemed so young that perhaps the parents or the teachers passed the film hoping that it touched their lives as it once touched them. Fat really has become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining film in which young and old can relate. "You're the one we want" will surely win even more followers of Grease. The only thing I wish would have been more in the character's story, then, again, it's kind of nice to leave some of that to the nostalgic imagination of the 50s. I can not wait to see the next show ... and then on Broadway !
