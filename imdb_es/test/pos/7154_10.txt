Wow, I just captured this Blockbuster movie and I love finding gems like this. Although it was definitely recorded in a budget and lost a bit in the clumsy edition (that is, in the scenes of a hospital, in the second place, until the end), for a first effort of direction, I give it 10 stars ! I loved the concepts that provoke reflection, and if you are a free thinker and open to ideas out of the ordinary, I recommend this movie. I think the director and writer, Jay Floyd, should get some attention and more opportunities in the film industry. According to his credits, it can be another Quentin Tarantino.
