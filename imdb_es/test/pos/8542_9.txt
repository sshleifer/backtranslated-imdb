It's been almost 25 years since I saw this movie. I would consider this film as an all-time classic in a drama category. Anthony Queen gives one of the most wonderful performances in history. In a matter of minutes it takes you from laughter to tears. This film represents a splendid image of how humanity changed after the Second World War. How a large part of that generation and the next ones lost their innocence. It has taken me a long time to find this film by its name "hour 25". These types of films are not a source of income, but they are a treasure for some. I am very surprised that this movie is not widely used for the media so that more people enjoy this image.
