I saw this movie when I was very young and I lived in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood and I told him how much I enjoyed seeing him in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This film was directed by Jacques Tourneur and, in addition to Jean Peters, in the leading role. It also stars Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. He also starred in "Viva Zapata" with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, who won an Oscar for playing the role of Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando played Zapata) (1952). And he also starred in "Captain from Castile" (1947) with Tyron Power. Since then, I've been trying to find a place where it's available, but so far I have not succeeded. Does anyone have any suggestions on where I can find and buy this movie? This comment contains spoilers, I do not know it.
