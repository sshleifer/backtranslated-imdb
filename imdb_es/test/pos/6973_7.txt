** SPOILERS ** Simple movie about simple people whose problems are too complex for them to handle. <br /> <br /> Natalie, also known as Sara Ravenna, Shirley Knight, has been overwhelmed with married life and the fact that she is now pregnant. It is the straw that breaks the back of the camel. When taking off from her homes in Long Island, New York, Natalie has no idea where she is going, but hopes to find peace and tranquility somewhere in the heart of America. It's on the Pennsylvania Turnpike that Natalie picks up hitchhiker Jimmie "Killer" Kilgannon, James Cann, who seems as lost and confused as she is. When Natalie, who called herself Sara at that time, soon realizes that Jimmie had suffered a serious concussion while playing football on her collage team and had been reduced to such a simple individual that she is so passive that she lets all, even later in the movie. Natalie, step on it all. <br /> <br /> Nice at first Natalie feels very upset about Jimmie's self-pity for not defending herself and letting herself be used as a rug by everyone she comes in contact with in the movie. Not knowing what to do with Jimmie Natalie, as a child, he finally gets him a job in distant Nebraska as a janitor at the Reptile Jungle pet market, Mr. Alfred, Tom Aldrege. Being the kind and simple person that Jimmie is, he lets all the animals out of their cages causing havoc in the pet store and his boss, Mr. Alfred, dismisses him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie who thought she was finally finished with Jimmie, returns to the Reptile Jungle when she receives a fine by traffic police Gordon, Robert Duvall. It seems that Mr. Alfred is also the interim county judge and is the person to whom Natalie must pay the traffic ticket. While all this was happening, Gordon, the policeman, had developed a great fondness for Natalie and wanted to take it to the bag, to his motor home, the first opportunity he could. Gordon, a widower with an uncontrollable daughter of 12 years, Rosalie, Marva Zimmet, needs a mature woman, with much love, to make him forget his many social and psychological problems, and Natalie is exactly the medicine that the doctor prescribed! <Br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** Final wild and shocking with Gordon completely crazy and trying to rape Natalie, who rejected his drunken advances, which finally made Jimmie out of his stupor of self-pity and came to his rescue. There is not a happy ending here with Natalie saved from being abused and raped by Gordon, but Jimmie, who was bouncing Gordon like a ping-pong ball, ended up dead for all his good and noble efforts. <br /> <br /> Jimmy was the most tragic and sympathetic person in the whole movie. All Jimmie wanted was a friend to talk to and spend time with, and all he got was stick crap. For everyone, even the only person who initially treated him with kindness and understanding with Natalie Ravenna! In the end, Jimmie, even though everyone treated him as dirty, despite his willingness not to offend, even those who trampled him turned out to be the nicest and, at the same time, heroic in the whole movie.
