For those who appreciate the intersection of silent movies and social commentary, this is a unique movie. In part homage to German expressionism, partly allegory, the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals everything seen since the 1920s. In addition, the attention to detail of the period and the visual composition of the scenes as an instrument to advance the story is impressive. Apart from this, the plot offers an interesting comment on the role of the media in society and its effect on the social voice, perception and opinion. In truth, it is not so much the silence that permeates the film as it is the loss of voice and the loss of words to communicate and express the thought that inevitably follows. In short, this film is something that is not often seen and, as the producer of the film said in the questions and answers that followed, it will leave you thinking about its meaning until the next day.
