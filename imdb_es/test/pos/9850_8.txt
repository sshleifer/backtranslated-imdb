If you have not heard of this movie, follow two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America, where they convince themselves that they will find success and wealth. Life is more difficult than expected in the United States, and this film captures beautifully the frustration that you feel when things are not going well. Lives are captured very well, many moments seem programmed because they are so perfect. Whether at work, at school or in between, the two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the filmmakers and make some very stimulating comments about life in the United States. It's one of the only documentaries that I remember that, when it was over, I wanted it to last another two hours. It can be hard to find this movie because you did not get a large distribution, but check your local "house of art" or an independent theater and give it a shot (side note, if you're reading this when it's already in video) it's definitely worth a rental). Score: 28/40
