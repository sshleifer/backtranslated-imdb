The world is going to miss John Frankenheimer. This was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second, but do not let that deter you from looking for him. The direction of Frankenheimer is assured, and he gets some convincing interpretations of his cast. <br /> <br /> Someone else has already pointed them out, but I also want to talk about James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two key supporting roles. Both would work again for Frankenheimer, especially Gregory as the clumsy senator in "The Manchurian Candidate," and they do a good job for him here. <br /> <br /> If everything seems too simple at the end, that is simply because Frankenheimer and the writer Robert Dozier chose to tell a simple story, and they do it well. Stay tuned, since Turner Classic Movies could show it again.
