I'm surprised that so many viewers have not found all the symbolism in the film ... it's what made the film an incredible work of art! The story is about some of the saddest content that a movie can have, however, it is one of the best movies I've seen in my life due to the need of your own imagination and the brilliance of the story. <br /> <br /> If you pay close attention, the message is there. The younger brother is killed by the stepfather. The older brother invented the story of the car's flight as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death. There are those who argue why he would lie to his own children with the story. For me, the answer is because he does not want to share such ugliness with his own children, or because he has blocked and replaced his memory of the horrifying event with the thought of his brother flying to a safe place. I have read some of the criticisms that believe that he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered. Although this is an interesting idea, I love the imagination I used to have. I do not think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother. But, I think it's plausible that he would have lied about his little brother's death. However, I like the idea of ​​a much better ending than the idea that the film did not have any symbolism. <br /> <br /> There are many different shots you can have in the movie, but if you take it in the movie face value ... two brothers who create a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather: you've missed the brightness. The fact that I was able to see the subtle messages in the script was what made the movie so incredible to me. It requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work ...... it deepens when you look at it. You will be surprised by the genius contained in the film. The only other movie I've seen so close to in symbolism and subtle messages is Pleasantville ... but that's a comment for another movie!
