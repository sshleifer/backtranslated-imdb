Totally disgusting and cheap obscene humor. I loved!!! It is the most disgusting and totally horrible movie, with the exception of Nicolas Read, who plays an undead Court Jester, comedic brilliance. But anyway, I laughed so many times and I have to give it to the filmmakers, it was not pretentious or ordinary in any way. Rapes, fights, zombies throwing up on their rape victims. What other movie does this have? Not for the quesy, but with a pizza, a bong and a pack of six beers, you have it done, if you have a cast iron stomach and a youthful sense of humor like me.
