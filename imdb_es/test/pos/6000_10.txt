Gulliver's Travels is, at first, a satirical novel written by a great misanthrope named Jonathan Swift. That is why it is not recommended to judge of this movie, only by itself. We must go deeper into the consciousness of Man to get to the point where Swift would have taken us. Gulliver has lived a journey of truth, of solitude, of apprehension of what his true life can be. We can not just sit down and watch that movie, saying it's so cute or boring. The issue goes much further than that and I would like everyone to expect that. This is the best movie in history, to the extent that you can feel the truths that emerge from the character of Ted Danson: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver.
