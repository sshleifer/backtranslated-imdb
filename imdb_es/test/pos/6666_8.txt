Kevin Spacey returns to choose a winner with K-PAX, an endearing film that expresses deep revelations about human existence through the naive point of view of the character Prot, but at the same time, undoubtedly wise. to solve "if it is or is not" as the plot expands and the character of Robert Porter becomes reality. However, some may find the end a bit unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> My few problems with the film revolve around the caricature and about the simplified description of mental patients. I was surprised because the plot of the movie shows a lot of intelligence and I do not think I would have lost anything by being more honest about how people with mental health problems behave. <br /> <br /> That said, I realize This was a movie and not a documentary and the film itself is exquisitely filmed and the story unfolds at a pleasant pace. <br /> <br /> Bridges is great and Spacey offers a languid and relaxed performance, more like a stand-up than an alien. <br /> <br /> A good movie that will make you talk with your friends.
