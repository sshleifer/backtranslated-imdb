I love this movie. and the Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing anymore. I think you should definitely put Susie Q in the air at least one night so we can record it. But if not, does anyone know where I can find it? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please send me an email if you know where I can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my children about this movie and I think they deserve to see it too. All these Disney films that are coming out now are fake and boring. I need Susie Q back !! It was a great movie and it had great actors and I do not see why it was removed from the air. If everyone likes this movie so much, why did they take it off the air? Please take my comment into consideration and along with all the other comments made to this film. Thank you, have a good day.
