This comedy of 1931 improves with each visualization due to the comedic talents of Marion Davies and the excellent performance of C. Aubrey Smith. Smith plays a rough old man who reunites his older children (since his youth as a rake) in his last years. One is American (Davies), one English (Ray Milland who seems to be 18) and another Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises as the plot moves along with Ralph Forbes (he has no appeal at all) falling in love with Davies. <br /> <br /> Davies and Smith are simply wonderful together and very touching. Davies can also do some dances and make some "big" tickets. And, of course, Davies is simply magnificent. <br /> <br /> Halliwell Hobbes, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and David Torrence, co-stars. If they had awarded prizes of the Oscar prizes in 1931, Smith could have been nominated. He is simply excellent at this gem.
