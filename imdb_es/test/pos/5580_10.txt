This is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of all the series. The production values ​​are in a class of their own. The characters are rounded and interesting. This is entertainment at its best. Some of the aliens are quite grotesque, but there is an underlying humor that makes it inescapable. I hope this series goes on for many years and has many side effects. Science fiction has had bad press, some justified, but this is truly an iconic science fiction series and I thank Henson for that. The best notes.
