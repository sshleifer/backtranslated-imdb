Let's not go down the road here, Taylor Hackford's clever film, no doubt, has little to make him stand out from the biographical genre aside from Jamie Foxx's exceptional performance in his career. Do you remember the year they delivered the special effects Oscar to the boffins of Terminator 2, unopposed? They should do the same with this year's Best Actor gong. <br /> <br /> The fact that Ray Charles's story is worth filming is not disputed. In fact, the many flashbacks of his traumatic childhood are well managed and used judiciously. But for such a unique life, the film seems incredibly formulated and familiar. Follow the template of 'the story of a defective genius' almost to the letter: hardship and exploitation, women and drugs, recording disputes, disputes between bands, rehabilitation, yes, yes, yes. And surely there was more humor in your life than you treat us here? <br /> <br /> I appreciate Charles's music, however, where the well-cut jellyfish would have kept the story moving, Hackford surrenders himself with almost all his strength. -Reproductions of too many songs - in gin unions, in the recording studio, in concert halls, infinite. Narratively, and for non-devotees, they begin to act as a cinematic brake. This may seem like a harsh judgment on a biographical film, but with a catalog as extensive as Ray's, we do not need to try the whole dish. Otherwise, we would buy the albums. <br /> <br /> Intrigued as I was, I looked at my watch more than once. So, for all of Foxx's brilliance, could Ray have been better served as a two-band HBO?
