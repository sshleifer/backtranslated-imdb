I'm not sure how the "weighted average" of IMDb got such a low rating in this movie. It is in my opinion and for all the other accounts a jewel of an overlooked movie. Rip Torn is fantastic as the headstrong Noel Lord and Tantoo Cardinal as his housemate. Torn and Cardinal are underestimated actors who are finally given a stage to work on their craft. <br /> <br /> Your relationship is not always pleasant, but it is very real. This is NOT the "humiliating and touching love story" that is advertised on the DVD cover. In the end it is a tragedy. Lord simply points too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the electric company to move. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, as are the established periods.
