Contemporary New Yorkers with this film will remember the reflectiveness of their time and how well the cast and crew captured America, the New York City of that era. <br /> <br /> Norman Wexler's script delineates the different worlds in the various subgroups he lives in and the direction of Avildsen brings out phenomenal performances. The prodigious talent of Peter Boyle is shown as never before or since. Clearly, he is the best character that Dennis Patrick has ever achieved. <br /> <br /> What I will always remember about JOE is the feeling of having been in a virtual state of shock leaving the theater. Knowing that what the image portrayed was boiling beneath the surface in the neighborhoods of the five boroughs of New York City. <br /> <br /> This movie should be remembered.
