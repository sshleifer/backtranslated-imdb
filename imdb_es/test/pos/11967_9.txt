"East Side Story" is a documentary of musical comedy in the Stalinist Russia and later in the Eastern European satellite comedies, with many clips of the films and comments of the survivors. Although some of the Stalinist films are laughing badly (The Bright Road (?) Is a notable exception), the films of the sixties look pretty good. "My wife wants to sing", "The White Mouse" and "Midnight Revue" seem particularly entertaining. The producers had to deal with the censors, who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, humorous in retrospect, since the people whom the censors tried to appease were the same people who supported the realization Of the movies. begin with! Since musical comedies were quite rare behind the Iron Curtain (there were only about forty in forty years) they had a disproportionate effect on their audiences, who made important successes in some of the films. <br /> <br /> I realize that the sound for the films of the sixties was much better. Managers often had to cope with outdated equipment and strict energy regulations, had to shoot in shots of seven minutes or less, and with dangerous officers. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong influence on "Hot Summer". It's possible that the latest films are not up to "Singin 'in the Rain", but they certainly seem to beat "Bye Bye Birdy"
