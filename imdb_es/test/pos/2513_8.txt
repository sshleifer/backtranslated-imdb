This is an unusual movie because even though it was made by Twentieth Century Fox because she is one of the few couples of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had been making films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) at about the time she did THIS IS MY BUSINESS, but Taylor was a player hired by MGM, so she only appeared in this movie because she they lent to Fox ... Something that studies did occasionally during this era. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, although the piece is pure fiction. You will see actors who play William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I can not remember any movie with McKinley or Dewey as a character, although I do remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND THE LION and a couple of other films. Three applauses for seeing a "minor president" in a movie as an important character! <br /> <br /> The film begins when McKinley takes a young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) aside and asks him to be a special agent for him, and does not tell anyone, not even the Secret Service. This is because the president fears that someone inside the agency is informing a gang that has been committing a long series of robberies, all based on internal information. So it's up to Taylor (who is NOT known for his male roles, especially at this stage of his career) to pose as a bully and find the responsible gang member AND the inner man. <br /> <br /> However, there are two serious complications. First, while he can find the gang members, one of the gang's stepsisters is Stanwyck. Taylor discovers that he has fallen in love with her, but must also fulfill his duty and deliver them to the authorities. Second, because McKinley is the only other person who knows the truth, SERIOUS problems develop when McKinley is killed and Taylor is on death row for the crimes. <br /> <br /> The film did a good job of creating a story and placing it in a historical context. While most people today do not remember McKinley or remember that he was killed, the film is set in this interesting period of time. The acting is pretty decent, since the stars are supported by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, although I must admit that the role of Donlevy was quite moderate and ordinary compared to many of his other film roles. In general, it's very interesting, it's well written and it's not too dumb in the romance department. A good exit for all.
