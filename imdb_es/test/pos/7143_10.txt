Easily one of my favorite television drama movies, in many ways, beautiful but sad, touching and stimulating, this is a magnificent dramatization of some years in the life of C.S. Lewis and his relationship with Joy Davidman. I found it incredibly absorbing with the dialogue and the excellent and "realistic" situations. Everything seemed very "real", but there were also "magical" moments that almost left you breathless with joy. Ackland and Bloom as the central characters were excellent, as was the cast. It is one of those dramas that I find difficult to criticize, simply because, for me, there is nothing to criticize, it just works very well on many levels. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
