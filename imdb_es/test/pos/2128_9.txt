This movie was very cute and very appropriate girl. My nieces have seen it without stopping since they received it, and as a result I have seen it almost 4 times in the whole process. I can not have enough of that. The CGI images are great to see, the humor is good and the ballet portraits are excellent. Even though the story line has some holes, no girl will notice, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that you almost can not tell. Just keep in mind that this is a Barbie movie and, although it seems corny, in my experience, it meets the high standard that the other Princess Barbie films have established. I would recommend it to anyone who has a girl who always wanted to be a princess. It also teaches a good lesson. Everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.
