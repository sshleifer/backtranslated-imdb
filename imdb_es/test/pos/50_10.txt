Fantastically written, acted and produced! I loved seeing this brilliant and talented cast; Each of them offers a great performance. This movie thoroughly heated the cockles of my heart! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for the month of Black History. Filled with an accurate description of recent history and very real characters who resisted incredible pain, with dignity and belief in a better future. It is so easy to see how these diverse adults affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually feed the talent of his adulthood. The next time you are in the company of a child who listens and observes, remember; show or he can be a writer in the making!
