Hal Hartley has been compared to the modern William Shakespeare, by virtue of the fact that he achieves that his actors deliver their lines in an iambic pentameter. He certainly knows how to put together a cast and, once again, Martin Donovan is sensational, while Thomas Jay Ryan plays his role with an intensity that is unforgettable. Although the film lasts only 1 hour, the time frame works wonders and keeps the audience in a fast race until the end. Undoubtedly, Hal Hartley is one of the best directors who have left the United States in the last 20 years, with a unique, funny and moving vision.
