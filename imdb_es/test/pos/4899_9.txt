Apparently, the film arose from an idea that one of the writers had when he "saw" one of his creations in a supermarket. The inhabitants of Royston Vasey address "our" world to persuade writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world. <br /> <br /> If that sounds too serious, do not be discouraged. In the first minutes, we have: Bernice (the vile woman vicar) who leaves an unfortunate penitent during the confession; Chinnery (the veterinarian who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches) trying to collect semen from a giraffe; Mickey (beyond the credible) being, ah, thick; and Tubbs (sister, wife and local merchant) being as sweet as ever, but still disgusting. <br /> <br /> Some of the common characters are missing, but a new idea from Gents presents some sixteenth-century characters - and we have the knights in action as well. If you are new to La Liga de Caballeros, this is an easy and very fun introduction. If you're a long-time fan, this has everything you expect, including the joys of Jeremy Dyson's location. <br /> <br /> In total, it has the same slightly surrealistic mood that is the hallmark of The series, plus some moments of quite 'introspection'. Herr Lipp, for example, maintains a gentle dignity when he learns that his creators consider him a "joke character". While most of the characters remain as they are, some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they occur. <br /> <br /> This movie is a 'swan song' for Royston Vasey, but it is also a showcase for the gentlemen who prove that (panting!) they can write other things, and it can be a lot of fun. (But you knew anyway)
