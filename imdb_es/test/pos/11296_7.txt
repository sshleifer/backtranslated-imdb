I just picked this up on a decent, if not exceptional, DVD version for a dollar at Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> Stay and buy it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that this version is the short and incomplete version released against the animator's wishes in the late fifties, but even so, for little money it's an * incredible * bargain. <br /> <br /> This movie was distributed in small portions as a series to local. Television stations in the early 1960s for children's programs that almost all stations performed on weekday afternoons in those days: "Mr. Bill and Bozo", "Monty's gang" (Channel 4, Greenville SC) and "Captain Grady" (Channel 13, Asheville NC - that's where I saw it). It impressed me as much as I did when I was twelve years old when I saw him at Wal Mart tonight and I grabbed him. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You should get it.
