In 1989, Aardman Animations presented the two heroes in The Grand Day Out. In 1993, they fought an evil penguin in The Wrong Trousers. And in 1995, they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in A Close Shave. In 2005, they are back and they are going to fight against something that used to be cute and cuddly in The Curse of the Water Rabbit. In this complete film, Wallace and Gromit work at Anit-Pesto, a pest control business. There will be a giant vegetable competition, but the rabbits are still eating the vegetables of the neighbors. Wallace and Gromit take care of that problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will wash the bunnies brain with his machine. After doing that, something suddenly eats all the vegetables in the neighborhood and it's big. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. He kept what the previous 3 chapters had and, in his place, he incorporated many Hollywood actors for the voice-overs, they put an unparalleled name in the work and, boy, they did a fantastic job. Wallace and Gromit have not changed. Wallace is still the cheese-loving monster as he always was and Gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog. Also, the script was not as bad as other family movies. There is a twist of who the Were-Rabbit really is. The direction of Nick Park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a very good job with the story. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula to it, he simply took the style of the previous chapters and added a bit of a touch of dark fantasy. Well done, Nick. Rabbits are also fun and adorable, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is the one with Wallace's mix in it. The characters were not bad and they were not annoying, but they will never surpass Wallace and Gromit. The animation is really fantastic and wonderful. I've never seen an animated clay movie that is so amazing since Chicken Run. In general, fans of both knuckles (including teenagers) will love this fantastic movie. It's a well-made movie that should get an Oscar next year. Hurray, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10
