I have not seen the latest 'Traffic' based on this, but I would bet on this as the best creation. I do not know of any other film that has portrayed the intricate tragedies of drug trafficking and the "war on drugs" so well. I have seen this at least four times and I am enjoying it again as part of the Masterpiece Theater 30th anniversary presentations.
