SPOILER ALERT! Do not keep reading unless you're ready for some spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this movie had a lot of value. In addition to the apparent connections with "Oldboy" (and other Park-wook movies), an incestuous relationship in this really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that surrounded all the vampiric physical action. <br /> <br /> The main actor, Kang-ho Song, is excellent in the role of priest Sang-hyeon. Coincidentally, "singing" means "blood" in some languages, which really loved Tae-ju, played by OK-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in "Badlands", where the girl looks psycho and the man is basically wrapped around his finger. <br /> <br /> Your relationship is one thing, but the mother of the girl is completely different. While moving, it is rigid, one-dimensional and tense, but paralyzed, it says that it does not move even through the blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> Park-wook has really mastered his cinematography in This movie, and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick; There are a lot of beautiful shots scattered throughout the film, some for simple effects and others that require several looks and, probably, repeated views to capture them completely. <br /> <br /> The music is quite traditional, and mainly uses strings to accompany. the monoreaction of the main actor; It is very good that the character is as retired as he is. Although he does very little and loses with that, he seems to be a person who thinks a lot. While his love interest says and does a lot, his actions show very little thought behind it. In my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> In short, a very disturbing movie that is not made for action, that is not even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days; It is magnificent, and repellent at the same time.
