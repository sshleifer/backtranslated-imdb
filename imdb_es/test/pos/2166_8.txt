Black Scorpion is Roger Cormen's batman. Which is great and there are a lot of great things in this movie. Just like the Breathtaker is a cross between Doctor Doom and Darth Vader, that's great. The mental control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the Mad Hatter. The style of the B movie of Cormen is all over this puppy, which is not always good. There are lots of tricks and hot girls to make any action fan happy. This movie, the good weighs the bad. But if you're not one of the comic movies, then I would advise you not to look at the Black Scorpion, however, if you like comics like movies and you do not care if it was ever a comic. Then check out BLACK SCORPION, since for me I give 8 STARS.
