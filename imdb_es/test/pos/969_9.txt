BIG FAT LIAR, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "ALL THAT") played those tricks with Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I really smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's rehearsal ended erroneously in Marty's hands was hilarious. I especially loved the Jaleel White cameo. When I saw him for the first time, I could not be sure, but when I asked my mother if it was him, she said: "Of course!" Before finishing this, I would like to say: "As I said before, there is a moral in this story, and that moral is, always tell the truth." Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes or Paul Giamatti, I recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral.
