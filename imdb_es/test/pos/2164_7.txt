Do not get me wrong, it was fun to watch. It has some nice animations, except for some strange looking bugs, and good music. And the outstanding scene was definitely the dance of Elmer, Bugs and Daffy on the floor, it was such a nice and fun touch. In fact, it's nice to look at the whole caricature, but in general it's not what I call exceptional as Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they have been used before I felt them, and there was not much that I found hilarious. And Daffy joining forces with Elmer? Somehow, seeing that he was a target of the hunter, it did not seem strange that he was his friend. Although I must admit that it was good to have Daffy there. The voice acting was also above average, but somehow I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> In general, an exceptional but very nice caricature. 7/10 Bethany Cox
