A flic of warm heart that describes the archangel Michael as a villain, fat and cigarette smoker who loves to dance and have fun with the opposite sex. However, it has a good side, as it strives to fix things in the lives of a couple of lost burned before being returned to heaven. Funny movie, well represented; Very nice although somewhat irreverent.
