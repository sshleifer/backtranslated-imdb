I do not know why people considered it trashy or hateful; It's not like American Pie or something like that. I do not know why people are offended by universal plugs; Since it is part of the plot, advertising is excusable. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (which fortunately is not too silly), great acting and a cheesy ending. <br /> <br /> (minor spoiler) The basic premise here is the classic story of a child Pastor (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes along with him. Then he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they go and drive the Wolf crazy. <br /> <br /> Frankie Muniz can be annoying in other roles, but not like Jason Shepherd. He manages the soft confidence of his character perfectly well, and what seems to be a lack of expression at first sight is really a perfectly executed indifference. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes. What more can I say? The girl has the gift. She is fun, talented, versatile and very, very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than her, I need to get to California soon). In fact, the "best friend" part was originally a boy, but it became a girl as soon as the manufacturers saw Amanda's interest. Which works pretty well, since the part would have been pretty boring without the blessing of Bynes' abilities. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. While some interpreted Marty Wolf as evil and diabolical, Giamatti did it ... not just an imbecile, of course, but a LIKEABLE imbecile, an imbecile who animates the screen, instead of intentionally attenuating it. And I doubt that many other actors can achieve the psychological break that Wolf also suffers. <br /> <br /> In short, a great movie. I loved seeing Jaleel White able to make fun of himself. I loved seeing all the little references and other things incorporated in the movie. (One of the guests at the scene of the party is the director, Shawn Levy, another is the former co-star of Bynes, Kenan Thompson). I loved seeing Amanda in those outfits ... Get the DVD if you can. It has all kinds of extraordinary things, and the lovely Mrs. Bynes is your guide through the menus. :)
