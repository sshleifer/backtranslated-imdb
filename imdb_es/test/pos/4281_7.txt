I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has something to be blamed for, everyone is real. There are no cardboard heroes or cold characters, omnipotent, know-it-alls. <br /> <br /> I read many viewers here complaining about Anne's morality and James's willingness to keep his love for her, even though he cheated on it, but I do not agree. <br /> <br /> I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and I felt love for her. <br /> <br /> She was a very repressed woman, her actions were not planned: once she started to break free, she felt confused and made many mistakes. But that's the way it is in real life, when you gain freedom, you are likely to make mistakes (especially at the starting point). <br /> <br /> Was she a little too ungrateful? Perhaps. But we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time. She knows that James, after all, is a good man, perhaps too rigid, serious and focused on work; but she also feels the need to live life as herself. <br /> <br /> Is she guilty more than him? I think not. <br /> <br /> But the change that is happening in their lives generates some changes. <br /> <br /> James instead of letting his wife out of his life (as other viewers suggested as the right option) bites the bullet and waits, hoping for the best. He begins to understand that what, although superficially, was well (his marriage) was actually a control game he played with his wife. <br /> <br /> This is not a story with characters of too emotional and precarious character. (that is, the usual clich√© of Latin American or Italian jealousy), this is a story of men and women who use the heart and the brain. <br /> <br /> It can be very painful, but if you really love a person (women). or man) and if you are not a terribly unstable nature, you are likely to forgive your traps and let go. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric individual, with a crime of passion, possessive and mentally unstable. <br /> <br /> A really good movie. The last scene, when James, despite all the things that happened before, goes with Anne to the train station is moving: she is free and he understood what freedom means for a person. <br /> <br /> Guido
