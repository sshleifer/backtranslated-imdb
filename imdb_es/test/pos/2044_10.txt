I love this movie...! I've seen it 1000 times on a DVD and I can not say enough. It has everything, comedy, incredible action and incredible acrobatics / fx. Samuel Jackson steals the show here in style. I do not think there's a time when he's not fun! "Everyone knows that when you make a guess, you make an ass of yourself and guess" !! The f / x are great! The explosion of the bridge / truck is incredible, although the sound is not so good! When Samuel leaves the truck, the sound is a little off, I think, and what he says is priceless. For those of you who have it on DVD, put the audio in French! It is a wonder !!! Even the emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that Sam / Charlie's daughter is his, it's great ... This is a great movie that no action fan can do without ... I also recommend Cutthroat Island ... Aside of all negative publicity, kicks !!!!
