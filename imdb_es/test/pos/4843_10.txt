This gem was direct to the video? Fabulous art direction. State of mind that never loses sight. The Truman Show meets with Metropolis. An excellent deal. I've never seen Laura Dern better, and Bill Macy is always fabulous. The same said for David Paymer, and Meat Loaf. This is just an incredible movie.
