Okay, I think we all agree that Michael Jackson was the low point. <br /> <br /> And the special effects too. But, please keep in mind that this was NOT a big budget movie, okay? Not all movies have as much budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars. <br /> <br /> However, I found it quite funny. SECOND-? Nothing that, in my opinion, wastes your time. <br /> <br /> Parodying is always fun to watch, and just because it was not a big budget does not mean it's bad. <br /> <br /> I think this was a good movie, although weak in some points. <br /> <br /> I hope this comment helps. ~ Angela
