Joline (Heather Graham) comes out after her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) who disappeared to clear his head about him and his marriage. Joline, who is committed to her marriage, begins her journey to find Carl, but on the way she discovers a lot about herself. On her trip she meets a lot of interesting characters who, unknowingly, help her find her way. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a classic road movie, which moves at the correct pace (some viewers may also find it slow). Throughout the film, he keeps his humorous note while Joline responds to the madness of the world that surrounds her with a warm, knowledgeable, sometimes sad smile. All the actresses and actors give wonderful performances and the musical score is immaculate. 9/10
