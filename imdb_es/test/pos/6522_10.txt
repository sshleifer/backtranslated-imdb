Fred was a great show. It was simple but somehow very addictive. I can still remember the days I saw this in Kids WB on Saturdays, but then Kids WB did the unforgivable. Kids WB became a senior relative who tries to do it. They act like "hip" and "funky fresh." * shuddered * They became like that relative who tries to act in a great way, but the attempt is a cheesy mess. They took out the fruit salad inside Coconut Fred and all the other good shows to put on some of the most useless shows I've ever seen (Johnny Test). The only thing that keeps me watching KWB are the occasional fragments of the old shows and the anime in 4kids. It was a big mistake to comment on it. boast of the agenda. This brings me back to my first point ...
