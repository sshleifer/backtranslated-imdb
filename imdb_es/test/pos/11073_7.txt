This film remembers "Boys' n the Hood", "Menace to Society", "South Central" and others of its style and even shares actors with some of them. The "us against the law" mentality of the film is underlined by the neighborhood of blacks against the almost white police force. Here the policemen are so bad that they look like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys when they pass by in a car that they have just "freed" from their owner. It's like a massacre of an old Westerner, but the contemporary environment makes it seem too real. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the young Jason Petty and his friends, for whom school is just an inconvenience that takes our time. of his "real occupation" of driving cars. This happens to be Newark, N.J., a rust belt city with few jobs but notoriously high in crime. In fact, the problem is so serious that all policemen have "car theft" written on their backs, to show that a whole unit must be dedicated to this particular crime. <br /> <br /> Children wear a "thin Jim". "to happily break into the cars and enjoy the fun, as if it were not much, they only face real problems when the police ambush them." The vicious, lieutenant similar to the Nazis, has a revenge against the children, since They do not see them as human beings who could be worthy of redemption, but as human targets, in fact, they remember a bit the sadistic Nazi officer of the Warsaw ghetto, who shot down the Jews for pleasure in the movie "Schindler's List" When the boys steal a police car as retribution for the ambush, things, as expected, go downhill quickly, they are severely beaten by the police and Jason finally ends up in jail. bad guys "who would steal your car in a minute, but the movie wants us to see them as anti-heroes, showing Jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother. We know which side to take and who we would feel sad about: the children whose lives are going down the drain, the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen from left to right and who could get caught in the crossfire of a shooting at any moment . The moment or the city of Newark, the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal police and dead to death. <br /> <br /> Despite the exaggerated description of the latter, the film offers a realistic representation of the ghetto, the protagonists and their families and the culture of car theft in a city where there seems to be only 2 races : the application of the law and crime. Interestingly, the subject of drugs is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously predisposed against the Newark police, which, we hope, are not as bad as they are described here. However, they have given us another very strong and affectionate story about the inner city and the black youth that went wrong and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason.
