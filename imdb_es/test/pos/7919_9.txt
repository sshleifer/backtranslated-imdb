I think that anyone who has enjoyed the films of Ivan the Terrible of Eisentein would enjoy this well-crafted film. This film was developed as "The Lord of the Ring: The Return of the King", but without the special effect, but as a good and better drama. <br /> <br /> We have a German, dressed as KKK, who conquered Russia's Novgorod. The Russian summoned Nevsky to guide them to fight against the German to save Russia. Nikolai Cherkasov, who played Ivan in the films of Ivan the Terrible, was as charismatic as Nevsky. The first 10 minutes of how he handled the Mongolian pass was fascinating. <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white. The anticipation of the War did not require any dialogue like "how many enemies are we going to kill", etc. Except for some speeches, the film can be represented basically as a silent film. The scene of the fight can sustain those on the scene of the civil war of The Birth of a Nation. <br /> <br /> Another of the film's strengths is the great musical score, by Sergei Prokofiev. The music gave an epic touch to the film in those scenes without dialogue.
