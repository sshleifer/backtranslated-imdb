Sometimes a movie is so bad that it's pretty good. This movie was made in Germany and is dubbed in English, so you have to overcome that. The performance was also forced and forced, apart from what the real rats did, that IMO did an excellent acting job. It fits the wrangler rat. Anyway, the mayor of the city has decided to reduce costs and, as a result, local garbage collectors strike, leaving large piles of garbage everywhere. This story has been used before, not to mention that it has happened in real life (very often, unfortunately) and the public has no surprises. But this is fine. We know what is going to happen and when, and sometimes an audience needs a movie in which it is not necessary to follow many brain cells. We have our hero, even the face and the body chiselled, the semi-heroes and, of course, our heroine, who is the doctor, but who is still in training, although it is she who discovers what is really happening. when many people end up sick and dying, and not just because of the bite of a rat. Of course, the villain must die (well, all the villains, that is, the rats), and the final scene is one of those that reminds the audience that there is a sequel in the works. This is one of those movies where you simply sit and enjoy what it is and what it is not.
