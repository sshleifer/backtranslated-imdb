The performance that Barbora Bobulova made of Valeria in this story was totally captivating and heartbreaking at the same time. It's been a long time since I've seen a hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by using their facial features and using their eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was completely credible as Valeria and I was swept away by her characterization of this role. Suddenly, the movie was real life and fantasy, the intelligent use of what was a limited dialogue left me fascinated. I was forced to read between the lines and each of the key players used the art of body language and emotional intention to convey a solid story. Barbora in particular was visually stimulating in an almost asexual way and at the same time in a sexy way. This comment can be easily related to each one of the many emotions that its performance presents. Underestimated in terms of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence. I have been captured by this actress delivery and will look forward to much more of their work.
