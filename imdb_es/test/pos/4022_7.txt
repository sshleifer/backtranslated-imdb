Brown returned to his role the year before (in "Slaughter") for this approximate follow-up movie. In the original, he had avenged the murder of his parents by eliminating a large organization of mobsters in Mexico. Here, he is the one being persecuted (in retaliation) by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon. When the first assassination attempt fails, Brown returns to the action once again, kicking a gangster's ass all over while trying to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. While the original film was, in general, a better and more coherent film, it offers all aspects of exploitation in much heavier doses, which makes it more enjoyable for fans of the genre. In addition to a rather dismal horseback ride and an absolutely deadly car trip down a city street at night, this film develops at a very fast pace. Every few minutes there is one or more of the following: drug use, sex, nudity, shooting, murder or some other action. Brown is your reliable and kind person always, helped by his incredible physical presence that helps to ignore any rigidity in his performance. McMahon is a riot! With tinted glasses and his hair separated in half (!), He is shown to carry out orders to his gang of thugs and is heard by chance to make a passionate love to his leather-dressed bimbo. Seeing Johnny Carson's partner on a paper like this is a perverse emotion. Stroud leaves an impression of being an aggressive and racist assassin, while Peters adds just a touch of class like a police detective who enlists Brown's help. Unfortunately, no mention is made of the original cronies of Brown, Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is quite nice, but lacks the voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before. Williams makes an outrageous turn as a pimp who can apparently get any girl out of a bar and turn her into an instant member of his harem. The cinematography and the general direction are less polished than the first film, but this one has an impulse and a feeling of danger that exceeds the sensation of the original. The film spends a lot of time in the wastewater of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, but maintains interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the now surprising lack of political correctness. A strange note: it was shown that a key player in the first movie was shot to death, but appears here in a different role.
