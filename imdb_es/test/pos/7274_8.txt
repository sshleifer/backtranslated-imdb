Ah, how refreshing to see a vision of eighteenth century England complete with mud, pox and chickpeas ... and accompanied by a delicious soundtrack of techno to boot. This is the story of the misguided bandit Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and Gentleman-fallen in hard times Captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), and how Aristo pigs get together and rob. Plunkett is a hard nut, but MaCleane is too polite for that, and therefore becomes "the gentleman of the road." He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler), (being frank is the only weak part of the whole shebang) and wants to impress her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are fantastic. Large, colorful, historically inaccurate beautiful togs. Alan Cummings gets all the best threads, and the best lines like Lord Rochester, sporting a piercing of eyebrows rather than the eighteenth century. The music shifts between swooping glorious choirs and techno-laden bass, which does not work as you think it should be in a historical movie. The script is fast and dotted with modern colloquialisms; Merchant Ivory, this is not it. There are funny parts, disgusting parts, sitting parts on the edge of your seat and nibbling nails, but everything goes on and it's still wonderfully entertaining. This is something to animate in the cinema. Safety pin
