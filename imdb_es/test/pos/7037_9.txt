I remember this in a similar vein to the young. We stumbled back from the pub and saw it or recorded it and then spent weeks repeating the lines to each other. <br /> <br /> We call one of our buddies "Zipmole Watkins" after the brilliant episode in which Daniel Peacock has a bit of 'restyling' in the nose for the Back Street Abortion. <br /> <br /> Many great lines "Remember that at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man ... Take it easy boy!" - Gandhi as a local merchant. <br /> <br /> Tony Woodcock was definitely there in the episode they were teaching Ralph (Daniel Peacock) to be a barman "It's not good that Amanda never does it like a bar man" Helen Lederer teaches her to ask to people about the game "Do you see the game last night? I thought Woodcock played well" After a series of failed conversations, the star of the curly hair arsenal was sitting at the bar: "Do you see the game last night?" "Yes I thought I played well "<br /> <br /> We still follow strange and stupid lines -" Reg and Ralph ... or ....... Ralph and Reg. Reg., Reg. Reg Reg Reg Reg "<br /> <br /> Lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the Flatlets - The Back Street Abortionist, a personal favorite with the big final line -" And will mark your packages' Return To Sender "< <br /> <br /> Good old Danny Peacock: you added a lot to the afternoons of some young drinkers, sir. <br /> <br /> ** Update: I found a couple of episodes on the tape - I'm going to upload the sketch of Gandhi to YouTube **
