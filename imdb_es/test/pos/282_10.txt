The secret agents of the comic have returned in recent years, with "Myers Austin Powers" by Mike Myers and "Johnny English" by Rowan Atkinson, and most recently Steve Carell in the big-screen version of the hit show 'Get Smart! '60. <br /> <br /> In 1974, it was David Jason who carried a holster on his shoulder and a briefcase with all the documents marked "Classified." <br /> <br /> 'The most secret life of Edgar Briggs was his first leading role in a comedy, after years of being a supporting actor in shows like' Six Dates With Barker ', the series' Doctor 'and' Hark At Barker. ' <br /> <br /> Humphrey Barclay had found him working at a theater on the Bournemouth pier and was impressed enough to include him with Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's comedy show "Do not adjust his game!". <br /> <br /> 'TTSLOEB' chose Jason as 'Edgar Briggs', a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service. While John Steed was wearing a bowler hat, Briggs had a trilby. While Napoleon Solo was carrying a radio pen, Briggs had a pipe. The objects fell to pieces in his hands. He read Confidential Documents in Bed while his wife (Barbara Angell) examined Woman's Own (on one occasion it would be the other way around). When he tracked down a couple of Russian agents to a heliport, he accidentally turned on the Tannoy system at the airport and relayed his plans to capture them. When he hid in a train to photograph a meeting between a S.I.S. The man and his contact with the enemy moved with him on board and took him directly to Brighton! When he tried to organize the defection of a Russian scientist, he took a 'shortcut' to elude his pursuers, only to end up desperately lost in a parking lot. However, like the 'Inspector Clouseau', he always seemed to come up at the end, to the dismay of his colleagues. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, I was married. His wife Jennifer understood the kind of work he did. Although they once had a line, which made him shout at him from the window of his high-rise apartment: "Secret Service, Secret Service, never stop thinking about the Secret Service!" He yelled, "Think of the neighbors! They're not supposed to know I'm in the Secret Service!" <br /> <br /> Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included 'Coronation Street' the villain Mark Eden (was the psychotic Alan Bradley) as' Spencer ', Michael Stainton as' Buxton' and Elisabeth Counsell as' The doctor in the sea 'like the charming' Cathy Strong '. They responded to 'The Commander', played by the late Noel Coleman. The Commander was kidnapped in an episode, leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of the S.I.S. - which, of course, horrified everyone. <br /> <br /> This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna, who had written for the series 'Doctor'. Instead of faking Bond, it was rather a shipment of serious spy programs like 'Callan' (although it had a Bond themed melody). Furtive meetings in underground car parks, deciphered codes, stolen missile plans, that sort of thing. Jason brought a lot of energy to the paper, doing many of his own stunts, like Briggs falling from a staircase while decorating his apartment, and falling down a trash can, and remembering those in the 'Pink Panther' movies. <br /> <br /> 'Briggs' had all the ingredients to be a great success. Unfortunately, I was not on the network. In the London area, it was held on Sundays at 7.25 P.M. where he was defeated in the ratings for the soapy drama "The Brothers" by B.B.C. Then he moved to Fridays at 7 p.m. because I.T.V. He wanted to exhibit his last American import: the version of T.V. of 'Planet Of The Apes'. Briggs never found an audience. A similar fate happened in Jason's next big show: "Lucky Feller" from 1976. It was not until 1977 and 'A Sharp Intake Of Breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle. <br /> <br /> You can see the title sequence (along with two short excerpts in German!) for this series on YouTube. Unfortunately, that's all you can see. Jason will not allow his first stellar shows to be repeated or published in D.V.D. A great shame. For the moment, however, the life of Edgar Briggs will have to remain a secret. <br /> <br /> CODA: I have recently seen a series of episodes and I am pleased to say that it stands out incredibly well.
