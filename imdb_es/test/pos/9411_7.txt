Yes, it's a bit corny. But it is entertaining and entertaining, and one of my favorites; There are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job, given the limitations of the plot and the characters. It's interesting to see David Soul in a role of 'bad boy'; I thought it was quite credible, and rather chilling, as the CO increasingly paranoid. Robert Conrad is a favorite for a long time; I think it gives his character a lot of life; and Sam Waterston has been a star in everything I've seen: movies or TV. <br /> <br /> I see this movie from time to time, but our tape (a copy of VHS TV that I got) is so bad quality that it is difficult to enjoy it to the fullest. This is a movie that I think they should publish on DVD; maybe it would not be universally sought, but I'm sure there are many people like me who like this kind of movie, so there would not be a market for a DVD version. I'll keep waiting!
