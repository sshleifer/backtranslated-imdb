I love the other reviews of this movie. They reflect my attitude. I am a type of man of the 70s, less disco and children of "Star Wars". There was nothing good in this movie, except for a chase scene. That's why it was good, because it was hard, basic and economical. Roy Scheider took the film, which was based on the team, the 7 Ups, which backed Gene Hackman in the "French Connection". The people who were in it were credible and average, burned while they served coffee, showed fear in the chase scene and almost lost it after a near accident. <br /> <br /> Maybe it would be easier to tell him what he lacked. There were no elegant weapons, only basic revolvers and cut firearms. There was not a tough guy philosophizing, ala Tarantino. There was no kung fu or samurai nonsense, nor trick shots. There was not an intelligent guy to carry out a complicated scheme based on hundreds of things that went the way he planned, including the reactions of everyone else. The criminals were bad, but they did not shoot people for the fun of it. In fact, there was a count of only three. Something that the average movie of these days would happen in the opening credits. It could be a G movie today! No orphaned children who traveled by bus or terrorists who threatened to kill half the city were kidnapped. There were no high-tech problems, nor were the crimes themselves so moving or witty, the most novel of the technology I saw was an ATT tone wall phone. I did not have subplots or funny character developments. In addition, there is no sex or women, except for the wife of a mobster who shouted while Buddy, our hero, had threatened her. <br /> <br /> It was a small entrepreneur who exploited his connections with the local mafia and the police to kidnap local mobsters for easy benefits. The gravediggers. Vito, was played by Tony Lo Bianco, who did a great job, as did Roy Schneider, Buddy, the 7 Ups police chief, whom he reported and exploited. What happened to Tony Lo Bianco, he looked like a Pacino shoe, handsome and talented? What it did have was a great New York backdrop for a simple crime story. Locations that were gloomy and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. He had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme in which one of Buddy's cops got involved accidentally, literally accidentally crawled and then shot himself accidentally. Since Buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dog unit, both the NYPD Brass and the gangsters thought he was involved, since the kidnappers posed as plain clothes policemen to convince the mobsters. Obviously, the mobsters thought they had lawyers and rights to protect them from the normal police. Even the mobsters were simple, old and ugly, without the royalty of The Godfather or the soprano fashion here. <br /> <br /> It's a good basic movie with an outstanding chase scene between two 70s Pontiacs. Even the cars were simple and cheap, not even a GTO or a Trans Am, like acting and history. In the days of Batman uber-hype or "24" levels of intensity in the doomsday scenarios, this movie reminds us that less is better. It should be shown to writers and film directors as a warning not to dazzle, and then, ultimately, insult us with stunts, gadgets and a lot of psychotic clown behaviors.
