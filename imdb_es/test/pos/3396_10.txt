Maybe one of the best movies ever made. The friendship of Orry and Goerge is deep, and the war puts to test their strong friendship. As a Southerner, I can honestly say that this epic is as accurate as it can be. Brothers fighting brothers. Can you imagine what life must have been living in those times? The best part of the movie, for me, was when The South surrenders; General Grant is urging President Lincoln to really adhere to the south, he says: "Mr. President, many people want the South to bleed for what they have done ..." President Lincoln addresses him and in a very tired voice says: "The south has bled enough ... and we too ..." I started to cry and took a deep breath. What a president! It is as if a father said that his son has already been sufficiently punished and, in spite of his anger, he realizes that what he has said has been said. This war was a very dark time for our young country, and it had to be fought. President Lincoln knew it. I urge everyone who reads this to watch this movie and add it to their DVD collection. So, thank God that our country was preserved. As Jesus said, a "house divided against itself can not be maintained."
