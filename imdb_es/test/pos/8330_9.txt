We bought the "Walking with Dinosaurs" DVD and we have been almost ecstatic about the things that have been done very well with him. <br /> <br /> Many DVDs today offer the bare minimum ... the feature itself, and perhaps another language (which does not help the viewer at all, but makes it easy for the company to watch the DVD in several markets). <br /> <br /> Not so in the case of WWD. There are so many wonderful extras and thoughtful vignettes that seeing even the * navigation menu * is interesting. The introductions to each chapter in the DVD "The Making Of" are fun and fun. The quality of the sound and the video is excellent. And, of course, the story and the content ... what else could a dinosaur lover ask for? <br /> <br /> I watched most of the version aired on TDC (narrated by Avery Brooks) and then I saw almost half of the DVD (narrated by Kenneth Branaugh). As close as I can tell, the broadcast version slipped into a series of mostly American slang terms in the narrative (ie, in a section on the mating of T. Rex, Branugh says that "the female is tired of the man's attention "and Brooks says" The honeymoon is over ") and eliminates some of the closest puppets. I prefer the Branugh version simply because it is more complete. <br /> <br /> In general, a great value and a wonderful production. Many congratulations to the BBC and the team that made this gem.
