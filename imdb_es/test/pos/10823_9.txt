One comment said it was not a comedy ... Error! It was a charming comedy from a period of history that does not lend itself easily to that genre. Very busy ... and active movie from start to finish. Often, the shots from the window of the train or the car were simply beautiful. A fun way to spend a couple of hours in a theater. All French historical figures, such as Charles de Gaulle and Petain and some of the people involved in the French Resistance were included in the script, which could be sent to those who are not familiar with the collapse of France during the German invasion. The characters were attractive and the actors who represented them were excellent. I recommend it, 9 out of 10.
