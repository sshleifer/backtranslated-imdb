As with many of Wong's films, many people find them boring and confusing. Well, I like them and I like this movie too. I went out and rented it on DVD and saw it 3 times. It is a very subtle film that provides an intoxicating experience. for those who did not enjoy it ... he wasted 2 hours of his life ... very bad ... muhahahahaha.
