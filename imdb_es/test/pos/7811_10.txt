This movie deserves to be one of the best Hindi comedies ever made. Rajkumar Santoshi is best known for his dramatic social dramas, but this is easily the film that has made the most effort. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around two jesters from small towns, Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem. (Salman Khan). They want to get rich quickly and move to the big city. They plot the same plan separately: to court a rich heiress, Raveena (Raveena Tandon), who is the daughter of a wealthy businessman Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). Thus, whoever marries Raveena has all his wealth in his hands. but when they know each other's plan, there is an intense one-person fight over who marries Raveena. As the battle progresses, the jokes and hilarious situations continue. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the identical twin brother of Ramgopal Bajaj, Shyamgopal Bajaj, wants to eliminate his brother and niece and usurp the family fortune. Add to this an assortment of fun characters that include a Raveena maid, Karishma (Karishma Kapoor), a prone butler named Robert (Vijoo Khote), a manager named Bhalla (Shehzad Khan) who imitates the villain of yesteryear Ajeet and a Funny gangster Gogo (Shakti) Kapoor) who looks more like a pirate and a funny comedy awaits you. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time looking for LOGIC in the movie. Leave the company of your brains and just ENJOY. The actors are so in tune with the script that there is no room for mistakes. The dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are ingenious. The music (Tushar Bhatia) and the lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are memorable. The image and choreography (Saroj Khan) of "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Doori", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Karta Hai Tere Paas Aaoon" are appropriate and will remain engraved in my mind forever. <br /> <br /> The film was starring two superstars in formation, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (who eventually became superstars). Aamir Khan is impeccable in his first comedy role. I greet your sense of comic time. Salman pales in comparison to Aamir, but he's still nice. Among the supporting characters, Paresh Rawal stands out in his double role as Ramgopal and Shyamgopal. <br /> <br /> The movie surprisingly failed at the box office. I do not understand why. I recommend it to all, however.
