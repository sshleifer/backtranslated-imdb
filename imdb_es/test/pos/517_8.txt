I must confess that I've been a big fan of the almighty David "the Hoff" Hasselhoff since he took part in the hit 80s television series "Knight Rider." Whether it's his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously "The Revenge of the Cheerleaders" or his brilliant portrayal of a hasty prince in the daring sci-fi gem "Starcrash," the Hoff has shown one and again that He is simply an excellent actor (and embarrassingly underestimated). The Hoff stands out here as Gary, a cynical and skeptical photographer who, along with his repressed and virgin writer, the girlfriend Leslie (the attractive brunette Leslie Cummings) investigates a sordid haunted hotel in ruins located on a remote island off the coast of Massachusetts. . They are investigating witchcraft over the centuries and the last owner of the hotel was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts. A quarrelsome family also shows up at the facilities to see the hotel. Very soon, several people began to be beaten in a horrific way by the mysterious Lady in Black (a really disturbing Hildegard Knef). <br /> <br /> Of course, the rest of the cast gives Hoff a run for his money: the always cheerful Linda Blair projects her usual charming style as an energetic pregnant woman who ends up being possessed (nach!), the legendary jazz singer Annie Ross fucks her with a cheerful poise like an old and cunning bat (poor Annie ends up being cremated alive after her lips were sewn and hung upside down in a fireplace, and the pretty blonde Catherine Hickland she exudes a considerable sexual attractiveness from every pore she seeks as a lustful slut, the competent direction of Fabrizio Laurenti, an appropriately spooky atmosphere, the brilliant and sophisticated cinematography of Gianlorenzo Battaglia (Steadicam's follow-up shots are particularly pleasing), the special effects striking, the trembling caress of Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller, and the bloody note, the sadistic violence is up to scratch. Ultimately, it is the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only Hoff that makes this tasty and flavorful portion of Italian horror cheese a winner: he takes off his shirt once (hubba!), sprayed with blood and ... - WARNING: Major * SPOILER * forward - even encounters an untimely pleasantly spooky ending. Produced by none other than Joe D'Amato, this image in general qualifies as good and sordid fun.
