This is the first movie I've seen in Singapore and it's great. If you do not know much about Asia, its languages ​​and its culture, this movie can be a bit confusing for the uninformed. As an Asian-American who specializes in two Asian languages ​​(one of them is Mandarin) and has taken some Asian American Studies classes, this movie was easier to understand for me, but even without that kind of knowledge, I think that This film is still accessible to its foreign audiences, as long as you keep in mind that it is a type of film that comes of age. Definitely, it's worth watching the movie so that you have the opportunity to see what kind of problems young Singaporeans have who have difficulties to face them. This is an amazing coming of age film, but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way. The actors are outstanding.
