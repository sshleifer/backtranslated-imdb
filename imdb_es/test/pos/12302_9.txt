John Huston, actor and director best known for his more solid fares, such as "The Misfits" and "African Queen," directs his daughter, Angelica Huston, in what would be her last film. In fact, the movie was released after the death of Huston. Based on James Joyce's novel of the same name, "The Dead" tells the quiet story of a New Year's celebration in 1904 in Dublin. Huston, his cast and his writers, including his son Tony, have created a movie jewel. The novel is among the best works of Joyce (besides being the only one that can be filmed). The film is a tribute to the genius of Huston. He has taken a small and beautiful story and made a small and beautiful film. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston shine (although "shining" is too catchy, too flashy to describe their silent and discreet performances). "The Dead" reflects the love of the Huston family for Ireland and is, in its quiet way, a fitting final film for a legend.
