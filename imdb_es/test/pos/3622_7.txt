The books and works of Spike Milligan have defeated the filmmakers over the years, and the 2002 'Puckoon' is unfortunately no exception. The novel, set in 1924, refers to the partition of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community (the 'Puckoon' of the title). Due to a colossal mistake, half of the people are now in Northern Ireland, the other half are in the Republic. The locals go to the bathrooms at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence that blocks their way. The drinkers crowd like sardines in a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. A dead man must have a passport made in his name before the villagers can reach the cemetery to bury him. <br /> <br /> 'Puckoon' is a kind of Irish 'Under Milk Wood' with comic characters and surreal events. galore. The main character, Dan Milligan (renamed as 'Madigan' in the film) is played by Sean Hughes, and has conversations with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). Also in the film are Milo O'Shea, Griff Rhys Jones, David Kelly (from 'Robin's Nest'), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. <br /> <br /> Interviewed for 'Making of' Puckoon 'documentary, writer / director Terence Ryan expressed an eternal admiration for the book. It is displayed on the screen. But, unfortunately, as the ill-fated film 'The Hitch-Hikers Galaxy Guide', a good book does not necessarily make a good movie. The problem with 'Puckoon' is that, like other Milligan books, they just do not work on the big screen. 'Puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot. <br /> <br /> You can not compare the movie with train accidents like 'Sex Lives Of The Potato Men', 'Fat Slags', and 'Lesbian Vampire Killers', but it's not as good as it should have been. The last half hour involves a lot of running by the police, the British army, some locals who have hidden explosives in a coffin, and it is really tedious to sit down. Ryan's decision to stay close to the book is the main reason why it does not work as a movie. <br /> <br /> The other problem is the total absence of charm. 'Waking Ned' had this in spades, while the TV series 'Father Ted' was much more fun. Spike lived long enough to see the movie, and apparently enjoyed it. His daughter, Jane, has a cameo as Madigan's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me was the quote at the beginning: "I do not mind dying!" Spike said: "I just do not do it." I do not want to be there when it happens! "
