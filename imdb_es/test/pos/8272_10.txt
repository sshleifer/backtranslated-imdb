I am so happy that I recorded this on a VHS tape when it was presented at Master Piece Theater. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again. As it is not difficult enough to live in the early nineteenth century in England, Prue was born with a "hare lip" and is marginalized from birth. The people of her village accept her a little, but she always fears that she is "from the smithy of the Devil" and hastens to attack her. Especially when a lot of bad luck happens to your family. She is strong and courageous, but she moves away from Kester Woodseaves, an itinerant weaver who catches her attention. Partly because he fears rejection and also because he believes he is so virile that he should have a wife who is as beautiful as a lily. Kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and says what he thinks and follows his heart. The film remains true to the original story of Mary Webb and is fascinating from beginning to end.
