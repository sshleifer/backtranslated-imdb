I think this is the best Norwegian movie I've seen. This is Andreas, about 40 years old, who is run over by an underground train and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, however, everything is ready for him here. He has work, home and clothes. At first, this city seems perfect, without death, without pain and without problems. Everywhere there are men in gray suits who clean and fix everything that does not fit their definition of perfect. However, Andreas really can not fit in and begins to return to his old world for a long time, and tries with all means to return. <br /> <br /> What impresses me most about this movie is the way they make the city look so surreal, even though I've seen many of these places in real life, they seem so far away. Another thing that contributes greatly to the performance of the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is the perfect boy to interpret the confused and annoying Andreas. And all the other characters are also doing a great job playing with apathy (sounds like a difficult job, right?). The strong difference between Andreas and the others also leads to very funny situations. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a fabulous movie. The plot can be a bit confusing, but the film has a great atmosphere that I would recommend to everyone to see it. <br /> <br /> And I would not recommend listening to "ccscd212", since it seems that you have seen too many commercial movies from the United States and seems to have become too used to only getting the moral on a silver plate. In my view, there is not much in this movie that tries to tell us if the suicide is right or wrong. I consider it to be more of a warning from one direction that our society seems to be taking. But of course, everyone can watch a movie in their own way.
