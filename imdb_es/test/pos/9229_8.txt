I was not even born when this series was released in the United States. Approximately a decade passed before British television networks took over. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was lucky to see the first episode, in which The Lone Ranger was one of the gang members who ran into an ambush and killed himself. TLR was the only survivor. Although severely wounded, he was saved by an Indian who passed called Fool. I think he started wearing a mask to hide his true identity for fear of reprisals. But instead, it became more recognizable. I do not know if he used it while he slept. <br /> <br /> This was the main day of Saturday. The words of fanfare from William Tell's overture presaged a script for TV, with food still in hand. Although very quickly it became repetitive, predictable hokum. Nobody ever unmasked it. Nobody ever punched him, nobody shot him. He was too good, and a little too flared in his dress for most children. Poor Fool, on the other hand, became his Aunt Sally. He was always being beaten, tied up, kidnapped and those things. <br /> <br /> And what did he keep calling The Rang Lone? 'King Savvy' was the general consensus where he lived. It seemed to imply 'the great knowing everything' in the Indian language. But it sounds like something else, as if Mr. Silverheels had a speech defect. 'Kemosabe'; what the hell is that? <br /> <br /> A duo later, and less commercialized called 'The Range Rider' and 'Dick West' finally won my vote. This presented Jock Mahoney, with a naked face, who suffered a pretty deep beating in each episode and was less aggressive, less super and more credible. <br /> <br /> Even so; Even today I can not hear the William Tell overture without waiting for the galloping of helmets and a cordial Hi-Oh Silver. <br /> <br /> Devine daftness.
