...this. What immediately came to my mind was Love Annabelle, since she has this same kind of mature humor and detachment from the subject. We simply observe as the story unfolds, without taking sides, or having to face "moral" problems (or of course we are, but we do not spoon feed them). Of course, there were some difficult facts to face and decisions to make, but they simply flowed. Basically, it was like any other love story, in any other life, with any other sex. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them in their night outings. The only thing I could really point out as a problem would be that he felt like ... held back. Detained. It's not about the sex scenes (or the ones that are missing), but since I felt that the movie was more animated during the moments they spent together and had a good time, compared with the rest. The key is good, but it just never sputtered like Loving Annabelle, nor did it touch me so much. <br /> <br /> That said, I recommend it with all my heart, it's not a waste of precious time, on the contrary ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
