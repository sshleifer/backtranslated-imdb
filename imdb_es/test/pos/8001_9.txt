Batman Returns is a very dark film, which shows Credader crossed fighting the penguin and the sexy Catwoman (I will refer to them later). Michael Keaton acts well as Bruce Wayne, proving he is a good actor. Tim BUrton directs this image well, and the locations of the film are impressive. The villains: Danny deVito is threatening like the penguin. A cruel man, but disturbed, who had a really difficult childhood. But, Michelle Pfeiffer steals the photo. She is the BEST Catwoman ever! She is threatening, and extremely sexy. There is a scene in which she kisses Batman the way the cat heats the movie. The action scenes are also good, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, probably the best ending to a Batman movie. Tim Burton shows that he can handle a Batman movie really well (he already proved it with the first Batman) and also gives Batman a darker nature. As much as the.
