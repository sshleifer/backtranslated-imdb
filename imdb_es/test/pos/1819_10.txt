This gem captures the life of the early 80's brilliantly. As a graduate student of '83 <br /> <br /> myself, I must say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times at <br /> <br /> Ridgemont High) stands out as the sex movie class for teens </ br> <br /> gender. The characters are exact representatives of the time; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've seen this more than ten times. The music in the movie was first class. Unfortunately, these tunes could never be so popular in <br /> <br /> it was like cockrockers like Journey, Styx or <br /> <br /> Loverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I searched through the records <br /> <br /> and the tapes (it was 80 after all!) By Josie Cotton, Sparks, <br /> <br /> Plimsouls Modern English <Br /> <br /> This movie deserves respect. It's not just a good movie for teenagers of the 80's. It's <br /> <br /> a great movie. Period.
