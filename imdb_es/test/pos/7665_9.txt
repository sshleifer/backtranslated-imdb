I have never read a good review of "Vanity Fair" and I can not understand why. For something that was "rushed in ten days", everything goes surprisingly well. Although it is admitted that "Becky Sharp" is a better movie and Miriam Hopkins a better Becky, there is nothing that prevents her from getting a solid 10/10. Sometimes, Myrna Loy may seem too cute and nice to be an absolute bitch, but at other times she just has to squint and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. Meow! The change to a more modern environment did not work against "Vanity Fair" and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was less than 5 feet tall, and some of the leading men were not very tall either, all this comes together to make Loy look like an absolute Amazon woman! <br /> <br /> "Vanity Fair" is similar to "Craig's wife" in that no matter how bad the main character is, you must love her. And you know that she deserves her deserved, and then something, but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it. Although based on the same story as "Becky Sharp", this version had a different ending, which is interesting because most of the rest of the films were almost identical. As for the value of pleasure, the ending of "Becky Sharp" is ultimately more pleasing, though aesthetically, and according to the flow of the story, there is no doubt that the end of "Vanity Fair" is the best, like it or not. that.
