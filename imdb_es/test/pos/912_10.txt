This film is not only about human feelings and emotions, but also about everything that could be, but it is not. Poetry in movies can be very boring and annoying, but this movie is a delight to watch. Not to mention the incredible Irène Jacob, a great actress in France, one of the best, actually. When the movie ends, you can only feel sorry. After all, when something is really cool, we want more (Well, for another great film by K Kieslowsky with Irène Jacob, we can always see La double vie de Veronique)
