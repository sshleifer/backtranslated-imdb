The debut of Spheeris must be one of the best musical documentaries of all time. And as far as I know, it's also the only one that focuses on the L.A. Punk Explosion of the early eighties. It's all there: not only the big bands, like Black Flag, Fear, X, the Germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on current alternative rock music can not be overestimated, but also the promoters . The media and, above all, the public, the punks, all represented in a way that makes you laugh, tremble and gasp in amazement at the energy, anger and fury that these young people put in their music. Where is that today? The eighties may have sucked big when they joined conventional music, but the underground was rock. If you need a test for that, look at the performance of Fear in Decline. Peerless. Great movie! Why is this not available on vid, LD or DVD? PD The Pt. II tracking decline is hilarious, too
