Since 'Midnight Cowboy' I've been looking for films with Dustin Hoffman and, for the most part, I have not been disappointed. Since 'Kramer vs Kramer' I've been looking for films with Meryl Streep and for the most part I have not been disappointed. She gave an excellent performance, really one of her best results, in 'Sophie's decision' and I wrapped her in 'Out of Africa'. That these two actors joined more than 20 years ago for 'Kramer vs Kramer' was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme that is still very relevant in today's society. <br /> <br /> When they get divorced, everyone has a bad time, although the children seem to suffer more ?????? .. Very well handled by Robert Benton in an original direction that presents some memorable scenes: even the catwalk acquires character and should be included in the ¡emit! And as for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), just magnificent. How do you get an 8-year-old to act? Benton did it and, of course, with Hoffman there seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly attractive, attractive and convincing. The performance of Justin Henry should be among the best 5 or 6 children of all time. The best, once again, was the naturalness, we did not have to go over, so frequent these days. <br /> <br /> This movie reappeared on the small screen the other night, although I did. In my video collection for years: it's still worth looking and paying attention to everything. Around 7½ out of 10.
