This was one of those social dramas that WB knew how to put together and guaranteed box office successes in the thirties. These first "children without exit" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. Cagney, a gangster as part of a deal, is named commissioner of the school. At first, he does not take it seriously, but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of children. The idea is to let the children govern and administer their community. If this is a good social reform it is beyond my belief but it is a movie. It's a lot like Boys Town with a slightly darker tone. A useless happy ending dilutes the impact of the previous scene but is still good. Later, WB would make these same films with Bogart in the fatherly role of Cagney.
