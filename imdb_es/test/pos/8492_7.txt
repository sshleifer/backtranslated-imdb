The year 2004 was the year of the biographical film with no fewer than four images that address real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four photographs to arrive at the Oscars in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA and RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night when the award for acting went to Jamie Foxx for his performance of The R & B genius, Ray Charles. <br /> <br /> And it was well deserved despite the fact that Leonardo diCaprio was close and Liam Neeson was not even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively dark eccentrics, Ray Charles was still making music until his death in 2004 and by then there was not a soul that did not know at least one song that Charles' had written Helped that Jamie Foxx rose far above the film, in itself as a weak whole and often with the appearance that it would not be out of place like a biographical television movie, and its representation is detailed as it is fierce. He has the delicate task of incarnating a person to nuances, and once the crisis of the addiction of Ray to the heroine hits a head, Foxx does everything possible and it is not difficult to imagine that the real Ray is going through such an experience. painful <br /> <br /> The bottom line of the movie is how he spends too much time detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a lot of luggage. Of women, the only one who has managed to lead real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. His is a difficult role, since he is alone on the screen with the young actor playing Ray, but his facial and body language is heartbreaking, especially at the moment when he must give up his motherhood so that Ray finds his way in home. So much intensity of emotion, stop there and watch your blind son crawl through a room and have to force him to have this rude awakening towards independence. A beautiful performance, and one that should have been recognized. <br /> <br /> A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the outstanding music. Anyone who knows that R & B will enjoy the first recordings of Ray's radio hits as well as the last ones that would lead him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx practically steals the show while performing songs like Ray. That will only live even when the movie itself is little more than a rigid biopic. However, I would have loved it if they had used their latest Adult Contemporary success in 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in the final credits. After all, it's Ray Charles, an artist who had a fierce dedication to his art.
