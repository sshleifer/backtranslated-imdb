I was prepared so that I would not like this movie, and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to calm my fears. Start with 2 gangs from high school that are facing each other with bad kung fu. A scenario found in countless other Korean films. Ho-hum. Add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote "He Was Cool" (which was barely passable) and, well, I thought I was expecting a 2-hour antecedent. <br /> <br /> But don Do not give up so fast! "A Romance of Its Own" was directed by Tae-gyun Kim, who also did "Volcano High" (which I found very fun). Anyway, "Romance of Own Own" soon takes a turn to improve. A high school girl, who has just moved to Seoul, is in the middle of the attention of two potential suitors. Each man has his own merit, and it is not clear which (if any) would be the right choice. <br /> <br /> What follows is not your usual teenage love triangle. Emotions are complex, and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the movie unfolds, you can certainly understand why the characters create them. <br /> <br /> The movie asks the characters and the audience questions. Who does one choose? At what point is one obliged to even make a choice (and is it unfair to one if it seems that he is being bound)? After you (or your heart) have made a decision, how do you react (and how * should * you react) when new information emerges that sheds new light on the situation? There is a scene, near the end, that is very subtle but perfectly captures what I think would be a real life reaction instead of an exaggerated "cinematic reaction". The subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene. Recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed. Basically, he does not know what to do with things. Instead of making him "act" something, or look stupefied, he stares at a fixed point unable to react or say anything. It is as if someone simply disconnected it. His reaction sounded faithful to me and I appreciated the scene. <br /> <br /> Like most Korean movies, there is a mix of action, bravado, slapstick and melodrama. Korean movies often take abrupt turns (see "Sex Is Zero" for a great example), which can be a shock to the uninitiated. Go ahead and start with this one. I like, I love, or I hate, I think most viewers can relate and appreciate the actions and reactions of the characters.
