Farscape rules completely! In my opinion, it is very close to Babylon 5, although there are only 7 main characters in the series (including the spacecraft). The humor is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting although almost everything happens on the boat. <br /> <br /> What I really love and appreciate in Farscpae is that they do not use CGI for the extraterrestrial The characters or if they do, it's imperceptible. They use those adorable animatronic rubber puppets very similar to those used in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Farscape is something you definitely want to look at, if you have not already done it.
