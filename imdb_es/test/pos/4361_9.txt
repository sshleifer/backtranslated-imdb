I had the opportunity to see this last night at a local film festival. Herzog presented the film and made an hour of questions and answers afterwards. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliantly made "documentary"; Herzog later explained that he does not consider his films to be true documentaries, since the facts sometimes camouflage the truth. Instead, write some scenes and some ad-libs to introduce a new element that may have been lost if you followed the original outline of the story. <br /> <br /> Little Dieter, unlike Timothy Treadwell, is a real person that you fall for. in love with; You encourage him, you feel the anguish he feels. He admires the sense of humor and the joy for life that he exhibited here 30 years after the Viet Cong took him captive. You are disappointed to know later that Dieter passed away recently. <br /> <br /> As in most Herzog films, the images are incredibly beautiful with a wonderful selection of background music. Especially a battle scene taken from the archives of the Vietnam War but which fits with the Dieter story line. <br /> <br /> The core of the film causes Dieter to return to the infernal jungle where he was a POW and he remembered. Make your trip with some locals. Struggling to see it, I can not imagine what it felt like when it was tied again. <br /> <br /> One of the best films to represent and discuss the nightmare of the Vietnam War. It should serve as a lesson for all of us.
