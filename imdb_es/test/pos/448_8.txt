Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film, "The Journey," starring Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson and Jason Robards. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and concerns a group of travelers who have problems leaving Budapest due to political problems in that part of the world. They put them on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Commander Surov (Brynner), confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), who pretends to be an American, but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter, whom the commander believes is taking him out of Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding it. She becomes the center of attention of the commander's romantic attentions. <br /> <br /> Very good movie that transmits the tension and annoyance of the Cold War, and all the performances are wonderful. Brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate Major who is not all bad, and Anne Jackson offers a realistic and powerful acting as a pregnant woman who does not want her child to be born in a communist country. <br /> <br /> Well Screenplay, good director, good cast, there should be more movies like this. Highly recommended
