This movie is good, but not the best of Schaffner. My favorite is Papillon and Patton, but this is a sad and very nice movie. Kris Kristoffersen is good at this movie and it really makes a difference. I'm going to miss Schaffner and this is his last film. <br /> <br /> A good movie by a great director! 7.5 / 10
