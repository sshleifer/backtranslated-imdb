Of all the seasons and episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, after seeing all the great and surprising stories that provoke reflection, it is at the top. It's okay. This story, titled THE HUNT, heads the great number of the best scripts in History of television. <br /> <br /> It is true, there are no interplanetary space flights, or unexplained cracks in time. There is no nightmare alive, no sudden changes of adjustment. Apparently, there is nothing out of the ordinary with what our protagonist can deal with. <br /> <br /> The main character, played by veteran actor Arthur Hunnicut, leaves his hut in the hills, accompanied by his faithful dog, to hunt raccoons. Because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal, the hunt is in the light of the moon. <br /> <br /> The man and the dog soon find themselves with a large raccoon, which jumps on the back of the dog and tries to drown the dog in a pond. The man jumps to help his dog. There is a kind of near-fainting, after which the couple is seen on the shore, in a recumbent position, almost asleep. <br /> <br /> Calling your dog by name, (Rip, I think) The old man leaves to go home. When he arrives, he finds the wife crying and does not respond to his conversation. He also observes visitors who come and go to his house, paying their respects and giving words to comfort his wife. <br /> <br /> Still seems baffled by the strange reception and the events that happen around Home Cabin, the Man and Rip take off on a long walk down the road, where He says out loud that he did not remember a fence so long in these parts. Finally, he meets a rather large guy, dressed in a garb similar to his overalls, hat, work shirt. They are in a door, which leads to an area where a large amount of smoke rises freely. The Doorkeeper is too anxious in his persuasive release to try to get the man in. Rip sounds disgusted. The Man at the Door tells the Old Man that he can enter, but the dog would have to remain outside, offering to watch the animal for him. The man will not have any of that and the two will continue their way down the road. <br /> <br /> After a little more walking, you will find a second closed entrance where the Gatekeeper recognizes the man and receives him. When the Elder informs what happened on the way, he told him how the guy in the other door tried to separate the Man and the dog, and added: "Without dogs allowed, that must be a hell of a place!" The keeper of the second door declared that he was right! "That is exactly what it is!" <br /> <br /> Our family had lost our 1st Dog, Lady-a mixed laboratory, in October 1981. About 6 months later, as luck would have it, the Wife (Deanna) and I together with our 2 The daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) watched this episode on TV, WGN TV, Channel 9 Chicago. Well, everything made a lot of sense to us at that time. <br /> <br /> We are sure that anyone who has had that relationship with a family dog ​​would agree. The episode still brings a teary-eyed condition to this 60-year-old writer.
