I expected FAME to be an edifying movie, but it ended up being the opposite. The general plot that follows the lives of several determined students who attend a performing arts school has great potential. However, FAME builds its characters beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when it ends. I was very surprised when the graduation scene appeared: we thought the DVD had jumped or something. All the characters have internal and external conflicts of some kind and practically none of them resolves when the movie ends! You may think there are too many characters, but they are probably too many scenes. It is evident that the film was cut and shortened because sometimes it lacks transition. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I really connected with the ambition of his character and following his heart. Boyd Gaines like Michael, the stereotypical poor student who can not read but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I did not especially like the character of Irene Cara in Coco, but this is not Cara's fault, since her script is weak and her character is not complete. His voice is beautiful and listening to his songs justifies watching the whole movie. In short, the film could use many improvements, but quality actors and good music gain their place in film history.
