"Purgatory Flats", which is recently shown on the cable, is a small movie that contains a lot. Harris Done manages with style. The screen game of Mr. Done and Diane Fine is a good thriller. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, maybe you would like to stop reading. <br /> <br /> The movie is the story of a young Los Angeles doctor who made a mistake and lives to pay for it. When he leaves prison, he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten. Bad selection! What Thomas Reed finds in Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert. Right after getting a job at a bar tender, Thomas meets a pretty young woman, Sunny, who is clearly someone to be kept out of. The young doctor is called in to help, since Sunny's boyfriend, Randy, is murdered by a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> We know Randy's family. His uncle Dean seems fine, but his brother Owen is a loose cannon. Everyone in the home is connected in various ways to the sunny nubil. <br /> <br /> The performances are fine. Vincent Ventresca is Thomas, the man who should have gone to his AA practice instead of diverting to the small town. Alexandra Holden is Sunny, a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry, and Brian Austin play the men of the Mecklin family well. Nicholas Turturro also makes a good contribution as a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> The film shows a director with a promise that he will go far to judge by this well-constructed film.
