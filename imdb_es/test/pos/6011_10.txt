Swift's writing really has more in common with Kafka and Orwell than with fantastic adventure writers, so it is curious that Gulliver's Travels has been considered a novel for children. Lucky kiddies! <br /> <br /> The same applies to this movie. There have been some really horrible versions of this story, which must be the reason why people are reluctant to look at this version. I mean, it's a television movie and it comes from muppetteer Jim Henson, so how can we expect anything other than tenderness? <br /> <br /> Look again: beauty appears in the strangest places. Children love this film enough to sit down during the three hours of it, but also take the time to correctly understand Swift's dark vision. I hate special effects, but here they are used to taking the story instead of dazzling us. Keep in mind that the producers took the trouble to recruit classic actors like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole who play their eccentric roles perfectly. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the romance between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch becomes poignant and poignant. besides fun (it's a small girl, but twenty times its size). The history of the framework has a theme about absent parents with whom many children will relate. And the part about Gulliver in the asylum introduces an element of horror related to the abuse of authority (apparently derived from Valhamton's "Bedlam" [1946], another forgotten masterpiece). <br /> <br /> The VHS is always spinning up in the bargain box for a few cents, which is an insult to the many great artists who put this together. I encourage audiences to recognize something good by getting this movie and to inspire others to see it. Although it has a lot to offer children, adults will find that it faces very well the classics like Aguirre, Brazil, 1984 and other serious fantastic works.
