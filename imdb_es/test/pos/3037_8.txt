Our America is multicultural, with so many subcultures. This movie simply tells the story of a snapshot in time within one of these subcultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives alien to the rest of the world. In general, a good movie. Entered, provoked the thought and showed lives that would not look otherwise, right in our own backyard. It should be seen by everyone. After having lived in the USA UU All my life, I had no idea that there were citizens who did not know they were citizens. This film helps to illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. The obvious conclusion: if this is really real, then, what else do we know nothing about?
