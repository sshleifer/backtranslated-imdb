Shuai is a young and portly Beijinger with a punk haircut, who makes his living selling cheap books from a stall in an indoor market. It would seem that he had nothing in common with the intelligent, middle-aged, intellectual potential, Zhang, and yet the two end up in a restaurant together discussing the pros and cons of murder (the Chinese title might be better translated as 'Talk'). It Over '). If that makes you sound like a pedestrian, do not be fooled: this film is profusely inventive in its plot, and mostly runs at breakneck speed (although the pace is pretty bad towards the end). <br /> <br /> If you only know Zhang Yimou's worthy historical dramas such as Raise The Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad, or his latest martial arts epics, Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, you will be surprised; in fact, any of your other films that you have seen, you will be surprised, you will be pleasantly surprised: this is, by far, your most original, most peculiar and most experimental work. It was filmed within a couple of weeks with a minimal budget, almost entirely in Beijing (and making use of many Beijing citizens in smaller supporting roles, there's even a short cameo from the director himself), and mostly with one hand Camera, in an unequal, hyper-kinetic style, which is a million kilometers from the elegant formalism of his best-known films. <br /> <br /> Okay, I live in Beijing, so I find an additional delight in all the small and strange details of everyday life that I am coming to recognize and taste (although they were shot in 1997 and things are changing very quickly here), but I really believe that anyone can appreciate this movie. I saw it, as I have many other Chinese "comedies," in a movie club that projects subtitled versions of recent Chinese films for an almost exclusively foreign audience; and he's the only one I can remember where the audience was laughing out loud. Some non-Chinese audiences may find it a little too strange, a little uncomfortable at times, since it includes some violence and, after opening up like a breezy and unconventional romantic comedy, mutates into something much darker in its second half. However, it's very, very funny. <br /> <br /> It also has an excellent performance by the two protagonists, especially the long-time collaborator of Zhang Yimou, Jiang Wen, who is probably the main movie star of mainland China, and has a presence in the screen that remembers a young Depardieu or De Niro. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, as proof that the Chinese have a sense of humor that CAN be translated into other cultures, as proof that Zhang Yimou is much more than a pony of a single trick .... .. and for a good time.
