Even though the story is light, the film flows so beautifully and its visual is so calm and poetic that it could almost lead to the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The film consists of four interconnected stories, all about different aspects of the attraction. between the man and / or the woman and how often it is ethereal. His true desire always seems to be something they can not cling to, it will come out like a handful of sand. <br /> <br /> I thought that the most intriguing story was the last one where the woman was more unattainable, the more the man desires it. It is parallel to his deep love for God, which is infinitely beyond his reach, but never closer to his heart. <br /> <br /> A very good movie. 7/10
