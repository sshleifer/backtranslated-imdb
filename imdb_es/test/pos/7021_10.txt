Dirty Dancing one of my favorite movies. I've only seen it twice on ABC because I have not had the opportunity to buy or rent it from Blockbuster. I had no idea that Jennifer Gray was 27 years old when she made the movie, because she was very convincing when she was a teenager. Compared to some Hollywood women, he has a very flat chest, so he cheated on me so easily about his age. Then, both physically and emotionally, Gray manages to play a teenager very well. I also loved the dance, who would not? The two times I've seen Dirty Dancing, I still want to look for dance classes. I also love the soundtrack, and I recognize some of the songs from when I was eight or nine years old. I would love to see this in my drama class, and I will ask my teacher at some point if there is any part of the film that I can use for educational purposes. It's much better than what he made us see last year. And the ending was absolutely FANTASTIC. That is one of the best moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I'm waiting for the first day back to school because of Dirty Dancing. Who could ask for a better influence of a movie with that kind of title?
