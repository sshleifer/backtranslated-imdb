A 2006 online survey of Japan's 100 best animated television series of all time, directed by TV Asahi, placed this series in fourth place. That tells you everything you need to know. So go and look at it;) I will not comment on the story, simply because I do not want to ruin anything. I just urge you to keep looking after you saw the first episode. The animation is really good and above the television average. The best thing about this series is that, finally, there is something new. I mean it's not innovative, but it still offers a new and nice idea. You will not regret having entered the world of Suzumiya Haruhi. <br /> <br /> and the best thing is a movie soon.
