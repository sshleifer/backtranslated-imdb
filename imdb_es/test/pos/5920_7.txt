"In 1927, a young man, alone on a single-engine plane, flew nonstop from Roosevelt Field in New York across the North Atlantic Ocean to Le Bourget Field in Paris, at a distance of three thousand six hundred and ten miles. triumph of the mind, body and spirit, Charles A. Lindbergh influenced the lives of all the inhabitants of the earth, since in the 33 hours and thirty minutes of his flight, the era of the air became a reality. This is the story of that flight. " <br /> <br /> Billy Wilder is adapted from Charles A. Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, in what is a re-enactment of Lindbergh's historic solo flight in 1927. Fueled by a strong performance by James Stewart (himself a pilot) as Lindberg, and which contains an intelligent script by Wilder and Wendell Mayes, Spirit of St. Louis is a well-told story. <br /> <br /> In what sometimes threatens to become a monotonous movie, Wilder keeps her active by using flashbacks to Lindbergh's life. After the good preparation of the event, as the danger that is perceived as Nungesser and Coli disappear (never meet) while trying the same trip in reverse, we learn things like how he got to buy his first plane and his work with the flying circus . All this is relative to the understanding of man and his evident passion for flying. This also helps to give us a complete picture of Lindbergh, which brings us to him in his isolated cabin while embarking on this dangerous journey. Struggling against isolation (his only company is the fly) and chronic fatigue, it is here that Stewart perfectly portrays Lindbergh's devotion to the task. With the help of an excellent score by Franz Waxman and the Academy Award-nominated effects by Louis Lichtenfield, Wilder's film turns out to be an interesting story of human interest that had a completely professional production. 7/10
