People watch movies for a variety of different reasons. This movie did not have the big budget, it does not have special effects, it does not pursue cars and there are no explosions. Actually, reality does not have much of this either. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them is perfect in any way, but together they find themselves in a situation in which they learn to explore and accept what is different and that It makes order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since I am neither an expert nor use the full range of my own brain. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie for the characters. It is full of a whole cast of wonderful extravagant characters. <br /> <br /> In the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland represents the life of Detective Michael Hayden in an extraordinary way and continues to develop the character throughout the film. Excellent performance, very credible. <br /> <br /> Henry Czerny could not have been better chosen and the relationship between his 'Harvey' and Kiefer's 'Mickey' enhances the opacity of his characters. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the irritable landlady, 'Ms. Ramsay ', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of these wonderful characters, but space is limited here, so watch the movie and enjoy them
