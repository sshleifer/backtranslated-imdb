The first time I saw this movie when I was a teenager was in theaters, a long time ago. Seeing him again, almost 30 years later, I was surprised at how well he has resisted it. The gags are still fun, the interaction between the characters works very well, and the cameos come out better than ever. (Steve Martin has to be the best.) <br /> <br /> My children (9, 11 and 14) loved it, and the music is good enough so that they are still humming the songs many days later. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that before watching the movie, you see at least half a dozen episodes of the Muppet Show, to get an idea of ​​the background story behind the characters, otherwise, the movie won. It does not make much sense
