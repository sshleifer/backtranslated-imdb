I'm not sure why some people complain that this movie is not a comedy and at the same time it's too unrealistic. If it had been realistic, there certainly would not have been much comedy. Nor do I believe that a comedy has to make you laugh out loud twenty times. There was a lot of subtle humor, sweet feelings, and Kim Frank simply portrayed a dream character. In real life, there are many people whose facial expression does not change much, so Kim Frank keeping his was pretty good. The ending was quite unrealistic, I would say, but happy. It's a happy movie with an ending to feel good. I liked. I loved it, actually. A serious part was that Krueger was going to Schwedt, and I'm glad they did not show what happened to him there. Showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly.
