I remember seeing this movie in the mid-80s, I thought it was a piece of good rhythm and good acting. Now I work quite often in Berkeley Square and I had to get a copy of the DVD to remind me how little the area has changed, although my office is renovated just 30 seconds from "the bank". Even car dealer Jack Barclays continues to sell Bentley and Rolls Royce. <br /> <br /> It seems that the DVD will soon be released in Region 2. The copy of Region 1 I is of very poor quality. Hopefully they have cleaned it. <br /> <br /> Only the court's escape sequence, which is unreliable, spoils what would otherwise be a great movie, but I think it is in line with the label of the caper with which the movie.
