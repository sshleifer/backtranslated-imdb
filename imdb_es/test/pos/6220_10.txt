Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva's most political films. It adopts a firm stance against the authority status of modern society in the life of the common man, and how it has completely separated men from nature. It challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society. <br /> <br /> Vatanen (Antti Litja), suffocated, buys the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations, tries to shake the chains of society when escaping. all in the desert of northern Finland, only to realize that the concept of "free country" is not so unequivocal, in other words, society has the common man for the balls. <br /> <br /> Even so, what makes Jäniksen vuosi so exceptional, in addition to the visual and humorous brilliance, is how it seems to illustrate the entire political atmosphere in Finland in the 70s, as well as the whole identity of Finland as a nation. Vatanen is like an archetype of a classical end in its loneliness and social distance. Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of the Finns, the idea that modern society takes it slowly makes Jäniksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving.
