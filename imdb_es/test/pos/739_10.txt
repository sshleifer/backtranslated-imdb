Although not mentioned very often, "Do not look in the basement" is a very interesting film and definitely worth seeing. The story follows a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, who is hired at Stephen's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens, after he was killed by a patient. Many patients begin to torment Ms. Beale, and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, acts as if she were hiding something ... <br /> <br /> This movie has many attractive characters that you really end up worrying about and have sympathy for the climax, which does not happen very often in horror movies. The musical score is great and reminiscent of "Dark Shadows", the performance of Rosie Holotik, Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee are great, the story is very intriguing with a great ending. This film has a surrounding countryside atmosphere that no other film I have seen has been able to capture. Many terror fans have never seen or heard of this movie, which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic. Definitely worth seeing "Do not look in the basement" for all the fans of the 1970s movies.
