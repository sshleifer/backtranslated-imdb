What I can say about this film, apart from the narrative, is one of the most exciting in the history of cinema ... and is based on a true story! Being old enough to remember the Berlin Wall when it was still used to contain a country, this film gives you a dark vision of the dark imprisonment of East Berliners and their desperate attempts to escape, no matter the cost. The film follows the lives of two families, who decide to escape using a balloon manufactured by themselves. Always afraid of being arrested by the authorities, under the scrutiny of the neighbors, they have to calculate a plan to get to the other side of the wall. A tense and exciting story of courage and determination that really pays tribute to all those who succeeded and failed in the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom.
