I read the previous comment and I can not believe it! Of course it is a movie for children, it is an adaptation of a book for children! This movie is easy to obtain, try play.com or amazon and it is very easy to get a copy. The jokes are fun for children and adults alike, and the adventure is clean and without violence! It is completely suitable for children of all ages! The songs are fabulous, and yes, a bit repetitive, but that's what the children need and as they watched, I heard my little ones sing "hi hi cocalorum" all night! They loved it, a story of innocence and friendship! Very beautiful and worth seeing for children and adults of all ages.
