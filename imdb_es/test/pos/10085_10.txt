This is one of the best movies I've seen ... <br /> <br /> It's so full of details and every time you see it you'll find new things ... Like the father is in the shower. But even so, he only hears one voice, and when the girls falter, they can not do it at the same time because then there would be two girls and there are not any. <br /> <br /> I have some trouble finding out, in the middle of the movie, your "uncle" visits you, but why does your wife go crazy? If not a fantastic movie !!! The best Asian movie in history. <br /> <br /> I hope people enjoy it. There have been so many movies, where the main character is skit-so (the machinist, the secret window, etc.), but this movie is much better than them.
