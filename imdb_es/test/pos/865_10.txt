If you were ever a fan of MTV's "The State," then these three guys will be familiar to you. But even if you only hit them on the Internet like I did, you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy. <br /> <br /> Born from their comedy trio, 'Stella', Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain produced these brilliant surreal comedy cartoons to show at their shows, and are now available only to download two Websites, appear in a pristine glory on a DVD. <br /> <br /> Think of the sketch of the uncensored comedy, and you'll be halfway there. There is no stone of decency left without moving. who like their rude comedy, self-indulgent and close to the puerile, (and I say it in the most flattering way) this is the DVD for you! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth the money for the comment of the two, Michaels and David alone, you can not stop liking them as they explain their actions, they shudder at their own mischief with s Ex toys and, to In turn, they slap on the back and launch abuse. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. <br /> <br /> You must say something to Stella's appeal that the likes of Julie Bowen and Paul Rudd are willing to take action without fear. And you should follow your good example, throw preconceptions into the wind and prepare to laugh sick.
