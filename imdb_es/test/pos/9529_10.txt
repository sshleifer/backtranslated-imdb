I've seen this movie countless times, and I never stopped loving it for its simplicity, sincerity and kindness. Great characterizations of all the actors, and the charming steam trains that play such an important supporting role. I confess that I fell in love with Roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today. Shown on television in New Zealand on Christmas Day, the best gift she could have had.
