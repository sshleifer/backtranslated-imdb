There is a unique place in the pantheon of the John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films without box office names in which Ford did not have to adapt the film to the personality of a star like John Wayne, Henry Fonda or any of the others with whom he worked. It is not surprising that Ford considered all of these as favorites of one kind or another. <br /> <br /> Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr., a pair of friendly cowpokes sign to guide a Mormon wagon to a valley in Arizona territory. On the way, they are first joined by a group of players stranded from a medical program and then a family of outlaws in the race named Clegg. Their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> If Wagonmaster had been made even 10 years earlier with the strength of the two performances between Johnson and Carey, probably both would have had a great Careers like the image of the cowboys. In Johnson's case, it would have been art imitating life. Johnson was a true rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a chain of horses for John Ford to use at Fort Apache. Ford was impressed by his presence and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> But the Western West day was coming to an end, and Johnson and Carey had a great career as two actors of great character. <br /> <br /> Ward Bond plays Mormon leader Elder Wiggs. However, Bond is a recent convert and has trouble remembering not to use four-letter words. But he is the leader because of his strength of character, not his impeccable LDS theology. It turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. <br /> <br /> In portraying the Cleggs, Ford only had to go back four years to his My Darling Clementine. They are the reincarnation of the Clanton band and pure evil. In fact, if Walter Brennan, who after My Darling Clementine refused to return to work for Ford, was willing to see him as Shiloh Clegg, the head of the family. As Charles Kemper did a good job, this is probably the role in which he stands out the most. Shortly after finishing this movie, Kemper died in a car accident. He could very well have worked for Ford in the future. <br /> <br /> Ford makes Mormons pacifists here and I do not remember that pacifism was part of the LDS doctrine. However, here it works, the idea is that these people who do not carry weapons are innocent when dealing with evil people like the Cleggs. A few jeans are needed to dispose of them properly. I think this post-World War II movie is trying to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. <br /> <br /> Another remnant of My Darling Clementine is that Alan Mowbray plays the same kind of role he played there as the head of the medical entertainment company. Part of that company is Joanne Dru, who is doing another round as a woman of elastic virtues, just as she did in Red River. Dru used to do so many westerns that he wanted to be out of the gingham and put on some modern fashions. <br /> <br /> Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I am willing to bet in the state of Utah. It is a very popular movie. .
