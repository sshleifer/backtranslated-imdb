I must say that I did not expect to sit down a lot to see "Pitch Black", but I recovered a lot, in terms of emotion and pure fun. It is the kind of movie in which you can lie down, relax and have a good time just entertaining yourself. This is not a profound movie in any way. All it offers is recycled or scammed from other movies like "Alien", "Predator" or similar. But when I see a scam, I want it to be good, and this scam is great. <br /> <br /> It opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the best movies of all time open with this type of scene: "2001", "Star Wars", "Alien", "Predator". A ship navigates through space when it awakens within the entire crew cryogenically frozen. The ship has been hit by something. They collide on a nasty little planet with three suns. Everyone leaves the ship when they find that their transport of prisoners, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), has escaped confinement. They scan the desert planet in search of it and finally find it, but they have no way to make their ship fly again. They search the planet for water and civilization, but it seems that all of them suddenly disappeared from the planet not long ago. <br /> <br /> Then they discover that every 22 years the planets are aligned in a solar eclipse and the whole planet. The planet turns black. It also happens that there are lots of aliens that thrive in the darkness that live on the planet, what are the possibilities? It happens that they are on the planet just when the eclipse occurs, what are the possibilities? And Riddick has a weird talent, which he can see in the dark. Once again, what are the possibilities? <br /> <br /> There seems to be a lot of coincidence in this movie, but a movie like this one is not available. To obtain the Oscars for their originality or credibility. He is there to entertain the audience, he does it easily. Vin Diesel is a great gorilla of a man without talent for acting. But I have to say that if there is someone who can fit into the part of a murderous criminal of poor quality is Diesel. Listen to him mutter: "I did not know who he was fucking with." Big things. <br /> <br /> The aliens in this movie are a mix of hammerheads, "Alien" and Predators. They have long horizontal heads like a hammerhead shark, the agility of fast movements of the aliens and the stealth of a predator. I suppose David Twohy (director and writer of the film) did not expect the public to believe that his creatures were really something never seen before. At least I hope not. <br /> <br /> "Aliens Redux" could be a better name for this movie, but, again, it's better than the second and third "Alien" movies together. In a time when seemingly finished series are revived - "Terminator 3", "Alien 5", "Predator 3", "Alien vs. Predator" - "Pitch Black" stands out as a new series. Two more sequels are planned. Let's hope they do not get carried away. I can imagine it in twenty-five years: "Aliens vs. Predator vs. Pitch Black Aliens: * The Fight of the Year". <br /> <br /> * The title of Fight of the Year can be shared with the upcoming movie "Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leatherface vs. Norman Bates vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barny the Dinosaur". <br /> <br /> 4/5.
