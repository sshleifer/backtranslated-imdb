When "Madame" decides to let her cats inherit her, that creates problems. Snob Butler Edgar, who is next in line to inherit, decides to get rid of the cats. In this way, the story can begin and the cats can undertake an adventure that otherwise would have been impossible. An adventure that allows them to meet the charming cat, but not entirely reliable, O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and fun situations until the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> The strength of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is willing to adjust the score and, of course, himself receives some serious beatings. One of the best scenes contains him being pursued by the two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is excellent and, as in "The Jungle Book," you have scenes that are almost "musical" in the sense that the story does not progress and the goal is to let the protagonists express themselves through the dance. And, of course, we like that the score is pretty Jazzy. <br /> <br /> And, of course, it's not just me, but also my children who love this one. <br /> <br /> Greetings, Simon
