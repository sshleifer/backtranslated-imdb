Now I understand that this movie was not an accusation against all the Indians, but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians have regarding their women and their sexuality. I have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society (with the women murdered because the husband's family does not want them anymore after his death or because she had a small dowry, as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing). I also realize that some of this culture will be greatly offended by the movie, but the bottom line is that there is some truth in the subject, even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in India a decade ago. As a result of the extreme misogyny in the film, most members of the Western audience will be surprised or at least emotionally attracted to the plight of the ladies in this film. <br /> <br /> Even though I am a man, I am not. rabidly feminist and I am heterosexual, the film had a strong positive impact on me and is NOT a film on the agenda that only lesbians and "those who hate" can enjoy. In fact, I do not think the film promotes hatred towards men or homosexuality, but offers a credible argument that, in the case of these two ladies, it was the only reasonable alternative because of their wicked husbands. Yes, I use the word "evil" and I mean it, since the two spouses who live in this big house are extremely selfish and do not take into account the sexuality of their spouses. In many traditional societies, this is the case and women are condemned to an empty emotional existence. <br /> <br /> A husband married a vivacious young woman, Sita, out of family obligation. This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for both of them, but initially Sita tries to connect with her sulky husband. However, he sees himself as a victim and might have worried less about Sita, and continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady. To make matters worse, he did nothing to hide the matter and did not apologize. In her deceased marriage, sex was meant exclusively to produce children and there was no way Sita could meet any of her sexual or emotional needs. And unfortunately, he did not care. <br /> <br /> Another husband was married to a woman who was infertile (Radha). Interestingly, after initially trying to have children, the next 13 years have passed without any sexual contact! It is because this man has decided to become an ascetic (that is, in Hinduism, a person who abandons the pleasures of the world to obtain inner illumination). Now, his desire to do this was very good if he was not married and had obligations to his wife. However, being married, this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother, he assumed that his wife had no sexual feelings or seemed to care. The closest he would allow sexually was to sleep with him, since having her by his side helped teach himself to "overcome the desires of the flesh." This must have brought you nothing but frustration. <br /> <br /> Then, there are two normal and abandoned women who live in the same house who crave an emotional connection, as well as an outlet for their sexual needs. Eventually, these needs reunite these sisters-in-law, at first, only emotionally but later sexually as well. The film was brilliant how it made me see and understand how, in some cases, homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, when the intensity of their sexual life the relationship is discovered, it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction of the "enlightened" husband of Radha, a man who seeks vision and peace religious, but is so wrapped up in itself that true vision and growth are impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a very challenging and adult movie. While there is very little nudity, the subject is very adult and this is not a movie to show their children. Very disturbing is a secondary character who masturbates in front of a paralyzed old woman. Like I said, this is NOT a movie for your children to see. However, for a mature audience, this is an excellent and highly erotic movie that will make you think. <br /> <br /> The film presents good acting, complex characters, excellent writing, lovely music and a slow rhythm. It might bother some, but I found it rewarding. The only serious negative that I can not blame the film itself, but the idiots who posted this on a videotape. This is because, although the film is in English, the accents are quite strong at times and it is not always easy to understand what is being said. BUT, and this is the worst part, there are no open or open subtitles, including them is a necessity for Western audiences. If you watch this movie, see if you can find it on a DVD or, hopefully, a newer version in the video will have subtitles. Not mine. <br /> <br /> By the way, the director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful movies like EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. A constant theme in his films is the conflict between culture and the traditional expectations of India and Occidentalism, with a strong emphasis on female characters. It is not surprising that this Western-thinking woman settles in Canada and is divorced, a truly unusual woman, at least. For a similar film that explores traditional culture and Western culture, try another Canadian gem, COMA TO DRINK THE WOMAN OF MAN.
