Eisenstein was not only one of the best Soviet film directors, Russians, but one of the great masters of cinema, among Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles and others. One of the best things in all his films was the editing, very personal, and in this film it is exceptional. This was his first sound film and the use of the musical score of the great Russian composer Serge Prokofiev in the sequence of the battle is a perfect contrast between music and image. Watching this movie is like taking a lesson or a film lesson, something that many film directors can not afford. I never tire of seeing REAL CLASSICS like this movie. I hope that in the near future more people will recognize a great work of art.
