"Classes tous risques" is one of the best "gangster" noirs that France has produced. Perfect cast: Lino Ventura, a young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who did "A bout de souffle", something Godard, the same year), Marcel Dalio and an excellent cast; brilliant script by José Giovanni, who also wrote "le trou", Becker's masterpiece the same year. What a year for him !: wonderful black and white cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet. And tense action, first class. Directed by Claude Sautet, who surpasses Jean-Pierre Melville. While the latter films a gangster movie with metaphysical pretensions, which sometimes lasts more than two hours, Claude Sautet directs men of flesh and blood, and the presence of the two children adds extraordinary moments. An emotion that Melville has never been able to generate. And Sautet avoids pathos, excessive sentimentality: the last time Ventura sees his children, getting off on the subway is a maximum point of contained emotion. <br /> <br /> Ventura portrays a whos gangster The die starts when the movie starts. He thinks he can trust his old acquaintances, but they are all cowards. We are far from Jacques Becker's beloved men's friendship ("touchez pas au grisbi"), in which Melville was to continue. the sixties, sometimes instigated by bad women (the film noir misogyny par excellence), living in a rotten microcosm, ready to inform, we are far from the simplistic behavior of Jean Seberg in the "opus" of Godard -. <br /> <br /> Cloquet works wonders with the image: the scene on the beach on a night without stars when the two children see their mother die after the shooting with the customs officers is absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> There is a good use of the voice-over, which Sautet only uses when necessary, therefore, the last lines make the end even stronger than if we had attended the scenes. <br /> <br /> Claude Sautet had found a good niche, and he followed the rules of "classes tous risques" pretty well with his follow-up "l'arme à gauche" (1965) which featured Ven Tura again and He made good use of a desert island and a ship. If I had continued in that direction, France would have had a Howard Hawks. In his later works, only "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971) showed some brilliance. It was shown in the first half of the sixties. He had become, from "les choses de la vie" onwards, the director of quality cinema, who used to focus on the bourgeois of the tender heart in works such as "Cesar et Rosalie" (1972). , "Vincent François, Paul et les autres" (1974) or "Mado" (1976)
