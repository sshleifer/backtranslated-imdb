We just watched this movie in Austin, Texas, at the Alamo South Lamar yesterday afternoon. It made me laugh out loud many times! The scene about Albert Einstein's thoughts on humanity hit me again and again and I could not stop laughing. It's a pity that I'm not in any more theaters. I know many friends who die to see this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you". ... great work for everyone involved! Also, if you see it, be sure to stay until the end of the credits too! I am going to take my family to see him again this weekend for sure! If you are a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, you should go see this movie. It's a classic and nobody knows it's out! So if you want to see something fun this weekend, definitely, take a look.
