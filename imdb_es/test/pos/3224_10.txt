I was hooked to "GG" from mid-2001 to 2002 (second season), when I tuned in to see "Smallville" 10 minutes earlier. Thanks to "Beginnings", now I have all but 2 episodes recorded, until the night before (Ep 4.9). I am a middle-aged heterosexual man, and this is the ONLY weekly television show that I see. <br /> <br /> I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a very beautiful, funny and intelligent woman to boot; b) the dialogue is very well written; c) It's totally hilarious, putting excess garbage like "Everybody Loves Raymond" is a shame. Many current television comedies have been strongly influenced by the very successful and much despised slime pit known as "Married with children", where the viewer is encouraged to mock and feel superior to the characters. In "GG", the characters have flaws, but we can see our weaknesses in them and laugh with them, not with them. This is a stimulus for television, where writers challenge us to keep up with rapid exchanges and references to popular culture / literature / current events outside the left field. It gives me immense pleasure to see these episodes again and again, capturing all the phrases and references of previous episodes. Stars Hollow is your own little world, one that I will happily keep visiting while the series is published.
