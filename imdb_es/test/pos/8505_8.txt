I saw it for the first time when it was shown for the first time, so I'm not too objective about it. It really scared me, partly because it was very late at night, but partly because of all the feeling of a suspense story recorded on video (the same thing that helped Dark Shadows itself). And the casting was very good. I barely know Shane Briant for anything else, so it might not be so right to call him "well thrown", but to me, he is Dorian Gray. And as far as the other male actors are concerned, the one that most suited his role was Nigel Davenport (who is as good at the characters "bigger than life") as Sir Henry. And John Karlen, a kind of "repertory player" by Dan Curtis at that time, due to Dark Shadows. As one poster points out, this version manages to include relationships with men, in a rather subtle way. The scene in which Dorian recites a list of the names of the men to the character of John Karlen, as a way to blackmail him, and the look on Karlen's face, were very well done. (If that scene were done now, it would probably be done in a VERY OBVIOUS way, and it would be bad in comparison). I saw it when "Dorian Gray" was just a name for me, not to mention, so even more than the famous 1945 version (which is just famous), this is the version for me.
