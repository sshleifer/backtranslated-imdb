I thought that this movie was great, not only because of its history but also because it was represented to a large extent by the excellent cast. I read that Drew Barrymore was not exceptional like Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes, maybe, but in the movie she played outside herself, which caused a simple girl to look for who she is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics there are, sure I am. David Arquette is crazy like his brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is beautiful like Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job as her partner Aldys, someone who was not afraid to be herself. I think this movie should get more credit instead of being rated as a "tiny" movie
