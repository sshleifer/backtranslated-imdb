Trapped by the vision of a war situation where the Vargtimmen couple (well, they have different initial names and situations, but the actors are the same) is caught in the crossfire of two fronts. The representation of the parties in combat as anonymous and superordinate authorities are often captured in sublime surreal images and draw interesting parallels with Orwell's 1984 ones, even if Bergman frustrates this personal context of a slowly growing marital war. That is why innumerable fundamental and philosophical questions about the marriage of Eva and Jan are relevant and essential, while the threat and danger from the outside open a gulf in the interior that was previously covered with ailments. An intense allegory about the fragile fa√ßades of civic conventions.
