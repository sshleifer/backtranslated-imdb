This was one of the worst episodes of Columbo I've seen, however, I'm only in the second season. <br /> <br /> Typical Columbo activities are fun and irritating. His cigar ashes that cause him problems have been seen before, and the part where he always identifies in some way with the killer, in this case cooking, although the scene in the television cooking program was distracted from the main theme. <br /> <BR> It was also not explained why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the cables from the mixer. The reason was never explained, nor did it serve any purpose. But the part that most displeased me was the death of the bride. This was never explained and is the main reason why I give this episode such a low rating.
