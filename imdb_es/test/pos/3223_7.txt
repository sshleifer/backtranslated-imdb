Every time I see this program, I want to turn it off and curse the creators for wasting my time week after week. The dialogues, or the monologues, rather, as everyone complains nonstop about anything, are becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I saw yesterday began with a seemingly endless chatter about how a particular dish (I forgot what pasta was with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family's dinner into a total war. And these were only a few seconds or so. <br /> <br /> It seems that every time, many lines, with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use must be huge. <br /> <br /> But once in a while something happens. The babbling stops and suddenly these wonderful emotional and silent moments appear. For example, this week was the breakdown of Lorelai in the real estate agent. I just thought it was the best piece of TV I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It almost makes it all worthwhile.
