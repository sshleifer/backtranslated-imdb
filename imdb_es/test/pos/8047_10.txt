Some of the critics here have foolishly judged this silent movie according to today's standards of political correctness. <br /> <br /> "Battle" was an excellent movie for several reasons, correctly pointed out by more rational reviewers: excellent cast, lots of action, innovative editing and photography. <br /> <br /> His stars were indeed the D.W. The company of actions Griffith and for this fanatic of the silent film, is an incentive enough to see and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago and I saw it again on YouTube; that was an impression of very poor quality, but along with my memory of a good impression in a real theater, I can rightly recommend reasonable people and film historians.
