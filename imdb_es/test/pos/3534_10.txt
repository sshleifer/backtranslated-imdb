Just Before Dawn, 1981, is one of the best stories about horror in nature. He is one of the best slashers of the 80s and easily blows films like The Final Terror, Do not Go in the Woods or The Prey out of the water. <br /> <br /> A group of young adults Come and see the mountain property that one of the groups has just bought. However, they are not alone in nature. A great murderer raised, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates intruders. <br /> <br /> Director Lieberman, who gave us B movies as good as Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), also does an excellent job with this intelligent thriller. The film is pleasantly atmospheric, with a feeling of progressive tension and a strong suspense. This film makes even open nature seem terribly claustrophobic. The places of Oregon are beautiful and well captured by the astute cinematography. The musical score is really original and impressive in contrast to the scenic images. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson is a great asset, her presence was captivating. Gregg Henry offers a good performance as Benson's lover and Chris Lemon offers some occasional charisma. The cast, especially veteran actor Kennedy, also does quite well. <br /> <br /> A true gem of the slasher genre, which does not need gore to thrill. Definitely worth looking for both for fans of slashers and for lovers of terror. See it! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
