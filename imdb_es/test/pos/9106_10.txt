This is the only thing I can look back on since 2006 and say now that it has shaken. It rocked strong, and yet it also oscillated tasty. Mr. MEATLOAF gave a nice touch to this movie dish before the opening credits came out. Now that it tells you something, this movie shook even before it BEGAN! Now I do not want to give much away or be a "spoiler", but this movie ROCKED! If you've listened to the new album and you've thought "this looks like a tenacious material below the standard, it's as if I'm just playing badminton with Satan, what's wrong?" Then, this film will elevate your appreciation for music and you will marvel at this satanic masterpiece of steam. For those who would like it better, they do not know what they want, because it would not be D anymore. This movie is the D period. So, venture if you dare to see the local theater if you want to take off your socks. .
