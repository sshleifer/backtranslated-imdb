After being fired from their last job and finding a scant job in the UK, the six members of the Wonder Boys, better known as The Crazy Gang, see a job advertisement in the city of Red Gulch at the Gold Hulch in the Yukon territory. It's from a newspaper clipping and in the back there's a story about Chamberlain that says it's better that the country be prepared for war. Outside of them they go to Yukon and The Frozen Limits. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is the case of the Chamberlains out of place. The cut is forty years old and refers to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer War instead of Neville in the current crisis. But that's typical of how things are going for this team. I can see Stan Laurel making the same mistake. <br /> <br /> Of course, when they get there, it's a ghost town inhabited only by the young Jean Kent and his grandfather Moore Marriott. He is leaving in years and is a little moved in the head. Marriott has a gold mine that is out of place somewhere he sleeps while he sleeps. The gang will help you better to find that mine or, otherwise, pretty, Mrs. Kent will not marry the unconditional hunter Anthony Hulme, but with the owner of the room Bernard Lee, a fate worse than death. Crazy Gang and I can see why they were so acclaimed in the UK and why they never had any impact on the pond. The jokes are fast and furious and then there were a number of things that the Code in the United States simply did not allow. The jokes are also strictly British news and many things could not happen here. <br /> <br /> The gags are universal, the final scene of the persecution is worthy of everything the Marx brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you see The Frozen Limits, paste it if you're familiar with British history and execute it two or three times to make sure you pick it up. Will be worth.
