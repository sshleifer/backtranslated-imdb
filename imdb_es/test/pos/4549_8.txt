This movie is hilarious. The laughs never stop. Each scene is filled to the brim with a hilarious comedy. Chris Farley is a comic book genius, and Spade plays his character perfectly. Farley was one of the best slapping comics of all time, and in this movie (as in all his movies) we see how much time and energy he devoted to portraying his character in the way that best suits him. "Tommy Boy" is an excellent example of comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
