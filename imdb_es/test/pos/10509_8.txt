I do not see why everyone is bombarding this so much. I thought it was a very funny time that, unfortunately, was not popular enough to be so famous. Believe me, I've seen much worse than this. If you want a bad movie, go to the blood hut or the dead alien or something. So, what is this normal, but better than most? And it is mirable. This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard. Part of the music is very suspense. And the scenes of death are great too. We see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words SOLD written in blood on the mirror, and we also get a double beating by a toilet drain! With attached razor blades! This was a fun slasher from the 80s that is definitely worth it despite what others say about it.
