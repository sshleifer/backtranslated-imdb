The ruthless mercenary Bruno Rivera (Paul Naschy in his maximum unpleasant expression) betrays his pregnant partner / girlfriend Meiko (well played by Eiko Nagashima) in order to have exclusive dibs of a fortune in stolen diamonds. But Meiko manages to seriously hurt Bruno before he escapes. Bruno ends up in the ostentatious villa of the kind and rich doctor Don Simon (an excellent performance by Lautaro Murua). It also attracts the attention of the two attractive daughters of Simon: the hot Monica (Silvia Aguiler) and the sweet Alicia (very well rehearsed by the charming Azucena Hern√°ndez). However, Bruno soon realizes that something is wrong with the isolated place and plans to escape as soon as he can. Meanwhile, the bitter Meiko tries to find Bruno to be able to take revenge on him. Naschy, who wrote and directed as well as stars, invents one of his strangest, twisted and perverse horror vehicles with this little weirdness. The extravagant plot and the mysterious atmosphere become more strange and disconcerting as the story unfolds, which eventually leads to a surprising and surprisingly surprising ending. This film benefits even more from the occasional moments of graphic gore (watch out for the memorable sequence with a poor man devoured alive by vicious pigs who eat meat!), Alejandro Ullo's cinematography and the good amount of nudity and soft sex. The good turns of support of Roxana Dupre as the shameless maid Raquel, Pepe Ruiz as the loving Don Serafin, and Julia Saly as the crazy Teresa. A nice and valuable cry that is worth it.
