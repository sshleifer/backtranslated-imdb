The movie was excellent, except for some of the scenes with Esposito. I enjoyed how he met all the detectives in the series and I wrapped up some arguments that were never solved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together in their most human and basic person. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but as usual will be overlooked. It hurt to see that this was the end of the homicide. The memories, the tapes and the repetitions in CourtTV are not the same as seeing it appear every Friday. But the film did its job and it did very well, presenting a great representation of life after Al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit. I enjoyed it a lot.
