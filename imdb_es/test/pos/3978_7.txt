A good movie. The movie was even better than the commercials. And believe it or not, it was very inspiring. I really believe that anyone who leaves the film at the end will feel inspired in one way or another. <br /> <br /> It was a little cheesy at first, but it recovers quickly. I laughed. I laughed very hard in some parts. The performance is basically above average, nothing special, but better than the average. I can say for sure that it was the second funniest movie that premiered this summer (the first funniest one is CLERKS II). So after all that I give it a 7/10 (a maximum of seven, but not an eight).
