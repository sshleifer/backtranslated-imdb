Being an avid fan of the carpenter, I really loved this movie (although the wigs leave a lot to be desired!) And I agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of his life were absent or not touched. Whatever it is, leave your curiosity well and truly dissatisfied, so I went to discover more. I should recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent reading and, unlike the movie, it is "real" and realistic. I hope you enjoy. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy. She is a singer (also a dancer) in her own right and I think this was the necessary advantage to create the character. Some other actresses may have struggled with this. It is a pity that the film has not gone deeply into its history. After all, this is the title of the film, but I felt that we learned more about Richard, but I suppose that, like any artist worthwhile, you should always leave them wanting more!
