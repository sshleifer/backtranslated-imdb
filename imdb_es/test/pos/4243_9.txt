Bride of Chucky starts late one night when officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the testing room at his police station and, among all the horror movie of the joke, steals the remains of the Chucky doll that the killer in series Charles Lee Ray had long ago. in the original Child's Play (1988). Take the remains to an isolated area where Ray's ex-girlfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) cuts Bailey's throat and carries the remains to her trailer. There, Tiffany sews and staples Chucky (with the voice of Brad Dourif) again and using a book of 'Voodoo for Dummies' returns him to the murderous life. Things do not go as Tiffany had hoped and Chucky turns out not to be the man of his dreams after all, so he locks it up in a play pen in which Chucky is not so happy. While Tiffany takes a bath, Chucky escapes, electrocutes her and, using that book, gives her life back in the shape of a doll dressed as a bride. They also do not want to be stuck in plastic bodies and have to work together to get to a cemetery in New Jersey where Ray's natural body had been buried with the amulet necessary to turn his spirits back into human bodies. The bodies of Tiffany's neighbor, Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), who are fleeing Jade's corrupt uncle, Police Chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), will do very well ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Ronny Yu I love Bride of Chucky. The script of Don Mancini is very funny, very fast, very entertaining and makes reference to many other horror movies with a lot of love. From the opening sequence where we see the Jason Voorhees hockey mask on Friday the 13th, the Freddy Krueger shaving glove from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series and the Michael Myers mask from the Halloween franchise. To the clips used by Bride of Frankenstein (1935) when it recreates virtually the same scene. Bride of Chucky never takes seriously what is good, there are many liners, self-referential gags that Scream (1996) put in style a few years before and does not seem afraid to make fun of himself and the horror genre. in general. I love the scene where Jesse and Jade are having a muddy romantic conversation that Chucky listens to and makes derogatory comments and gestures fun at all times. That does not mean that there is not a good movie there also because there certainly is. The director Yu manages to create a good atmosphere and a true sense of fun, both the human and plastic character sets are nice and bright, since each couple suffers their own domestic problems that the trail of corpses that are leaving behind obviously it would cause Technically, Bride of Chucky is great for the most part and has a big budget for it and with about $ 25,000,000, I hope so. All I'll say is that some of Kevin Yagher's puppet effects are a little stiff and unconvincing, and I can not remember any CGI scene in Bride of Chucky either. Fortunately, the film does not neglect blood and blood with a cold slit throat, nails smashed into someone's face in a presumably Hellraiser tribute (1987), people impaled on pieces of glass, someone bloody destroyed by a huge truck , pierced lip piercing and several stabs and shots. The acting is pretty good and Dourif like Chucky is very funny while spitting the coatings. I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning and I find her very sexy when she is using all that fetish equipment, can not I be the only one? Personally I think that Bride of Chucky is a fantastic movie, total entertainment from beginning to end, great humor and horror in equal measure and with only 85 minutes of duration it never gets boring or boring. One of my personal favorites, look at it as soon as you can.
