I missed it at the cinema and I've rented it on DVD. If you have the opportunity, I would recommend it, since it is better than almost everything I have seen in the cinema or in DVd this year. That does not mean it's one of the best movies in history, it's just that I've seen a lot of garbage :) <br /> <br /> I can not really add to what is already said except 8/10
