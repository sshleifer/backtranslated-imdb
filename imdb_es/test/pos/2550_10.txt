For the same reason that I love movies like "Central do Brasil" ("Central Station", 1998), I really love "Chop Shop". There is no layer of sugar, there is no attempt to make these people's lives become more pleasant or beautiful. What you see is what you get, and that is often harsh and sometimes heartbreaking. But that's exactly what makes a movie like "Chop Shop" so wonderful, along with the fact that the story unfolds in an elegant and subtle way. For a young brother and sister, who are almost as close to homelessness as one would wish to have, to work (and live) in a body repair shop in Queens, New York is the best you can find. Is this something good or bad? That is the question that this movie essentially poses to the viewer. This movie is really a fantastic piece of life that sometimes feels like a documentary rather than a drama, and that's a great thing, because it looks and feels so real. In the midst of that, so many current films based on essentially surrealist and often implausible arguments, stumbling upon "Chop Shop" is like finding a little gem.
