Asterix and the Vikings is the first animated asterix movie in more than 12 years since 1994 "Asterix conquered America". It also has the honor of being the first digitally colored asterisk animation, which makes the story, largely entertaining, much more impressive to watch. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this movie is vividly represented in bright, bright tones that adhere to the color schemes of the comics on which it was based. The designs of the characters also adhere relatively to the comic, for better or for worse, retaining the simple but unique aspect of the characters. Being simple in terms of character design, this allows more time and effort to be spent on real animation, which by the way surpasses many other big screen theatrical animated films. Character movements are very fluid and possess a quality that seems far beyond what a modest budget would normally produce; there is always something that moves in each scene and there is no evidence of the usual cost reduction shortcuts. 3D computer images are seamlessly incorporated with traditionally animated 2D art. In any case, the shading style makes the 3D elements look more like traditional comic paintings than CGI models. <br /> <br /> The plot takes much of its comic book elements "Asterix and the Normans", and this is where its main flaw lies. As an adaptation of that comic, "Asterix and the Vikings" takes too many liberties with its source material. Undoubtedly, comic book fans will find that they do not like the story of the film and its lack of adherence to the source. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, one can see this story as a very funny one if taken on its own without comparing it with its source material. Very comical, well written jokes dot the optimistic script. The most entertaining parts were the numerous references of pop culture and ridicule in the modern life of the 21st century. Mobile communications, the shopping channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are falsified with great effect. Excellent chemistry and performance of the cast (I saw it in English by the way), although a couple of voices like Cacofonix seemed very irritating (but I think it's all part of his character). <br /> <br /> Yes There is something to criticize about the story, it is the lack of "asterix". This story seems to be more like Justforkix's story about teenage romance and "coming of age" with Asterix and Obelix simply playing side roles. This gives a great feeling of rigidity, since much of the elements of the story are the usual basic elements of these films for teenagers. Derived and clich√© at times, only the ingenious comedy and the traditional elements of "Astrix" (the Romans, pirates, etc.) manage to avoid that this film falls into a simple mediocrity. <br /> <br /> While it is not the best installation in the world. Asterix's library of animated films is undoubtedly one of the funniest, the best scripted and the most beautifully animated. DVD seems a bit hard to get though ????????
