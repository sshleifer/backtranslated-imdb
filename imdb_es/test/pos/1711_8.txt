If (as I just pointed out in THE GOAT) Keaton is following the tradition that the comics are in disagreement with the law, this short Langdon (the last one published before he made TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic ploy : be married to a cunning wife, and try to escape by some secret date twice. Laurel and Hardy did this in several movies, as did Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with that, why do these characters always marry such unpleasant women? And there is an interesting sociological theme, why do not you find female comics married to male counterparts of these shrews? I can not remember any, except in a sketch by Carol Burnett, where the two most unpleasant members of two couples discover that they prefer someone to return him as well as possible (a kind of mutual sadomasochism, but also the assurance that his unmarried with a type of Namby-Pamby). As for the fact that comics marry shrews, I suppose you can imagine that they get what they deserve. Or them? Does Ollie really deserve a wife to throw him pots and dishes? Yes, he went to that convention at SONS OF THE DESERT that ruined his plans, but he wanted to have a private moment, there's nothing to suggest that he and Stan cheated on their wives. Actually, he is in love with Mae Busch because he lied to him while Stan collapsed and told his wife the truth. <br /> <br /> Here Harry's wife (Alice Ward) is shown at first talking to her mother about how she keeps him under tight control. We see Harry at work (it's Saturday morning, and the work ends at noon for the rest of the weekend, this was before the idea of ​​a job five days a week, 40 hours a week at the industry). He works in a foundry in which the red metal hits (a joke about Langdon: he is a small, light man, not the muscular guy to swing a hammer). He just missed his tram trying to give birth to a man. Call home to explain things and get from the lady to arrive two minutes late. <br /> <br /> On the way home, Harry meets his friend Steve (Vernon Dent), who has met two nice and sweet girls who would love to have a date. Harry is indecisive, but he accepts it after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay the hot dogs for the four, he has a half silver dollar of 1926 in his pocket). But his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers her hidden "hiding place" of coins. He keeps it hidden under the living room rug and finds it walking along the edge of the carpet. But his wife spies on him, and confiscates everything. Later, she hears him speak alone and reprimands her. In contempt, she gives him back a penny and says he can give him a soda to his date. <br /> <br /> But Harry has a second coin cache and dresses for the appointment, and leaves. He and Dent apparently arrive late, and Dent blames Harry, but Harry tries to compensate: he produces two prostitutes. They fight when Dent (wisely) says they are not the kind of girls he would call "good". Eventually the girls show up and the date begins. But soon Harry hides in the roar, while his wife goes through his roadster, and the friends become furious with their two rivals. <br /> <br /> The short works well and is fun, and gives us a better idea of ​​the person that Harry Langdon developed in his brief stardom as a comic book teacher. He is constantly put by others. He misses his tram because a stranger keeps asking for smoke and a light, and in the end the stranger gets his. The cute girl that is Harry's date has a puppy that drives him away. He rests between two cars that start to move away and ends up wrapped around a pole. Without a doubt, it shows that Langdon had his character on the screen by the time he did his duties. If only I could have kept the whole complex beyond those first three traits.
