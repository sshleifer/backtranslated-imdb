S. Epatha Merkerson shines as a Nanny in this moving and vibrant look of the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under the tutelage of Nanny. The film offers a good study of the character of Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture the ups and downs of life in a realistic way, unlike so many memories that become a movie. The supporting cast adds a lot of sparkle and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles, such as Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig. It loses some steam and vitality towards the end, and the final sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling. But, in general, a great movie with a truly exceptional performance by Merkerson.
