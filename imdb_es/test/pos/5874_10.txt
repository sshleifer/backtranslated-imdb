What can be said about any Wilder movie is that they are the most human and real stories about people and what motivates them, annoys them, persecutes them. Billy created images as paintings that remain forever reflecting the human condition. He paints the good and the bad in all of us. He also paints with love. I can not imagine someone who has a list of the best movies without a Wilder movie. They will last because they are true. The first time I saw this film on television in the 60s, when I was a child, I had to leave the room because I felt tears crying and I was embarrassed. Now I am an older man and I still feel the tears sprouting but I do not leave the room. I knew these people and I loved them and I grew up around them. Billy retained them in this film and not in the manner of "the greatest generation" but in the most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.
