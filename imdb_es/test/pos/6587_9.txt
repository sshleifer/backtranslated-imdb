Before watching this movie, I heard a lot of praise and a lot of exclamations about how "horrible" it was. Not to take credit for this movie, I think it was not so horrible or so shocking. It's just a movie about people who live on the darkest side of the city. And a good interpretation of the point. <br /> <br /> Here is a great performance and a well-thought manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a renowned writer on the scene of the Finnish film and is the best when it comes to describing contemporary Finnish culture (although he is not the only writer for this film, but I daresay he is the main writer Anyway, correct me if I'm wrong). <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, except for Jasper Pääkkönen (the main pseudo-character, which in my opinion should have stayed on the soap opera scene), and the sets, the cuts. and the sounds are also very well made and give a great atmosphere to this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a story about sad and little interconnected destinies that, according to the well-known song of a Finnish band (Ehhuu Normaali, "Tuhansien Murheellisten Laulujen Maa", which was translated VERY into "Paha Maa" throughout Finnish society, it led to a sad and dark end accompanied by alcohol, loneliness and bad choices.And it is the side of everyday Finnish life, about 80% of the population has no conscience, unless films like is.
