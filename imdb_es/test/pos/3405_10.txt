He was 13 years old when this miniseries was first aired (and its sequel North and South, Book II). I had already been captivated by personal interest stories in / around our American Civil War, which is what interested me in seeing this program made for television. <br /> <br /> I loved it. And now I'm 29 years old and I just love it more. It's full of history, beautiful costumes, real-life characters woven in and out of the lives of fictional characters, of whom everyone cares deeply. There is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, battles, victory, defeat and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Although I had the full set of episodes on the tapes that I recorded when originally issued, I bought the complete set of N & S and N & S II from Columbia House a few years ago when they were available. Once every few years, I take a full weekend and see all the deliveries in a row, and I feel sad when the last episode comes to an end, because I want to continue watching the story of the lives of these characters. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this miniseries anymore.
