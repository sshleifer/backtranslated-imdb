It is a movie with a theatrical message mixed with some intelligent moments. Films of this type are the basis of great actors, who enjoy throwing the ball in open pieces like these. The angel that was not what we see in the old books and churches is a pretty nice change. It is repeated in Kevin Smith's piece, Dogma, almost in the same slapstick vein. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie for a good day after sucking it all. Could it be that so many movies Are we trying to complicate that we forget the simple movements of movies like this one? Possibly one of the funniest pieces I've seen in a long time, I found this on VHS in a trash can because someone's basement flooded this summer, and I grabbed a handful of tapes. <br /> <br /> Yes In a trash can, or on the silver screen, soft comedies like this are fun, you just do not have to tell everyone at a fashionable nightclub that you like, or a flamboyant political party . Just save it for you, and I bet many people will borrow it from time to time.
