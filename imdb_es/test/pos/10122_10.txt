As someone who frequently goes to the movies, I must say that this has been one of the most impressive films I've seen this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. had outstanding performances that allowed the spectators to lose themselves in the different emotions and really feel for the characters. It's nice to occasionally see a movie that does not totally depend on special effects, but allows the characters in the story to touch the human psyche on many levels. I wish Hollywood produced more movies of this caliber.
