Why would he say that? Because when the movie was over, I was in a good mood. Many people exclaim in the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be fun. For those of you who believe that you learned to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new to your career. He won an Emmy Award for best actor in a comedy series before Die Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, heaven learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was hilarious. What surprises me is how some other comments about this movie claim that there are no memorable lines or scenes. Spoiler ... <br /> <br /> The waaaambulance? I'm not a loser? Have you ever seen an adult scream that I'm not a loser before? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was great. It was funny, it was never boring and, in a cheesy Disney style, it had something to do. Something that has to do with life and, of course, with any movie for children that tries to do that is in its entirety, but for once, I did not care. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it. Do it You will like it.
