This movie is simply amazing. It's so hilarious Although skating and other assemblies are played, the comedy is incredible. Raab himself and Brandon Dicamillo are hilarious. There will be times when you can not breathe, you are laughing so hard. In addition, there are scenes that you can see hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I've seen in my life.
