Pat O'Brien had his best role as Notre Dame football coach, Knute Rockne. From his humble beginnings, Rockne joined Notre Dame as a student around 1910. He devotes himself to chemistry, but he becomes a wonderful footballer and hero. <br /> <br /> Upon graduation, he teaches chemistry at school but has football. The fever that throws him, forces him to abandon the chemistry to pursue his dream of training the game. In a way, very badly, the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher, certainly much better and prettier than he had in high school. (Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn to be exact). <br /> <br /> Motivate your students. It will not tolerate low academic performance. He is a coach for all seasons. <br /> <br /> O'Brien captures that kind and common touch. Ronald Reagan memorably plays one of his students, George Gipp, in an excellent supporting performance. <br /> <br /> The years go by and the achievements are high, but Knute is still the same kind coach who testifies before Congress when football is questioned. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp stands out as a Notre Dame priest who knew that Rockne was destined to train football. Albert Basserman is adequate, but his Jewish accent in representing a priest is, at best, uncomfortable. Basserman was nominated that year in the category of "Foreign Correspondent." <br /> <br /> The tragic death of Rockne, in a plane crash, robbed the world of many more years of a totally wonderful and professional human being. The movie is great.
