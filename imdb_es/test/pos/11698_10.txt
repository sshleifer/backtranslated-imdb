I probably should not say it because I come from Oz, but it seems to me that many of the local films lack that cohesive flow with a weak story. This comedy lacks nothing. Great story, without exaggeration, without melodrama, just a brilliant comedy as we know, Oz can do it. Do yourself a favor and laugh until you fall.
