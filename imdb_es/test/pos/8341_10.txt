Too many Christian films focus on the fear of Judgment, and as a result they are condescending and undesirably kitschy. "Second Glance" does it well. This is an almost perfect evangelical tool; This is the real reason why so many young people do not want to have anything to do with Christianity. It assures the spectators that one should abandon their sin, not their amusement, to succeed in the Christian way of life. "Second Glance" even works as a piece of film. The filmmakers were obviously working with a very low budget, but managed to write a script dynamic enough to divert the attention of viewers of this obvious fact. This film took me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to Christian stations everywhere that show it, it surely has impacted more people than just me.
