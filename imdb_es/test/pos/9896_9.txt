I just watched this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival today and I loved it. The synopsis was included in our program as "an old Shakespearean actor invites his three children to his suicide party." I was not sure if I was going to see it because when I read it I liked the idea of ​​a "suicide party", I thought it was very interesting, but the "old Shakespearean actor" had me worried that the movie was kind Of dry and boring . But I decided to try it. I am happy to have done it. It was not at all dry and boring, that dialogue was great, fun in an intelligent way, but not pretentious and difficult to understand. Peter Falk was great in this role, he stole the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by the performance of Laura San Giacomo, it generally bothers me, but I really liked seeing her in this movie. I think Judge Reinhold's part could have been better for another actor, sometimes he seemed a bit corny and seemed to act, not as if you were just watching this character. But the movie was so good that I could forgive the awkwardness of an actor. I would recommend this movie to anyone and I have already told some people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public. Who knew that suicide could be so hilarious?
