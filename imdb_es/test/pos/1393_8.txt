I saw this movie on TV as SCREAMERS and I loved it. I heard an interesting story about this movie. When Roger Corman released it to the drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent an advanced trailer that was not actually filming the movie. Supposedly it was images of a naked woman pursued in a laboratory set by a monster. During the opening of the movie on drive-in, irate customers complained that they did not see the movie they paid to watch. The owners of the theater called Corman and said that his clients felt cheated. So Corman had to make copies of the images, and send the positive film to the owners of the theaters to join the film. Since the footage was never part of the film's negative, it has not appeared in any video, DVD or television broadcast. Has anyone ever seen this video? Anyone who has seen this movie on a drive-in in the summer of 1981, remember this?
