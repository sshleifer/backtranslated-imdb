This movie launched my theory about book-based films: instead of following the clich√© "You've read the book, now you see the movie", if you're looking for a good book to read, try one of the ones you liked. based, because it will be 10 times better. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in its initial release at the National Theater in downtown Eugene and I liked it so much that I stayed to see it again. It's a perfect fusion of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors, Jon Voight, with what became my favorite book, "The Water Is Wide" by Pat Conroy. <br /> <br /> I can not think of anything better. Film about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life. Two small warnings: <br /> <br /> (1) The video suffers severely from pan-and-scan and deserves a mailbox version. (2) The title must be restored to the name of the book, a reference to one of the most moving enigmatic songs ever written.
