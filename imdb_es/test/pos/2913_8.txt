... as valuable as the tomb of King Tut! (Okay, maybe it's not so valuable, but it's worth hunting if you can). I've noticed that nobody has commented on this film for some years and I hope that a new publication will generate new comments. This is a film that I remembered only fragments of childhood, and that I only saw recently when I got tired of waiting for Fox to honor his own past, and looked for the Korean DVD (in English, but with unavoidable subtitles in Korean). I will not go through another long description of the plot, suffice it to say that seeing it for the first time in its proper widescreen format left me speechless at the sights and scope of the film. The matte paintings still stand, and the palace sets are really impressive. But it is the details on a smaller scale that give this film its depth and richness, offering insight into the lifestyles of the poor of Egypt and its elite. The bazaars, huts, docks, embalming houses and taverns are as fascinating as Pharaoh's throne room. While errors abound on a large scale (especially the dynastic succession), the details are investigated more meticulously than the vast majority of Hollywood films. Visually, it is not without flaws: the interiors are often too bright and are very colorful to blend perfectly with the exteriors. However, this is a film that should be recognized for being as bold in small as in big. Tedious? In parts, absolutely. Overrated? Subacted? Yes, both, although 'underestimated' could be a more adequate description. Too long? Absolutely not. I wished that they had spent more time with Sinuhe's experiences in the House of Death, and among the Hittites, and less with their "romance" with Nefer, however. Historically inaccurate? Yes, that too, but so was Shakespeare. Nobody punishes him for that. I appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next player, but ultimately, we must remember that the cinema is theater, not a history lesson.
