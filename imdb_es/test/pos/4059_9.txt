Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, what a team. While Rene Russo, William Shanter and that guy from the Everyday video are next to the trip. This is a fun and great movie. Not only that, it's a good movie for friends. <br /> <br /> Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) directs this hell of a movie. From start to finish, it was a masterpiece. There's no slapstick humor here. But the good laughs of yesteryear. Laughing at all the other police movies (to name a few lethal weapons, Beverly Hills police, fifteen minutes, etc.). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie, watch this one. You'll love it. It has a wonderful cast and crew. So, leave your a ** to see "COPS" and see "Showtime" for a police movie. And remember, they'll be lengthening their neighbor in um ... um ... oh! On Friday nights at 8:00 (man, everyone says I'm a bad writer).
