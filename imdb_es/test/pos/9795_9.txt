"Radio Flyer" is one of my most beloved American movies. <br /> <br /> The excellent work of two children, Joe Mazzello and Elija Wood, (despite the terrible performance of T.Hanks at the beginning and at the end ...) with the wonderful script of DMEvans and the powerful and emotional direction of R.Donner more Absolutely Incredibly Peerless Music Score by H.Zimmer allowed the "Radio Flyer" to win one of the first places in the classification of my family's films. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that such a good movie has been belittled by some movie critics. <br /> <br /> I just can not help but wait to see it on DVD.
