Surprised to know that the director (Sebastián Gutiérrez) was a young Venezuelan (28) and was bored with so many predictable films, he was delighted with the script that showed so many little stories and clues spread here and there. Directed with black humor and taste, I loved the tension between the Boggart Rickman and the very natural but beautiful Thompson. Each member of the gang deserves attention, Gil Bellows in all its glory. Gugino is remarkable.
