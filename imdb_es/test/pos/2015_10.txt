This is the second movie from 1985, the other was 'The Wedding Singer'. While the "Wedding Singer" represented the pop side of the 80s, "Rock Star" has to do with metal. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band to some famous rock band of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day. <br /> <br /> The story does not become so dramatic and only scratches the surface of a rock star's life. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it's full of Rock'n Roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are brilliantly directed! All the feeling of the concert is very well captured, since they used real audiences (not cgi here). <br /> <br /> Great direction and a brilliant performance by Marky Mark, who acts like a true metal friend! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' has to do with fun and if you have something to do with the old metal scene, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
