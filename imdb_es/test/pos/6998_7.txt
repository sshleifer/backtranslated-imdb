This movie has a bad start. An incredibly cheesy monologue is immediately followed by a collision of a truly amazing and brilliantly made spacecraft. Then things go downhill again, when you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost everyone fits very well in the role of the fodder monster. Hell, half of them do not even speak English, which prevents the public from knowing the characters. You feel like you're watching "Deep Blue Sea" meets "Silence of the Lambs" minus the good bits. And unfortunately, all this tries to be difficult "Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter" during the daylight scenes. Vin Diesel is a great actor, but it's not Anthony Hopkins and, frankly, it bothers him like the hyper-genius intelligent psychopath. There is at least one very good scene that involves an unexpected survivor, but other than that, he could have eliminated the first thirty minutes or so ... <br /> <br /> But then things change. I can not pinpoint exactly the moment, but soon the movie will get much better. It also feels less choppy: the scenes really start to be followed with a coherent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a spectacle thief. When the first monsters appear, the movie is quite nice. By the time the night falls, it's great. Exciting, horrifying and exciting. And even the character development of most of the main characters is well done. If you can sit through the poor bits at the beginning, you will have GREAT entertainment. <br /> <br /> In addition, the images are very attractive, and I admit it sincerely: I love the color and tone of this film. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (could have been 9/10, if only it was ...)
