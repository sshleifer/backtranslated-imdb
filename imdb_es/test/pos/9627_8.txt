This is truly a classic of kung fu. This movie seems to have influenced martial arts films for decades. The background music of the Spanish guitar, the schools that compete with each other, the incredibly high jumps on the edges of the roofs, the capture of spears thrown, the deception in the tournaments, the secret training for an exotic karate technique, themes of patience and perseverance, and many more were copied by many later. Movies like "The Karate Kid" (1984), "Hero" (2002), "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) and "Kung Fu Hustle" (2004). <br /> <br /> I feel lucky to have seen this movie for the first time in 1972, shortly after its release, just before the kung fu movies became mainstream and before Bruce Lee became in a family name. I saw him with two friends of mine at a theater in downtown San Diego frequented by sailors, and although the scenes of the bright red hands and the eyeballs laughed, clearly the audience was entering, as was our small group. It was a very memorable movie for me. Decades later, he could still remember several specific scenes, even after he forgot the title of the film. This movie is very special to me now because one of those two friends with whom I saw it for the first time (the navigator Kenneth Lee Hines of Kitty Hawk) has passed away, so this film serves as a memory of that day together before let's take judo and karate lessons in the following years. <br /> <br /> Regarding the kung fu movies, I would rate this movie as 10/10. But since I have to take into account the larger film audience, I will qualify it more objectively as 8/10, due to obvious technical flaws. I only recommend that neophyte viewers consider these technical flaws as proof of their vintage nature and authenticity, and then continue cheerfully enjoying their chaos loaded with testosterone.
