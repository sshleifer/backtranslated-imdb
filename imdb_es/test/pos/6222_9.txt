A wonderful movie in the best Scandinavian tradition of magic drifting, with a very foresightful analysis of a large part of the big problems that we are beginning to face. <br /> <br /> It should be a mandatory viewing for all politicians. <br /> <Br /> Choose between privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change, quality of life. <br /> <br /> Reminiscent of Walden by Thoreaus, but with a modern touch and considerable humor. <br /> <br /> I am not Finnish, although I have traveled there and I have good Finnish friends, but I found it totally accessible and also culturally informative.
