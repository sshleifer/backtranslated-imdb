(Warning: spoilers! - although it is difficult to spoil this movie by telling details of the story). <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for everyone. He is very old and is, er, clumsy. What makes it great for me is the soundtrack, not the original but the updated soundtrack. Better yet, the orchestral version that Prokofiev created (my favorite performance is by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony). <br /> <br /> The movie is really funny in some places. It is reminiscent of the old "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent. Some of the actors are also quite magnificent. (The actor who played Nevsky could have been a superstar today - the same goes for the warrior girl, Vasilisa, definitely a rocking chair). <br /> <br /> This may be the best collection in the world, on film, of Russian Russian phrases. (There are a lot of them: they constitute most of the spoken lines). <br /> <br /> Battle scenes seem much more realistic than most high-budget Hollywood flicks. These guys are as clumsy with their fight as real peasants would be. The guns seem unpleasant, so the actors probably tried to avoid actually hurting each other. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays the German "big marshall" is trying to "really" scare the beginning of the movie, but it seems he really was a kitten. After being captured, it looks * so * pathetic. (Speak volumes about the intended audience, da?) <br /> <br /> A really funny touch is that the German army brings an * organ * with him, played by a character in a black robe. Watch the Russians take down this guy * while * he is playing. <br /> <br /> After the battle ends and almost all Germans are dead, the best part of the film (and music), the song sung to the dead soldiers who have died defending the homeland. This part is so sad that it is almost a declaration against the war. <br /> <br /> Ten times more men than ladies have rated this movie. Why? <br /> <br /> Warning: Joseph Stalin liked this movie. Ironic: killed more Russians than anyone. "Those who come to Russia carrying a sword will die by the sword."
