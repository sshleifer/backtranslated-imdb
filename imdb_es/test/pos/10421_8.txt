I agree with Aussie's comments for the most part. However, it seems that there is a fairly decent plot, although not original. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a rural property that aims to open a mountain lodge. He is reunited with Chip (Bobby Johnston) whom he had met when he was growing there. The plot is complicated when James (Paul Logan) arrives with his new stripper friend, Shene (Devinn Lane) because Christina had been James' stripper friend in the past years, and the implication is that James had done something wrong. To add interest to the film Sophia Linn (Monique Parent), a romance novelist appears as a guest at the hostel, as do Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), a couple of city lawyers. James mistreats the local inspector of construction codes of Christina's business as one of his dirty tricks to silence her. So, the question is: "How far will James go to sabotage the lodge and be successful?" <br /> <br /> Look out for Devinn Lane here and in "Beauty Betrayed." She seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the "R" world. Another notable is Samantha McConnell, who plays the role of "Bait", clearly the most scandalous character name in the movies!
