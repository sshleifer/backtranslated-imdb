I got Monster Man in a box of three movies where I mainly wanted the other two, but I still had a great time. It combines horror and comedy with a reasonable effect, aided considerably by the decent performances of Eric Jungman as a geek leader, Justin Urich as his friend and Aimee Brooks as the love interest. The film is quite predictable and draws ideas from a lot of other movies, but it's still fun at all times, with some gruesome gore thrown in. Surely it is not up to the classic bloody comedies, but this still works well. Director Michael Davis even manages one or two spooky scenes, like in the bathroom or at the bar. The movie can be seen all over the world if you graph it and write it in disarray, and for me it just got a bit lost towards the end when the title Monster Man starts to look like a member of Slipknot and the movie tries Go more to the horror style, but it is not. t crooked or convincing enough. The final moments are also a bit weak. Still, despite the lack of much suspense and nonsense in general, this is a good example of unpretentious comedy, often capricious and sprinkled that should be for the fans of it.
