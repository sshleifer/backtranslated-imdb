This was in a strange movie. I liked the adventure although it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER FORWARD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he is a fugitive in the race. Later they blew up his house and finally he commits suicide. It seems that they should have made a movie for a more mature or more family-friendly audience. <br /> <br /> This was in a strange movie.
