I saw the 2-hour version of Choker Bali. I can not say it's long. The film has a certain natural rhythm and does not seem to be delayed at any time. The suit and the set remember what we would see in the old movies. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai has done a good acting job. In fact, it is a mature role with enough room to act within the story. The script also supports the story very well. Aishwarys acts as the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage. The film is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict he faces with the trampled condition of widows in those times. <br /> <br /> Your best friend in this movie, played by Raima Sen, has also been fine. -manejado. Her innocence and admiration for Aishwarya's ability to speak English and act in an educated manner has been done very well. These are, in fact, some of the prevailing mentalities of those times. We can see how far we have come from a time like this! <br /> <br /> The film talks about the liberation of women as a subtle line of history. The development of the story seemed very similar to Ghare Bahire, also written by Tagore. In the action of the struggle for independence is part of the action of the struggle for independence and contrasts the struggle for Indian independence against the silent struggle for women's rights. <br /> <br /> A well-made movie that is worth seeing. Performance of Aishwarya: par excellence. Rituparna has handled the story with great care. Another classic by Rabindranath Tagore.
