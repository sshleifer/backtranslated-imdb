I have seen 'NSNA' right after watching all of Roger Moore's films and I must say it felt really good to see Connery again. At all times it shows that it is the only Bond. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is not really a masterpiece, but it's really worth seeing. The jokes are much better here, the effects are fun and interesting, Connery is Connery and Brandauer is really a good villain. But von Sydow is only wasted and the score is usually not good and there are some scenes that seem quite unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 7/10 \ 2.5 / 4 \ 3+ (1+ - 6-)
