A surprising and reflective observation about modern life for young people in Japan, Like Grains of Sand delves into topics such as rape, homosexuality and pubescent anguish in a subtle and meaningful way. It gives an idea of ​​the youth culture that struggles to define itself outside the limits of the generation of its parents, with its strict conformity and facade. Typical of Japanese cinema, often what is not said is more important than what it is, so, for those who are not versed in Japanese cinema and culture, be careful. It may seem boring and minimalist (almost like every movie that comes out of the Mangas Japan bar) if you do not know what to look for. I saw it for the first time when I was 15 years old and it was what originally sparked my interest in Japan, its culture and its language. Considering that I am now 22 years old and I am learning Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years, it goes without saying that it is a powerful film. Enjoy!
