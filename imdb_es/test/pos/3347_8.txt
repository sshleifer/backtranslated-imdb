I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California, in October of 1976. As we were driving through the tourist streets of the city, we saw a movie tent that announced "ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX". So even before reviewing the Disneyland version of Lewis Carroll's classic half a mile away, our curiosity won and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember that even before the movie started, I was surprised at how much I was surprised to see this type of film in the ultra conservative Orange County. <br /> <br /> Thirty-two years later, I met ALICE IN MARAVILLAS in a local video. to stock. I wondered if it would be the same movie until I looked at the back of my jacket and saw a picture of the lovely Kristine DeBell in the title role and decided to rekindle some memories. Subversive Video, for your credit, has released two versions, X and XXX in the same package. As a result, the version my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X despite the original XXX publicity there. Seeing it a second time, I realize what brought Bud Townsend, a charming and charming actor, to the screen. As an example of the scope of this man behind the camera, in his days of salads he directed two episodes of DEATH VALLEY DAYS on television. <br /> <br /> Miss DeBell, who appeared on the cover of Playboy in April 1976, is ideal as Alice. She brings a new American innocence to the role of librarian in her first twenty years yearning for a better life. When her boyfriend is rejected for taking her relationship to the next level, Alice reaches her inflection point. This is a "musical comedy", however, the melodies are quite catchy, with appropriate strings and metals to compensate for the generally suggestive lyrics. Miss DeBell has a nice singing voice when she says she wants to be free. That's when the magic begins. The pace of this film is surprisingly fluid, given that Wonderland's genre and supporting cast are there to allow Alice to become a woman. A special mention is for the television veteran Larry Gelman as the White Rabbit, who seems to be the only character who is not obsessed with sex, since he is always late for an appointment or something. <br /> <br /> Special features include comments from prominent feminist advocate Lena Ramone that explains how watching this movie while attending college influenced her by choosing a career as an adult film actress after graduation. <br /> <br /> What makes ALICE IN WONDERLAND such a lovely walk is its garden as a setting. Shot partly in the exuberant and natural splendor of Vancouver's Stanley Park B.C., the film hides its pornographic roots. You do not leave feeling that you've seen a film of sordid skin. At this time, I have not seen the triple version XXX. The sequence of additional sex added later, in all probability, would interrupt the general flow and eliminate the light, the windy atmosphere that was evident in everything. <br /> <br /> Naturally, the Lewis Carroll version is the best way to snuggle and explore. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. However, for a time capsule that represents the adult film archives of the 1970s, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is worth following that white rabbit for a front row ride full of cheerful fuss.
