I, for one, loved this movie. <br /> <br /> It is not a "typical Asian horror" where you would see a ghastly ghost (usually a woman) who scares people. You barely see ghosts for most of the movie, but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and the characters is great. This is not the movie for you if you like gore (for example, Saw, Hostel) or "frightful surprises" where you get things (Hollywood horror, slasher movies), but this movie has a "spooky" factor underlying everything The whole movie that I loved. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to the horror between the ridiculous remakes and the non-original garbage launched by Hollywood in today's society. <br /> <br /> Please, do not let the documentary filming style discourage you (why should I do it?) ?!). It's far superior to the Blair Witch Project because, on the one hand, the performance at Noroi is brilliant and it really makes you feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to see. <br /> <br /> Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen in my life. Only a few movies have reached my Top 5 horror; and this movie has a solid # 1 spot on my list.
