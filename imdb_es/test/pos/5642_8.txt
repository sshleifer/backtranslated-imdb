The fires in the plain led by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a World War II film that ultimately does not show the allies fighting against the axis powers, but the Japanese fighting and fighting for their lives in Philippines The name of the main characters is Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier who leaves his regiment for being sick. All he has on him is a hand grenade, his weapon and some potatoes. So, he is trying to go to the hospital to get a doctor and a cure for his illness. But as the hospital refused and was destroyed, he began a long walk. Throughout the entire film, Tamura is still a bit cowardly, but very civilized, when the other soldiers are more like animals using their basic instincts to survive. Tamura is still human and would not degrade. A scene that has influenced me a lot to think positively and differently about this war movie is when Tamura enters a village in the Philippines, which is completely deserted. There, he fights with a dog and finds many corpses of Japanese soldiers piled up in front of a church. This makes Tamura think and even more scared of what is already. That shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine, but a servant of superior beings and humans, the most important thing. After he leaves the corpses, two Filipinos (a couple or a brother and sister: a very close relationship) return to the village to retrieve their stash of salt. The main character of the film wants to be friendly at first, although he walked towards them with his gun, but he shoots the woman when she starts screaming. His brother / boyfriend / husband then flees scared and after a moment, Tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing Filipino. He does not hit him. After Tamura picks up the bag of salt, something very precious, he drops his gun in a river. This gesture is very important to understand the profile of Tamura and the war of Kon Ichikawa / Shohei Ooka. Comparing this movie with other films of the Second World War, it is not typical. Of course, all films have suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. It expresses everything that is human: it is manipulating, it is weak, it is afraid, it has hope. This is typical of Japanese films of World War II and Japanese society. Since World War II is not a subject discussed in Japanese society, it is likely that the Japanese put the Japanese in World War II as the victim. This victimization is also very visual in this movie. One of the examples is Tamura, another the stacked bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is when the Japanese soldiers try to cross a street and the Americans are already waiting for them and firing at everyone. the Japanese soldiers who have worse equipment and feed themselves worse and do not have health equipment or anything similar. In my personal conclusion, I must say that it is worth watching this movie to finally see a movie from the other side of the usual. Nor does it have a nationalist propaganda that could easily have been incorporated. Once you have seen the film completely, you will be able to see the horrors of World War II in its entirety.
