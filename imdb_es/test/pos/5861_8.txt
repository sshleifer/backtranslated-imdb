"Murder by Numbers," starring Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt, are two rebellious high school students who are content with the perfect murder for overcoming their shattered self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays the heroic thorn in the way of his plans as Det. Cassie Mayweather This is not even close to the traditional mystery of the murders with the fingers, since the film reveals to us the assassins (Gosling and Pitt). What the film does, however, is concentrate on the purposes of their murders and if they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder. <br /> <br /> The title itself has been rightfully chosen for several reasons, mainly because the "Numbers" in the title are the most vocal. The angle that focuses on the reasons behind the heinous murders, although it will pursue it with its chilling dialogue (especially of the insensitive guys), is not up to exploring the origins of what led them to their frenzy of murders. The characters are fascinating: you have the handsome rich Richard (Ryan Gosling) and the smart but socially awkward Justin (Michael Pitt). At school, they pretend to despise each other and even share a taste for the name of classmate Lisa (Agnes Bruckner), but outside the school they are allies and collaborate on a ritual in which murder is an escape to release the mind. <br /> <br /> Of course, the story that involves children seems exciting, but it is in a more mundane background involving Det. Mayweather (Bullock), who assumes his murders, was due to discrimination (hence the arrogant aspect of Gosling) and its unexplained characteristics, but he manages to do well. At first, the audience may disregard Cassie's character due to the fact that she is very stubborn and not very understanding. She shows dominance and control over her junior partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Even when he tries to reason with her, he knows it's a battle he probably will not win. <br /> <br /> The reason behind her tyrannical behavior dates back to when Cassie was the sad victim of a crime that has left a permanent mental scar on her. This parallel story does not have much room in this film in part because it offers nothing fascinating with the main plot (the wave of child murders). It also offers some development to Bullock's character in the film, but it's only half-baked and not very satisfying. I would have liked the diabolic students to have a parallel story. The resources were right in front of them for the perfect film for the crime, the creative schemes for children to manipulate the police with their false evidence and lies just to get out of a possible life in prison. <br /> <br /> Despite the unbalanced subplots and the useless ending of "real murderer", "Assassination by numbers" has a great performance of a great cast. Sandra Bullock was convincing as the tough and ruthless police trying to change her inner pain in a more positive light. Ben Chaplin shows his strength as the young detective who tries to understand his partner and is able to defend himself against his occasional tyrants. But the thieves on the scene are the diabolical duo of Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling, since they keep you glued to your seat waiting for what they're going to do next. The chemistry of children is reminiscent of Matt Damon-Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley."
