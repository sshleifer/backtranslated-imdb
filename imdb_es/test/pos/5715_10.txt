This one-man show can be the most fantastic show I've ever seen. To call this simply an act of standing is to do a great injustice, there is a definite reason why this was a Broadway show. John Leguizamo is a master at making people from every culture feel at home by listening to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general. I would recommend this program to anyone, as long as they can handle the language.
