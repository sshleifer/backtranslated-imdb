The title of the Chinese movie "In the Mood for Love" is "fa yeung nien wah". It can be interpreted as "those years of blossoming (which were once)." <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a well composed piece. A complex love story told in simple visual approach. Writer and director Wong Kar-Wai has choreographed a dance of hearts: it's her, it's him, it's love. I can hear the Galasso theme: dum dum dum, dum dum dum dum and the strings, almost like heartbeats. A piece with prelude, verses and epilogue. <br /> <br /> The director optimized the use of music (the score by Michael Galasso, the singing of Nat King Cole in Spanish and the Chinese songs / melodies). The rhythm and the lyrics take viewers to what he and he are feeling / thinking instead of verbal dialogues. I can hear Nat King Cole giving us the clues: "That, green eyes" (that thing, shooting, green eyes) he plays when the two meet, and "Maybe, maybe, maybe" (maybe?) When he's undecided. <br /> <br /> The nostalgia extends throughout the film. Abundant design details: bags and ties; Japanese novelty of rice cookery; the glasses, plates and plates of green glass with striated pattern (I remember that dad treasured them at home); mahjong session; kitchen area; bedroom furniture; The thermos for the noodles to take that she balances when she walks. Maggie Cheung, slim and well-formed, looks exquisite in the patterns and fashionable colors of traditional Chinese clothing for women: "cheung sam". Each change of her dress denotes another day, again in history. Wong Kar-Wai is witty in that way. <br /> <br /> The scenes can be from the same place, but it is of a different mood, advancing to the next stanza. Go up and down the stairs to the won-ton noodle stand. Standing next to the wall around the corner of the apartments while it rains. Along the corridor, back and forth, to his writing corner. <br /> <br /> Trivia: So she helps him write his martial arts novel. Maggie could help since she has been in kung fu movies / martial arts. "Eastern Three Heroes" 1992 is a fun action movie with Maggie Cheung (Thief Catcher Chat), Michelle Yeoh and Anita Mui as three superheroes fighting against evils. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate the performance of Tony Leung, do not do it. Miss "Chungking Express" 1994 (in the second segment: romance with a difference) and "Happy Together" 1997 (an intense and emotionally colorful painting of friendships, faith and destiny), both written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai. <br /> <br /> Being able to understand the Cantonese and Shanghainese dialects, and when visiting the official site, I realized that the epilogue was not completely translated. Here I am sharing my version of the legends in Chinese: <br /> <br /> It was a kind of unbearable encounter. From the beginning she kept her head down. Giving you the opportunity to approach. He did not have the courage to be closer. She turned around, walked away. <br /> <br /> That time and place had passed. Everything that belonged, no longer exists. _______ <br /> <br /> Those missing years, apparently separated by a glass that accumulates dust, can see, but can not understand. <br /> <br /> All the time he has longed for all that has happened, if he can break through. That glass collected in dust, He will return to the times that had disappeared. ________ <br /> <br /> "In the Mood for Love" by Wong Kar-Wai reminds us of the simple poetry and wisdom of Rumi, the Sufi philosopher: the "inner and outer", the "spirit and body" of the lifetime. , Love and life. <br /> <br /> [Forward.
