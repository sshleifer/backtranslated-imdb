Seeing "Cold Mountain" gave me the impression that its director, Anthony Minghella, was deliberately trying to outdo himself and his own film "that he was trying to win was the practically impeccable" The English Patient "of 1996. Comparing the two films, the The premise is quite similar, we have a passionate love story between two people in a turbulent time of war and end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background as they try to rediscover each other's arms. the character of Nicole Kidman is not married, Jude Law is a deserter and the conflict is the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "Cold Mountain" is, in terms of history, more diluted, soft than saying " The English patient "and is more at the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of external turbulence that causes a problem. It is a shorter film, which is an advantage for For people with less patience. However, it is not as spectacular or original or really fascinating as "The English Patient". My * only * big complaint about "Cold Mountain" is, surprisingly, the love story between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Surprisingly, his love was the least interesting in the image. They do not have a real relationship; We do not feel any real passion coming from them and the passion we do see is more physical than emotional. I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscar winner Renee Zellwegger and also the trips of Jude Law across the country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers. If Minghella had strengthened the importance of the love story, then I would have had a better image. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is entertaining even if the love story is not interesting. The sequences of the Civil War are absolutely great; They are of the modern tradition that they show the war as horrible and dehumanizing. The recreation of the Petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives were detonated underground and then followed by a hand-to-hand battle, is terrifying. Minghella is not afraid to show blood and blood in an artistic and sensible way, and is not afraid to show victims of innocence and life in these scenes. There are times when women and men are killed, often by crossfire. And there is more than that. Only the sound design of the film generates tension. There is a scene in which Inman and another defector make a meal by cutting off the head of a dead cow. We do not see the cut, but the sound effects of the blade cutting through the bone are disgusting. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must congratulate the cast for the performances. Jude Law was excellent in the film and deserved the Academy Award nomination he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman also deserved it, even though her character was a bit superficial. Renee Zellwegger had the biggest personality and the atmosphere of screen theft. And then there are the small parts that also work to complete this stylistic world by recreating a horrible time in the United States past. <br /> <br /> Perhaps "Cold Mountain" would have been better as a war image, but it certainly would have been spectacular as "The English Patient" if his love story had been ignited and he had become more passionate about screenwriters and director Anthony Minghella. As it is, it is a very nice image, I was not bored and I recommend it. I'm just saying that his love story, although it is a central point of the plot, is a bit softer than it should be and all the things around it was what really worked.
