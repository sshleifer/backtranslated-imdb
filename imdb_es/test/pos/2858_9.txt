I'm not sure why I chose a loan from my mother for "Nurse Betty". I think just because I had heard a bit of this movie. But I'm glad I did it. "Nurse Betty" is an original and intelligent film that has humor and a darker side. <br /> <br /> This was one of Renee's first big ones before getting to the race in Hollywood. I can see why, she is an incredible actress. The scene in which he finally realizes what had happened and is on the set of his favorite soap opera, you can see the pain, the confusion, the fear and the shame on his face. Just to let you get into the movie, she plays Betty. A timid and insecure woman who defends her abusive husband, is a waitress and is in love with soap operas, especially one in which such a nice doctor, Dr. Dave Revell. When she accidentally sees her husband's murder accidentally in a separate room, the murders she notes are two clients she just had, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. Then, he simply loses his head and leaves the city after talking to the police and tells him that he needs to find his ex-fianc√©e, Dr. Dave Revell. So, she travels across the country to California to find Dr. Revell, and she wants a job as a nurse to work with Dave, she has seen the program many times, somehow, it's amazing to be a nurse when she saves the brother of a woman. Even though everyone tells him he is delirious, he only looks at them as if they were crazy. When she meets the actor who plays Dave Revell, George (her real name) believes that she is just a crazy fan trying to appear on the show. She just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and she belong together. <br /> <br /> Renee was great, she was so credible about losing her mind in the movie. She has come a long way and yet, whether you want to admit it or not, she is adorable and a great actress. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays one of the killers, Charlie, who is the father of both. . He is so enchanted and in love with Betty and while chasing her across the country, he almost feels in love with Betty to the point that he almost falls in love with her. He and his son Wesley must find Betty when they discover that she was there at the scene of the murder and could reveal their identities. When Charlie sees Betty and finally catches her, at first he has scars, but he calms down and they know they have a real connection. It was a beautifully performed scene, my opinion is that Morgan had a stronger performance. It is simply great. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly decent performance by Chris Rock, the son, Wesley. He is so "good", he just finished the job hastily and take over the business. I loved his comic performance at the end, where he and the gang that he holds hostage at gunpoint are only watching the telenovela together. Classic. "Nurse Betty" is a great movie that I would recommend to laugh and, ultimately, a good and honest little movie that I think anyone could enjoy. <br /> <br /> 9/10
