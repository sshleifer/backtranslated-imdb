The Italian concept of "sprezzatura" was the grace and indifference in social manners that led to success in love, as described in the sixteenth-century manual "The Courtier." It is worth watching the movie "Hitch" to see the personification of the concept "sprezzzatura" in the dynamics of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Smith plays the character of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant. To those who lack luck and confidence. The best scenes are when Hitch trains the terribly shy and cranky Albert in his quest to win the heart of a New York socialite and in Hitch's attraction to Sara and a surprise to her when he visits Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith has the support of the good work of Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this movie is driven by the charm and attractive personality of Smith. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Smith rises above the average comic script to make "Hitch" an eminently visible and entertaining movie. I do not think there is another actor working today who is able to offer the charisma and perfect timing with the comic moments like Will Smith in this film. And his secret is in the "sprezzatura"!
