Normally I give horror movies around 6/10, but this one caught my attention. House of Wax was by far the best horror movie I've seen ... Even better than Amityville Horror. <br /> <br /> Paris Hilton was pretty good at this and I must say she has a good future ahead of her. His death scene was probably the most brilliant. I'll just say how she dies ... <br /> <br /> She has a giant stick right between her eyes and her close-ups and everything. Gory, huh? Brian Van Holt was very good as the two assassins, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had long hair). He usually plays a bad cop or soldier, but he did it very well. <br /> <br /> Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also performed very well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick focused on the first half of the movie, then Eliza stole it by enduring a lot of pain in the second half, like cutting off the finger, ripping off his lips after they hit and getting a direct hit. in the face by Bo. <br /> <br /> In general, I give this movie an 8/10. Fans of horror movies MUST see this.
