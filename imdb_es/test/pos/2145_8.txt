Seriously, I do not know why this movie had such a hostile reception when it premiered for the first time. Of course, it is too long and somewhat gratuitous in its representations of sexuality and violence, but so are many well-considered films. Seriously, I do not think people who hated "Heaven's Gate" really understood it. "Heaven's Gate" in its uncut form, like "The Deer Hunter" shows the big differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living with comfort and privileges (like " Americans settled "" In Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue.) Living a hard life is painful, but it can also be invigorating compared to the boring life that Averil leads in the epilogue, and, like Michael Cimino, he made great efforts to The image was historically accurate, it is fascinating as a document of (and perhaps an indictment) of American life in Old West Wyoming Dialogue is often genuinely intelligent and emotional, combined with good music and cinematography, the film works like a truly poetic work of art, of course, "Heaven's Gate", with its refusal to sponsor the viewer, is not for everyone, however, every year, Hollywood produces so much Commercial control, which is much easier to dismiss as a mindless eye candy (even when an example of this becomes a box-office success) that "Gate" and Cimino really deserve more respect. All people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make a decision. <br /> <br />
