I think the reason why this film did not get the recognition it deserves is due to the many misconceptions of Darwin, pro and con. I would say that the real man is represented here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the film is nothing more than a snapshot of man, the storytelling technique extended his life beyond the years mentioned in the film. This is a profound film, a reflection on modern life and our way of thinking, and it can provoke a study of the man whose thoughts (and others who used it) have certainly affected our lives. There are some movies that the historical context is so good that it is the main job of the actors staying out of the way. The story took the day and the actors did their job. Good job for them, I tell them.
