You must have lived in Japan for a while to enjoy the beauty of this movie! I lived in Okinawa for more than 2 years, and in the north of Honshu for 4. Believe it or not, what you see paints a very good and accurate image of contrasting the mentalities of the east and the west, both from the sporting point of view as of personal relationships. A fun, funny and moving movie that deserves something better than what Americans see can judge. 8+ out of 10!
