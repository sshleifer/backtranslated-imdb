This movie worked for me because I see this movie as the exact opposite of "Gone with the Wind". Owners of estates instead of owners of plantations. Scarlett struggles and cheats for what she wants; Ada becomes depressed and turns inside herself until Ruby (Renee Zellweger) appears to save the day. Something like that, in a round of road. The deserters instead of the officers trying to return to their families, the lists go on and on. Even the love story was the opposite. If this is what the producer and the writers tried to convey, he succeeded with me. <br /> <br /> There are only two things that I did not like about the movie, the rest I thought was well done and I liked it enough to recommend it to my friends. First, I could not see the attraction between Inman, (Jude Law), and Ada, (Nicole Kidman,) as strong enough for Inman to defect to get back with her. Inman said he had only written a few times where Ada wrote him almost constantly. Second, something or someone who died or died in almost every scene was little. I must say I was full of action for that, but after the second scene I knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. I like that the next scene surprises me, I do not know what will happen before it happens. <br /> <br /> I thought that the whole performance was very well done, with Zellweger the best. She deserved the credit she got for it. I thought she played the role of the girl from the hills very well. She must have done her homework on the part. Zellweger even said in the film that she was smarter than people thought she was. I think that was true. Law did well with his part with everything that had to happen to return to Kidman. It must have been a much stronger love to go through all that than I thought. Now he showed a lot of emotion on his face during his tests. Kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact that I chose his performance after the other two. Except that when I was depressed I did not show much emotion, I do not know if that was how the part was written or if that was how it was perceived. She still did a good job, I thought the other two were better. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene with Zellweger, Kidman and the rooster, although it was one of those scenes I mentioned earlier. I thought the 'Home Guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. Although we did not hear much about them, they were part of that time. I thought the landscape was beautiful. The film had everything necessary to be a good historical romance.
