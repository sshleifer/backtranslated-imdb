... the opportunity he gave me to look at Ireland's past was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the advantage of seeing this with my mother who came from Cork, and when looking, we talked and I learned a lot from her about how things were back then. <br /> <br /> Things like Deasy and Co. was a Cork soft drink company; how the rain could really destroy a crop; how farmers used to have to pick up the crop; how in the dance halls women and men really had to stand along the opposite walls before the men moved forward and asked the woman to dance; on the bellows that kept the fire burning; how the priests really called the list of donors of the church and their donations and a little about the coin at that time (that my dad helped by showing me a case that shows the pennies, shillings and crowns that were used at that time ( they were legal tender England too)). <br /> <br /> I did not pay too much attention to how good the film was, but I was very grateful to have the opportunity to remember a period of time that for some is Irish. History, but for others, including some of our parents and grandparents, it's just their childhood.
