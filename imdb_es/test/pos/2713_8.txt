The melodies are the best aspect of this television movie that has higher than average production values, but a very superficial and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of "Have Only Just Begun" and Karen's marriage problems admirably (the "Superstar" set was a nice touch), but notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of the guitar solos Tony Peluso, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen personality, but does not include the daring and daring aspects of the Carpenter's true personality. Anderson is in good shape as the creative and responsible Richard, and Fletcher leaves his mark as the lover but dominant Agnes. The most disturbing moment of the original transmission is the use of "Goodbye to Love" in the background of a commercial that shows a direct line of anorexia.
