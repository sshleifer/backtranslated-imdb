One of the most poetic narrative films ever made, WAGONMASTER is, however, a difficult movie to like immediately. I love this movie, but I recommend watching some of John Ford's other westerns before taking a look at it. The first time I saw him I was 18 years old and I had not seen too many other westerns, and I hated it. I thought it was incredibly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen. It took me several years to love this photo. First, I fell in love with westerns in general (traditions, characters, landscapes, ways of speaking, etc.) and that made me realize when I saw WAGONMASTER again, after all, a lot is happening. <br /> <br /> I was also simply a more experienced viewer at that time and had learned to appreciate visual narration and to listen to what each image was telling me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual film by one of the most visual directors who works near the peak of his career. <br /> <br /> The film is a celebration of a lifestyle, and its theme is more emotional and interior. than other Ford westerns. Actually, that is not as accurate as saying that, rather, it has much less external action than the other westerns. (The other westerns have external action and inner emotion). He places his Mormon pioneers very well in the context of nature. There are many pictures of animals and children, not for any narrative purpose, but to illustrate this idea. That's why the movie can be called a poem. It is not about the history of the surface (which barely exists) almost as much as of an emotional idea, and it makes this idea pass through composition, editing, sound and music. In fact, one could argue that this is a purer way of making films because the images directly express the emotional idea of ​​the film, rather than having to first serve a "story". <br /> <br /> Give this film a chance and allow it to exist on its own terms, not on the terms of other westerns or other movies.
