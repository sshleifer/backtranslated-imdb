Fires on The Plain (1959) **** <br /> <br /> You do not see movies like this anymore. 'Fires on the Plain' is an incredible representation of the lives of the soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows Tamura, a soldier with tuberculosis as he roams the Philippine landscape in the last year of the war. His commanding officer sends him to the hospital only to be refused treatment, so he is sent back. His CO tells him to return and if they reject him again, his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. He is denied again, but he finds a gang of squatters sitting outside the hospital. The next day they are attacked by US troops and Tamura flees, opting not to commit suicide, and from there he walks from one place to another trying to reach Palompon. He discovers that some men have been eating human flesh to survive, while others exchange as much tobacco as possible for what they can recover. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of a feeling of despair and tranquility. Desolation, with a touch of madness. Everybody we see is skin and bones, covered in dirt with ragged and tattered rags. Ichikawa uses his camera to capture some beautiful images of the destroyed landscape and the Japanese soldiers who walk it. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for doing many comedies and satires, and there are moments in Fires on the Plain that are very funny. Take, for example, a photo of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a puddle of water; a soldier walks but wonders aloud if this is how they will all finish, to which the man raises his head from the water and answers "what was that?" and then he drops his face even deeper into the puddle than before. Another hilarious sequence involves a man who finds a pair of boots along the way. He takes the boots, replacing them with the old ones. Another man passes by and sees that pair of boots and changes into his old boots. The scene continues until finally Tamura finds the place of exchange and examines the boots that remain without almost any sole. He looks at his and those on the ground, and deciding that both are trapped, he takes off his and goes barefoot. The movie is full of incredible scenes, one after the other. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and amazing images. There are many impressive images of men in empty and arid plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies in the broken earth. There is another incredible scene in which dozens of Japanese soldiers attempt to cross a road protected by the Yankees in the middle of the night, all crawling on their hands and knees while the camera watches from above. <br /> <br /> The film gets its name from the plumes of smoke that rise from the fires in the plains that are seen throughout the film. The soldiers represent a little more ordinary life; The lives of Japanese farmers in their homes burn corn husks. Their beacons of hope for normal life, however, are in hostile hands. <br /> <br /> The movie caused a stir in its day with its graphic content. Much emphasis is placed on the horror of war, not only with the enemy, but also within their ranks and yourself. Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plains is an incredibly authentic, poignant and, in a way, disturbing portrait of the horror suffered by the men who make up the lower ranks of the Imperial Army. Letters From Iwo Jima by Clint Eastwood, although it is a very good film, does not come close to understanding the horror of the war that is shown in Fires on the Plain. (No doubt, Eastwood was influenced by the movie, since he claims to be a classic Japanese movie buff). Many war movies show that war is hell through the eyes of the winners. In Fires on the Plain, we are shown that war is even more hellish when you are in the losing end <br /> <br /> 4/4
