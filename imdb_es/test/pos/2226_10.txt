I saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in Pablo CO. I had just left my biomedical engineering job in a hospital. I think the script is an exaggeration of the real kind of things that happen in hospitals. <br /> <br /> The idiots who attribute it to the production value do not understand the point and probably have never been hospitalized. And I never worked in a safe one. Billy Jack (the same time) was very badly produced, but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message. <br /> <br /> Since then, I've been looking for this movie, this is the first site. I have found where it is mentioned.
