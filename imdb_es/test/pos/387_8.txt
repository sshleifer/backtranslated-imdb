Although in the end some unrealistic things happen (ie, a policeman shooting a gun in a crowded carousel where you can kill any innocent), this was an intense and enjoyable thriller, one of the best films of Alfred Hitchcock . Robert Walker is excellent as the creepy, really convincing nutty and offers fascinating performance that is sometimes too creepy. His casting partner here, Farley Granger, is fine, but he is no match for Walker, neither in the acting nor in the characters they play. It's the typical Hitchcock movie with some strange camera angles, immoral themes, the innocent man gets into trouble, etc. Unlike many of his other films, I thought that this was a fast moving story with very few dots off. Being a former tennis player, I enjoyed his video of some excellent games on the net that showed some good rallies. The real-life daughter, Patricia, of Hitchcock, has an interesting and unique minor character role here. She not only got the job for her dad; She can act It is also noteworthy: the DVD has the British and American versions and there were some differences in the story. This is a classic movie that is still referenced in today's movies, including comedies such as "Throw Momma Off The Train".
