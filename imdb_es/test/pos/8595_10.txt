This movie is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is also the best seen film that uses a drama to tell the story, without going into speculation as with JFK, Nixon or Hoffa. It represents skillfully the claws that Belgium had in the Congo. It also easily facilitates the European and American forces that were behind the power inflicted by the Congo today. The film would surely specifically implicate the United States, with good reason, in the murder of Lumumba. This movie could never be made in the United States. The United States film rarely criticizes itself in acts of imperialism and murder. (Save Stone JFK) It also allows us to know the problems that arose with the internal conflict in the Congo, between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We can see how precarious countries sit in the establishment of new governments when their history is one of colonization and those who were the colonizers continue to pull the chains of power and force. The film is excellently shot with Eriq Ebouaney and an excellent Lumumba. The cast is great and they really appeal to the feeling of the weather in the Congo during that time. <br /> <br /> Again, this is a must-see for drama lovers with a correct historical record. See my notes about Quilombo.
