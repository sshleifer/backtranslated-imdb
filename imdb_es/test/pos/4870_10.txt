Okay, so, in any Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner cartoon, we know that WEC is going to install all kinds of traps for RR, but it is always mutilated in several ways. That certainly happens in "Beep, Beep." Foreseeable? I suppose it is, but when you think about it, these cartoons show how the more you try to hurt someone else, the more they hurt you; Something like Daffy Duck always tries to undermine the integrity of Bugs Bunny, but Bugs looks around. <br /> <br /> In general, this is another classic from the Termite Terrace crowd. Sometimes, I think that if we really wanted to alleviate the tensions of the Cold War, we could have let the Soviet Union see the cartoons of Looney Tunes; I'm sure they would have loved them. Another great one. <br /> <br /> PS: I learned about "Jeopardy!" that the second name of Wile E. Coyote is Ethelbert.
