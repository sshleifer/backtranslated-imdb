There was a time when not all animations were Disney or Pixar. It's so nice to see this wonderful movie again and, in fact, I got a good, reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as it is out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies. I received a very good copy of a company called Flashbacks and it's pretty good. In the old days I saw him in black and white on television and his magic to see it in color. Much better than some would have you believe. The songs are lovely and the color is great. Interestingly, the characters are very well developed, which is strange in animated films. I loved Hoppity and the villain Mr Beatle is a true cad. It is incredibly imaginative. The way inanimate objects, such as cotton rolls, old cans become part of the environment and have new functions, is excellent. The anthropomorphic use of insects is staggering considering the grumpy creatures that most people think are disgusting. Hopefully we can never step on an insect again! The enemy insects is man. Actually, of course, it's the insects that will survive. No matter how hard we try to get rid of the ants here in Australia, they keep coming back. The battle has been lost and we have to live with them. There are several scenes that stand out, such as when Hoppity and Mr Bumble are trapped in a shower, the great flood and the trip to the top of the building are wonderful. It is also quite anthropomorphic, but in a charming way. The human characters are very similar to Gulliver's and it is incredibly effective. The wedding scene looks beautiful. It is a crime that this film has not been considered a classic. The only jarring note for me are the occasions in the movie when the characters enter verse. Talking verse spoils the narrative and it was not necessary, the verse is horrible and it spoils another good wise writing. It's great and the kids will love it. It is a joy to watch. There is also a very intelligent ending.
