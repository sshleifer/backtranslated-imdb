This movie is very silly and very funny. You can never criticize for taking yourself seriously. If you have listened to your previous album or seen your HBO videos from the album, you can imagine the very good moment of this film that tells the fable of how the Tenacious D group was formed. <br /> <br /> Filled with cameos , not only gives a fictional account of Tenacious D, but it is also a summary of musical history. The humor reminds Something about Mary in that she often "goes to places you thought not," but lacks the scatological humor of South Park. This movie does not contain nudity, except for the moon.
