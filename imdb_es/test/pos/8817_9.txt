This blaxploitation classic about a kung fu mom traveling to Hong Kong to avenge the death of her brother offers everything she learned to expect from the genre. Playmate Jeannie Bell (with a giant afro) really kicks ass and usually loses her clothes very quickly. If you do not take it very seriously, the movie is very fun to watch. Stan Shaw offers solid performance, Jeannie Bell is a bit less convincing. Pam Grier is not. <br /> <br /> This is where Quentin Tarantino got his idea of ​​the light switch scene in "Jackie Brown" from. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Don Julian is a gem and is frequently used in rap songs.
