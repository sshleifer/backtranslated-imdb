Denis Leary can be fun and smart at times and always nice, but this takes the cake! This program showed the genius of Leary. <br /> <br /> The work takes place in New York. Leary plays Mike McNeil, a tough detective who is married, has an occasional drug problem and has a girlfriend. McNeil has a serious attitude. So much that it is dripping on it. The venue is full of fun, interesting and pleasant characters, in addition to McNeil. An excellent cast too. All episodes of this program are really fun and addictive. The liners of this show are everywhere. You will be in stitches after listening to them and you will still laugh at them a few minutes later and later. The cases dealt with by the precinct are something else for stripper nuns, a situation of hostages in the bathroom and more are above. This show was very good. They could have grown legs to last many more seasons. <br /> <br /> The last word: a great fantastic show. I miss this show very much. All episodes of this show are great. You even have belly laughs ... a lot. ABC made a big mistake in giving this ax. Too bad Leary did not revive the cable TV show. Still, I give this show one of my highest recommendations. Truly a unique show in its class.
