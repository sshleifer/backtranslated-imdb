I saw this movie with great expectations, but it disappointed me a little. Although I like this movie and the story captivated me, I did not find it exciting and I thought that the ending is not flat. <br /> <br /> The story consists of the friendship between a man who runs a photography shop and his best client. which is a traffic police. The location is a picturesque Korean town. <br /> <br /> This movie is somewhat realistic, since there is an element of tragedy and, nevertheless, it is not melodramatic. However, ultimately I was not touched by a film that described a man whom a woman loves so much, but who does not even give her the option to enter his life. In my opinion, he is a sweet and noble loser. <br /> <br /> Good points: excellent performance of the two main protagonists, a pleasant snapshot of village life <br /> <br /> Cons - Flat finish <br /> <br /> In general, OK, but I prefer the Before Sunrise and After Sunset movies (or it's Before Today and After Sunrise)
