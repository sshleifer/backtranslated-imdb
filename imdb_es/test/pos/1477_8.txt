From the beginning, you'll like the character of Sam Elliott (Falon): a reliable policeman who is especially loyal to his partner. But too loyal, and too vengeful to see his partner killed in an alley, because then he kills who he thought was the aggressor before giving him the opportunity to explain it to him. Falon is an alcoholic, and that tends to take him away from his self-control, although he manages to direct his attention to the search for who is really behind the death of his partner. He takes a newcomer as his new partner (who seems to be seen too often in the movies), but Esai Morales does well to accompany Sam Elliot, although the disconcerting pieces begin to fit in the place where Morales begins an authorized investigation into Falon; he mainly wants to find the answers since Fallon is not telling him the whole story, and he does not like what he finds. There is not a last minute that shows who the bad detectives are, which is fine; and they can not make Falon join them, which leads to a dramatic ending. Good acting in every way, with a touch of humor from Paul Sorvino, who is the captain of the detectives. It's a good movie that will make you want to see it several times; therefore, it qualifies as "must see" and is a good addition to a movie collection. (Filmed in San Francisco)
