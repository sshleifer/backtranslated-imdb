Okay, act, cut, direct there may not be the best of all, but the dance, the movements, the heat and the passion in this movie is definitely the best (well ... at least for me ^^) really It touched me, it inspired me to learn to dance. I even registered especially on this site to be able to vote and contribute my support for this film. For this movie, it literally gave me goose bumps when I saw it. I love. Jennifer Gray is so pretty! Patrick is very sexy in there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first thing I'll do tomorrow, on my way to college, will be to go through the video store and buy a copy of it, never see it again until it's old and wrinkly. I can not keep dancing with the movie. before what I need to learn all the dancing moves there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
