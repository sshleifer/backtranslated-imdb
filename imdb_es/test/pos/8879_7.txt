Now, Throw Momma from the Train was not a great comedy, but it's a lot of fun and it makes you laugh. The title may seem a bit strange, but the whole movie is not literally about that, although it is something so sinister. <br /> <br /> Danny De Vito basically wants to kill his dominant mother, and move quickly. A little, some random and fun events take place. The premise is quite funny, and the things that Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito got into were great. Some of the scenes seemed not to fit in my case, but this did not make it a bad movie. <br /> <br /> For what it is, a crazy comedy, it gets it right and should be seen once. Just to say that you saw it.
