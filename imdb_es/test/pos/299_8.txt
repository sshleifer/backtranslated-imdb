It's that movie that many people acclaim as a classic: Apocalypse Now, now cropped, remodeled, Redux, 22 years after its original release. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on Conrad's heart. Darkness, it is the main plot (if it has one) being Captain Willard's trip on a naval ship through the Vietnam conflict on his way to end a rebel colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he encounters, and he tells the story of the Colonel on the road. <br /> <br /> My initial feelings towards the film are that sometimes it is not particularly exciting, especially at the beginning. but at least he puts on a good dose of comedy, in the form of surf fan Col. Kilgore. However, as the film progresses, a great deal of tension accumulates with Willard's reading through various reports about Colonel Kurtz until the end is in sight, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film It reaches an incredible level and keeps it there until The end. <br /> <br /> The usual aspects that everyone looks for in a decent movie are all of good quality. Cinematography, in particular, stands out as exceptional, and I found that the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest deserve special mention. The score I found initially seemed out of place, but as the film progressed ... I'm not entirely sure if it really improved or if it fit better, or if it had only grown on me, but at the end of The Movie I was thoroughly enjoying myself. <br /> <br /> This is the second time I see the Redux version, (I've seen the original about four times). Now I will say that the first time I saw her. I was disappointed. I expected a "classic" movie, with a lot of war. The fact that Willard obtained the mission at the beginning of the film and did not fulfill it until the end bored me because all the interaction of the character in the way that the film IS seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not completely defined (since the focus is more on the character and the journey rather than the plot), in most cases a second visualization is needed to appreciate the film completely (as in all films that are more characters than plot-based), like the second time, you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> With the four great films of Vietnam, Apocalypse Now wins over the rest in the atmosphere, but lacks the action and participation of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and can not be compared with the Full Metal Jacket (probably my favorite of four). Apocalypse Now is a great job, especially towards the end where it becomes amazing, and should be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good movie based on characters and who does not care about casual violence.
