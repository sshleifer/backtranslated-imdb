After watching the premiere of Talk Show with Spike Feresten, I took a moment to think that there are really good shows after 12 in addition to SNL and I was also sad to see that it only lasted 30 minutes. His excellent writing skills helped this program overcome a series of lack of money and help. Lincoln electronic was very funny and I really think that this will be a good program of Dark Horse Talk Show. He was very happy with the way he handled it and gave Andy Richtor some good lines to work with. As you would have suspected, it was a bit unstable, but for those types of slots it was very good. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are not someone with weed or if you are and you do not have something It is more important to do than see this great piece and have a fun time doing it.
