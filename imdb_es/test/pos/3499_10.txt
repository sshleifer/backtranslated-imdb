Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it with. I have not found pleasure in the silly and senseless humor of American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar kind of humor, I could not help but laugh. I almost never laugh out loud in a movie. And generally a movie has some fun parts for me, but this movie was fun from beginning to end. My only disappointment was when everything was over. In fact, I'm going to buy this on DVD when I find it.
