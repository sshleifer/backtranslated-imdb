Most of Kieslowski's films seem to me enigmas, destined to expand the mind and soul. The characters are not very credible, they are idealized, they are schematic. However, the way in which Kieslowski presents his sinuous paths through life, his complicated interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or destiny, makes me understand the faith, makes me (I want to) believe in God . That at some point everything has a meaning, if not for me, then certainly for someone. <br /> <br /> Trois couleurs and especially "Rouge" is closer to making me touch, feel, experience the "truth", the "meaning" than perhaps any of his other films. The only problem is that the paths of the explored "puzzles" are a bit too similar to their other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable. There is still a lot of joy to have here. It's like a family wine brand: you know what to expect and deliver it, sometimes with a newly discovered bouquet that could come from aging, be it wine or yourself.
