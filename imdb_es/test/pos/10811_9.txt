French cinema had always been very strong when it came to presenting historical themes. 95% of the time, they never make mistakes. This film is one of the best of the genre, due to the very strong performance of Depardieu and Pszoniak. Wajda's work, as a director, is truly a marvel. Everyone should see this great movie.
