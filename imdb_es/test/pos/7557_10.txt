... that maybe one day people wake up. People who can resist the temptation to separate each one and everything, and who see the 60s for what they were. People who can see that it was the individuals who made those times; not the other way around <br /> <br /> The comparison of "Forrest Gump" is good. Both films look back to the 60s, but "Four Friends" is about human beings, instead of cartoons. FF delves into what FG (quite successfully) tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop. But while "Gump" files the 60s in an attic like old toys in a box, "Cuatro Amigos" collects and hugs each toy, thus erasing the lines between what you hold and what you are. <br /> <br /> If you associate romance with shoe polish, you will hate this movie.
