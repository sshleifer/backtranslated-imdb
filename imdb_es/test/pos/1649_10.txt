Many experienced and excellent actors mingled in an ongoing plot of an untold part of World War II on the Eastern Front. Well-portrayed and unforgettable characters. One episode leaves you wanting the next. Pay attention to the closing credits where the thousands of battalions of Shtrafbat are listed. An untold story that involves hundreds of thousands of people. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always full of real people and dialogue. Produced with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a terrible time. I want to buy a copy for my own collection to be able to enjoy the series repeatedly.
