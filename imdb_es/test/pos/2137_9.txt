I like to walk through a museum. You can appreciate the great talent of the main composer, Michael Cimino and this fabulous artist of light .. Velmos Zsigmond. As I said, I like to be in heaven discovering all the creation that this man can apply to a single painting. Imagine when you can see a moving image of this artist. I can say: this movie is one of the best.
