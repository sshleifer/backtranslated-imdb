The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways, from more or less traditional points of view such as dealing with art to more modern approaches that like to dissect the work according to postcolonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me quite cold is that I had no idea what he was talking about. What is the underlying vision / idea / concept behind this performance of Shakespeare? The previous critics do not get much more than the tragedy of revenge, the punk show, but surely there is more, right? This does not mean that there is no vision here, only that it cost me to discover it. Be that as it may, there are still things to enjoy. The punk flavor is refreshing and fun. Toyah Wilcox as Miranda and Jack Birkett as Caliban are wonderful. I did not much care that Williams as Prospero ... is not magic enough, I suppose. The changes between the old monastery / castle and the outside world (very English) can be a little disturbing at times, but I think that is intentional. In general, interesting, but not quite the success I expected (especially after seeing Jarman's Caravaggio).
