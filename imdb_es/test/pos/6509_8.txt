-This is practically the whole soundtrack of this movie. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and it shook the house. Director Doug Pray is never seen in this documentary, nor do I think he is even heard, but he has made a very intimate look at the lives and history of the "mixer". He has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be explained according to what they are talking about. I never liked to "scratch myself", but the film does a wonderful job of being elementary for those who know little and instill jokes for those who are experts in this area. Mixmaster Mike from the Beastie Boys is in this movie, but it was not until after the movie that I was able to name several heavy hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc.). The extreme fascination with the record players of these talented and extravagant DJs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film also sheds a gratifying light on these guys (and a woman) to be classified as musicians. Pray does not leave his movie idle and if there is a slow scene, it soon becomes energized again due to the fact that music almost never stops. If nothing else, this movie will increase the vocabulary of his jargon. I have to go back to "dig", so I'll finish this review. See it, it will be of interest. Good stuff, man. Good material.
