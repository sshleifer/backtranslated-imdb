It is quite revealing to see this today and appreciate how far we have come in what we expect from the movies, and at the same time appreciate how many fundamental notions were established. <br /> <br /> Here we have a narrative film spoken in every rule: audio and images are pushed to their period limits. The frame is limited to approximately the height of the band and upwards, without close-ups of the face. <br /> <br /> The compositions are remarkable; there is an early cross-sectional scene on the shoulder to show the dialogue; there is a treacherous descent into a canyon with some angled angles of perspective; a skeleton bleached by the sun lies in the dust while the wheels and legs advance in the upper part of the frame; the tension in the confrontation between the hero and the bad is visually captured by filming on the long axis of a large tree that is between them; and again and again - early visual whims abound. <br /> <br /> Today, it is disturbing to see young Wayne lead a movie, free of ego or manners. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Walsh recognized the self-reference: the theme is the journey of a disparate group of pilgrims; the ones that appear on the screen are a disparate group of theater actors, vaudeville comedians, shell game artists and, probably, carny barkers and veterans of the ten-in-one show. They all travel together to make way for the way the movies would be made. <br /> <br /> This is worth at least one visit to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later films.
