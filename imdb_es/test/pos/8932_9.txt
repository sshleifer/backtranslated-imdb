I have seen this movie on a Sunday night and I must say that there is no better way to end the weekend. I am totally satisfied with the humor and warm charm that this film offers. It just leaves me in a good mood. Watching this movie means having a good time and maintaining a warm feeling. <br /> <br /> The film offers a sharp British black humor and I find it very cool. You really enjoy the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is SO cool. I do not know exactly why. She is too old to be a love interest for me and too young to be my mother. But I really feel comfortable when she appears in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some may say that the story was thin and predictable. But who cares? There simply has to be a happy ending, dancing in the sun! Are the characters stereotypes or cuts? I do not know, I do not care! I just loved and enjoyed watching them. <br /> <br /> Also, I must say that I generally do not like romantic comedies. But this one is exceptional: a black comedy with a heart of gold!
