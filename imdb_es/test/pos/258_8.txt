Log in to the imdb to say what a lovely Love Love movie is and I am totally confused. It seems to me that someone has been confusing their titles. "Plastic demon baby" What? This was not Love Life. A bit of luvey dovey for my taste, but a great, funny and original movie. I especially liked the ending that did not fall on the normal block of clich√©s in which all the romantic movies of Hollywood crash and burn. Nine out of ten
