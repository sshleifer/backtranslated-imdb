The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon; Two rival Bond movies. "Octopussy," starring Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. "Never Say Never Again", made by a rival producer, is, apart from the horrible "Casino Royale", the only Bond movie that is not part of that franchise. His great attraction was that he brought back the original Bond, Sean Connery; his title supposedly derives from Connery's observation after "Diamonds Are Forever" that he would never again play the role. Some have complained that Connery was, at 53, too old for the role, but in reality he was three years younger than his successor Moore, who not only did "Octopussy" in the same year but also made another film Bond, "A View to a Kill", two years later. <br /> <br /> The film owes its existence to the settlement of a demand on the film rights of the work of Ian Fleming. Perhaps it is unfortunate that the terms of the agreement included a clause according to which the new film had to be a new version of "Thunderball", since perhaps it was not the best of the Connery Bonds. (A remake of "Dr No" or "Goldfinger" could have worked better). The plot is very similar to that of the previous movie; The terrorist organization SPECTER, acting together with a megalomaniac tycoon named Largo, has stolen two US nuclear warheads and is trying to bail out the governments of the world by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a large sum of money. Of course, it's up to Bond to save the world by tracking the missing missiles. <br /> <br /> The film is lucky because it not only has one, but two of the most beautiful Bond girls of all, Barbara Carrera as the seductive but lethal Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo's girlfriend, Domino, who he moves to Bond's side after learning of his lover's evil plans. Some of the Bond films have a plot that depends on the hero's ability to win over the villain's mistress or accomplice. There are similar developments, for example, in "Goldfinger", "Live and Let Die" and "The Living Daylights". In the official series, Bond's ally is usually considered the female protagonist, but here Carrera, playing villainy, announces herself above Basinger, who was an actress relatively unknown at the time. Basinger, of course, has become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, while Carrera is one of the Bond girls who have faded from sight. <br /> <br /> Of the villains, Max von Sydow makes an effective Blofeld, the head of SPECTER, but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too insipid and non-threatening as Largo, except perhaps during the "Domination" game, a more sophisticated variant of those violent computer games like "space invaders" that were so popular in the early eighties. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German, in films like "Mephisto" and "Oberst Redl", but he does not appear so expressively in English. <br /> <br /> One of the characteristics of the film is that it follows Bond's normal formula and, sometimes, moves away from it. There is the standard plot of the world at risk, the chase sequences, a series of exotic places, glamorous women, sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the title of the film. However, there is not an extended sequence of previous credits, and we see some familiar characters under a new perspective. For example, Bond's boss M becomes a lanky, supercilious aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter turns black for the only time, and scientist Q is represented by Alec McCowen as a disillusioned cynic (despite his characteristic Christian name). Algernon's upper class) a clear accent of the working class. There is also a funny Cameo by Rowan Atkinson as an awkward British diplomat. Although Connery may not have been quite as good here as it was in some of his previous films on paper, when the changes in the familiar theme sound it makes this one of the most memorable Bonds. 7/10 <br /> <br /> A fool. The character of Rowan Atkinson claims that he is from the British Embassy in Nassau. However, since The Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, Great Britain would have a High Commission in its capital, not an Embassy.
