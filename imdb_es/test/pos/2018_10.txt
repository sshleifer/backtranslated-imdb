After reading the previews of this movie, I thought it would be a disappointment, however, after I got my DVD from Region 1 (the DVD was available before the movie reached UK theaters), I was surprised pleasantly, the strong performances of all the cast members make it a very nice movie. The fact that the script is quite weak means that you do not get entangled in the story and, therefore, the display repetition factor is greater. I recommend this movie to each and every one <br /> <br />
