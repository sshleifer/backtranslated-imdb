Many American pea brains who love and support the half-truths of fans like Michael Moore would do well to sit through this movie more than once and see how hypnotic manipulators can scare, intimidate and lie to an uninformed audience and get people who fear or hate killed, spindle and mutilated. Robespierre in this great epic kills the opposition by remote control, all in an outburst of self-righteous devotion to his principles. We get the impression that Robes felt it was quite justifiable to cut off the heads of his opponent, even when he sent his henchmen to invoke false and misleading charges against the State. Today, the captains of our rotten media institutions are much more sensitive than the Robes ... they simply murder your character with insinuations and false accusations without foundations or sources. Dan Rather's attempts to assassinate W's character on the eve of the 2004 elections, or the constant noise of the 2000 elections, were stolen, though constitutional scholars continue to mock the irresponsible nonsense.
