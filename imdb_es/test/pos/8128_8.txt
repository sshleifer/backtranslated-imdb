An inspired choice of the director for this latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, who burst onto the scene with NY Dykes's no-budget tale, _Go Fish_ offers a gently ictonic vision to this tale of a Londoner who chooses the unsuitable environment of a the masculine union society to declare their lust for a companion who seeks masculine truths. The highlight for me is a scene in which society tries to return to being primitive hunter-gatherers, but ends up ordering a take-away. The film as a whole is wonderfully performed and Troche, who would never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, enjoys the larger budget by making some wonderfully persistent bread shots that contrast with Go Fish's granular hyperkinesia. A really nice movie.
