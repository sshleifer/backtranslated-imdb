I'm so glad I recorded this movie when it came to the BBC last month! It blew my mind, so heartbreaking and real. David Tennant is absolutely fabulous in this, although his character is not always so easy to like or identify. The final scene where he plays the song broke my heart, those eyes ... <br /> <br /> I guess he made this film among the Dr. Who series, and that makes it even more of an achievement for me. I simply love Dr. Who, and yet I saw absolutely nothing of him in Mr. Tennants' representation of this man who knows he has changed and struggles to create some kind of new identity and life. <br /> <br /> very little intense drama!
