I'm very happy to see every time I watch the (Ray) movie for Sydney Twenty-first Century (Jamie Foxx) who played this role as evidence of his brilliant acting skills to take his position alongside great actors in Hollywood for his support of gold for the strong skills of African-American actors at all times and periods for their eternal work as evidence of the eternity of Ray Charles as a great proof of his legendary presence at all times for his success in winning the Oscar as ( best actor for the lead role) a (better mix sound) between facts and film scenes about Ray and Jamie as a mix between two copies of Ray (ray of the past) and (ray of 2004 acted in the person of Jamie Foxx). It was nice that the director chose those songs to adapt them with dramatic scenes in the movie's crashes to enter the environment of success in the corn legend with legendary films in Hollywood from 1893 until now and his cunning to choose Sharon Warrne in t Ray's mother's role was that she succeeded in this role through a brilliant analysis to the core of her character that Ray's mother was the turning point for him when he grew up to be independent of himself to take his place in this world and be icon in his talent as (Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington) and at the end of this film to receive his honorable report of Gerogia and his decision to take his song (Georgia in my mind) the national anthem for this State made its promise to its mother to be alive so far for its legendary songs and its brilliant life.
