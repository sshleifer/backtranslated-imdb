I always knew that the day was coming. We all knew it. There is only a lot of oil on the ground, and one day we will fall short. But is not there supposed to be enough coal to use in its place? And wind power, or something like that. Things for future generations to worry about. <br /> <br /> Then this documentary hit me between the eyes. The oil produces the fertilizer that is the reason for the first time in the history of the world, practically nobody lives on the farms. When the inevitable shortage of oil comes, many things (air travel, many drugs, plastics, life in the suburbs) will become impossible. But the craziest vision of the documentary is this: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort, that without it our lives must change. Even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they will soften our landing in a strange post-oil world that (documentary claims) could start NOW. <br /> <br /> Despite its grim message, the documentary is often very entertaining. It contains fabulous historical images (sober images of dark urban factories and fun things from the 1950s) that remind us why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. It also offers the hope that a massive effort started now can facilitate our oil transition and make the world a better place. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time in the mystery of Why are we finding this now? How can this be a great emergency all of a sudden? We knew that in the 1970s we should be preparing for a post-oil world, and we began to prepare ourselves with alternative energy research and smaller cars. If our lack of follow-up to President Jimmy Carter's initiatives 25 years ago has condemned us to a forced landing in a post-oil world, why did no one shout in the soap boxes? <br /> <br /> In the end, He found the documentary highly persuasive; and left me with the terrible chill of being dragged from a very beautiful dream. This must be seen for all those who are not afraid to face a very likely near future of which we still have time to do something about it. <br /> <br /> - Charles
