This was a very strong look at prejudice and group mentality. The cast is composed of excellent actors who do a remarkable job. The sets are beautiful and a little stylized. The art direction is first class along with a great cinematography. The story is tense and shows how prejudice and bigotry can flourish easily. It is disturbing because of its realistic violence and the representation of a fairly typical community. I was very impressed.
