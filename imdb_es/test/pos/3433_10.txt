First of all, I almost never see Swedish films, and this is the second time in my life that I see a Swedish film about cinema! Therefore, I think it's one of the best Swedish films of all time! The combination of emotion and humor is outstanding, and sometimes you do not even know if you should be terrified or just laugh. The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after the Second World War and help the Germans start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which however is a bad idea. What an awkward idiot! And poor Robert Gustafsson, the wounded soldier, always gets in the way ... OUCH! But he still has his great humor. A positive boy Robert Gustafsson has made some less cool films in recent years, and this is really a relief. He is great in this movie. After all, this is one of the best Swedish films in history, and Peter Dalle has done an excellent job. Congratulations!
