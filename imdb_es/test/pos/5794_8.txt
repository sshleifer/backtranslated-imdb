Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager, her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life that is becoming increasingly decadent. In his quest for meaning, he falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose hatred for his deeply flawed parents quickly goes out of control. <br /> <br /> Little Vera is shocking and disturbing in almost every respect. The drink of the father, the habilitation and the lack of understanding of the mother, the casual lies and the bad direction of the brother, and Vera herself who forgives them, all her faults are all shocking and a little disturbing to observe. However, the frankness of the film somehow manages to be even more shocking than the plot or the characters. Located in small spaces and in a great urban decadence, little Vera presented a very different vision of Soviet life than had ever been seen before. In fact, Little Vera is a portrait of the collapse of Soviet society painted in shades of pain, despair and rust. It is the implosion of a family opposed to the implosion of an entire social order. <br /> <br /> Although painful and desperately unsatisfactory, the film itself is definitely worth seeing, if only to understand the feelings and cultures that are still reshaping Russia. today.
