I loved it. There you go, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of times more. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer movies like this to the trash like Die Hard 4 that holds the box office and receives criticism for the simple fact of having an old man who is saving the United States. Van Damme moves well for a boy his age (47 I think), throwing kicks that remind one of Kickboxer. If you like the action of the old school and the explosions, this is the movie to watch. This is one of the best works of Van Damme. <br /> <br /> The films of Van Damme and Steven Seagal are theatrically released where I live, so I never miss the chance to see our old-school action stars on the big screen.
