I believe that this loving story and written with sensitivity is one of the true masterpieces of the screen. After having seen this movie, originally on the silver screen with my mother, in Los Angeles, California, when it appeared, it was many years before I had the opportunity to relive it. The beauty, the tranquility, the simplistic elegance and the tranquility of the film for me, separate it from many, many others of its kind. Yes, tears still reach my eyes when I see it, and I hear the refrain of that unique song in life. Maybe still, today my number one of the most beloved movie of all time. I hope that future generations will enjoy and appreciate this classic love story.
