This is, in short, the television comedy series with the best cast, and the most enjoyable as well. Each of them is a comedy actor firsthand. I only know one television series that is better (that is, "Moonlighting") "one of them had Willis as the protagonist" but he only had Willis, while The King of Queens has a lot of actors that are as good as one can enjoy: Kevin James, Leah Remini, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Sullivan, Victor Williams, Gary Valentine and even the rest of them ... I liked spontaneously and continuously and quickly. The advanced age did not ruin the fun, anyway. <br /> <br /> In some words, the series is intelligent and original, miraculously avoided from the stupidity and waste of current television. It is politically incorrect and does not court minorities in the usual and disgusting way. <br /> <br /> The comic is very appetizing and tasty. <br /> <br /> I read, almost in its entirety, some writers, and sometimes they write about their favorite programs, however, although these are several, I did not find in any of them the slightest mention of my favorite television shows (but it is true that the critics that one likes are not those with whom he is in total approval, but those that at least offer a common basis for disapproval), which are, mainly, WILD WILD WEST , MOONLIGHTING, QUEENS, FANTOMAS, the TWILIGHT ZONE of the 80s, Bradbury TV show and SANDOKAN. Most of them I saw when I was 13-14 years old; about some of them I have written, and execrable.
