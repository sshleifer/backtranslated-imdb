I loved this movie when I was a kid. I saw it theatrically. Randy Edelman made a good composition of the soundtrack. David Sevilla is the father of the Chipmunks and the recording manager. The Chipmunks consist of Alvin, who is best known for playing the harmonica, Simon, who is an intelligent and studious squirrel, and Theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. There is a lady known as Miss Miller, who takes care of the squirrels and has 3 daughters known as Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor, who have the same character as the Chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack include "Diamond Dolls," The Girls of Rock & Roll, "and the touching" My Mother. "Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go there on business. They play around the world in a 30-day video game that led them to compete with each other doing the real thing.
