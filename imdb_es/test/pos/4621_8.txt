Yes, 2:37 is in a way a scam by Gus van Sants Elephant. It is about some students who are dealing with their problems that lead to the suicide of one of them. Yes, it is full of clich√©s, but that is life. There is no denying that spooky nerds, people with disabilities or popular students who, despite their popularity, have problems exist in the real world. <br /> <br /> But this is not what this movie is about. It's not about life in Highschool. It is not about the misery of life itself. <br /> <br /> If you look below the surface, below the social relations similar to those of the soap shown, you will find some exciting and stimulating critiques of our society. <br /> <br /> Why do people commit suicide? Do we really understand your motives? Or are we simply trying to understand, after it is already too late? And why is it always someone, you never would have expected it to be? <br /> <br /> This movie does not answer this question, but it raises it. And he does it in a very intense way. All the time it keeps you guessing, whose blood it is, what you see from the beginning. You are following the paths of some students, they all have a more or less good reason to end their lives, only to be forced to see the gruesome act in the end. <br /> <br /> Did you know who? would be? Or was he surprised, as in real life? <br /> <br /> The message is verbalized by one of the surviving children at the end. We are always so fixed in our own problems, that we forget to see those of others. There may be someone, a colleague, a friend, who no longer wants to live. But, if you do not open your eyes, you'll never know until it's too late. <br /> <br /> This movie works well. It may have some flaws, but they do not matter anymore, when it's over. Either you see a reflection of society, or you are blind to reality.
