This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is truly original. Equal parts of porn, fairy tales and musical comedy: this film is definitely a strange part of the history of adult cinema. <br /> <br /> Alice is a sexually naive librarian who ends up following the rabbit in "Wonderland", where she meets all sorts of "experienced" oddballs like the Mad Hatter (who likes to take out her dong whenever she possible), Humpty Dumpty (who broke his wiener along with his shell), Tweedledee and Tweedledum (a brother / a of sex) -dead crazed), and the bisexual queen, among others. <br /> <br /> This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is actually quite docile by the standards of the time, a time when much pornography was bad. Energetic and unpleasant (as the sub-genre "roughie" points out): this is actually quite funny and strangely captivating. It's the kind of thing you would show your children, if it were not for graphic sex. A little slow to get to the "good things" ... but really entertaining. Oh, and some of the musical numbers are downright funny. If you are a drinker, take a few, if you are a smoker, roll a couple and give this a chance. 8/10
