'The Dresser' is one of those movies that are so perfect that it really costs you to find something you do not like about them. Written by Ronald Harwood (he himself was an old dresser of the legendary Donald Wolfit), shines with energy and true love for life behind the spotlight. <br /> <br /> As' sir ', the dominant actor and the main focus of the When playing, Albert Finney is a pleasure to see him, either complain about the lack of a storm during the' blow, the winds .. "from 'King Lear' or chatting with his faithful stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, as good as ever) about the old days. Like Norman, the dressing room of his camp, Tom Courtenay offers a fabulous performance, moving on the good path of 'Lear', picking up a bottle to go to the pub, or maliciously despising the former Fool, Mr. Davenport-Scott (often mentioned but never seen!). <br /> <br /> In an attractive supporting cast, there's Edward Fox as Oxenby (a typical second arrogant leader), Zena Walker as his Lady, Lockwood West as the replacement Loco, and many others. <br /> <br /> This film has a great energy, it is true that it brings with it some of the brushes of its scenic origins, it is true, but being so good you do not realize it. Very well done
