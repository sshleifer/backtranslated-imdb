If you want a movie with the full range of emotions, look no further; dramatic and funny, and scenes of heartbreaking emotion; I can guarantee that VERY few will be able to see this warm and VERY human film without shedding a tear from time to time. The performance of the two protagonists is hard to believe; you would swear that the two young people really suffer from Muscular Dystrophy (Rory) and Cerebral Palsy (Michael); simply, two of the best performances I've seen in my life; they are also two very credible characters, and you never get the feeling that things have been "thrown" for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy. In the release of the DVD as "extras," they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternate ending) and an "extended-party sequence"; It is difficult to understand why these clips were not included in the final film, since they are perfectly related to the rest of the film and are by no means superfluous. But without reservations I can recommend this movie to anyone; One of the best I've seen in my life.
