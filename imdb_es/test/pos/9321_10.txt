I enjoyed this movie very much. I found it very entertaining because I feel that it captured the romanticism of the Irish-American culture of the end of the century. There are no messages There is no violence and there is no open sex, just entertainment in the style of 1947 and Dennis Morgan had the opportunity to sing some really good songs. A very good movie.
