The plot of this movie is not complicated. A very attractive girl goes to Europe in search of the reasons for the suicide of her older sister ten years before. There she meets her sister's ex-boyfriend and together they travel to all the places where she was her sister, and gradually the reasons become clear. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film so special, and rises above the limited plot, are the beautiful portraits of the characters. Although the older sister's boyfriend is a hippie who leaves school, he has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. And although the older sister, whom we see in flashbacks, shares these ideals, she does not have a sense of limitation or balance, of how much is too much. And although the younger girl is fiercely loyal to her sister's memory, little by little she finds the strength to face the fact that her sister was just a normal girl, after all. <br /> <br /> The most special moment in the movie is when the girl and the boyfriend of the sister finally stop fighting against their mutual attraction. I can not remember seeing a more beautiful, moving and romantic tenderness when making love in a movie! <br /> <br /> In all these forms, this is a truly beautiful film, a film to be treasured and to be seen again. and again. 9 out of 10.
