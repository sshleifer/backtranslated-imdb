Telling the story would not be the point, right? Barnens ö, spelled almost like "booné aww" is the title of that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked many people, including me. <br /> <br /> Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has the Guinness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he is willing to break new records himself. In particular, the youngest person under water for three minutes. <br /> <br /> The story is, like most Swedish films and books of the time, profoundly, consciously provocative and imposing. Bergman was starting his latest film and Cries and Whispers had barely left. The expectations for any Swedish film were quite high. They taught us then that the great theater, the great actors, the excellent writers and the gifted directors formed a true team of perfection in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, Barnens Ö is a story of discovery. It is also a history of alienation: the cities are alienated and living in one of them makes us foreigners for the majority of its residents. It is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. It is a film of overwhelming hope and despair. Of feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and isolation from a world that could not care less ... <br /> <br /> This approach, in itself, is a rather difficult way to weave a compelling narrative. Here, Kay Pollak's masterful guide in the script of the PC Jersilds novel by Ola Olsson, turns it not only into a possibility, but into one of those film masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I can disagree a little with someone who said that this work was almost forgotten. It is not. Even as I write this in 2009, discussions about the history of P C Jersild take place all over the world and the film is shown in many film schools and small theaters. <br /> <br /> Why? It would be difficult to philosophically entangle all of this and many have already done so academically through writing and lecturing. The reason why Barnens Ö was and is a special story is the cozy feeling that you feel from the beginning when you discover that everything is told through the eyes of a small child. And that's where it ends, too. Maybe it's a clinical vision, as someone else pointed out. But deeply disturbing, moving and satisfying. The concept is profound: as long as we do not have pubic hair, we can still live one more day as an angel. Afterwards, we will become what Raine reflects as the culmination of his experiences: "Men are pigs". Find your fears when you are not afraid. Find love when the world collapses around you. Discover a reason not to behave like adults because they refrain from committing crimes. He let go of his inner purity and trust in others without reservation, only to learn how rotten a man's soul can be. <br /> <br /> Where love is expected, find hate. Where compassion is needed, find suspicion and cold hearts. It is a movie of metaphors. A film to think about and pose questions that are difficult to formulate but more difficult to answer. <br /> <br /> In the end, the satisfaction of witnessing such a magnificent job (which really increased the initial bet for any other Swedish film after) is a joy and hope ride. Keep in mind that it is a film full of the dark side of our nature. But, alas! A film of hope and deep joy. Reine will remain an island in Stockholm, but there is great hope to live today, even when we find our first signs of sexual maturity.
