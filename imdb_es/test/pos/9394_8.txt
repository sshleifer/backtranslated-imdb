Hmmmm I'm a little lost here. I mean, I know that I liked the Deathbed, I know that I will transmit the Gospel of the Deathbed to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you are reading this, I urge you to see the Deathbed, but I can not . really tell why maybe that is the secret of its charm. <br /> <br /> Parcel? Kind of. There is a bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases and anything else that comes close) when sucking them inside their mattress full of digestive fluid. Among his almost unlimited powers, Bed has the ability to keep the spirit of Aubrey Beardsley trapped behind an image to observe and narrate the events of the film. Then, several people end up in Bed's abandoned mansion (Bed's habit of eating something that moves gave the place a bad reputation), and they went to have sex, to take a nap, or because they did not feel well and they were eaten, sometimes having trippy dreams first. And in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between Beardsley, Bed's mom (you had to be there) and Bed. <br /> <br /> It seems pretty simple, when I put it like that, right? Well, except for the part of Aubrey Beardsley. But something feels constantly out of place, and the story seems to slide sleepily from one scene to the next, even when they laugh at cheap laughs or weird gore effects. Imagine that Bunel crossed with Bergman, then went to soak in a large tub of Herschell Gordon Lewis. The tone of the story changes from the horror to the fairy tale, to the comedy, to the existential meditation, without breaking the step: an incredible achievement for a movie of a student without a budget in the Detroit area. <br /> <br /> Everything all included, an amazing little movie that, most likely, no criticism can ever do justice at all. See it yourself.
