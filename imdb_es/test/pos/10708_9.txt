I am surprised by the questions and problems that this documentary has mentioned in the reviews here, especially because they are interesting questions. Surely, those who could best approach it would be the creators of the film. However, I think I can shed some light on something that I think has been overlooked, which is, in my opinion, the purpose of the film, what it is about and what it is trying to convey. What is your message after all? At the risk of pointing out the obvious, I will begin to say that the filmmakers have an intention. They are trying to tell a story, extract meaning and convey a point. With this in mind, we can tear down many of the criticized points, particularly those that involve what people expected in contrast to what the filmmakers were really trying to show. Causes and consequences of violence? The movie is not about that. Is it not about "enlightening the non-Brazilian public" on the issue of Brazilian favelas? Well, who wanted to do that? Is AfroReggae this or that and supported by whom? It does not matter in this context. Are not there enough women in the movie for your tastes? It is not about equality or the feminist cause. Every little detail about Anderson's life, mother, son, family and all aspects and functioning of the AfroReggae movement? Well, do not be so fussy because it does not matter. The story may have so much extension before it can no longer become a movie. If the authors showed everything that everyone expects, they would have to do a 6-month television series. If you're expecting all that, you approach the movie incorrectly. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's about two people who started a movement. Two individuals full of ideals. Two individuals who are thirsty for change. Two individuals who try to do something for all the bad actions that surround them. The people who went to the bottom and wanted to get up again. It is about finding a purpose in life, being inspired by misery, changing destiny and becoming something more than what they were meant to be: criminals and drug traffickers. It is about achievements and hopes, and not about the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, although it is an integral part of the film, given that the characters are constantly surrounded. Unexpectedly and not without reason, the film ends up focusing much more on the course of Anderson through the difficulties in life. This is because they faced Anderson's accident while filming the movie. I'm not sure about this, but they may even have seriously considered finishing the film right there, leaving behind all the effort invested. But Anderson wanted to move on. And so they did, risking losing in having a movie with a bit of identity crisis, considering the sudden change of course, but winning in showing someone how to overcome such a devastating event. It is very evident to those who see it that the film starts on AfroReggae and ends on Anderson. It is very unique in this sense (the change of the story line). Perhaps his only sin does not make it evident in advance, which can initially increase the expectations that will remain unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> Regarding the importance or ordinary of Anderson, I would say that not everyone wants to change the whole world. , end all violence, feed all the hungry, be like Mahatma Ghandi, be like Mother Teresa or any other known personality there is. It is much easier to relate and be inspired by someone who, like everyone else, is trying to transform their own hard life, raise problem children, deal with permanent injuries or illnesses and even manage to pay bills at the end of the month. To understand the film, we must see that it is about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime, compensating for it and trying to persuade others not to follow the same problematic path. Although you can criticize whether the way you chose it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method, you can not deny its intentions. <br /> <br /> Also, the perception that Anderson is special or can be chosen. In part it had to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they represented. As much as befriending them. There is no way that the whole movie does not tinker with a more favorable light on Anderson. If a dear friend is paralyzed in an accident, it is not just a fact, it is a big problem. And this is not necessarily bad. It is not much that they treat it as "a chosen one" but they do everything possible to show it as a seed for transformation and a source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, do not see it. this documentary for the scenes of the reality of the poverty and the crime that it contains, looks at it to see what is much more, an inspiring story. <br /> <br /> Nike-Ad-like? It seems very good and professionally made for me and does not affect or undermine the intentions of the film. Romanticized? Speculate about your credential as a documentary if you wish, but why not when it is supposed to cause reaction and inspiration? Is not it about improving the lives of people through music and dance, the essence of what the subjects try to do, romanticize reality? Forgive me, but showing the facts is what the reporters do and you can watch them on television every night. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to be a filmmaker, I wish my first movie was so good too.
