I'm a fan of independent cinema. Driven by dialogue, the character's pieces of study are what interest me. Some of the other publications are right: "Wannabes" is not going to compete with "The Godfather" for the best movie in history. On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well-written and well-directed image that has surprisingly good performances by all the actors and actresses. My problem with one of the other reviews: <br /> <br /> - Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians <br /> <br /> - Dubin is a Jewish surname, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy of an Irishman. He does not stand out at all, rather, he offers great performance. <br /> <br /> This did not win many awards, but it deserves a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it for $ 7 in Blockbuster and I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. Highly recommended
