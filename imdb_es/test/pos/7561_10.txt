Any company, PLEASE, will do a (good +) DVD of this movie? Besides being a wonderful movie about relationships and friendships, "Four Friends" is the ONLY movie I've seen, and literally, I * spent * years * of my life watching movies! - that captures the essence of the experience of the 60s (and I was there!): idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, betrayals and, ultimately, its optimistic but bittersweet outcome. And all this is achieved without being a story about any of the many disorders of that era, although many are only mentioned ... as part of the tapestry. But the story is mostly about the characters and their friendship for about 10 to 15 years ... and that those survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade. Absolutely a film of joy and a must see ... even if one is not an old hippie!
