finally, a movie that deals with the probability of extraterrestrial visits with adequate depth and warmth. Just in case we are not alone, I think these visitors are too touristy to take care of us or give that group of anthropocentric nonsense a stable proof of their existence. we would not interfere in the battle rites of some tribe of the agitated desert, unless we are out of place to get our travel insurance, huh? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie shows the transitory cathexis of a tired mind. and body by a higher entity. that happens quite unspectacular and quite unrecognized, but we're dealing with a movie here, right? so prot hospitalization is just a trigger of the plot. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges acts as usual, but Spacey is hilarious. The paper seems to be very simple for him, convincing and lovingly "crazy". eating unpeeled bananas, sitting in a tree, giving your doctor a hard time with speed, wisdom and (above all!) amazing appointments. They made me think and philosophize for hours. <br /> <br /> It's an encouraging movie, to say the least, and the soundtrack of Edward Shearmur is simply beautiful. just go and get a copy. Catch a ray of light. now.
