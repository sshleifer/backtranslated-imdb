This is a movie about a man that everyone thinks is Jewish. This is a film about Lawrence Newman, who lives in Brooklyn in the 1940s, at the time of World War II. One day, when he puts on glasses, people start thinking he is a Jew. And only because it looks like one. And he lives in a very anti-Semitic neighborhood. So some people start treating it like rubbish. They make that judgment, being Jews, of Larry's cool wife, Gertrude Hart, too. He lives unbearable. Neal Slavin's Focus (2001) is a good look at anti-Semitism. It is a problem that does not disappear. The film is based on the novel by Athur Miller, which, I admit, I have not read. The movie is really good, so I'm sure the book would also do it. The actors do a good job. William H. Macy is always good, and his work as Larry Newman is brilliant. Laura Dern is Gert Hart and she is magnificent. almost terrifying as the neighbor who wants to keep the Jews away by any means necessary. The character of David Paymer as the owner of a Jewish store, Mr. Finkelstein is the most sympathetic of the movie. Paymer is the perfect choice for paper. One of the best scenes is when Mr. Finkelstein and Newman fight against these Nazi-style people with baseball bats. They come together to fight against Evil. The Christian and the Jew.
