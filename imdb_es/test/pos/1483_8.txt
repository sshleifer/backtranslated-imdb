Once there was someone in my family (without saying who is for personal reasons) who thinks that Mr Bean is always so foolish in everything he does in the comedy series. Imagine how I felt at that moment. Surprised instantly. <br /> <br /> There are more reasons than one for which I love seeing Mr. Bean. Being one of the first programs on local television here in my country where I grew up seeing for the first time, it's just one of those things that had stuck in my head. There was even a time when my friends and I talked about some of the selected episodes and we just laughed together. <br /> <br /> He's always silly, funny and hilarious in Rowan Atkinson's antics as Mr. Bean will do in every episode. Although lately he can sometimes show some of the repetitions here, he never stopped recovering those childhood memories of mine. In fact, I can dare to say that this is the first program that shows me the type of programs that come out of the United Kingdom as it grew. <br /> <br /> The comedy series ... is definitely really perverse, as the British say.
