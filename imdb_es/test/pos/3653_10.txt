A work of love Each painting is perfect and it catches you. Then, pure emotion and storytelling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director receives your heart and takes it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this film in 2 festivals and it came with standing ovations in each screening. The extraordinary storytelling transcends nationality and language and I felt that it was part of the drama that was unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as you can get. Vijay Raaz, Camille and Benoit hold each other. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all who appreciate good cinema. I can not wait for the commercial release of this movie.
