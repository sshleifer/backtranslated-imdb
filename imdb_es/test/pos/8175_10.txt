A great movie. <br /> <br /> A great love story. A lot of swords fighting. Huge battle scenes. Heros and villains. True story. <br /> <br /> Few in the West know a lot of Chinese history. Chin Zchaundi founded China. In fact, the country bears his name. Some are familiar with the recently unearthed terracotta army. This is a historical epic of how the Period of Conning States and unified China ended. He founded a dynasty that lasted only 14 years, but was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty that permanently defined Chinese civilization ever since. <br /> <br /> Chin (or King of Zheng as they knew him before founding the empire). ) was more or less contemporary with Scipio, Hannibal and Fabio in the West. The parallel domain of the Roman world (worlds of the west and east) was achieved without a single imposing personality like Chin. It would not be another century before the West produced Caesar, the closest comparable Western figure. <br /> <br /> At the beginning it is shown with sympathy, but it develops throughout the film in a helpless ruthless. The story only records the ruthless part of despot, but the comprehensive beginning leaves room for the real development of the characters throughout this long film. The famous story about the meeting with the murderer is as true as any anecdote of two thousand years can be. Gong Li is adorable. She is the emotional core of the story. Everything he does to make a great movie.
