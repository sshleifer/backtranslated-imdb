Shazam was fine, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a kid, I mean, before there was Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006), there was Hero High, a school for superheroes in training, Teenagers with superpowers to help the police to capture the bad guys, and other times they would find themselves in embarrassing situations like The Greatest American Hero (1981). It was a fun cartoon to watch, which was also fun, it was the live action stage show called The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam. The actors who expressed the characters, also dressed, have characters in the show. Rex Ruthless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields), WeatherMan (Jim Greenleaf), Captain California (Chris Hensel, who also sang the song), Dirty Trixie (Maylo Mccaslin), Glorious Gal (Becky Perle, who looks like Son of Love by Superman and Wonder Woman), and Punk Rock (Johnny Venocour). The whole cast just went with anything, when it came to jokes. The cartoon was a funny comedy of superheroes, points to that will return to live action as Fat Albert (2004)
