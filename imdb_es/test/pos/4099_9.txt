Actually, this movie should be released to DVD. I just received a contraband copy of what I think was a studio movie and I was completely satisfied. It was on my list of movies to simply possess by the cast. Three of my people, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo and Juliet, and also John Gielghud. Sorry for the bad spelling, they were there, so I just thought that the small amount I was spending would be fine. Boy I was right I will not reveal any of this, you may already know the story, but I'll tell you if you can get a copy in ANY format ... Do it! @ You will not regret . JPC
