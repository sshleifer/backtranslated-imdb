This is a very incredible movie! The characters seemed so realistic to me that it was hard to believe that they were not real people. Being from the south, I thought that the character of Judith Ivey seemed especially real, and like everyone else mentioned, she does an exceptional acting job. The characters are not beautiful and they do not look anything like the average Hollywood stars; their imperfect bodies and personalities seem much more natural and real. <br /> <br /> One critic mentioned that the protagonist, Alice, did not have a good reason to run away from home, which is true: she had no moral or important reason to flee, like escaping from a child abuse, etc. I thought I was sick of the jobs without a future in a working class life and wanted to go to Florida, where her friend lived the attractive and privileged life of a university student in Miami. The actress shows that Alicia's confusion, uncertainty and questioning become a decision and willingness to take control of her life with an impressive naturalness. The film also shows how Alicia is trapped in situations where she apparently has no options, which causes her to panic, act and seek help. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the style of the grainy film discouraged me and made me think that it was a homemade or very low budget movie, but in reality it is very well made. The quality of the home movies really makes you feel like you are there with the characters, a part of your RV trip across the country. Definitely, this is a movie that is worth seeing, although I do not understand all the descriptions of it as a moving story. It is quite vulgar and disturbing at times, even if it is not completely sad at the end.
