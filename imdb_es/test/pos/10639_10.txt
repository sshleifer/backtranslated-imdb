Some users are confused about the identity of the armed men who walk the steps in the sequence of the "Odessa ladder". These men are not Cossacks, but regular army troops. <br /> <br /> The Cossacks arrive on the scene a little later and it is the men on horseback who attack the crowd with their swords. <br /> <br /> To the experts in Russian history: Correct me if I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> But there are a couple of lines in the movie that apparently nobody has commented. After taking the Potemkin, someone from the crowd on the shore says: "Kill the Jews!" This is on the screen only for a couple of seconds, but it's there. <br /> <br /> How cruelly typical of history, not only in Russia but in many other countries, to blame the Jews immediately, without thinking and instinctively for any domestic problems! <br /> <br /> Perhaps other parts of the film are not historically objective, but the clamor against Jews is too real. Comments, someone? <br /> <br /> Also, why can not English speakers learn to pronounce the name as "Potyomkin" instead of "Potemkin"? In Russian it is necessary to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of "e": as "ye" or as "I". Sometimes two points are used to distinguish these two pronunciations, but generally the difference simply must be memorized.
