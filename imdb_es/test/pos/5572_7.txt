After having watched the program for about four weeks, which is enough to get an idea of ​​the program, I think it shows potential. Although much is borrowed from other programs (what science fiction does not have these days), and the characters are stereotyped, I like what they are doing with the stories. There is some continuity with the development of the plot and the interaction of characters / relationship building, despite the essentially modular nature of each episode. Some topics related to science have been explored, as well as revelations of character's secret / weakness. They have also added some comedy to the show, something I would gladly see more in "serious" science fiction. In general, this makes for a good balance, which can attract larger groups of people, unlike the Star Trek vs. Babylon 5 debates in which I have been a great participant and witness. The visual aspects of the show are more than adequate and are well budgeted for a first season. The acting is acceptable, and I'm curious to see how well the actors manage to make their characters grow from their script stereotypes. I see enough positive aspects and the potential to remain interested in seeing where the show wants to go ...
