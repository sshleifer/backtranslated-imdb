I was surprised and impressed to discover that this movie premiered in 1940, before the United States entered the Second World War. On the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misinterpreted as a rash. But the brilliance of Chaplin is not limited to making a joke of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message would not have been as valid if it were not for the excellent use of humor in this film, along with the moments of dramatic mixed drama. The drama alone would not have had the bite and the resonance of this The movie did it. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) may be the best way to attack him, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Hairdresser) may be the best way to love him. In the final speech of The Jewish Barber, I forgot for a moment that the war I was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that make sense now, and at any time of war. For this reason, I think the film did much more good than bad, as it still has the same profound effect today.
