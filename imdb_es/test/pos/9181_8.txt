OK, OK, I must say it impressed me. It's hard to say what impresses me the most: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so that my vision does not escape, or the film itself. Either way, "Hitch" was pretty good. Hey, it was good enough for him to see it twice. Will Smith was fun and good. Kevin James was simply hilarious and absolutely essential to the movie. Even though this movie focused on Hitch (Will Smith), without Kevin James it is not the same. <br /> <br /> The story is: Hitch is a matchmaker who helps the boy seduce the girl. Her job is to create the opportunity for the girl to notice the boy when she would not otherwise. After the meeting, the rest depends on who does or breaks the relationship. It works only on the reference and remains largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is the project of Hitch this time, and Albert has his eyes on Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta), a figure of the style of Paris Hilton. While the plot unfolds, Hitch himself has Sara (Eva Mendes), a columnist of sharp, independent and fangled gossip who does not want to have anything to do with a relationship. <br /> <br /> The two stories create some fun moments and come together for a bit of a quagmire. Of course, no love story is complete without the lack of mandatory communication, misunderstanding or setback to send the guy who chases the girl. Fortunately, they make it brief and unhappy. Hitch was a fun and funny movie that flowed very well and developed without problems.
