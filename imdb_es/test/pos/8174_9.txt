I have found that this epic is of a surprising beauty, surprising and even heartbreaking. A kind of monumentality in beauty and decorative richness, a magnificent dramatic movement and dynamism. The choreography here is hugely enjoyable, the actors are completely nice. I've been a big fan of CROUCHING TIGER ?? Also, but this one was even better. They have the ingenuity of Kitano to delight in what is pleasurable. This beauty that affirms adventure cinema is an act of courage. When was the suspense so exquisite and genuine? And the art of showing large crowds, gigantic armies? The film has something deeply satisfying and a constant good taste. There is a huge pleasure in making such an impressively clean and clean show. It's good beyond words. Few, few adventure films, and much less epics, gave me such uninterrupted delight. <br /> <br /> The fanatic can be monumental. "It's not monumental art," but it's monumental fun, like Leone's films, like some of the epics of the 1960s; Also like the trilogy of hobbits. It is large and fun.
