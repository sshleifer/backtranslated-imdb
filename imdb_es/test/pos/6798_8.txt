Mickey Rooney (as Mi Taylor) is a young man adrift on the figurative road to ruin, where he meets Elizabeth Taylor, 12 years old (as Velvet Brown). He loves horses, but he has a sad history with animals. Mrs. Taylor is in love with the sense of Mr. Rooney's horse; She takes him home and gets him room and board with his family. They are very well supported by Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (like Mr. and Mrs. Brown). Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are Taylor's brothers. <br /> <br /> The plot of "National Velvet" is implausible to a certain extent; For example, the circumstances that led to Taylor's career in the "Great Race" are quite complicated (but they were probably more credible on paper). Even so, the connection of the characters with the horses and the character of Mrs. Revere are very well conceived. Rooney and Taylor are excellent in the leading roles; there is a balance between Rooney's "child star" and Taylor's exuberant "child star," which adds depth to his characterizations. <br /> <br /> The excellent performances of Rooney and Taylor are reinforced by good direction and photography. , and the edition of Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith and Robert Kern. A sentimental classic. <br /> <br /> ******** National Velvet (12/14/44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Anne Revere
