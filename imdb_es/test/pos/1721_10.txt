First, I've been a fan of the show when my PBS station started showing it in 1981. I learned a lot about the program and the people who participated or contributed to the program. <br /> <br /> This latest installment of Doctor Who made a great impression on me. The original series, also known as the classic series, mocked bad special effects and / or wobbly games. Well, this is no more true. The special effects are impressive, but what is even better is the writing. You have the opportunity to learn more about our beloved doctor and perhaps some reason why he loves planet earth so much. Without revealing too much, it's a series worth seeing. Christopher Eccelston brought a part of the Doctor that we could never see, a bitter and angry but at the same time kind. <br /> <br /> YOU MUST SEE!
