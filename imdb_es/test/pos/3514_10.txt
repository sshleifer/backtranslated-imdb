Just before dawn is an excellent horror movie. It is atmospheric, full of tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature, in which few young people meet their doom, in the form of two fat and maddened bastards, who kill them. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent director, who unfortunately is underestimated. He managed to build tension, not with blood, but showing a threatening natural environment. Lieberman manages to build a tension in a very linear and simplistic way, which is also the best, not to show the spectator the gore, but to allow him to imagine the worst that happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> Just before Dawn was compared to the Texas massacre, Deliverance and Hills have eyes. He's as handsome as Deliverance, better than Hills, I mean more terrifying and better designed, and it's creepy like the Texas massacre. <br /> <br /> JBD is one of the best horrors of the last decades, who finally lives on DVD!
