I was surprised to see this movie, how much I had "captured" it. No, the actors did not act like the typical 'Hollywood' actors, but that's not always bad either, as this movie shows. Very different from the Disney standard, it's a refreshing twist! They also give you an idea of ​​how it was probably without being 'educational'. A movie that everyone should see and enjoy. Many people love to discuss "precisions" in any movie of this type, but just having the basic idea has a lot to offer. Mild complaint East and West Germany, seen on any map, would have West Germany on the left side, East on the right. The movie sometimes makes you go back a bit, because about half of the scenes have West Germany on the right side of the screen, and other times on the left side. Even during the same events, they change from one side to the other. Perhaps, just a little more consistency would have avoided this slight distraction. Go see it!
