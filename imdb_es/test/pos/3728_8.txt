I still can not describe what to feel when I received this at the fnac site. A film so rare, so little spoken and known, it is difficult to find, even for fans, but the contrast between the past and the present is devastating: now I have a DVD of the film, with the best possible quality. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie that I bought online, I saw it at home, with all the lights on my DVD and TV turned off, and I marveled at the experience. I did not know what to expect. Wicked, I always looked for some kind of disappointment when I saw a Luc Besson movie that I had never seen before. But I never arrive. This movie was no exception. From the beginning, I understood that the person who makes a movie like this as the first film is destined to be great in the future. And so it happened. This won several awards (including the highest prize at a film festival in my country, which makes me proud) and shows that this film is preparing many more important things. This may be the most original film after the war I've seen, surpassing Mad Max in its originality and artistic sense. There's no problem with this movie: its cinematography is great, as are the actors' performances. I am also proud to say that I finally saw all the films of my favorite director and I have a copy of almost all of them (Joan of Arc is still waiting for me to buy the DVD). This film is above all a work of style and dedication, which makes it clear why Luc Besson is the director of my choice: good taste, beautiful framing, excellent use of music (I also marveled at Eric Serra's first score) and The promise of great achievements. Gaumont did well to bet on his youthful genius, the man who would later change the face of the relationship between France and Europe between the cinema and its audience. Let's hope that Besson starts working on a new management project. I will be the first to encourage him. Until then, I recommend this movie to anyone who needs to learn a lesson in how good movies are made with little money. I loved the atmosphere of the film, which, due to its black and white cinematography, suggests an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust. This film works by the pure magic of the movies: it shows in images what we can not explain with words. And I'm with all the people who wrote comments to this movie and they liked it: good choice! A big hug for all who see this and feel that a bit of their lives were changed.
