Good movie, all the elements of a good movie were there, history, actors, script and direction. I was on the edge of my seat all the time. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, it is a low budget movie, but I liked it more than many big budget movies. <br /> <br /> Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who deals with his cheating wife. Then, a voice on the phone and then fear. <br /> <br /> Virginia Lustig is beautiful and delivers powerful performance. She is an excellent part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the growing ambiguity towards the end, although we know that the main character may be involved, we continue to see everything from his point of view and asking: Who is the killer?
