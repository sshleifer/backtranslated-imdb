A really excellent vision of the world and the reality of being a heroin addict. The film is one that will come too close to home for those who participated in the drug culture and have knowledge of what a heroin addict really is (or is close to). Good movie, that will never be really obsolete. Excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is the way in which Preminger shows how devastating the world of JUNKIE can be. It's worth taking a look, a kind of education. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain in which a drug addict lives.
