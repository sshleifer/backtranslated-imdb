Another one in the long list of "Do not" films of the late 70's and early 80's, but this is much more than that. This film is a low budget schlocker highly underestimated with a twist. It has the grainy quality and the strange soundtrack that is typical of the horror films of the time, but they are the very underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors / actresses that make this film good. A young nurse arrives at the progressive psychiatric hospital of Dr. Stephens just after he was killed by one of his patients and everything is not what it seems. It seems that Dr. Masters, a fairly ambitious doctor, has assumed his functions and has begun to implement his own ideas. Each of the patients acquires their own unique personalities and has their own personality traits and defects that make the interactions very entertaining. There is the nymphomaniac, the old and crazy, the woman with a sickly obsession for infants and a man who has returned to childhood among others. There is also a strange twist in this strange story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients loose and the bodies piled up. If you are a fan of the sordidness of the 70s, this is the movie for you.
