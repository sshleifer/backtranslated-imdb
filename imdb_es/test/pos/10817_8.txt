I found this DVD in the library and, based on the notes on the cover, it seemed that it could be interesting: a black comedy set in France in 1940, just as the Germans are advancing. ("Boy, should that make them roll in the hallways?") But he does! This is an intelligent, original, suspenseful and funny movie. I do not remember seeing anything like it before? The foreigner or the United States. That the writer / director can find humor when we know that part of the result (the Germans will occupy France for four years) is remarkable. That he does it with so much charm is part of the delight. What starts as a black comedy and fluff even ends up having a couple of serious moments? including a race to carry out a "heavy water" deposit (which was part of the preliminary investigation for the atomic bomb) and a quick introduction to History 101 of the beginnings of the Vichy collaborationist government that would govern southern France during much of the German occupation. * But do not let any of that scare you: the film itself is fun, charming and romantic, and is ahead at a steady pace. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is the combination of actors we've seen many times (Adjani and Depardieu) and others that we've never heard before. Along the way, there are two shifts to make stars: Virginie Leydoyen and Grégori Derangère. Both are impressive, but Mr. Derangère is especially so. According to IMDb, was in ten movies before this? but Cesar also won as "the most promising actor" for this role, so apparently he was not as well-known even in France. Is it a combination of romantic and comic protagonist? And it makes everything look so easy. You may be reminded of Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby" and "Arsenic and Old Lace"? It is difficult to do comedy in a movie because the risks are huge and the actor may seem inept. But Grant did it with charm, and this guy does too. I should think we're going to hear more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> To be sure, will not this movie please everyone? There is a bit of violence, although nothing that you do not see on television every day. But if you fancy something original, after having seen this, it is possible that you have discovered a cinematographic jewel. <br /> <br /> * The so-called "spoiler" in this comment.
