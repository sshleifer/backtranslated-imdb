The genius that is Stephen Sondheim never showed up as prominently as he was in his 1979 "Musical Thriller" SWEENEY TODD, a gothic, bloody, spooky and delicious musical mix about a demented barber who returns to London to take revenge on the evil judge who not only had him permanently exiled from London, but is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to "protect her from all the ills of the world." The barber finds the love, sympathy and help of a pastry shop owner who has his own agenda regarding Todd. This musical shook Broadway and won nine Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress in a Musical (Angela Lansbury). The production was filmed entirely in 1982 with Angela Lansbury recreating her role on Broadway as Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a bakery that finds practical use for the bosses that Todd makes minced meat from. George Hearn, who replaced Len Cariou on Broadway, is electrifying in the title role, so much so that you have to wonder why he was not originally cast for the role. Lansbury and Hearn are fascinated from start to finish and commit to 100% with their macabre characters helped by a top-notch Sondaheim score, probably as close as Sondheim wrote to an opera. Lansbury shines on "The Worst Pies in London" and "By the Sea." George Hearn stops the show with "Epiphany" and is also convincing during "Pretty Women," a duo that sings with Judge Turpin, the man he has vowed to avenge. Cris Groendahl is vocally impressive as Antony, the young sailer who rescues Todd and falls in love with his daughter Johanna. Betsy Joselyn is a little exaggerated when Johanna and really pushes vocally to the point that during "Green Funch and Linnet Bird", she really diverts the voice for a couple of moments. The rest of the cast is first class, especially Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin, who plays "Johanna" in this production, which was eliminated from the original production, and Ken Jennings as Toby, whose magnificent tenor fills the auditorium in "Not While I 'm Around. " But it is the impressive musical score of Stephen Sondheim and the fascinating interpretation of Lansbury and especially George Hearn that makes this night of Gothic musical theater an experience that remains with you long after the curtain call. Not for all tastes, but if you are a player with a strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a joy for all lovers of music theater and a must for the fans of Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.
