I just watched this movie tonight. I thought it would be good because I really like Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon is also a great actress, but it was much better than I could have imagined. You came out of the movie feeling great. The performance was excellent, which is something that may be difficult to achieve lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and I being a university student at the University of New York, I think it's great that she goes to school instead of just being an actress. Anyway, going back to the subject, the movie keeps him interested all the way and I definitely think that everyone should go and see him. I would give more details, but I do not want to give away the movie.
