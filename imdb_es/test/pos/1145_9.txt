The wind and the lion is a wonderful sweeping movie. It is a monument to what was once the cinema, but it no longer exists. <br /> <br /> Connery, despite the thick Scottish brogue, plays the Raisulu very well. He inspires the viewer in a way that many main characters can not. <br /> <br /> Candice Bergen, in one of her first roles, is wonderful as the kidnapped socialite Mrs. Pedacaris, showing courage in the face of adversity (and a lot of humor too). A wonderful movie, rent it or buy it and you will not be disappointed.
