Well, I'm a history buff, and well, I'm addicted to the action movie, so, of course, this movie is among my ten best of all time. I love the action scenes and the unique weaponry of the time. I have a kind of doubt about the possibility of fighting with the two-handed sword against the horse, and Raisuli's sword looks more like a katana than a scimitar ... oh, well, I've never fought the horse either. <Br /> <br /> I also love attempts to make philosophical proverbs. The typical man from a desert tribe probably could not read the Koran, so he would take his word. Several writers have criticized Connery's accent; Well, on holidays like Youth, I met a family of South Africans in our west, Dinosaur National Monument, and although they spoke African to each other (yes, second-generation Germans can hear the difference), they spoke English with a Scottish brogue. Your pronunciation Scottish missionary?
