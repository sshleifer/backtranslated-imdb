I saw the Gate of Heaven in its first week almost twenty years ago. The tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing Cimino for a long time in the follow-up to his 1978 masterpiece "The Deer Hunter". The critics came and the critics destroyed the film with vehemence. An influential critic of New York cinema opened the way and most critics followed his example, and 3 o'clock. 40 min. The movie was taken out of the distribution. United Artists caused Cimino to shorten the film in about an hour and it was relaunched many months later to receive equally horrible reviews and sad business. The film at that time cost around 40 million dollars (now considered low budget), which makes it one of the most expensive in history, and Cimino had free rein in the project with endless repetitions despite being alone his third movie. "The Deerhunter" also received a negative reaction based on a perceived political ideology, which was not popular. I mention all this to present a possible bias against Cimino. At that time I thought the movie was very good and when I saw the shorter version, it was still very good, but not so much. The film appeared again in a museum in the early 90s. They were supposed to show the long version, but could not find an existing impression. However, watching the movie years later, I now thought that Heaven's Gate was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version began to appear in select cities, I saw it recently and it was worth the wait. Heaven's Gate begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt, and we presented some of the flaws in their characters from the beginning. Despite Joseph Cotton's mandate in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to illustrate and improve their country, many of the graduates behave as if they were part of an elite country club. The film advances 20 years to Johnson County in Wyoming. A livestock company called the "Shareholders Association" has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants who claim they are cattle thieves. Kristofferson is allied with immigrants, while John Hurt is part of the Association. Although Hurt is totally against this insane action, he is too inefficient to do anything about it. There is a massacre, but immigrants do well to defend themselves. A cavalry from the United States comes to the rescue of the Association to, allegedly, arrest them after most of the damage occurred when, in fact, they sanctioned the mass killing. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his Harvard days married, bored, on a yacht, but dead inside. <br /> <br /> This is a very complex film that is brilliant in all departments, such as themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, set design and acting. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston and Cotton are excellent characters of very complex characters. Some of the main complaints I read about this film say that it is ugly to see it, incoherent, too long, that the characters have no meaning and that the words are often unintelligible. In his defense, Heaven's Gate looks like photographs of that period just like "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" did. Some of the scenes have a smoky appearance that suggests the industrial revolution or, sometimes, horses, cars, people are going around creating a sense of reality. (The critic who called it one of the ugliest films ever made, likes to use his thumbs a lot.) But despite all that, the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable. The movie makes a lot of sense if you pay attention to it. Not everything is defined for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or their themes. As for its length, it is a beautifully structured piece, sometimes poignant, poetic, stimulating or devastating, with practically one big scene after another. Sometimes some of the words are unintelligible, especially in some of the scenes full of activity. But one could understand a cinematographic film like this one through its use of cinematographic language, the looks between the characters or their actions. One day, soon, this film should be reissued in its entirety so that people and critics can give it a second chance. Do not let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles-Under appreciated in his life and that he can not do the kinds of great movies he is capable of doing.
