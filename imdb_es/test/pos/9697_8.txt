This movie was very funny! Occasionally it went too far, but is not that what we expect from them? The theater laughed out loud and shouted at all the incredibly crazy stunts. It is rude, raw and, at times, terribly intense. The whole gang is back and even more crazy, which in turn provides great entertainment. I do not want to reveal anything, but the small fragments of clips that circulate through the network are nothing compared to what comes next. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to go see with friends. Try to see it with a large crowd. You will not be disappointed. Just do not go with anyone who can not take it (see above). It will not go well, you can be sure of that. But that's pretty obvious in the first place. If you enjoyed the first one, you will love this one.
