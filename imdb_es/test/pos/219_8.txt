The creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker had its roots in improvisational theater in Madison, Wisconsin, I think so. They had a group called "Kentucky Fried Theater" (or something similar). They put a lot of their pieces on celluloid as "KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE" (1977), which was long, irreverent, sophisticated and very fun. <Br /> <br /> They followed with the very popular, AIRPLANE! (1980), what really put them on the map. In it, they took some well-known veteran actors on Robert Stack and (especially) Leslie Nielsen, and putting them in prominent roles, proceeded to parody every cliché of every aviation film since the days of John Wayne (Batjac) THE HIGH Y'S PRODUCTION THE MIGHTY (1954). * With pockets full of cash and now noticed, the trio reached an agreement with Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company TV Network to make a half-hour comedy parody of the almost uncountable Crime Drama police. They have come and gone on our television screens over the years. Recalling the excellent work that Mr. Leslie Nielsen had delivered on AIRPLANE !, he was chosen to lead. <br /> <br /> As Sergeant / Lieutenant / Captain Frank Drebbin (the rank designation switch is one of his comic bits), he presided over a great series of successive word games, visual gags, not hijackers, and exaggerated clichés police and criminals. All these statements by some, seemingly standard scripts. To this is added an opening narrative that is too dramatic, expressed on information that contradicts printed visual information. They always used this to give the title of episode titles, where the voice and the printed titles never coincided. <br /> <br /> They had a great musical score, which although somewhat exaggerated, would have passed as a theme and incidental. The music in a direct drama. The musical score, the initial titles and the format of the episodes divided into Act I, Act II, Epilogue, etc., were all obvious but affectionate elements of QM nerves. (Quinn Martin) Productions. (They even had the same announcer as the Q.M.). <br /> <br /> One thing that this short series did not have was a public laugh with a technical boost. And, boy, I'm sure they did not need any false tracts. The nature of the parody was such that it demanded close, almost undivided attention from the viewer, and that was the main reason behind the fall of POLICE SQUAD. <br /> <br /> Regarding the cancellation of the series, explained an executive of ABC. that the episodes "... require too much attention from the viewer". So, is not that what one would want? <br /> <br /> Then, after only 6 wonderfully extravagant and hilarious episodes, until the beyond of the cancellation of the series was POLICE SQUAD !, only to be reborn in THE NAKED PIST Trilogy, made for the big screen in movie theaters. Once again, they did pretty well at the box office. Oh, well, the loss of television is a gain for Cinema, thanks to you, Mr. Idiot TV Exec! <br /> <br /> * THE HIGH AND MIGHTY was produced by Duke Batjac Productions and released by Warner Brothers. It was not available for many years and, finally, Mr. Wayne's family made the arrangements to launch it to television and video.
