This is the funniest movie I've seen in my life. However, I have laughed a lot in many movies. This is because the brightness of Best In Show does not lie in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated verbal wit and layered. The improvised dialogue is so fast that you end up laughing, not from each individual joke, but until after several jokes are built with each other, disarming your senses until they reach the climax and you can not help but let them go. <br /> <br /> It's a well-filmed movie, but what makes it extraordinary is acting. I was impressed the first time I saw it, but when I saw it after learning that practically all the scenes are improvised, I was surprised. It was very nice to see the comedians work together, build jokes from scratch and immerse themselves completely in their characters. <br /> <br /> I imagine that the golden days of Second City were like this.
