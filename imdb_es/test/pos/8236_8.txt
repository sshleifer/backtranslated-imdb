More than 21 years, the film version of the work of Ruth Gordon, detailing their experiences in trying to keep the marriage together with Garson Kanin after entering the service, provides Irene Dunne one of his best later roles on the screen big. It is also compatible with what was then an optimistic spirit in the United States about how we would not ruin peace as we did in World War I and sow the seeds of another global conflict. <br /> <br /> The play Ruth Gordon wrote and starred that he ran for 221 shows in 1944 on Broadway and limited himself simply to the bungalow that Gordon and Harvey Stephens, who was the male lead, had a training base. If you look at the Broadway credits list, it says the production was "staged" by George S. Kaufman instead of being directed by him. I am not sure of the distinction, but I imagine that with a wit and a will as strong as Kaufman's, it must have been an interesting period in the preparation of the production before the opening night. <br /> <br /> When Columbia bought the screen rights, Sidney Buchman had to do a considerable script reconstruction to move the action beyond the bungalow. The film has very little trace of its scenic origins. <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the husband and Charles Coburn, the employer of Dunne and Knox, who are writers. Knox graduated not only as an editor, but as a prominent columnist. His words and thoughts help sell the paper and Coburn is in a bind. But Knox feels he has to enter the war, the seminal event of his time to speak with authority about the kind of post-war world he wants. This was not an uncommon topic in those years. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne has some good comedic moments, the kind she used to have when she appeared in front of Cary Grant. In fact, Garson Kanin addressed them both in My Favorite Wife a few years earlier. Coburn is his usual water buffalo cantankeros of a boss who finally has a good heart. <br /> <br /> More than 21 was an optimistic image that is sad to say was not accurate about what the Allies and I want to say. I could bring peace conferences to create a better world. I still hope that a new generation will do well.
