Man, it's great to see Young's star and The Restless Melody Thomas Scott as more than the fickle Nikki Newman! A doctor with a brain no less! And super nice to see her with the beautiful Lorenzo Lamas instead of Victor Newman! <br /> <br /> Mel plays a university professor of microbiology who goes to the islands with his son for spring break, only to find herself a prisoner of the island infested with a rapidly spreading virus. For her it is very practical the character of Hunky played by Lorenzo, who has a daughter of the same age as his son. <br /> <br /> Mel shines, as does Lorenzo with a bit of the exaggeration of the younger couple. Interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism. It's worth seeing, especially for Y & R fans.
