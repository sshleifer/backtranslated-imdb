I think this was the edge thriller of your most prominent seat that I've seen in a long time. The investigation for the film was exhaustive, the writer Kelly Sane has left no loose ends. The cast was seasoned (fantastic performances throughout the year). Omar Metwally was outstanding. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is poetic, the music is charming and the overall effect is highly satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The interpretation enters a territory that even the media fear to tread. It is really a wake-up call for those involved with espionage and the legal network that is the "War on Terror". <br /> <br /> A woman came out of the theater and asked me "does this really happen?" That in itself speaks of the masterful achievement of Gavin Hood.
