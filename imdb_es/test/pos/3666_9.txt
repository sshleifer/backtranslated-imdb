The movie is not perfect in any way, but despite this, it is very funny and fun to watch. I'm the first to admit that Victor Fox is not really that attractive and that his music and style are pretty corny. I also agree that the movie has some strange distractions and some scenes do not work well. And that? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it, who cares? Does each movie have to make sense? Does every movie have to be perfect? No. A person could be devastated by admitting that he loves this movie. Once again, so what? It has adorable characters, it is well filmed, the performance is good in its majority, it never becomes too dramatic or dramatic, it is peculiar. Look how many people love I Dream of Jeannie. It's perfect. Hell no! And although this is very different, I say that you look at it and you will be in a good mood after seeing it.
