A respectable event of real rumors <br /> <br /> 1. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 A very strong opener ... Edge performance in the heel was sublime as it was during the rumor event ... especially ID EDGES NIGHT ... <br /> 2. Undertaker Vs Heidenreich CASKET MATCH <br /> <br /> 7/10 Many people hated this rivalry, although I liked, I thought Heidenreich really played his character well. the match was not amazing in the excitement it was until Kane and Snitcky got involved. It gets better as it goes. <br /> <br /> 3. Kurt Angle Vs Big Show Vs JBL (WWE CHAMP) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 a surprisingly good match, as there was only 1 really exciting ringtone ... of course ... ... very good game for the title ... good pace ... although it is a predictable ending. But not all the titles of the real rumor are predictable. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (WORLD TITLE) Randy Orton WORLD TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 Actually it was not so good for the guys involved, it had too many dry patches, orton sold His shock shockingly, although it ended was something more of an anti climax. <br /> <br /> 5. RUMBLE ROYAL EVENT ... by the way, during the other games there were some segments ... two that were really great ... dinner rapping Christian and warrior stealing flaits number 30 entry. the event was good. 7/10 would get a 9 if the dinner won, but unfortunately my biggest batista enemy wins (THOUGH ID UNDERSTAND WHY) ..vince falls and drops a drop and all the sand starts to laugh.
