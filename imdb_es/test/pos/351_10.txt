(Warning: may contain spoilers) Let Rosalina help Mario to open the way and smile because this game will brighten up your day. <br /> <br /> 120 stars will require luck and skill, but 60 will bring you so much excitement! <br /> <br /> Popping through the stars shows Mario and Luigi and what travelers are now! <br /> <br /> Walking upside down has never been so much fun, especially a final battle with Koopa near the Sun! <br /> <br /> This is really a super awesome game and absolutely deserves a place in the Nintendo Hall of Fame!
