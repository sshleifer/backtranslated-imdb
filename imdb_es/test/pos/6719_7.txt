Although it hardly compares with other giants of the science fiction movie like 2001: AN ODYSSEY OF SPACE or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD CLASS, LIFEFORCE works as a totally extravagant fusion of science fiction and elements of horror. Somehow, despite the dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and the acting that does the same, it manages to function due to a few very different elements. <br /> <br /> Based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel "The Space Vampires," this film by director Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST; THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a joint US-British mission aboard the shuttle British spacecraft Churchill to study Halley's comet. Led by a US commander (Steve Railsback), they discover an alien spacecraft in the coma of the comet. And when they investigate the interior of the ship, they find alien occupants that look like giant bats. Later, the Churchill reaches the orbit of the Earth, but there is no response to the radio calls emitted from the base of the mission, the Space Research Center in London. He threw himself into Columbia to meet with Churchill, but they found the entire ship destroyed by fire, all but the alien beings locked in a glass that, far from being touched by fire, seemed absolutely perfect. The extraterrestrials are bought back to Earth ... and that's where the incredible happens. <br /> <br /> These space vampires escape from the Space Research Center and, instead of draining their blood victims through bite wounds, they suck their victims' Life Force completely out of them. One of them is Space Girl, a completely naked vampire played by Mathilda May. Railsback, the only real survivor of Churchill, is bought by the head of the SRC (Frank Finlay) and a British special agent (Peter Firth) to track down May, who is in telepathic contact with him. Very soon, however, the vampires have turned London into a scene of pure holocaust; People are being dried out or are becoming zombies, and NATO's threat to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation is very large. Railsback finally catches up with May and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal saber. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, unconnected, indisputably unequal, but nevertheless worth seeing, LIFEFORCE, despite the frequent incoherence of its script and its performance, benefits from excellent excellent special effects work. John Dykstra (STAR ​​WARS), some of the best I've seen. The other element of work, and one that surprises, is Henry Mancini's incredible orchestral score, almost Wagnerian in the same way as John Williams' score for STAR WARS, and Mancini, like Williams before him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra . , to get started! <br /> <br /> Largely forgotten these days, and a critical and box office disaster in 1985, LIFEFORCE, though for no other reason, should be seen by anyone who has a taste for strangeness. Never before had there been a movie like this, and there certainly will not be something like that again.
