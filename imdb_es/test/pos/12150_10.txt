This movie is simply one of the best movies that I have the privilege to own. It took me years to create this movie and it was worth it. The film is destined to be anti-drug propaganda, but it becomes the opposite, although not even in the middle of the film. The taste of the faces of the players when they receive their abundance of drugs is pleasing to all those who observe. Until the final phase of their lives induced by drugs, heroin comes by their voice. YIKES! This is the anti-drug message that was searched so fabulously. The soundtrack of this movie kicks up! By far, it's one of the best Pink Floyds albums! If you ever have the opportunity, take a look, listen and take the time to witness a spectacular movie.
