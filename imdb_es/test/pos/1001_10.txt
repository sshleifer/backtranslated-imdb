Despite the title and, unlike other stories about love and war, this film is not too sticky and pink, because love is like a rose: with thorns, that's it. The four main actors define their characters as realistic, with good sense and balance between the tragic and the realistic. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of the cabaret / chanson-esquire songs (sung by Keira Knightley) drag the viewer deeper and deeper into the film, from place to place, between brutal warfare and between peaceful love Some people may consider that it is too biopic, but it is mostly a romantic story, although in consequence it follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationship that is filled with joy and jealousy. <br /> <br /> London is viewed from another angle for once, Dylan's bohemian life during the bombing of the Germans takes place in a floating atmosphere of small dormitories, pubs and bars. Independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly dragged by both feelings of love and anger. <br /> <br /> Maybe the ending is too twisted and hang a bit loose to the rest of the movie, but in general this is a great romantic story.
