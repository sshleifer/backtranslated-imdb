In & Out is a comedy with a simple premise. He has an admirable success in the mission of being fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The comedy in this film ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime, physical comedy exists along with dry humor, with a nice veteran twist of Bob Newhart. Kevin Kline can be predictably in excellent shape in this film, along with Tom Selleck who does not play his expected kind of "square-jawed" leading man. Mr. Selleck plays his humor well and shows a good sense of comic timing. The cast makes this movie successful. <br /> <br /> Not all movies with homosexual themes are made to promote some kind of sinister and Hollywood liberal agenda, in fact, this movie was simply made to entertain, and if there is any part of this film it does Thinking to the viewer, then it was a by-product of work well done by an excellent cast of professionals. Often, ironically, I found myself laughing at the right times. A solid "B".
