After Mrs. and Mr. Iyer, this is another very good Aparna sen movie (mainly in English). In the previous film she dealt with a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film is the impact of the family member with mental disability and its impact on the family. As a parallel subtopic, it deals with a philosophical concept about "reality". It is a movie that leads to think after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Mithee, the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) suffers from schizophrenia in charge of the dominant older sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi). Mithee after her marriage to Jojo and her separation from him, she believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children on 15 Park Avenue in Kolkotta (there is no such address in Kolkotta, there seems to be one in New York) and it is intense in your belief. It's almost like an intense religious belief. In short, what is reality? In one scene, she tells Anjali "if I tell you that you are not a teacher, just imagine that you are a teacher". The open ending reflects this reality. In an alleged search for her home on Park Avenue, Mithee is lost. The penultimate scene is that Mithee looks at a group of five children playing and she looks at them with joy to go back to her family and then she gets lost. About this concept of reality, I remember another film from the fifties called HARRY with James Stewart. The protagonist believes that a large rabbit (?), Named Harry, is always with him and is always talking to him. In the end, even the doctor believes that maybe there is Harry. What is reality, is what the protagonist believes or what others believe that Shabhna Azmi dominates the film with his excellent performance as the strong older sister with current of frustration. Konkana Sen Sharma offers a performance as adequate as the schizophrenic. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is not as close as Mrs. And Mr. Iyer. It seems there are some loose ends. And maybe there are too many characters. Those who want a closed ending may not appreciate the open end here. But the ending corresponds to the theme of the film. <br /> <br /> Another good film by Aparana sen.
