A vehemently cynical, sarcastic and intense film, mocking and imitating the style of Pulp Fiction and the movies of stylized gangsters, Thursday is an entertaining, unpleasant and hilarious game of emotion. An astonishingly eclectic mix of exaggerated characters and oddly entertaining situations, this day in the life of an armed man who tries to go direct proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that Tarantino's genius tries to imitate. Pulp Fiction, a masterpiece of dark humor. <br /> <br /> Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops at Casey's house (Thomas Jane) to catch up with the old days. Casey was a former drug smuggler who since then reformed, became an architect, married a successful business woman (Paula Marshall) and is now considering adopting a child. Nick, who still has links to the gangsters' underworld, leaves a case full of drugs at Casey's house while he borrows his car to run some errands. a.k.a. pending issues. Disgusted and angry about the introduction of drugs into his home, Casey throws them into the kitchen sink. That's when, one at a time, Nick's accomplices, the rapture of the Rastafarian drug couriers and the crooked cops come to call Casey, who is about to have an incredible Thursday. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a hilarious sequence at a gas station where Nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. After reflecting on the size of the cup to be obtained, a fiasco breaks loose with the cashier when he demands a free snack cake and uses a $ 50 bill to pay. As a result of a comically brilliant bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a policeman intervenes and gets caught in the most unusual circumstances. This opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which is never taken too seriously and includes extravagant characters who seem aware of their own existence in this movie of senseless gangsters. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into segments based on various events and moments over the course of a day. This effect is very similar to Pulp Fiction, which is a similar chapter, although Thursday does not mess with the chronological order except for the occasional flashbacks. Also like Tarantino, the music magnificently introduces each scene and each character. Oddly funny creatures, like the Jamaican pizza delivery man who hits the phone and shares his hashish, and Paulina Porizkova's narcissist Dallas, who tries to rape Casey, adds humor to every event, no matter how horrifying and disconcerting it is. The matches are. When Kasarov, the crooked and calm cop of Mickey Rourke's spine, shows up, the careful staging and intricate configuration are completely integrated, and Casey's plight becomes even more daring and commendable. <br /> <br /> of violence, witty dialogues and extremely spooky antagonists, on Thursday does some things well, but other attempts at homage can go so far as to suggest a scam. A flashback sequence that shows Casey shooting the bad guys and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches John Travolta's style in Pulp Fiction is easily a step too far. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie, www.MoviePulse.net
