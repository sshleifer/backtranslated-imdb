If you have ever seen Open Water, this is the same type of rough, daring and indie film. I liked the action, suspense. the slow construction of everything, I just hope you do not do to this what they did with Open Water, with that sequel ... but anyway, the only thing that I did not like was the annoying younger sister, I was encouraging all the crocodile the time ... the movie starts almost as it should, the children pack for a trip, hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 minutes. before they arrived, so I guess his assistant takes the two sisters, and the boyfriend in the water, now that this is the second day of their adventure, curiously the first day they spent in guessing, hmm a crocodile farm. .. they are out there and everything is fine for a while, then bang, crocodile time ... very intense, you know something in this movie that you do not see the crocodile, all a fuck of a lot, but when you do it, my God, It is very scary, I love the muzzle and eyes of the crocodile, and the veil of fog that seems to wrap the crocodile every time he raises his head on the water, very very creepy, but well, in general, this is a great movie, if you can overcome the annoying little sister.
