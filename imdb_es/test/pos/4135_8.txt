The first time I saw the story of Buddy Holly was when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tune into HBO and watch this interesting biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a true (something) story about someone who really lived. I remember the music, great songs that I still love today (I can not believe that Gary Busey sang his own songs and very well, what a pin!) Then, the end came. He died. He went crazy. I could not believe it. I had no warning, no prior knowledge like most of those who enter this movie. He taught me a hard lesson about life and how he does not follow the rules that most movies teach us. I just watched the movie again tonight and I got engaged again ... and I got a little sad. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I admit that there is a bit of bias.
