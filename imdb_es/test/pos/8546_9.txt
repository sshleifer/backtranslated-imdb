Anthony Quinn is a master at capturing our heart and sympathy. Portrays a Romanian peasant with an IQ below the average, harassed by his wife to do more. It is World War II and the Nazis have taken over their country. Soon he is digging entrenchments in the hope of benefiting his wife's eyes. The Nazis have different ideas. Over the next few years, we see that the events unfold through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. His manipulations and bad luck put him in more hot water. Finally, and not because of him, we see his picture on the cover of "Der Spiegel" as the perfect Aryan. The war ends and the allies judge him for war crimes. But all our peasant wants to do is go home with his wife.
