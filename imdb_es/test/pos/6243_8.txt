"Tourist Trap" is a strange horror movie from the 70s. The film is about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry and Molly, who travel in a jeep through a desert area. Her other two friends, Eileen and her boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When a wheel is deflated, Woody takes her to a nearby service station and faces a spooky fate for some strange telekinetic chaos and some spooky mannequins. Friends get tired of waiting for Woody and go to a local museum of mannequins / wax "tourist trap". In front of the entrance, the car breaks at random, and the girls find an oasis area to go swimming, where they are approached by Mr. Slausen, who runs the attraction on the road that is now closed. He takes them to the old western wax museum, and the girls are left behind while he and Jerry go to fix their car. Eileen, the curious of the two, wanders to an old house nearby, where she also falls into the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a lot of life as mannequins. After waiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly go looking for her. That's when the real horror begins, and the masked telekinetic brother (can move objects with his mind) of Mr. Slausen begins to kill the teenagers one by one, while controlling his large number of mannequins turned into humans. <br /> <Sound similar to the 2005 remake of "House of Wax"? Well, it is. I had heard about this movie, but I had never seen it when I saw "House of Wax", but now I can see the surprising similarities that the two movies share: "Tourist Trap" was obviously a big contributor to the remake of "House of Wax" . . The mannequins in this movie are scary at first, some with eyeballs in motion, some without eyes at all and others with their mouths down that also sings. The singing was extremely scary if you ask me, and the mannequins were mysteriously designed. For starters, mannequins are creepy, but they are so real that they really are not. The film combines the elements of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (the masks used by the killer are similar to those of Leatherface), with a bit of the original "House of Wax" and the telekinetic powers shown in "Carrie". The result is quite satisfactory. Telekinesis was a nice touch for the movie, it made the killer more threatening and inescapable. The masks were terrifying, and the plaster scene was really disturbing. <br /> <br /> The score of the film was very well done, although not too much used in some scenes. The performance may not be particularly key, but it was not really that bad. Chuck Connors was really good as the mysterious Slauston, which gave the character a gloomy but friendly feeling. A young Tanya Roberts is also in the film, best known for her role in "Charlie's Angels" and, most recently, in the comedy "That '70s Show," playing Donna's mother. Robert A. Burns serves as art director, did a phenomenal job on the original "Texas Chainsaw" and also does a good job here, creating a messy and moldy atmosphere for both the rundown museum and the old house full of mannequins. . I found it a bit strange that the original rating of the movie was PG, it seems a bit too scary to have such a docile rating, but the movie really is not too violent. <br /> <br /> In general "Tourist Trap" is a disturbingly unique, fast-paced and extremely unappreciated horror classic. Full Moon gave it a decent DVD release for the 20th anniversary, the comment was interesting and the image was clear and sharp for the most part, better than the video versions. If you like the old horror movies of the 70s, "Tourist Trap" is an underestimated retro jewel. 8/10.
