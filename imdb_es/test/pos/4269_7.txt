Where do we go from here? That is the fundamental question of this movie. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC', the effort made in 2003 by director John Jansen, asks many more questions than he answers, but none as moving or as powerful as this one. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is presented as an ongoing conversation between you and your college drinking friends, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you will recognize from your own afternoons of debauched drunkenness. However, one of the many beauties of this movie is that we are rarely given an answer. Questions are raised ?? Everything from the mundane to the deep? but Jansen skillfully forces his audience to examine and answer these questions by ourselves, with little or no help from the characters. <br /> <br /> Side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of non-linear segments to introduce us to the main characters. We met with them on the morning of April 8, 1994? The day Kurt Cobain committed suicide. And it's Cobain's death, and the trip to his wake two days later in Seattle, which serves as the backdrop for the film. When exploring the life, music and death of Cobain, the characters try, with varying degrees of success, to understand and reach an agreement with their own lives. <br /> <br /> There are some aspects of the movie that are what you believe. could be expected from a low budget independent film: the performances range from decidedly mediocre to outstanding, with the strongest performances coming from jessica scott (holly) and noel wood (daniel); it is admitted that part of the dialogue is a bit rigid, but it never deviates completely towards the unreal; and there are some minor sound problems, especially once we're on the road, which sometimes make it difficult to follow the action on the screen. <br /> <br /> but despite its shortcomings, 'mainly ETC'. It is a solid piece, which profoundly affects the cinema. Amid moments of disturbing shock, cheerful humor and intimate turmoil, Jansen skillfully weaves all the threads of the characters and illuminates their own struggles while making them accessible and attractive to us. and as we can see the reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify with the questions and the problems that we are struggling with, and we can look back and remember where we were that day in 1994, when Many people changed the world. <br /> <br /> While Jansen is credited with the writing, editing and direction of the film, he must also congratulate his photography. With a strange eye and an incredible ability to capture us and attract us to each of the worlds of the characters, Jansen managed to produce one shot after another that stayed with me long after the credits were over. <br /> <br /> And no comments This movie would be complete without a nod to the incredible soundtrack. The music in this movie is accustomed to an incredible effect; sometimes subtly emphasizes the action, other times it takes the center stage, but never gets in the way or deteriorates in a kitsch music video. The soundtrack works like the best final hits, although I suspect that the label probably would not fit very well with the director. <br /> <br /> The new double DVD file edition offers some deleted scenes, previews, music videos and a cobain documentary. The deleted scenes offer information about the making of the film through alternative opening and closing sequences, and it is certainly a pleasure to have the rare and beautiful video of Raining Kind. Cobain's documentary is fine, although a bit worse for wear, and certainly there are more extensive documentaries available for hardcore fans. An absentee is the comment of a director, and I can not help but wonder if Jansen has plans to relaunch this at some point with that tasty fact attached. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the next time I do it "If you are looking for a strong job from a talented filmmaker, I recommend you get on board.
