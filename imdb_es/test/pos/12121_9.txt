Great movie about an American G.I. He leaves the army to marry a German girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. She accepts, but does she do it because she really likes him or because he can help her with easier access to food and so on? Meanwhile, his brother and an old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called Men Wolves, whose purpose is to scare away the occupants (you may remember that the same group plays an important role in the film Europa (Zentropa) by Lars von Trier) . James Best, best known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane on the 1980 television show The Dukes of Hazzard, is surprisingly excellent as the American. Should I have become a great movie star? At this age he reminds me a lot of Warren Beatty. The other main actors are also good. The direction of Fuller is quite good, using many long shots again (although they are not as complex as in Park Row, the long shots often consist of long scenes with much dialogue). The only problems are in the script, as seems to be the case with all the Fuller movies I've seen. It does not have too many flaws, but it should have been expanded, giving life to the main characters and parts of the script. Helga, the wife, goes through a major change, but completely off the screen. Therefore, the emotional center rests directly on Best's shoulders. Fuller should also have killed the sick mother at the beginning of the movie. I hope it does not sound too hard! She really does not do anything throughout the movie, except in bed. She has so few lines. But Fuller keeps mentioning it as the movie progresses. I would have had his death solidifying the relationship of David and Helga to myself. And the film ends too abruptly, and has no reward. These are not really the biggest defects in the world (the way I described them makes them look bigger than they are). 9/10.
