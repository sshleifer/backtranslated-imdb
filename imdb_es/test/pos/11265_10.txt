This performance leaves you without desires. We saw it in Offenbach, Germany, and it's impressive. We only got the cheap tickets in the back but we still had a view on everything that happened. If you ever have the chance to see this live, go! It's worth the trip and if it were you, I would wait half an hour after the show to 'cool down'. The performances are impressive and around the tent there are artists dressed in colors that distract, help, smile and generally make the whole tent come alive. Music - live music !! - It's as good as the CD version: perfect! I bought a DVD later, but the program that was filmed had less colorful costumes. It is the atmosphere in the store that drags you from your feet. A great trip for old and young, and a great movie, too
