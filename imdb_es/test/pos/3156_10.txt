USA UU The movie is like this: you take a nap on a hot Sunday afternoon. It feels good to close your eyes and let your worries fade away. Soon you will lose yourself in one of those intense lucid dreams in which you know you are dreaming but you still can not wake up, it is not what you want. Follow the flow and soon you will find yourself in a kind of strange story of Alice in Wonderland, with characters that you did not think you could imagine. They are telling you all kinds of crazy things about war and peace as they take you through a journey into the past and even into the future. <br /> <br /> The dream begins to get heavier and you feel that you are going down a path that you can not control. Maybe you want to wake up, so you try to open your eyes but you can not. Now there is destruction, sadness, confusion and terrifying voices that tell you what could be true or could be a lie. You are seeing images that flicker and change and then clear up, but do you even want to see what your brain is creating for you? <br /> <br /> You are finally lost in a world of myths and you realize that the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It's over. What do you wake up to? What will you do next? <br /> <br /> Maybe write that dream because you know that dreams do not happen very often, and when they do, it's better to pay attention. <br /> <br /> Or maybe break a beer and forget everything. Bad idea. Do not forget
