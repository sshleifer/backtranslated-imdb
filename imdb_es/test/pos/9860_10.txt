The Museum of the Moving Image here in New York recently presented a complete retrospective of Jacques Rivette's films. When I fell in love with his "Paris Nous Appartient", I decided that this should not be lost. <br /> <br /> Largely through extensive shots and scenes of flexible structure, the film shows two avant-garde theater companies preparing their performances. of "Eses against Thebes" and "Prometheus" of Aeschylus. In addition, we are shown the day-to-day life of two people connected distantly with the companies: a working-class woman named Frederique who finds creative ways to get men out of her money, and a young man named Colin who visits local caf√©s he pretends to be a deaf mute and plays a sharp harmonica to the customers until he is paid to leave. The first four hours or so are devoted to establishing the characters and their patterns, before a capricious and somewhat loose plot that involves a conspiracy and the decoding of clandestine secret letters. <br /> <br /> The film is about life. Beyond the pale. The theater companies are a desperate matter, they use their elaborate and emotionally exhausting exercises (which really are something to see) to distract themselves from the fact that their actions are unlikely to be realized or seen. Colin and Frederique have very few friends, who only briefly find any emotion or purpose after the conspiracy touches them, as they are encouraged to find out more about the subject. The film reflects on the consequences of rejecting normal society in several memorable sequences, including the possibility of Colin wandering the streets of France shouting poetry for himself. As such, the film has been referred to as an analysis of the counterculture of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is no frame of the film that is not full of energy and vitality. The fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. The camera also becomes an important character in this sense; Throughout the film, shadows are visible here and there, or other similar mistakes, however, they seem natural and fit with the flow of action because the camera is such an important player. <br /> <br /> More than anything For me, the movie seems like a great example of another way of making movies, a place for movies outside the usual pattern. For me it was an experience that opened my mind, even more than the "Paris Nous Appartient", although the latter has many similarities of theme and structure. A must for anyone who reflects on the nature of art.
