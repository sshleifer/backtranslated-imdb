Deputy James Hacker did not expect him to be the next prime minister. Unlike the United States, the party is elected in Great Britain, while we, the Americans, vote for candidates regardless of their party. Despite the differences, the performance of Paul Eddington CBE as minister became prime minister almost overnight is helped by his principal adviser, Sir Humphrey, played by another gentleman, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and veteran actor Derek Fowlds also returns to the scene. Now, instead of pleasing some people, you have to please the nation instead of pleasing your constituents. Now, he has a hard job to do even harder than before. Now, you must approve the honors list and work with Your Majesty also on a regular basis. Hacker is not the type of hacking. It is rather that each of the men we like and do not want us to dislike and become a kind of villain or a cruel dictator. Now, we see the prime minister's point of view and all the nice things to follow as well as how to handle the strikes.
