"Head" is one of those movies that you'll have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see, but once they do, they'll fall in love with it. I do not know how many times this has happened to me. This movie is so funny and weird, that it's really a deconstruction of everything the Monkees had done up to this point in their career. Much of the credit goes to Bob Rafelson, who practically ended Monkee's career with this movie. I suppose he wanted to stop directing the television program and take over, which he did largely after this. Micky Dolenz is absolutely hilarious. I can not believe I did not have a second life as a comic actor after this movie. This movie has many great cameos and many wonderful psychedelic nonsense. I feel that the reputation of this film continues to grow and I would not be surprised if it finally becomes a cult classic.
