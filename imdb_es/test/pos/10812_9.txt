Set in 1794, the second year of the French Republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, at its best) and Robespierre (an imposing performance by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his headquarters in the country where he has been since he was deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety the previous year by Robespierre. It opposes the "Reign of Terror", which has resulted in the execution of thousands of citizens, mainly guillotine, who are believed to oppose the Revolution. Danton relies on the support of the common people and tries to persuade Robespierre to stop the bleeding. But Robespierre and the Committee fear that Danton's popularity will lead them to be overthrown, and will prosecute Danton and his supporters for being traitors. This was the first film in French made by Andrzej Wajda after he arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was shut down by the government because of his support for the Solidarity union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His previous film "The Iron Man" (1981) dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski, and between Danton and Robespierre. Danton / Walesa is the voice of reason that opposes Robespierre / Jaruselski, who continues the dictatorial government despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play "The Danton Affair" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and in its premiere the film was criticized by some for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is concentrate on the behind-the-scenes meetings of the Committees and the scenes in the National Assembly and the audience hall instead of the activities on the streets of Paris.
