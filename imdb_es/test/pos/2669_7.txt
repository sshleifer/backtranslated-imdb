Frank Sinatra starred in this strange little film by RKO that is now in the public domain. The film came out almost at the same time the war ended and is a good request for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Sinatra on stage singing. After leaving the stage, he goes out into the alley and finds a group of children getting another for his religion. Instead of yelling at children (or helping them in that case), Sinatra offers a good civic lesson about religious tolerance and equates prejudice with fascism. The children seem to get the lesson but then, out of nowhere, Sinatra begins to sing a song that, frankly (do you understand?), The children would have hated. He had a lovely voice, but unfortunately I think this detracted from the excellent message he gave to children about tolerance. It is a case of a good message with too much singing, even if the guy who is singing is Frank Sinatra. It is also an interesting curiosity, a beautiful historical piece that is often overlooked ... besides being quite moving, even if it seems a little clumsy.
