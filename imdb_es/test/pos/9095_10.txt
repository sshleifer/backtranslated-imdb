Seriously, I had everything you could want in a movie, everything! Screw the scalawags who like Gone With The Winds and screw the fans of the Titanic even stronger. Tenacious reins, supreme, for ever and ever, amen. <br /> <br /> Climb my faithful steed. Then, let's ride, to smoke grass. Get on my big steed, and ride, ride, ride. <br /> <br /> What's the name of the song, Explosivo? I do not know what it is, but it's good to go. What is the name of my girlfriend, I do not know, but she is built like the best And she is good to go, go, she is good to go, she is good to go. <br /> <br /> We are fed by Satan, Yes, we are educated by Satan. Fed by Satan! Writing those tasty riffs as fast as we can. He was educated by Satan! <br /> <br /> We were the inventors of the cosmic astral code. We've come to blow you up, We've come to blow your nose. We have come to the damned blow, we have come to blow up the show. We have reached the damn blow, you know, you know! <br /> <br /> What's the name of the song, Explosivo? I do not know what it's about But it's good to guess, ah! <br /> <br /> I'm not one of you. I come from an ancient time. I am known as the elven kicker. I am also known as The Angel Crusher! <br /> <br /> Explosive.
