There are many things to please in this film, despite its humble adornments from a favorite PC tale about rape and the perpetrator who has always been better than the victim. The film created some suspense in the mystery that surrounded who sent the notes. (I, for one, was sure he was the teacher.) In fact, that would have been more likely in a plot because the idea of ​​my best friend's boyfriend came up out of nowhere, I guess the point of that is that "rape." It's ubiquitous, you never know who it's going to be. ") Ms. Beller is bright as always (however, see the KB discussion panel for my rating of this statement). Like all preacher movies, the plot lasts 15 minutes after the climax, so you may want to stop watching it at that time. Unless you're very curious to find out what happens to Phillip. Blythe Danner, like the mother, is in the role for which she was born: the worried and overprotective mother. Some good scenes from the 70s for fans of the 70s. (The dark bar that the father goes to get rid of is all the beams, barrels, oak and cork dyed dark). A must see for fans of Beller and highly recommended for fans of 70's high school melodrama or 70's kitsch in general.
