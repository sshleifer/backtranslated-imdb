I thought that this movie was excellent. Jon Foster is one of my favorite actors, he was perfect as Micheal Skakel. I discovered that everything was great, acting, costumes, production, direction, photography, script and music, etc. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Coming Up! You have been warned! <br /> <br /> Martha Moxley, who had been told, the story of the film was beaten to death by her violent neighbor Micheal Skakel. Micheal did this out of jealousy of his brother Tommy when Martha rejected him and took Tommy instead. However, fortunately, he was trapped years later and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Although, I think he should have been condemned to "natural life" without the possibility of parole. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast, the team and the filmmakers. Two thumbs up.
