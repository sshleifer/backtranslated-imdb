This movie is great ... without a doubt. I saw it a while ago, after relatives constantly bothered me in their science fiction movies (which I'm not), and I thought it was pretty good. But after watching some documentaries in outer space, etc., we saw it again ... and it's OK. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the best actors of all time and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, Blown Away, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. Yes, of course, you think ... but what if his story is so credible that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth? <br /> <br /> This is how the story evolves with Bridges going through all kinds of situations. of emotions related to Prot (as it is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from Prot, almost admit that he could be telling the truth!) A great movie ... that makes you think ... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
