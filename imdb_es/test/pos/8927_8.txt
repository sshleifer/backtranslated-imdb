I rented this movie with very few expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is extremely good. And one would never say that it was low budget. <br /> <br /> EIGHT, directed by the centers of 'Richard Bell' around an 18-year-old boy named Pip, played by the superb 'Paul Anthony' who leaves home due to the Circumstances surrounding the form in which his older brother died. He feels overcome by the guilt of this event and falls into the harsh life of a fugitive teenager with drugs and alcohol. On his 18th birthday, his father traces Pip down and hands him a tape left by his grandfather, which he would listen to on his 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> The way the whole movie is told It is with two simultaneous stories unfolding at the same time. Pip's current life and his grandfather's past life during WW11 that Pip listens to on tape. <br /> <br /> The three performances featured in this film are "Paul Anthony" as Pip and "Brenden Fletcher" as Jason, the young 18-year-old WW11 soldier, his grandfather. Wounded doctor WW11 'Macauley' played by 'Mark Hildreth' All in excellent performances. <br /> <br /> A couple of concerns and scenes that did not sit very well with me ... the priest, Father Chris, played for 'Alan Cumming', who is gay and in broad daylight pick up the local street vendor that the whole neighborhood knows, and then we have the local store clerk named Jeff, a love played by the handsome 'David Beaszely' he just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason he is attracted to the unattractive and ungracious street, Clerk, who sleeps with him.Almost anyone and in all likelihood is a toxic walking time bomb. he is not a very nice person. It does not sound true. <br /> <br /> The parts that I like the most are the flashbacks of the War. They were so well acted and very moving. There is a scene at the end where one soldier is dying and the other soldier, 'Jason' is there to comfort him and show him love while he is seriously injured and dying. This is such a wonderful and moving scene that left me crying. Beautifully acted. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It is one of love, redemption and the power of the human spirit to survive.
