For some reason, some programs simply fail ... some deservedly, others not ... Buddy Faro was a smart program with interesting characters and black humor that was nice to see ... Maybe it was never intended to be a huge success. but it had an "extravagance" that made it nice ... and with that said, it seems that it could have been the only one I was seeing ... Dennis Farina and Frank Whaley were perfectly chosen in their respective roles ... quality of production and writing They were great and Vegas was the perfect scenario ... I hope that the first and only season will be published on DVD, because I think it deserves some notoriety ... maybe at least on TV Land ... greetings
