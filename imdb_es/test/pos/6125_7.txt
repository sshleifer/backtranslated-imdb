Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with his son Crackers, his daughter Cotton and his mother Edie (Edie Massey). She competes with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Stole, David Lochary) to be named the dirtiest person in the world. The film shows their attempts to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. It's a face on your face with no assault assault in bad taste. Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while her sister watches; The marbles collect female hitchhikers, impregnate them, chain them in the basement and sell them to lesbian couples; The divine and the family have a party that includes cannibalism, etc. It's disgusting but, in a way, it can not be seen. It is so exaggerated and does not apologize for that, it is fascinating. As director John Waters would say, bad taste is well done. It's also fun to watch: the acting is so miserable (especially by Massey) that you simply look at it in disbelief. A friend laughed out loud about how bad Massey was (she improved in later photos). <br /> <br /> This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Although it is more than 30 years old, it is still impressive. However, if you have an open mind and can have a lot of extreme behavior, this is a must. The only part that really was too much is what Divine does in the end.
