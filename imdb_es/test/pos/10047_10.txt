I saw this movie at Christmas, and what a great movie it was! Tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his Westpoint graduation. Although I've heard that the movie is not very accurate from the historical point of view (Hollywood never is), I liked it anyway, since I knew little about real events. <br /> <br /> I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and since then he has become my favorite actor! His performance with Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the end was fantastic. It brought me to tears when he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) went off to death with the small big horn. <br /> <br /> I always knew that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor because he was the favorite actor of my parents, and I grew up watching his films as a child. But it was not until I saw this movie that I realized how great it really was. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 10 out of 10!
