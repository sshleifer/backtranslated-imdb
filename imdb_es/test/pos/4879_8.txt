For anyone who has problems with naughty, crazy or problematic children, this is an essential program to watch. It is only the best documentary program of behavior, not only for advice, but for the transformations. The very attractive Jo Frost is Supernanny, with fifteen years of experience in nanas, now has a program where she shows a family where children are behaving very badly. Frost is the nanny who does not let children win. Each episode has young children who are crazy and are very, very naughty, for example. throwing things, swearing constantly, beating relatives and parents and many other horrible experiences. But in each episode at the end of the show, children are transformed by parents (with Frost's help) from little monsters to adorable children. It's just wonderful when the transformations are successful, Jo Frost is an excellent Supernanny. He was nominated for the National Television Award for the most popular events program (twice). It was number 15 in The 100 Greatest Treats 2004. Very good!
