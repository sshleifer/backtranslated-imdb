I saw this series in 1999 on the television in London and I was impressed. As another user commented: this is what I would have liked to see the first time I saw "Jurassic Park": the life and death of dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. The CG is very realistic, and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educational. <br /> <br /> The series takes everything that is known about dinosaurs, adds many good ideas about "what could have been" to compose what later looks like a documentary series. What I missed was a small bar graph constantly in a corner of the screen, moving between "fiction" and "fact" along with the narration and images, because often you wonder how much is educated to guess and how much is pure fantasy . <br /> <br /> For some clues about facts and fiction, you have to see "Making Of" 50 minutes, which is not only very educational about the CG process and the compilation and inclusion of paleontologists' knowledge in the series. but what is also very funny (Dinosaurs smoking cigarettes and complaining about the CG animators). <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this series before entering the next Disney Dinosaur movie or going back to see any Jurassic Park movie. . It will surely make you much more critical of those movies. The Disney Trailers looked especially bad.
