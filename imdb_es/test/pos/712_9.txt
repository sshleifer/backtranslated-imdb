I really enjoyed this movie, I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why, I'm sure a shrink could do something with this). I spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago, and I knew then I would never go back, I got the individual version of "scared straight"! (I locked myself in an isolation cell in Alcatraz for a couple of hours, thanks to the park ranger, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre really interests me. The soundtrack, specifically "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones, was the perfect setting for the film. To this day, I think of "The Jericho Mile" every time I listen to the song.
