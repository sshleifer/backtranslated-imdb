Ocean's Twelve is probably better than Ocean's eleven. I know most people would not agree, but actually I liked it better. After three years, it was good to see the gang return. The reason behind the theft is a little more inspired the second time. I see why Benedict (Andy Garcia) was stolen in the last movie. This movie has a little more motivation the second time. The Ocean Twelve is more entertaining and cooler than Ocean's Eleven. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace saying "I just saw that new Dennis Quaid movie" and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best in the series. <br /> <br /> The plot: One year after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict (the guy they stole in the last movie) returns and says that if Ocean's Once does not return the money they stole, he will call to the police. So Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old girlfriend, the police, Isabelle. After she finds him again, she begins to follow them. In addition, the gang learns that it has an enemy who is also a thief who is a bit better than them. <br /> <br /> With many funny scenes like when Tess (Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a pretty smart movie. It's cooler, more fun and more entertaining than Ocean's eleven.
