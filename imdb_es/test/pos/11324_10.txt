I just wanted to say that when I was young my favorite TV show on the day was the heat of the night. I loved the characters and the plot of the show. I thought it was an excellent show and I still do it to this day. I enjoy watching the reps and I'm a big fan. I love the way the characters played with each other. I always stayed up late to watch my favorite show with my mother, who was also a big fan. Now I can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the topic. I think it was a great song for the program. My favorite characters were Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott. I enjoyed watching these handsome guys take down the bad guys.
