* SPOILER ALERT !! PLEASE, DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE MOVIE TO BE SPOKEN! * <br /> <br /> Originally, I was planning to watch this movie last weekend, but my plans ended up making me not have time to see that. So my friend and I made plans to see him after school today. Boy, we're glad we did it. The film begins in Italy, with a planned robbery with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], The Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], left ear [Mos Deaf] and John Bridger [Donald Sutherland] plan a robbery to steal 32 gold bricks, this leads to full opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a chase by boat, which opens the film on the right While driving away in his escape van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold and kills John Bridger, who is practically the leader (retired) of the group. a year later, where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the main safe cookies that anyone can ask for, Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for the death of his father, as he called him to his retirement for theft) says that h I have found Steve (who has hidden) and they want to answer him for what he did. At first, he refuses, but then he accepts, and the teams rejoin, along with obtaining the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect robbery, while creating one of the largest traffic jams. in the history of Los Angeles. This movie is a perfect blend of action with funny fragments thrown everywhere. There is a joke about the character of Seth Green, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while falling asleep, and finally Lyle will only respond if he is known as "Napster". There's even a funny phrase in Seth's movie, which says: "He said in an interview that he called him Napster because he described his hair, like it was a diaper, because he was dozing when he stole it!" The start and end sequences are pure genius, and everything that remains between them fits perfectly. The only negative thing that comes to mind with the movie is that Edward Norton's performance was a bit weak. He was not a bad guy, strong and bad. He acted as if they were paying him and simply doing the minimum (which is a fact, since he was forced to make this film due to a contractual obligation). But, even though the problem is the only real complaint with the movie, the movie is still very nice, and I definitely recommend watching it. And even if you're not interested in the real movie, go see Seth Green shine in the comic role. He is perfect. Rating: **** out of *****
