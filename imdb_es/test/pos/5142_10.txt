If you read Carl Hiaasen's book, the movie follows its rather real form, with some minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion this is a great family movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) steals the program from a stellar cast that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The children in the film do a great job led by Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> Brie Larson is perhaps too small to play Beatrice. I imagined a bigger girl, maybe 6 feet, 175 lbs, in the role of Beatrice. This could have made her more credible in her role of hitting Dana. They should have developed their "tough girl" character further, and bitten a tire or kicked a soccer ball through a person. It's very beautiful, and I understand why it was chosen, it's a box office attraction. <br /> <br /> This is about what the PG movie has these days, no sex and very little violence. This film is a dream for parents that comes true, a film with a strong environmental message, with children who deeply appreciate the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults have fallen short in the administration of our planet and that our children can demand something better. One of my favorite lines in the film is when Mullet Fingers says: "Florida could use some mountains like Montana, Florida is so flat that there is nothing that prevents developers from cleaning it from coast to coast". In addition, Florida wildlife photography spoke volumes without dialogue. As a family movie with children from 5 to 15 years old, this is a great movie! As a bonus, parents will be entertained, especially if they are "parrotheads".
