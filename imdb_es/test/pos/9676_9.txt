Family Guy is the best television show. FOREVER. He has achieved great things that no other animated comedy, nor any other program, has even come close to achieving. <br /> <br /> In terms of animated comedies, this era should be called "The era of animated comedies". because there are many of them, and almost all of them are imaginable being released on DVD. There are some good ones (that is, South Park, Futurama and The Simpsons). Each animated comedy has its own style / technique of creating humor. For example, Futurama is fun because it always comments or acts on what has just happened with a touch of humor. The Simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same technique and comedy style as Futurama, but the Simpsons deserve the merit, since it was in the air before Futurama and still remains in the air using the technique. In my opinion, South Park is the funniest show by Family Guy, because it uses a clever mixture of vulgarity and stupidity as a humor creation technique. <br /> <br /> But enough about other animated shows. Let me tell you what makes Family Guy so fun. Family Guy uses a comic style that no other program has used before. Use a technique to make flashbacks happen after each joke. This not only reinforces the joke, it makes it more fun. It also moves at a very fast pace. These two criteria make it the most entertaining program on television. You have to see the program to believe it, but once you see it, you will most likely agree. (For your information, the two funniest moments in Family Guy were: 1) The 5 minute chicken fight in "Da Boom", and 2) The Dick van Dyke parody in "Holy Crap". Also, in my mind, Family Guy is a very modest program because while other programs create humor by becoming familiar with their shticks / routines and characters, most of the Family Guy jokes are based on the stupidity of current events and culture. pop. This also shows that Family Guy is smart, as well as being modest, because it reveals that the show has a vision. And this technique is extremely effective because they relate the references of their pop culture to the particular plot of the episode in which they find themselves. <br /> <br /> The Family Guy can be enjoyed by all ages, because while younger children do not understand the pop culture References, they will have fun with the funny and stupid antics of the characters, especially Peter. However, the show is a little more vulgar than The Simpsons and Futurama, but it is less vulgar than South Park. So, in terms of vulgarity, Family Guy would be somewhere in the middle when it was associated with previous programs, but it would be number 1 in terms of humor and intelligence! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was canceled for the last time year, not because it was not popular, but because FOX kept changing its time slot, so nobody knew when it was on. Fortunately, we have the DVD sets (which, by the way, are selling like crazy) and the Cartoon Network Adult Network Swim replays are available to us.
