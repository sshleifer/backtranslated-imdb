Are we allowed to interfere with the daily life of our fellow human beings? Is it possible to meddle in your privacy, penetrate the inside of your thoughts, violating the privacy of your own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions, almost sympathetic to the destabilizing decision of Judge Jean Luis to accept his own isolated isolation through fragments of lives misused by him. <br /> <br /> "Trois couleurs: Rouge" is based on the concept of "UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW IN THE WORLD". The phone can be considered as the main character of the story: after its presentation in "Dekalog 9", at the beginning it gives the encore to the spectators of Kieslowski, followed step by step in its quick tour around the world. The director deepens in the faculty of communication of human beings, without occupying a definitive position on the ethical side of individual behavior. Once again, he points out the unpredictability of future events, expressing careful descriptions of strange courses and life resources separated from one another for a considerable number of years. Unexplained combinations strangely convergent in a series of continuous and annoying situations. - Some books falling to the pavement. - One of them casually opens on a fatal page, predetermining the fate of a future profession, as in a similar past. - Flashes of everyday life that meet fleetingly, ideally united by their fondness for the fictional musician Van den Budermayer. - Human luck is marked by the most unfortunate coincidence. <br /> <br /> In this work that deserves to be seen with the eyes of our heart instead of those of our mind, we can witness a dialectical game between Judge Jean Louis' (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut ( Irene Jacob, perhaps the sweetest actress of our time, along with the beautiful Winona Ryder), in a generational conflict between the experience of an old man tired of the world and the conscious immaturity of a cute girl about to face the steepest path of your ascending path. Kieslowski talks about "dialogue tests" between a disappointed human life and a young man unaware of his future, between a misanthrope without spirit and a spontaneous girl full of good sense of selfishness. <br /> <br /> And the final parade when the humidity The smell of tragedy still remains in the air, with all the main characters of the whole trilogy in evidence, saved by an accidental stroke of luck thanks to the providential script written intelligently, he gives us the extreme greetings of this master of the film completely exhausted by His great passion for cinema. There remains only a feeling of bitter regret and emptiness to remind us of the existence of a void impossible to fill. GOOD BYE KRZYSZTOF. WE MISS YOU A LOT!
