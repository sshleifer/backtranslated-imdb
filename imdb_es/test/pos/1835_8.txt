This movie is so cool. He told me to enjoy every moment of life to its fullest. I think Bonnie Hunt (Jerry Maguire) writes well and I'm very happy that I gave the older actors the opportunity to have such important roles in the film. That's really great, in a society that loves wealth, health and youth, it was nice to see a movie about normal people. The movie reminded me a lot of "While you were sleeping", which I really love. If you do not like this movie, you should work on your sensitivity skills. <br /> <br /> Favorite phrases: Megan Dayton: "I'm just saying, for safety, do not shave your legs, because then you definitely will not let it go too far". Grace Briggs: "Megan, it's a first date." Megan Dayton: "I got married on a first date, I'm sure you plan to be sensible, but once you're in the moment, the male brain seems, I do not know, everything they say suddenly seems bright. only link with reality ". Favorite scenes: Megan (Good Will Hunting) riding his bicycle. All the scenes in the garden. The conversation and the camaraderie between the grandfather and the friends in the restaurant. Please, do not miss this movie, it will warm your heart!
