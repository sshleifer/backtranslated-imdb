This is a quirky robbery / adventure movie that seems predictable at first, but continues to surprise every last scene. The protagonist is a grifter who goes to work in a small carnival, where he is paid to kill the dancer of the belly dance, the wife of Divana, and then ends up falling in love with her. It is seductive, deceitful and deadly, and it keeps disappearing and appearing again as a kind of magician trick. The other props of the film include his duplicate husband / employer (played by the talented Armand Assante), some evil Dominican mobsters and, most importantly, the plot, a suitcase full of money. As in the old "shell game", in which you have to guess what the pea is, you will guess who has the money, and like the victims of the hucksters who handle such games, you will probably guess wrong. . Dagma Dominczyk, like the charming Divana, is a talented and attentive artist, whether she is dancing with the huge serpent on her shoulders or working to grift on all the unfortunate men in her orbit. Norman Reedus is fine as the young con man who is baffled by the elusive beauty he was paid to kill. However, do not exclude him, as he turns out to be smarter than anyone gave him credit for. This strange movie is worth seeing.
