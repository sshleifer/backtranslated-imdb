Is it a murder mystery? Is it a police procedure? Is it a background look in shabby French music halls? Quai des Orfevres is all this, but more than anything else it is a funny comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, set in Paris after the Second World War. It may be surprising that Henri-Georges Clouzot, the director of such grim films as Le Corbeau, or others who have suspense as Diabolique and The Wages of Fear, is the director of this. Clouzot, however, was a shrewd filmmaker. "In a murder mystery," he tells us, "there is an element of play." It is never totally realistic. In this I share the opinion of Hitchcock, who says: "A murder mystery is a slice of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you deny yourself, you could also shoot a documentary." "Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful movie, and it is not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer in music halls and dinner clubs She is a coquette, she sees nothing from bad to use a bit of sex and talent to get a contract.Her artistic name is Jenny Latour.And she really loves her husband, Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier) .Martineau is something like a sad sack. He is a little bald, a little plump and jealous of Then we have his neighbor, the photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant), blond, beautiful (think of Rita Hayworth) and capable, she and Martineau have been friends since They were girls together Dora, however, is definitely not thinking only of friendship when she looks at Jenny, then comes George, Brignon (Charles Dullin), a rich, rich and dirty old man, who often makes Dora take pictures of "art "of his young proteges, to whom he poses, he offers a contract or for a movie to Jenny, and suggests a dinner at her house to discuss the details. Jenny is more than willing. Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny yells back: "You're jealous of the rich! Well, I want my share of your dough, I'm in favor of royalty!" "Your father was a worker," replies Maurice. "So what? Under Louis XV, it would have been Madame de Pompadour! I would have warmed up the tights!" <br /> <br /> And after Brignon is found dead with a bottle of broken champagne next to his bleeding skull, Dora tries to make things safe for Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine takes charge of the case. Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired and middle-aged single with pain in the feet. He has seen everything. He served in "the colonies" with the foreign Legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria. The boy is now about eight years old and Antoine adores him. One of the first things that Antoine discovers is that not only someone with Brignon's brain with a bottle, someone shot him in the heart. Who did it? In a short time, Jenny, Maurice and Dora are inventing alibis, lying and, at one point or another, confessing. How will Antoine discover the murderer? Will we have the chance to see some great music hall songs sung by Jenny Latour? Everything becomes clear, but only with the time and persistence of Detective Antoine. We are left with many types of love that lead to all sorts of reasons, from hair-trigger jealousies to anxious looks ... and we all play with a good mix of Galician fun. <br /> <br /> Clouzot takes us to a Paris of sordid but non-threatening neighborhoods, to oppressed music publishers where melodies are played on the piano for shoppers, to restaurants with discreet private dining rooms. More than anything, it takes us to the music room where Jenny Latour shows up often. We can see Jenny singing, with couples in the seats and single men wearing their coats and hats in the standing room. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film, in fact, takes place largely in this environment. With Jenny singing about "Her little tra-la-la, her sweet tra-la-la", we followed her since we tried the song in the editors until an essay for a presentation with Jenny with a feather hat, a corset. Embroidered stockings and not much else. <br /> <br /> Delair, Blier and Renant do wonderful jobs, but it's Louis Jouvet who keeps everything together. He was a wonderful actor who did not like making movies. The scenario was his world, and he devoted himself to films only if he liked the director and earned money to finance his work on stage. Jouvet was tall, with a long face and wide cheekbones. He was not conventionally handsome, but he had what it took to master a scene. To see how skillfully you could play comedy, watch it in Drole de Drame. He is a fascinating actor. At one point he says: "I liked it a lot, Miss Dora Monnier." "I?" she asks. "Yes, because you and I are two equal, when it comes to women, we will never have an opportunity." Jouvet brings all kinds of nuances to that line, from repentant repentance to gentle amusement.
