Good drama / comedy, with two good performances by Hunter & Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals all the scenes in which he finds himself. With a great script, this film rises and gives everyone the opportunity to show their talent as an actor. And although Joan Cusack is not in this, but has one, if not the funniest scene in the movie. The highlight of the film for me was Albert Brooks' speech about the devil. Only one disadvantage is the fact that it goes a little slow in some places. And I was only totally interested in the role of Brooks, not so much in Hunter's as in Hurt's. I give this a 7 out of 10.
