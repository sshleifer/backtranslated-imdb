One of the many Scooby Doo cartoon films, "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, fun and also makes an amazing interpretation of the Scottish Highlands. An annoying aspect of the film are the voices of many of the characters: the Americans who try to look Scottish in this film unfortunately are not having as much success (although some people have better Scottish accents than others). <br /> <br /> Daphne has come to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland games at Blake Castle. Seriously Shannon tells the gang that she believes she has seen the Loch Ness monster. When there is even more chaos, Mystery Inc Gang has another mystery in its hands ... <br /> <br /> Good for Scooby Doo fans and for people who want to know more about Scotland! Enjoy "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness monster"! :-)
