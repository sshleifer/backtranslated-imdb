Like the 5-year-old protagonists of his latest work, Hayao Miyazaki's "Ponyo" captivates with his unbridled innocence as if the anime-meister had become a child in weaving a narrative that delights in its simplicity and emits a Contagious charm in the process. Miyazaki, recalling his earlier work, paints a world of bright colors, obviously aimed at younger audiences, and the raw effervescence blithely strips away the somber thematic elements that distinguish his immediate predecessors. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (kindly expressed by Yuria Nara), a fish with a girlish face (which makes her look like a mimosa girl in a pink Halloween costume), escapes from her underwater home and from her school of brothers to explore the surface. Forsaken, she is rescued by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year-old boy who, along with his mother Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi), resides in a house on the nearby cliff. This initial encounter and, eventually, friendship, has a profound effect on Ponyo, who now wishes to become human, but by inadvertently turning the balance of nature and unleashes a whirlpool on the ground. With the help of Sosuke, Ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and become completely human. <br /> <br /> Despite the plot that lacks the philosophical sophistication of, for example, his most recent "Spirited Away", "Ponyo" is Nothing short of an astonishing follow-up, characterized by diligent attention to the details and the masterful balance of the real and the fantastic, and of the simple joys and great fears. It is a direct story that, although it sometimes stops due to its tendency to wander like a small child, it stays in tune with its juvenile pedigree to magically captivate. "I will protect you," Sosuke tells Ponyo earnestly, a childlike statement not unlike the way Miyazaki endows his story with an ingenious spirit.
