This movie is almost never seen today, the only reason I can enjoy it over and over again is from a slightly worn VHS copy that I made when the movie aired on television in 1991 here in England. <br /> <br /> A The ensemble cast is obviously having fun and this is reflected to the viewer. A sharp script helps in things, and once you've seen it, you'll want to see it again and again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Rogers is the 'star' but everyone contributes to a great movie, with a great jazz soundtrack to boot. There are emotional moments during the film, but never to the point of sweet and sickly sentimentality: these are men in the journey of their lives, and they convey that emotion beautifully. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you can really get to see it.
