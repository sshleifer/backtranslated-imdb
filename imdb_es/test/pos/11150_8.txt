I'm really surprised that this movie only has a 6.4 rating from the time I did this review. While it's not exactly a great movie, I think it's one of Dietrich's best films and it's a shame it is not more considered. I think a lot of the reason I liked the movie is that Dietrich's usual dumb person like "über-vamp" is not present and his role required her to really act. I just hate to see film after film after film in the first days of his career, where he seemed more like a caricature or a cliché than a real woman. I do not necessarily blame Dietrich for the stupid vampire movies he made in the 1930s: they loved the public and made it famous. But here, she showed that she could really act. After all, just by looking at her in films like MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and EL ANGEL AZUL, they would have guessed that she was a well-interpreted woman to play a gypsy! I was quite prepared to hate the movie because of this casting decision, but it worked: she was quite believable and very funny to watch too! The film is, essentially, a vehicle only for Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich; the other secondary characters are very secondary to the movie. Milland is a wanted spy in pre-World War II Germany and in his efforts to escape, he runs into a lonely and rather playful gypsy (Dietrich) who instantly leads him to fulfill the prophecy; in other words, his new lover! Milland is quite congested, but reluctantly agrees to travel in his car, even putting on body paint and piercing his ears to make him look like a gypsy (hence the title of the film). Over time, little by little he begins to realize that beneath his very rough exterior he is a woman and romance flourishes slowly. <br /> <br /> The movie in one word is "lovely". A good romance with a good dose of comedy and fun, just the kind of image you would like Hollywood to still do. Also, consider Murvyn Vye's performance as "Zoltan". It was very magnetic in the short time he was in the movie and I loved his deep and beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Finally, a sad note to consider. Although the film is set in Germany, there is no mention of the next Gypsy Holocaust. During the war, throughout the German territory, the Nazis exterminated a large percentage of gypsies and, therefore, the pleasant ending of the film is a little exaggerated.
