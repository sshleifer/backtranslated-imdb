A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: the nature of the images and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should really be seen in the film, projected. The pixilation created by the digital transfers absorbs a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to the already abstract and grainy film. However, since this movie is not available in any format, I guess you'll have to make do with what you can. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this excellent artistic endeavor is courtesy of the kind that eventually Danos Shadow of the vampire. It is a dark and dirty film of the genesis of the elements (as far as I can deduce from the names of the characters) through a horrible and surreal process. Begotten is a very good example of what is known as abject art, a stylistic approach that seeks meaning through the visceral rather than the thematic. <br /> <br /> And it describes it viscerally. Technically, not many things happen in the movie, but the levels of emotion that will cross you are innumerable. The same repetitiveness of some of the images creates a fascinating capture about the senses. The sound editing and the particular score are immaculate, and they serve the images incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Fans of this movie would do well to review the short film collections released through Other Cinema DVD, Experiments in Terror I, II and III. Films like these make me more and more sure that the realm of true horror resides in the abstract, the abject and the non-narrative, more than in the tales of ghosts and ax killers. <br /> <br /> PolarisDiB
