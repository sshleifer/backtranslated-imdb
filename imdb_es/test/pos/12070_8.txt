This is not a BIG movie, since the cast (especially the children) helps in an admirable way to carry out this very sad but artificial plot, it is full of cliché on cliché. Poor family in the middle of the America of the 50, dying mother, alcoholic father, 10 children (1 of which has epilepsy) and a terrible decision to make. It is very easy to see and some of the children's performances move without being sick or disgusting. And little Frank and Warrnen stole my show with the last scene, letting me cry no matter how many times I see it. A great afternoon of rain that I recommend to all. Only those with the hardest hearts can not be moved by it. Not on par with the choice of Sophies, but a good equivalent TV movie !!!
