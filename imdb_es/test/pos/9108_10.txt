Probably the best comedy in a long time. It keeps you laughing without stopping! The acting is good and there are a lot of funny cameos like Ben Stiller as the guy from the guitar shop. The plot was not as good as I expected, but the comedy makes up for it. I can only wait for a sequel because it seems that they can still do much more. Although it lasted 1 hour and 40 minutes, I still wanted more at the end :) There is also a scene after the credits that is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie! I suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and I definitely recommend it to fans of The D or Jack Black. You should also buy the album, the songs are very catchy and fun, the music on it is also Top Notch.
