This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro is working in an animation studio, which is quite interesting if you do not know anything about the way anime studies were conducted. In addition to episode 3, this was probably the least daring, but had a great interest in girls, as well as a surprise meeting of others in previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is that it seemed a little too short, but at the same time this may have been just because it was the only original script for the show that was not based on one of the manga chapters. but it ended well, leaving us with the pleasant feeling that Kentaro is 25 years old and still studying. You can definitely see the rest of the series until the end, you can buy the whole series for approximately $ 17, you can watch it in about 2 1/2 hours or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes of free time. (What I do if I have a lunch at school). Good series, take a look.
