Having seen this movie for years, it never faded from my memory. I always thought that this was the best performance of Michelle Pfeiffer I've seen. But I'm surprised at the amount of negative reviews that this film has received. After seeing it one more time today, I still think it is powerful, moving and that I could not care less if it is "based loosely on King Lear". <br /> <br /> Now I realize that this is the best performance of Jessica Lange I've seen, and has received praise for much more superficial efforts. <br /> <br /> A Thousand Acres is complex, humane, vibrant and immensely moving, but surely it does not present any of the main The woman leads with any touch of glamor or "sensuality". I do not believe that this is well received in these times. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the reasons for the disappointing response of this film lies in the fact that the writer (Jane Smiley (, script (Laura Jones)), and the director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women I know that, in my youth, I would not have read a book written by a woman, I did not focus on this fact until years later. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie or given it a chance in the past , try to see her again, maybe you're ready for it.
