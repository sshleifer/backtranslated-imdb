I do not know if this movie hits my heart like it does because of feelings of friendship, love, closeness to others or the warmth of the transformation that Babette's kitchen creates, but when the party starts and for the rest of the movie, I choke often. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a movie to feel good, but without a hint of malice or easy sentimentality. Keep in mind that the elements of the plot are discussed. The Babette Festival tells its story with moderation and care, and allows us to discover for ourselves the values ​​of grace and love. All we need to know is that Babette Harsant (Stephane Audran) was a French refugee who was sheltered by two elderly sisters in a small community on the coast of Jutland. The sisters lead what remains of their father's flock. He was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes through self-denial. The sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith. Those who still remain honor the teachings of the long-dead pastor and his spiritual guidance. However, as they grew, the small community became questioning and argumentative. The sisters do what they can. For the pastor's 100th birthday, Babette wishes to prepare dinner for the small group the sisters will invite. The sisters reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies that Babette has ordered, they and their guests feel uncomfortable. They are accustomed to the community's usual meal of dry cod, boiled and a soup made of bread, water and a little beer. Even though Babette has made improvements over time, what they are seeing now seems to be close to impiety. At dinner there will also be a visitor, General Lorens Lowenhielm, who years before had chosen the ambition about his love for one of the sisters. <br /> <br /> What do we experience? There is the austerity of the faith of the aging community and the stone houses swept by the wind in which they live. There is warmth in the candlelight of the small and crowded dining room of the sisters. And then there is the transforming power of Babette's art as we watch her cook, we see Erik, a child helping her, serving and serving her, and we watch the old parishioners, with the help of a good wine and an exquisite cuisine, gradually rediscovering their community and love and friendship. The General is our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating. The general tells a story to his dinner companions without understanding, a story about a famous woman who was the exemplary chef at the famous Café Anglais in Paris. "... this woman, this chef, had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of amorous adventure ... a love relationship that did not distinguish between body appetite and spiritual appetite". He is also becoming a man who will accept what he has become, and yet he will always know the value and love of what he decided not to accept long ago. An old couple kiss. Two old men remember past friendships. And Babette, who spent everything she had won in a lottery at this dinner, had the opportunity to be the artist who once was in France, an opportunity that she accepted with love and friendship. <br /> <br /> Babette, now as poor as she was when she arrived penniless years ago, will continue with the sisters. The general in a carriage with his aunt returns to his farm. And older guests leave the sisters' house to return to their country homes. They stop and look at the clear night sky and the stars above. They spontaneously shake hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn ... <br /> <br /> "The clock plays and time passes, eternity is near, let us take this time to try to serve the Lord with heart and heart, mind, so that our true home we find it, so that our true home we find it ". <br /> <br /> They smile at each other. Everything has been reconciled. <br /> <br /> The Babette Party is a wonderful movie, full of contained emotion, tacit understandings, wisdom ... and, of course, a meal that will leave you with a snarling stomach when leaving the theater. If she wins a lottery to pay for what Babette created and has her skill and art, this is what she served: <br /> <br /> Potage a la Tortue (a rich turtle soup), served with sherry amontillado Blinis Demidoff au Caviar (small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar), served with Veuve Clicquot champagne Cailles in Sarcophage with Perigourdine sauce (boneless quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with Madeira), served with Clos de Vougeot, a fine Burgundy Salade cheese and fresh fruit Baba au Rhum with glacee fruit and fresh figs Coffee and a good brandy
