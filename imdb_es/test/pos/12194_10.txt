I have seen this movie many times and I still do not get tired. It's like a damn drug. I know that many people do not like it, but there is something that attracts me. All the performances are spectacular, but Aaliyah is the one who steals the show. She not only played the role of Akasha, she became him. The movement of her body and her beauty were captured exceptionally well. It is also good to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an Egyptian queen (No, I am not a prejudice against whites, I am one). It is true that we do not know what color the ancient Egyptians really were, but it was a pleasant change. Stuart Townsend made me completely forget about Tom Cruise's portrait of Lestat and Marguerite was amazing once again. In general, it was a good time in the cinema. For those who have not seen it, be sure to see it with an open mind and not take it too seriously. I mean, it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star. Take it like that.
