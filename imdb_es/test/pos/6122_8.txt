For me, Pink Flamingos lived up to its reputation as the shocking, disgusting, repulsive, and shoddy movie I expected, which really contains everything but the kitchen sink. We are treated almost two hours of evil that never ceases: rape, sex, sex with chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism and a horrible display of singing the annals. This is a strange couple who starts a competition with a trailer trash family, trying to steal his title as the "dirtiest people in the world". Divine (a fat man in friction) is an incredibly vile being, which actually becomes painful to watch. Trust me when I say that this movie is not forgotten quickly, especially the final scene in which Divine eats the dog shit from the sidewalk. I have always thought that John Waters was overrated and I can not say that I like this movie, but it is an experience if you ever have the chance to see it.
