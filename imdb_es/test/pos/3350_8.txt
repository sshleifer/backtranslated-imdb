What can you say? This is hardcore without cuts, musical Alice! It also works with a large and energetic cast that seems to enjoy to the fullest and, although you might want a remastered version, I think we're lucky to have this video transfer. Quite a delight in everything. There are a couple of mild moments, but this could have been embarrassing and it is not. It could also have been and today it would have been too much camp. No, a very good effort that is fun, silly and sexy enough. The good performances, particularly that of Kristine DeBell at the helm, was a Richard Prior uncredited as the prone Knight who rides energetically (albeit with discretion)?
