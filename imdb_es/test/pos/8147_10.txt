Honestly, at first, I saw this movie because of the free sex scenes I heard, but when I saw the movie, I realized that there are still good and sensible movies. In truth, it is one of the most elaborate and moving films I've seen in my life. I am a bisexual teenager and the film told me about my problems: sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. It gave me an idea of ​​how to deal with these problems with the help of myself and other people around me. I for whom I am Cox really handled the film well by spreading dozens of touching lines and a bit of sexuality. He made the movie more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain, but I do not agree. Brokeback Mountain has more drama, while Latter Days is well balanced.
