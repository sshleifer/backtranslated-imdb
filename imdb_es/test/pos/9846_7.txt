The great James Cagney, of first category in large letters, does not appear until the second third of the film, and probably has less time on the screen than Dudley Digges, who interprets the reform potential of the school. But when Jimmy arrives, as deputy commissioner of something or other to reform the schools, he cuts the air with his hands and jumps on his feet and spits out the aggressive dialogue of Warners-First National with all the usual, and expected, panache. Psychology in this crusty antiquity, one of Warner's many efforts to affirm his place as "socially conscious" study, is not profound: Digges is bad just because the script requires it to be, and there is the strange notion that the juvenile delinquents will become large children if given a little autonomy. But it is made with that spare and fast style in which the studio specialized, and never bores. Frankie Darro, who got into all sorts of problems on the screen for a brief period of time like Warner's favorite Rotten Street Kid, is an ideal JD: a handsome and handsome charismatic with a pug nose and a look full of hate that It could weaken the steel. No child actor today can touch it.
