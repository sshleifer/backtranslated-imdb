This is a case where the script plays with the audience in a way that only serves to extend this story to 90 minutes. The story begins in 1969, when a young woman named Faith (Cameron Diaz) travels to Europe with her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Eccleston), but she dies in mysterious circumstances. Then, in 1976, Faith's sister, Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) decides to travel to Europe and try to find out what happened to her sister. In France she looks for Wolf, who has stayed there and wants him to help her follow the steps her sister took and answer some questions. He is reluctant but decides to travel with her. On the way, it fills the gaps of events and tells Phoebe that Faith had joined the Red Army, which is an extremist group involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf get involved in a romance and this complicates the trip to Portugal, where Faith died. There are several things that are wrong with this movie and everything has to do with the script. First, the romance between Wolf and Phoebe is wrong and does nothing for the story. It sounds completely false and appears as forced. It seems strange that Wolf got involved in an affair with the sister of his dead girlfriend. Secondly, Wolf knows completely what happened to Faith, but only lets out small pieces of information every 15 minutes or so. Wolf will look at Phoebe every 15 minutes and say, "There's something I did not tell you." Wow, thank you Wolf! If Wolf had left clean the first time he spoke with Phoebe, the movie would have finished in about 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me was that I do not think this movie recreated the 60s at all. DÃ­az wears hippie clothes, but the time period just did not come true. I enjoyed some things like the authentic places where the movie was filmed. It is a very good looking film and the landscape is beautiful. The performances are all good especially for Brewster and Diaz. Besides "The Fast and the Furious" he had never really seen Brewster in anything. But after seeing his performance in this movie I was very impressed. She is very good here and I hope that better papers arrive. The script is told in a very artificial way and the movie is never credible.
