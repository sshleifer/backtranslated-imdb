For the record, I'm a Curly fan through and through. But I have to say that actually, Shemp was not really that bad. Yes, he might have missed the same kind of slap as Curly, but in his way it was very funny. At least it was not as bad as Joe Besser. <br /> <br /> At BRIDELESS GROOM, Shemp plays a music teacher (Stooge? a teacher? Yes, of course), who recently inherited half a million dollars from a dead uncle. , and Moe and Larry have to prepare him to marry a woman at six o'clock that night, or no money. <br /> <br /> This was one of the first sketch of Stooges with Shemp, before they started to recycle their material. It might not be surprising that Shemp was part of the Stooges before Curly came on the scene, so it seemed natural in this. The slapstick gags are hilarious, especially this scene with Moe and Shemp in a phone booth. Essential Stooge short to be honest.
