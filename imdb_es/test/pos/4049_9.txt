This is a remake of the anime classic of the 80s, and this is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna and Priss are back as Knight Sabers in their hard suits fighting the robotic boomers. The animation is sharp, the characters are well developed and the action is great. Priss is a singer in her usual work, so the series also presents some wonderful songs. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against the robots, and there is some service for the fans, but nothing too cruel. DVDs also have many extras, including comments, that really improve their understanding and enjoyment of the show. A must-have for any anime fan. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III
