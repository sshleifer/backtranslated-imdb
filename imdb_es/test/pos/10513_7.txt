When you read about this movie you want to tremble. I have seen it countless times and yet I shudder! So, what is the attraction here? I think for me, it's the extravagance of romance. It seems super refreshing to have a strange combination between this columnist like Jimmy Breslin of New York City and a dancer bad luck (health). You feel embarrassed by Paul Sorvino for his subtle approach to attract this woman. Like the guy at the bar who can not give a clue. She's a little overweight (at least as a possible suitor for a dancer, I hope that does not sound unpleasant) and possibly a little too old for her. Good change of rhythm of the Greek God who courts the Super-model. Bill Conti's score has stayed in my head all these years later, which is a good sign. However, part of the performance is simply terrible. A secondary plot that involves a young Puerto Rican friend of Sorvino's character is hilariously bad. But the initial scene in which Ditchburn is warming up with Carole King draws you directly into this story. Good luck finding it. You would think that Lifetime would be retransmitting this or even US, but I have not seen it in many years.
