It bothered me that the award for the best makeup academy went to Dick Tracy, a horrible movie with a horrible makeup. The Nightbreed (based on the best novel titled "Cabal") looks great, the acting is excellent and David Chroneburg becomes a truly spooky and terrifying antagonist. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on Aaron Boone, who has recurrences. Nightmares about a society of monsters that live under a cemetery. Are you inventing it or are they real and are you calling it? His psychologist (Chroneburg) convinces him that he is a murderer, a murderer of families. <br /> <br /> Concerned and suicidal, Boone seeks refuge in Midian, but the monsters do not want it at first. He is also tracked down by his girlfriend, Lori, who refuses to give him up even after he dies and returns cold and monstrous. <br /> <br /> But Decker is not willing to let Boone continue. Raise the locals in a total assault on Midian, as a holy war in the name of the gods led by the devil. <br /> <br /> The themes of the misunderstood monsters barkers may come from their experiences as a homosexual man, but they are always strong and honest. Nightbreed turns gender into its head. The monsters are just trying to survive and they want to be left alone, but the man is hunting them. <br /> <br /> Originally, a cut over 20 minutes was presented by Barker, but the studio divided it into this fractured masterpiece. Barker is working hard trying to locate the missing images for a directors release. Until then, this version will have to do.
