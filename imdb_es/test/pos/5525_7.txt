The title does not refer to a questionable poker hand, but to six comic book players. They come in pairs: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland as a couple traveling to California for a second honeymoon, George Burns and Gracie Allen as another couple who attends to share expenses, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth as sheriff and owner of a hotel in a small town in Nevada. No attempt is made to create a coherent narrative, it is a collection of comic bits that come together. All the first couple wants to do is spend time together, but the characters of Burns and Allen are not married, so the men play together, as do the women. There is a bit of a plot: a bad guy plants $ 50k in the suitcase that Pinky (Ruggles) is taking out of the city, but because the expedition is being guided by Gracie, the loot can not be found. The bad boy appears in Nevada and Fields accidentally catches him. A handful of nice fragments, the confused expression of Ruggles, the crazy Gracie, the boring talk and Fields playing pool with a touch of corkscrew and doing a fluttery, craven, retreating by leaps and bounds when threatened, and his wonderfully distinctive way to stop words. And trying to remember the name "Gracie," he says to Skipworth, "Hmm, start with a K ... McGonigle." She responds: "Oh no, no, no, no ..." "Mmmm, Wangahanky!" "No, no, no, no, no, oh, Gracie." "Yes, that is correct".
