I am having so much fun reading the comments of the users as watching the movie! It seems that this is the classic either "Love it" or "Hate it". And I have to say that not only am I on the "I love" side, but I risk saying that this is my favorite movie, NEVER! Thank God I found it in the first place. Almost IMPOSSIBLE to find it, I was lucky enough to record it on a UHF nightly channel about ten years ago. Of course, my love for Sellers can make me a bit biased, but I can not see how someone with a great sense of humor (like me) can not be in love with this movie. The plot is great (but maybe as a previous poster said, maybe the reason why it's not a well-known movie ... bother the medical field?) The performance is excellent (I can see why some may say that the acting was horrible ... But that's what made this movie so great ... it's total insensitivity and the humor is unbearable, I'm proud to say that I've seen this movie no less than 20 times and that I have almost all memorized lines, this movie is great!
