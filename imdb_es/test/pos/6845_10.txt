What's wrong with you? John Dahl? From "Rounders" and "Unforgettable"? Too weird to hit Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman for having fun playing against the guy? And did someone like Gingerbread Man? <br /> <br /> I rented it without knowing anything about it and I found it as ingenious as a video you can find. Never insulting, well thought out, funny, scary. I do not agree with the detractors, clearly. I thought that the story itself was not anything special, but the great cast, which probably means that the director was paying attention, elevated it to a super cool state. Good sound design too (much more appreciated in surround sound, but I'm not boasting). And yes, I'm a girl, so maybe I have a slight feminine inclination (the guys in the gang are worth it). In short, a 9 and a good RECOMMEND.
