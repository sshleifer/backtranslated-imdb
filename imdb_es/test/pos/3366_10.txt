There is nothing left undone about this masterpiece by Perry and Croft, as good as any of the best episodes, fortunately, it was still filmed in time before James Beck died sadly to be included in it and show his talent. <br /> <br /> Show from the beginning, how the platoon of the national state of emergency is formed, showing the children as incompetent under the command of Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier), as they tend to be through the series. <br /> <br /> On the way, Mainwaring fulfills his usual desire to show authority, but the boys can not help dropping it at every step, during the war games and suspecting an invasion. However, in the film they have the opportunity to redeem themselves when they capture the Nazi aviators who take the church congregation hostage. <br /> <br /> That was a good ending, especially when Mainwaring was able to prove his worth to the General, having one last chance to get in shape. A great movie, a lot of good lines and laughter, is another for the DVD closet, I'm glad that the BBC is repeating it, and on this day 2.8.08 deservedly had the 'Night of the Army of Dad'. Do not be surprised!
