This is an excellent James Bond movie. Although it is not part of the original and most famous series, and it is an independent film, it is very well made. To attract Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius, as he titled the film in a way that makes reference to his previous vow not to play Bond again. Connery was as good as he was in his first appearances in 007. The script is outstanding, as is photography and performances. It's the first movie I remember with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after this movie; Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. The frequent references to Bond's aging and the changing times and attitudes of the British secret service were most humorous. The 007 gadgets matched those of the other Bond films. The only thing missing was the famous song 007, which, of course, could not be used by this competing production. It was quite surprising for me to see two excellent James Bond movies released the same year, this and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is the emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The first years of the decade of the 80 were the first apogee of such things, and its use in this film turned it into a very contemporary film. The film is actually a different version of Thunderball, updated with newer technology. Regardless of the repeated theme, there are enough differences to make it more entertaining. I will see this frequently.
