This is another classic Seagal movie. He walks, no, crosses through the patriot only all the other Mega Seagal movies. Nothing comes close to even challenging Seagal in this movie, except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for this so-called "plague" and starts throwing things on the lab, but everything works, I mean face it, his teacher. Seagal, you have to win. What about his outfit in the movie, masterpiece, he must have chosen himself? It's great that everyone in the film is dying after being exposed to the virus, but Seagal does not even have a cough. The incident at the end, when he kills the fat man with the broken glass, genius, I bet Seagal also thought about that. This movie is pure and simple. Great plot, great characters, and Seagal.
