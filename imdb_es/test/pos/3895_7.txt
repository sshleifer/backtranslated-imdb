I can not say that this movie was very funny, but I must have had a smile on my face all the time. I like this kind of darker comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in a canvas bag" or "cold blood" <br /> <br /> The way in which the main character tries to escape with the murder is very fun to watch. For me it was not a big surprise what the end would be, but the way it came was the end. Another thing that stands out is the way they have managed to involve the audience. The way Terry looks at us is hilarious, you can almost pretend that you are his accomplice.
