Good show, very good performance, and the director takes us to swim through his story in an interesting and unpredictable way, especially because, essentially, they are two people in one room. It does not run through many modern movies, but neither does it drag. Bohl is frivolous enough to believe in the "now" of his character, who is still involved and will not back down in his "career" choices, so he is credible without the need to show us a deep self-examination. his soul ... Brundage has the delicate balance of weight, innocence, meekness and class to get "Buddy" very well. A little grainy in the quality of the film, but it fits the tone of the story. I could use a little bit of polish on my hair and makeup, but it's definitely worth seeing.
