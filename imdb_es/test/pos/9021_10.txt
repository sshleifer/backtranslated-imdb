In this film "Virtual Sexuality", 17-year-old Justine has no luck in love. One day, when she is standing, she goes with her friend to a virtual reality conference, there she is presented with a machine that can change her appearance, dody and whatever she wants in virtual reality. She decides to try it, but begins to have a boyfriend of her own, her dream date. Then, suddenly, there is an explosion in a gas pipeline and its creation comes alive. I will not say more, you'll have to see the movie, which is quite fun to watch.
