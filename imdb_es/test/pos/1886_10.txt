This is graciously funny (well, except when Bruce is at the hospital scene, which is a bit sad). <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are excellent and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not a big overproduction controlled by a budget, but it's everything it promises to be and more. and BTW- women are wonderful in their parts, although I do not know them from other movies, I would like to see them again. <br /> <br /> The scene of the two brains walking is inspired and certainly is a showcase. Because of Bruce's extraordinary physical comedy, he's a delicious guy! <br /> <br /> Thanks Bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!
