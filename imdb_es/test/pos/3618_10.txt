Being of Cephalonic descent, I was pleasantly surprised to see the movie. I have heard the true story of my relatives who still live in Kefalonia, but upon seeing the film and reading the book, the fragments of history were filled. Everything is true, the Italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that shake the island so often. The 1953 earthquake killed my great-grandfather, and both the book and the film portray the feeling of the time with great compassion. If you have not seen the movie, watch and read the book, it is not just a love story, and yes, there were many Italians in love with Cephalonian women, in fact, many boats of Cephalonian women were taken to Italy after the war, it is a true representation of history.
