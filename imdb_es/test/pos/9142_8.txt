I already gave my comment about this movie under the name BruceV3. Now under BruceV13 I want to add something! Now, after a long time, I have seen many of the so-called heroic titles of bloodshed! But not many come close to the action that is shown in John Woo's movies! That's why, after all these years, I think it's strange that "China White" does not get the credit it deserves! No matter what version you have seen! The action is first class! The landscape, China Town in Amsterdam is very unique. It gives you the impression that it is a large district. But having lived in Amsterdam myself, I know it's just a small area of ​​the red light district that has many Chinese shops and restaurants. But because of the way they filmed the film, it actually looks like a big and important territory where people know they should not mess with the triads (Chinese mafia)! In addition to the action, "China White" is a compelling gangster drama with good acting. For this I have to give credit to Russel Wong! Too bad we do not see it much lately, since it has a lot of potential! You must see the movie!
