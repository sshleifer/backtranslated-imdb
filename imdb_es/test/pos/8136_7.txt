No, this is not an Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is the last silent film by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The end of an era! In the 20s, Laurel and Hardy left a real imprint in the silent film genre with films that are still popular and that are regularly seen and transmitted today. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie is not. among your best <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie sounds good and is good. The boys get together with a goat this time, which, of course, leads to problems and for us some fun situations to observe. However, at the same time it is extremely foolish and totally amazing to see children doing comedy things with a goat. Most of the jokes in the movie still work well, but the movie, however, never really becomes funny or memorable. Comedy and history really seem to be lacking at times and for the most part they are too simple and predictable. <br /> <br /> Of course, they are still fun and fun enough for fans, but Laurel & Hardy's silent last entry is still a little disappointing. br /> <br /> 7/10
