A mixture of the humor of the drugs of the 70 together with the parody of medicine and the classic plot. As I've often said about this movie, if you do not get it, you're pretty lame ... Classic lines like (paraphrased) "I have this erection and it will not go away, no matter how many times I do it You're a nurse, what can you give me That? "The nurse answers" all I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ... "Great soundtrack. The classic "Hyde has nothing to hide". It remains surprisingly close to the original plot - it's not that the original stays in the way of a joke ... I have not met anyone with an IQ greater than 115 who does not find it hysterical. <br /> <br />
