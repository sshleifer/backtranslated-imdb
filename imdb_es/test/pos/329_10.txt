Hi all! I went to this movie without any expectation, although I knew that Maniratnam would have given an excellent movie! I was stunned! The backdrop is the struggle between the Tamils ​​established in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how a young Amudha who lives with her adoptive parents in Chennai, India, goes to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The highlights of the film are the performances of all the actors and actresses and, of course, the cinematography, the editing and all the other technical details. A highlight for the cast and crew. I have to mention about cinematography, since it highlights the war in such a way that you sit there. Excellent work! Although the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such work was never attempted on the Indian screen. In general, the movie is great! And congratulations to Mr.Maniratnam. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratnam has shown once again that he is a director who can take Indian cinema to great heights. I would love to see this movie again and again. An excellent movie and a must see.
