NOROI follows a documentary maker, Masafumi Kobayashi, as he slowly discovers something mysterious and evil that leaves a trail of corpses in his wake. After interviewing a woman who says she hears the loud cries of a baby coming from the house next door (where there is no baby), Kobayashi goes to talk to the neighbor. He is greeted with hostility by the disheveled and disheveled woman (Maria Takagi) who responds to the door (and quickly hits her in the face) and looks at her 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely, both the woman and her son disappear a few days after their visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noises, as well as her daughter, are murdered of Mysterious way Accident not long after that. This awakens the interest of Kobayashi and undertakes a search to discover what is happening. He soon discovers that those with psychic abilities and extra sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister, inexplicable and possibly even apocalyptic. Kana (Rio Kanno), famous 10-year-old psychic and television celebrity, seems to think that we can all be condemned, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help. Another psychic / actress (Marika Matsumoto) gets involved, like Mr. Nori, a mentally unstable kook / psychic who wears a hat and an aluminum jacket and believes that people eat it for what he calls "worms" ectoplasmic ". The tracks finally lead to the place of a small town that is now covered by a lake, and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba ... <br /> <br /> Unlike many other hand-made horror movies, This depends on both the plot and the reactionary fear in the first person. Fortunately, there is something of a story here, very interesting and complex, so it is not based on glimpsing horrible things through spastic camera work from time to time to maintain your interest. The way Masafumi travels following the clues in search of the truth, with shakes well placed on the road, reminded me something to THE OMEN in his rhythm. The film also does not consist entirely of material filmed by the documentary maker, but is woven into news reports and television variety programs as if what we were watching were a finished documentary. That helps break some of the monotony usually associated with movies filmed in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to damage the realism of the "real" images either. In general, it's a well-made horror movie, with a lot of plot changes, some suspense and some really spooky moments, that are worth checking out. My only real complaint is that I could have used a little clipping here and there and it seems to last a bit. Otherwise, pretty good things.
