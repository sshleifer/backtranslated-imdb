A word for it. Hilarious I have not seen a movie like this in a long time. At the points in the film, I completely forgot that it was a movie, I felt that I was watching Viva La Bam, or even watching, my own friend going through something like that. It was realistic and I liked that Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake and Brandon and the rest of the guys did not try too hard to act. They, for me, were acting like their famous idiots. There were some scenes that I loved more than others, like Raab in the shower, saint, I laughed so much. Honestly, he was probably my favorite character, in addition to Bam. Actually, in my opinion, it made the movie a little funnier. It's basically a must-see for any fan of the CKY team:]
