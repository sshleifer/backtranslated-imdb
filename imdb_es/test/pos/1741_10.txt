I loved this show. Such talent and I am so disappointed that it is canceled, only after starting. I expected this show all week. And I'm very sorry for the people who expected to be The One. I would have loved to see who would have won. It just started, and in my opinion, it should not have been canceled. I hope that these young artists have been seen by scouts and have the opportunity to achieve their goals. I voted and sat waiting for him to arrive; Without knowing that it was canceled. And I could not believe what it was. I am surprised that he has had low grades; Because it was in my opinion one of the best reality TV shows.
