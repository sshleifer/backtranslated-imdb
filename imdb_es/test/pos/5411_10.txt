Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best movie of the year. It was a complete and absolute joy to see. I was nailed. The whole audience of the Sunset Five was fascinated, when the movie ended, nobody moved, spoke, nothing. I think this movie is a perfect example of the power of drama. Especially insofar as it sets an example of the drama / work quality of this younger generation. <br /> <br /> There were moments in your movie, many, like at least seven, in which I was surprised by such a large amount of beauty, an emotional beauty, that I could not really breathe for a while. And for an addict of catharsis like me, that's the best censorship experience I can ask for. It is the result of a powerful and masterful narration and direction. Like heavyweight things, like Burtolucci and those guys. <br /> <br /> Each element of the film fits perfectly. There were no errors at all. The cast was incredible. I've been a big fan of Emile and Ryan for a long time, and I thought they had never been better. I was / am / will be continually stunned by this movie. And I promise that I will drag every person I know to see it. It must be seen. You must win prizes.
