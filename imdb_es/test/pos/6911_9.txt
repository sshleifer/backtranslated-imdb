Before watching this television movie, I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After seeing it, I realized how sad Lucille Ball's life was. It also had great moments, but I did not realize how sad it was. This movie was very good and told very well the story of the beloved Lucille Ball. I highly recommend it
