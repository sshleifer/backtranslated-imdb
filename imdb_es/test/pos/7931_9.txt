Watching some of the sequences (err, the complete 1/3 of the film dedicated to the battle on the ice) in Alexander Nevsy, a film directed by the Russian legend Sergei M. Eisenstein (co-directed by Dmitri Vasilyev in his only and significant credit ), it made me realize how much should really go in the direction, at least on a scale like this. If I were a member of an awards group at the time of the release of this film, I would probably award Eisenstein the director's year award, posthumously. It's a cinematic genius craze to pull out some of the things that are accomplished in the film, although for someone like this director after leaving his best work, Battleship Potemkin and October, it might have been something he scoffed at. First. But in the middle of a film that is sometimes a bit frustrating because of the little that the grays appear in the black and white theme, it is still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later. The fans of The Lord of the Rings, know the grandfather of the movie, so to speak. <br /> <br /> To say that something is a piece of propaganda already puts a connotation, and often a bad one. It is something that has a complete message and a point of view. It continues to be a topic of great discussion (see the swarms of arguments about Moore's films to see how they are made) about whether a great art can emerge from something that is meant to awaken the audience in a specific way. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans. As it approached the Second World War, Russia once again faced the "German invaders", and it is interesting to note that Eisenstein was commissioned to make this film, as a call to the Russians to never forget a crucial piece of its history. However, the final result appears as something that is actually a bit common when watching Battleship and October; If nothing else comes through those films, is that Eisenstein is more concerned about how the image and content can be linked to the viewer, that style can wrap the viewer completely without failing. In those terms, Alexander Nevsky is not afraid. <br /> <br /> But even with the idea of ​​'big Russia, bad Germans', there are some small moments when things get a little less strict, a little less strict on these ideals. For example, when we see the Germans in Privka for the first time, they are not a faceless blotch that is totally barbaric and has an intention to conquer blindly (not that they are not willing to take what they can). They also have their own national pride, which would be no less for them to go ahead with what their teachers led by Christians tell them. At least, the evil of the image has a face, however, it is kept at a low minimum so that the most prevalent side begins. There is also a brief scene, before the battle for the ice, where the Russian company has a joke. He counted and laughed, and added a little extra depth where in other places there could be very little. Because most of the time in Alexander Nevsky, with its battle songs full of pride for the war, there is no complexity in the characters, especially Nevsky himself (played in an ultra heroic way, only questioning near the beginning, by Nikolai Cherkasov ) that perhaps it has to be this way in the intention of Eistenstein to have it as the only infallible force to be taken into account in history. After all, looking for naturalism in an Eisenstein movie is like trying to find non-kosher pig feet in a delicatessen. <br /> <br /> But the real reason to see the image is not the performance, anyway, but for the aspect of the film, how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that Eisenstein establishes. On the epic scale, he is as ambitious as his films of the 1920s, with a series of extras, not only in the main battle scenes, but also in the scenes of the cities, of the hundreds of people who arrive. In fact, I would say that any director who works in Hollywood or in another place that is thinking of doing some kind of great epic, particularly the war, would do well to take a look at this movie, even with the sound off. It's even better if you think about a silent movie, with the visual traits fantastically accentuated at times. One could spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice, how it starts with the German soldiers in the distance and then moving forward like insects, and then how Eisenstein gets between the close-ups of the actors who fight and then the shots. and with the accelerated edition. And, of course, you can not rule out the power of music, Sergei Prokofiev delivering one of the great scores of any epic work. Meanwhile, the director's edition keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed. If this were just a short film, it would surely be among the greats, like the Odessa Stairs sequence. <br /> <br /> If I found it a little less than totally magnificent, it would be due to failures. that come from a director that is much more suitable for the silent medium than for the sound. Although I have not yet seen Ivan the Terrible, my only negative criticism would be for his direction of the actors, which is really as wide as possible, with the melodrama in such a high tone that it is amazing (the secondary plot of the two soldiers competing for la Olga is the best example I can think of, but even considering this, in general, Alexander Nevsky is too extraordinary to ignore it, and increases the commitment to action and film making at a level that puts a point of reference for movies, even today, to try to live.
