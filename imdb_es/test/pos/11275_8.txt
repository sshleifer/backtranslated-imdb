First of all, this is an art film and a good one in that. I loved the presentation and the way it was filmed. Very cool. Certain scenes were some of the most graphic horror sequences I've seen. This movie scared me, not because of suspense or commotion, but because I had a mortal fear that I would soon see something really scary. That happened in some places, but especially at the beginning. This movie also dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long. However, if you like the cinema you have to see this. To date, I have not seen anything like it. 8/10
