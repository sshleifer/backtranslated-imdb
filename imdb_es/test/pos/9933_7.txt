A diva of the opera has an accident, which leaves the door open for her substitute to take over the role. Betty (Marsillach) is now the star of Mac Beth, but someone who hides in the trenches has his own opera planned. He gets his advantages from tying Betty, putting needles under his eyes (so she can not close them) and assassinating members of the opera company before his very eyes. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is certainly one of Argento's. more ambitious films, like mixing them with Macbeth of Shakesphere, is the fact that the opera interpreted in the film is the version of Macbeth by Giuseppe Verdi, but also Argento, just as Shakespeare uses the ravens as an omen of death and disgrace. And like the crows that surround Dunsinane Castle, foreshadowing the demise of Macemeth, the crows on OPERA play a key role in the killer's fall. In addition, as in the old work, the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover. But I do not want to go so far as to say that OPERA claims to be a new version of The Phantom of the Opera or Macbeth, the similarities are too subtle. It's just a typical master beat from Argento, and with it gives this fairly basic thriller a vivid nuance of Gothic mysticism. <br /> <br /> Although this film has drawbacks, like the heavy metal soundtrack, it just does not fit with this movie and the final scenes of this movie are a bit strange. <br /> <br /> In general, "Opera" is something like a faulty masterpiece, but it's still good.
