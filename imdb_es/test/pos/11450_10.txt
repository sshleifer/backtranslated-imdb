I put aside this movie when I used to go to the movie store, but then curiosity affected me and I decided to check it out. I loved!!! The film begins with Judy and Jay heading to a Halloween party at the abandoned Hull House funeral home. Then we find some more characters, Angela and Suzzanne (the hosts), Frannie, Max, Rodger, Sal and Helen. Then, of course, they begin to celebrate and when they are really in the mood they decide to have a session that awakens a demon. The demon possesses Angela and she begins her appalling massacre. They will survive the Night of the Demons. <br /> <br /> The movie was great in general. The blood was fine, but the nudity provided by Linnea Quigley (ROTLD Garbage) once again screws it. I was never a fan of her and I never will be.
