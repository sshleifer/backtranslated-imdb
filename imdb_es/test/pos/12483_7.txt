This movie is made so lovingly that you want to be part of it forever. The flics are straight, but not without malice, the goods are transparent and the evildoers are almost not there. Even the "cabaret" are so naive that they will make you dream of nostalgia compared to anything available on television. Blier is fine, even if it's a bit one-sided. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you just can not have a better copper. It has the best phrase: "My dad cleaned other people's land and I do the same". Susy Delair is unbearable, but I suppose that part of it is the songs, the costumes and the hairstyle. Simone Renant, on the other hand, makes a great fatal woman, albeit a little silent. I did not realize that she could be a lesbian, as suggested by dbdumonteil, an IMDb user, and others suggest correctly.
