In 1983 two Bond films were made, one was the official Bond film, Octopussy, starring Roger Moore, who played James Bond for the first time in Live and Let Die and the other was the unofficial Bond Never Say Never Again , starring Sean Connery, who played James Bond's role for the first time in Dr. No, that film was also the first 007 James Bond film ever made. Never Say Never Again is called unofficial because the company that made the other James Bond movies did not do this. Never Say Never Again is also a remake of the movie Thunderball from 1965 007, there are several differences in Never Say Never Again that tell you that it was not made by EON. One thing is that the opening is different, there is no sequence of cannons or a sequence prior to credit, another difference is music. Some things in this movie feel like a James Bond movie like gadgets and cars, plus James Bond always agrees with the ladies and the movie has an opening credits song. Sean Connery still does a great job playing Bond, the performance of the other stars is also great. <br /> <br /> Never Say Never Again is a good movie that has become the official James Bond movie. Watch this. 10/10
