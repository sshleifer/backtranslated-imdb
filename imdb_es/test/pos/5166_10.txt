This is an excellent movie and I would like it to be put on DVD for people to buy it. It is difficult to try to capture it on television all the time. As you do not know when one of the stations will decide to aerate it. Can anyone tell me which file company does it so that I can write to them and see if they will publish it to the public? Yesterday I only caught the last hour and a half and I could only see it once last year. My sisters and I look for him in all the stores that sell videos. John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot is excellent. They published some much older films and I think it's great, but there are some that have not been published and I think if we could contact the producers and express our requests, we could publish some on DVD.
