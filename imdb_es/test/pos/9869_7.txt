Although I brought this film by accident (I thought it was the original Halloween (hey, stupid!)) I was surprised how good it was, many sequels simply continue the events of the previous films, however, this tried and succeeded in explaining the events . of the prequels, why does Michael Myers kill people and why does he seem to have supernatural abilities? I thought that this was a top horror movie full of action, suspense and surprises, I am very happy to have brought it. I've given it 9 out of 10.
