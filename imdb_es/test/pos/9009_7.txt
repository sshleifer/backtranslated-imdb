Spin-offs, for someone who does not know, generally do not succeed because most of the original characters are absent. <br /> <br /> Here they are and you can not ask for a better set in what is essentially a silly little caricature, which does not intend to do anything but entertain. <br /> <br /> JP Manoux, replacing David Spade, does an admirable job of retaining Kuzco's ego and, however, does not seem as annoying as Spade's character (a character Spade has done for decades and gets nervous after a while). It has a softer voice but it fits in some way. <br /> <br /> Eartha Kitt, repeating her role as Yzma, is brilliant. She has not really received much praise since her turn as Batwoman centuries ago, except perhaps for her vile part in Boomerang. However, it is funny how the character looks like. <br /> <br /> And Patrick Warburton. There's no way he can not be funny, except when he was wasted on Men in Black 2. I've been a fan of him since Seinfeld, but unlike that character, he plays a nice, genuine guy who is tricked into doing it. such beautiful things. <br /> <br /> The animation is really beautiful as it is usually all Disney, but sometimes the character's design is a bit too sugary. Oh good. Two out of three are not bad.
