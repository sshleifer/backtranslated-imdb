The efforts of a new group of young talents reinforced by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, 2 extremely talented actors, make it an exciting and fascinating evening of entertainment. And I might add that Hal Holbrook shines like the senator. This movie deserves five stars. I give you a ten on your scale. And the end is PERFECT. I am constantly amazed at the ability of British actors to master our American accents. He was convinced that all the actors were born in Louisiana. And what better place for a mystery than New Orleans! The Big Easy, also known as Crescent City, permeates all scenes. As a writer and director, Sebastián Gutiérrez deserves great praise.
