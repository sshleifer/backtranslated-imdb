I love this program. He is intelligent and very well acted. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. Writing is intelligent and subplots generally give great comic relief. After every new episode, I am always surprised at how stimulating and entertaining this show is. My only complaint would be the absence of Donna Murphy, at this point, in the second season. As David Morse's ex-wife, Heather, she added such a character to the show. <br /> <br /> I think this program is a credit for the crime / drama genre. That said, I can not, for my life, understand why this program has such a low rating. Did someone please give this program a rating of 1 supported by a review?
