I saw it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked me if we would see it. I did not want to do it because it was such an old movie, how could that be good? Finally I saw him with that friend and my father. My friend and I love the movie. The songs are great, the actors were great and we were crazy about that. I guess this shows even though it's from Dad's time, which does not mean it can not be a good movie. I bought the movie shortly after watching it on television, I put it on a lot and I sang along with the songs. I even saw him with my classmates at my birthday party. It's a beautiful movie, good and, sometimes, fun. <br /> <br /> If you do not try, you can not say it's bad. Even if you think no, I will not see a movie from Dad's time. Try the first part of the movie that you can always stop watching if you do not like it. I really recommend it, it's great!
