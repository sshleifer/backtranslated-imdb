Style on substance. But what style is it? "The Cell" is the internal version of most movies of serial killers. Unfortunately, history barely supports the visual. <br /> <br /> Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) delves into the dreams of her patients by artificial means to discover and help them overcome their phobias and obsessions. A new patient, who has fallen into a coma, is struck by the FBI. He is a serial killer who drowns his female victims and then raises their bodies in grotesque scenes like mannequins. Deane must enter the murderer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies to find and save his last victim. <br /> <br /> Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and pieces for this production. Each sequence of dreams is like a nightmarish painting in movement, from the landscapes to the costumes. <br /> <br /> But the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with extensive experience and is the last person that interests you. Without it, you basically have a movie that moves only in the present tense, which is a shame, since the movie is visually stunning and really terrifying. Lopez is squandered, but she's not an amazing actress anyway, although she's as beautiful as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I do not even know why he was chosen. This is not his strong and exaggerates to boot. He tried too hard to become his character and showed himself. Stay with the comedy, Vince! Even so, this movie is so frightening visually that I keep watching this movie with the lights on and I can never fall asleep immediately.
