I will not lie Telling that this movie is confusing is like saying that the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen the previous films by cult director Richard Kelly, "Donnie Darko" and "Southland Tales," you know that means something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour in the movie, almost half of the audience had already left. In the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what the hell they had just seen. For my part, I could only understand about 40% of what I saw on the screen, and even then you can only call interpretation. So, why did I give this movie a generous seven stars? Because, on the one hand, we have some spectacular performances (Marsden's great and Langella come back as a spooky and familiar character), and most importantly, they are completely original and Richard Kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors in the world, uses his creative vision to tell History that dares to be different. Frankly, it's the ONLY way: just through Kelly's unique style, this story can be told in the way it was designed. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are not willing to devote a serious thought to an intelligent movie (and even then it may be nothing), stay away from it. But if you want to see a profound, rich, complex and stimulating piece about spirituality, existentialism and the predictability of human nature, go see this. Prepare for long discussions with your partner, however. <br /> <br /> * Note: If by chance you have read this review, you have taken my recommendation, you have really seen the movie and you STILL think you have lost 2 hours of In your life, I would love to share my views on the meaning and the plot of the film. Look, that's why I liked it so much, promote the discussion! However, as difficult as it may be, I will try to summarize it by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote from the character of Langella, who explains the meaning of the simple box to an employee: "Your house is a box that you live in. The car you drove to work It is a box with wheels.When you return home after work, you sit in front of a box with moving images.You observe until the mind and soul are rotting and the box that is your body deteriorates, when they finally place you. in the last box ... to rest under the earth and the earth.
