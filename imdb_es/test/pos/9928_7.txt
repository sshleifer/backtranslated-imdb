Betty is an understudy in a production of Verbis Macbeth who is asked to continue when the diva is injured in a car accident. However, in the great tradition of "The Scottish Play", the production seems to be cursed by the problems, among which are some crazy people who cut the crew. Unfortunately for Betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the many Argento movies that you must see, in this case mainly because of the extraordinary photography of the great Briton. cameraman Ronnie Taylor. I have not measured it, but I recognize that around two thirds of the shots in this film include pans, dolls, caterpillars or cranes: the great amount of movement of the camera is amazing and makes the film ten times more exciting than a standard . suspense novel. The images are wild and dizzy: the close-ups of the heroine's eyes were opened with the nails, slid over an opera house from the point of view of a crow, shots from the killer's brain were fired, a bullet fired Through a peephole, a chain swallowed. of the trachea of ​​a victim. Conceptually it is simply amazing and can only be done by this director. The movie is not without some shortcomings though; the cast is variable at best: Marsillach and Barberini are a little shaky (and their dubbing in the English version is frightening, even by Italian standards), although Argento's regular Nicolodi is fun and Charleson gives a performance reflective in a role that is more than a little autobiographical (a director of horror very defamed by his remoteness and confidence in the technique). The material is a good three-way mix of The Phantom Of The Opera, Shakespeare and slasher flick, scripted by Argento and his usual collaborator, Franco Ferrini, with plenty of suspects in abundance and the usual disdain for boring expository scenes to explain what what is really happening . Filled with all kinds of different music: Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini and, of course, Verdi. The scenes in the beautiful opera house were shot at the Teatro Regio in Parma. For some strange reason, the UK impression of this film has the alternative title Terror At The Opera.
