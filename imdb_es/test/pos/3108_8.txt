Both Jackie and Candice are great in this movie. They are well adapted to their roles and have several opportunities to shine. In particular, the way in which Candice pronounces the words "Puerto Rican" is very funny, since she is as kind as she can be, but at the same time condescending. I had seen the original of this movie, called "Old Acquaintance", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. Apparently, they did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that could have been a problem. Here, actresses are admired and respected clearly. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have support parts and both are excellent, particularly Bochner, who never got a lot of decent parts in the movies, as far as I'm concerned. George Cukor did not make another movie after this, so this was a good one to leave.
