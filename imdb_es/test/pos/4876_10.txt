I also attended the RI International Terror Film Festival and I can easily see why this movie won the best show. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST is a wild game of horror, comedy and beautiful landscapes. A backward story of strange events. An increasingly widespread disease with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of the explosion of people's heads, brings the apprentice of a young teacher; Stefan, to investigate. Throughout his travels, he decides to deviate briefly and, once again, ask for the hand of his love in marriage, only to be sent once again by his extremely stubborn father. On the road "out of town", he meets a sick girl on the way and hands her over to Dr. Maitland, (played brilliantly by Vincent Price as the actor: Edward X Young). Who fills Stefan in the Bad? foot. Only Dr. feels insulted for having called the teacher and only received a child in training. However, Stefan turns out to be much more than a common viewer. Horror icon; Tom Savini portrays the supreme religious trafficker; Prester John. Shout queen; Ingrid Pitt leaves her retirement to give a stellar performance as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actors kept the story to perfection and helped to effectively move towards the climax. <br /> <br /> Dark Religion and at the top, but fun and, at times, very original, the bloody scenes play a lot in this film Homage to the hammer. This elegant film comes and goes between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and the reality of the character. <br /> <br /> Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very funny movie! Slapstick, the humor of the tongue and the cheek and the dark comedy raise their heads among the dark history. As others have said; This really is like three great movies in one. Very entertaining and original.
