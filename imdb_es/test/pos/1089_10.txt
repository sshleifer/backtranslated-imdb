I love the way he experiences. Ab Tak Chappan was an emotion to see as much as Satya and the company. Jatin the newcomer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating, but I think he fit the character he played: he had really ugly teeth. The story has a lot of progress and there are no songs in the movie that improve it. I just want you to register with Urmila for your other upcoming films. I think they are the best combination of director and actress I've seen. I have not seen Naach yet, but I'm looking forward to it. For some reason, I do not find Antra Maali so exciting to see on the screen, unlike Urmila.
