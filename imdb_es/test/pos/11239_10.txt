I think it's a brilliant show with talking heads and a great action. Two boys who pretend to be teachers in female seduction demonstrate their skills in different nightclubs and 4 experts (the same collection artists) comment on them, choosing the winner. Their jokes are fun, and some participants are really fun to watch. Moreover, this program really teaches men how to get in touch with women, many expert comments are useful, while you can see how it works in the field. In fact, I think this is one of the best television shows and I totally recommend it to all men, who like women. <br /> <br /> ps / sorry for my broken English.
