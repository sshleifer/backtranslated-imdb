I really like Traci Lords. She may not be the best actress in the world, but she's pretty good at this. She plays the dowdy, conservative, reporter to a 'T'. It's a great little thriller that keeps you guessing for a good while. Jeff Fahey is also good as the head of Traci. I think with a decent rest, Traci could be a top-level actress. She certainly is not worse than some of the leading ladies of today.
