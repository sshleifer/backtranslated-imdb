I really enjoy this movie. I've probably seen it 2 dozen times or more and I still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy, I'm still touched by the moving version of Anchors Away! I also love the pirate atmosphere of "McHales Navy". I could have done it without the diving officer, but I guess I'm out of style. It was still good to look at, hahaha, especially after the crew had finished with their clothes. The cook, sonarman and electrician made the movie. I loved the old salty engineer and his first class PO too. And Grammer actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit officer. I loved the "driving scene" when they passed the golf course on the way to the harbor, hahaha. Pure Navy! And I swear I had an XO that was like that little weasel ... I'm very happy that this is on DVD, in a bloody moment. : 0)
