Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being detained and tried by a court and then given the option of imprisonment or running the Punishment Park course. It's a grueling 52-mile journey through the desert to an American flag, with the police, the National Guard and several other figures of authority waiting. The idea is that if you get to the flag, you are free. The court consists of a group of conservative types, all condemning any behavior that is not like yours, and there is no result, except a prison sentence or the "Sanctions Park" option for any of those in trial. There are many things in this that are still true today, which is quite disturbing in itself. The people who run the course are promised water at the midpoint, which is not true, and the officials who chase after it are mostly a sadistic group that is waiting for some objective practice. This is not a very graphic film, but it is more impactful in its ideas and themes than anything else. What is scary is that it could happen. It's not a very optimistic movie but it's definitely worth seeing. Warning: it could make you angry. 9 out of 10.
