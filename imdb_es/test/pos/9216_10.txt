This film is amazing due to the fact that it showed how the cartoons really looked in the 80s, the animators were not lazy as they are today, the caricature had many details with very few resources compared to what we have today. If more people request that these cartoons be retransmitted, then maybe all the other cartoons of the 80 will be shown on television once again, therefore, to finish my sentence, I would like to say that it was a caricature with which I grew up and I really would like to be on TV one more time.
