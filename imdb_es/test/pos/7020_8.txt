Dirty dance: I think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another. I remember when I was a kid I loved this movie and saw it again and again without getting tired. <br /> <br /> Now that I am a little older, I bought the DVD recently and STILL did not disappoint me with the acting. <br /> <br /> Swayze and Gray create the mood for this movie, although they say they do not get along, the chemistry of the movie is amazing! As the film progresses, we are attracted to their relationship and believe in each of their actions. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible, the music only adds to the romantic atmosphere of the film and the relationship between Baby and Patrick. <br /> <br /> The last scene makes this movie You can never forget the famous phrase "Noboby puts the baby in the corner". The song is perfect and the dance is amazing! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone, at any age, it's just a fun movie that anyone can enjoy 8/10.
