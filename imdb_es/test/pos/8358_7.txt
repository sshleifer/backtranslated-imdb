Aslan Adam, or Lionman, as he is best known among English-speaking audiences, begins with an epic battle in which King Solomon and his army defeat a group of boys, though I'm not sure who they were and the film itself It is not very useful. establishing the fact. Anyway, after King Solomon has murdered all these guys, Princess Mary, Bishop Osorio and Commander Antoine are forced to sign a treaty that allows King Solomon to rule almost everything in sight. Soon after, Princess Maria seduces Solomon and they have sex, meanwhile, in the shortest wedding ceremony (only two prayers), Antoine marries Princess Maria and plans to rebel against Solomon and get a sweet revenge in the process . Antoine and his guards attack and kill Solomon despite the fact that his pregnant wife, Princess Almunia, escapes with her protector Rostin and Antoine's guards pursue him, after the shorter labor (less than 5 minutes or as long as It runs through a bush) Princess Almunia gives birth to a small child who is hiding in some bushes away from the guards of Antoine. Unfortunately, when Rostin tries to recover the child, he finds that the baby has been adopted by Lion's pride as one of their own! A year later and the evil Antoine now rules by treating his subjects mercilessly, Princess Mary gave birth and has a son, but Rostin also keeps trying to put together a gang of rebels to overthrow Antoine, the task seems impossible unless who can count on the help of the legendary Lionman, who is more beast than man ... <br /> <br /> This Turkish Greek co-production was directed by Natuk Baytan as Natuch Baitan and is a film of this kind. I found it hilariously bad, but at the same time immensely entertaining. The script never seems to be taken seriously, sometimes it's a pretty funny movie, it moves like a rocket and is never boring or boring, and part of the dialogue dubbed in English is simply hilarious in context with what is happening on the screen. None of that makes sense, we have a child raised by Lion, an evil king, betrayal, dark family secrets, birthmarks that form the Lion form in an element of history that was present before the child was raised by Lion's , crazy. fighting scenes, torture scenes in which people are supposed to be tied to the wobble, old castle interiors that randomly contain zip wires and gymnastic rings, bad idiot guys who seem to have a lot of facial hair and a central character who has a jaw line similar to a brick house, can be stabbed twice, have their hands covered in acid (this acid can eat its way through the steel traps, but it is stored in a ceramic jug) and fall on 20 feet on a concrete floor and still not have serious injuries! Aslan Adam is a tremendously entertaining movie, I do not think I've seen another movie similar to the one I can compare, if you're looking for something serious, forget it, but if you like it "so bad-they're good type movies and want to have fun, laugh and be entertained, then Aslan Adam should be at the top of his list, 100% gold for bad movie fans and those with a taste for the different and strange.On the disappointing side, Lionman only gets his claws from steel 10 minutes before the end, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Director Bayten certainly keeps things moving at a rapid pace, although it is far from well done, during the initial battle. moment, the guys are fighting on a sand dune next to their on a grassy hill with trees in the background! There is a point at which Lionman uses a 'branch' for the pole vault, but obviously it's just a long tube with a tangle dera wrapped around him! Then there's the scene in which a group of bloodthirsty bloodhounds are supposed to chase Lionman, but the dogs that are used are obviously different breeds, including some of the most harmless looking dogs! There are so many individual scenes in Aslan Adam that are hilarious, stupid, strange or the three that I could go on forever. Just check the end when Lionman is jumping and flying around as if he could fly. There is a lot of blood in Aslan Adam, although there is not much real graphic blood or violence, some stabbing and someone cutting their hands is as graphic as it seems. <br /> <br /> Technically, Aslan Adam is pretty messed up, the period the costumes are bright and flashy with violet, yellow, red and other bright colors. The fight scenes are cheap, but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action as they could. The music seemed more appropriate for a ballet than for an action movie and is another strange aspect for Aslan Adam. The performance was bad, even dubbed you could say that the performance was bad. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam is pure gold from beginning to end, there are many things that I like, I laughed and enjoyed in this movie that simply ended up liking me. In no way can Aslan Adam be considered a good movie in any sense of the word, but it is a very entertaining one. I may have to see this other soon to prove to myself that I did not dream it all! The best Turkish action film about a man raised by Lion's you'll never see, period. It was popular enough to generate a sequel, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
