The main actor Yuko Tanaka meets both in the exceptionally meditative "The Milkwoman", a quiet survey about lost opportunities in the life of a woman of 50 years of age, tracing her routine with sincerely moving motives. Represented in the picturesque and quiet city of Nagasaki, Akira Ogata's unconventional romantic film, so to speak, is less a direct melodrama than a deliberate introspection of the delivery of her characters to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced to an election they did not ask for. <br /> <br /> With a perfect embodiment of the necessary fatigue of the world subjected to a routine without spirit, Tanaka plays Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her shift to work in a supermarket, takes care of deliver bottles of milk to the residents of the Nagasaki Hills. One of the houses she constantly goes through to make such a delivery is that of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government employee who takes care of her terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were boyfriends in high school who, courtesy of an ignominious act with respect to their parents, split up since then. <br /> <br /> Opening his film with the premonitory narration of a young Minako vowing not to leave Nagasaki, Ogata does. as such, with the narrative, patiently beating Minako while he, cleverly aided by Tanako's discreet but highly effective performance, follows her - whether she is chatting with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) to be single, or when she jumps out of a lot of steps from her mountainous village to distribute the milk, while she and Kaita gradually overcome the obstacles that kept them separated for years. Such unhurried development may not be appropriate for the viewers that are seen in the fast-paced narratives, but for the rest, it is a sincere introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically.
