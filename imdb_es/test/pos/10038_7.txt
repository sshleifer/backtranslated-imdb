Naturally, along with everyone else, I was prepared to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON THE CUSTER LEADER. The mere fact that someone like Errol Flynn plays Custer is a sufficient clue that the legend has priority over the truth in this production. And, for the most part, my expectations were met (in a certainly stimulating and entertaining way). <br /> <br /> However, even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) account of Custer's story, some of them impressed me. the points indicated in this film that, sometimes in a subtle but nevertheless solid way, seemed to counteract the typical clich√©s of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism that are generally found in the westerns of the early 20th century. <br /> <br /> For example, even while the film tried to cover up its hero, certain scenes still suggested the most imperfect and foolish character of Custer's real life: <br /> <br /> 1) Your initial entry into the main door of West Point, in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character. <br /> <br /> 2) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed both to Custer's lack of idea about the demands of military service and to any other factor; There are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer in West Point where he seems absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> 3) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but is presented as a slapstick comedy. I almost expected to see the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello wander the scene. <br /> <br /> 4) Custer's position against Jeb Stuart in Gettysburg is not bleached as a brilliant tactical military leadership, but he is presented as reckless and tremendously fortunate. <br /> <br /> 5) The problem with Custer's alcohol consumption is not ignored. <br /> <br /> And although the music and some of the ways in which the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, I was still surprised that the film really explained in detail why the Indians they were justified in attacking the whites who moved to their lands, and blamed explicitly for the battles. in the Black Hills, directly at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white demons who make the false claim to gold in the Black Hills. Of course, that part of the story is true, but I did not expect to see it represented so unequivocally in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> And another thing: generally in these movies are the Indians. who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals, seemingly incapable of basic common sense to avoid falling drunk every time they approach alcohol. In this film, it is actually the troops of the Seventh Cavalry, and not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed in this way. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie slips in some surprising moments in The Middle of the Hollywood Litter.
