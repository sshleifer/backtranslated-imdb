You can not see this movie for a history lesson. It was the first time I had heard of Ma Barker's saga, but almost immediately I could tell that the facts were far away. And with a little research on the internet, I realized that, of course, he was right. Ma Barker is not the attractive and calculating woman that the film portrays, and apparently did not organize all the plans of bank robbery, kidnappings and murders that her criminals committed. <br /> <br /> But do not expect a brilliant criminal drama. The script and the acting are appropriate, the shootings are excessive and mostly unrealistic, and there is a scene of death in slow motion very laughable. So, why did I give him 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> Because it was very entertaining. The shootings are fun to watch but there are some deeper issues that arise between them. The film has a strong sense of ego intimidation among its group of alpha males, each of which has its own agenda. And I appreciate the minimum use of juras for the period. The pieces are great, reproducing a convincing time of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie as you would a cult movie, and take advantage of the excessive lack of blood and cruelty with comments ultra serious corny FBI. Who wants to defeat the Barkers at any cost? In other words, do not take it too seriously, just have fun. And if you like this, you'll love Serial Mom.
