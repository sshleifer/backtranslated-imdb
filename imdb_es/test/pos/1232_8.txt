This movie, for what it was intended to be, was successful. It's a short tragic movie. Although my choice of film is what really develops the characters and their relationships, this film is designed to give a touch, leaving you with the "what happens after" factor. After seeing it, I really wanted more, more characters from the previous story, what influences did they have to turn them into the people they were. I think that's what the creators wanted the audience to think. The performance is incredible. There are not many lines in the film, so your body language, facial expressions and presence in general should be powerful enough to hold a scene. Both Franco and Minero have that element and it shows. For them (especially Franco) to take the time to do this, obviously he says that they believed in this movie and that they wanted to be part of it, and because of that, I appreciated the film for what it was. I'm also happy to have it so I can share it with other people who would never have known it existed.
