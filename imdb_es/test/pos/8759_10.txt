I can only agree with many observers that Traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw Traffik when he was on TV, and I just saw him again. I am particularly moved by the disturbing original music of Tim Souster, and especially by the painful strains of the Chamber Symphony in C minor by Dmitri Shostakovich (the music on the credits and in parts of the film). The music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad destiny. Music is powerfully emotional. This arrangement combines two of the movements of the symphony, but I recommend listening to the symphony itself.
