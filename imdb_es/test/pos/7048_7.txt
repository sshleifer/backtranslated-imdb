If you take the movie for what it's worth, you will not be disappointed. If you think Murray should win an Oscar for his performance and that's the kind of movie you're waiting for, do not worry. It was fun when I saw it in 1979 and it has not lost its charm. Good clean fun for the kids and entertainment for the elderly. The story line is simple and easy to follow. Murray has done better, but this is his first movie. The film reminds me of a time when we did not need blood and guts to have fun. Morty is the main fool and plays the perfect role. The other counselors are accelerated teenagers looking to have fun during the summer. Something good about this movie, it has a message.
