Great comedy of the 80s, set in the southwest of England. It is a story of sex, drugs, tea cream and murders on the seashore. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (hilarious in the drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a role. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress his girlfriend by boasting that he is involved in a multi-billion dollar drug business. This leads to complications with hilarious results. I'm trying to figure out the proportion of the original image for this movie, but it does not appear in "Technical Aspects" of the IMDb site. I saw the DVD in the store and it looks like it's in 1.33: 1 format (full screen). Was the film filmed in this ratio or was it originally a widescreen movie with a panoramic and DVD scan? It would be useful to know that I hate to make bread and scan movies. So come to IMDb. Could you find out for us?
