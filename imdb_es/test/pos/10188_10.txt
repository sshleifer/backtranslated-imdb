I'm not a Disney fan, but I'm in Orlando for a friend's wedding. So my traveling companion and I went to Disney for a few days. I have not seen a good 3D effect on, well ... ever. So I generally try to stay away from these presentations. The 3-D effect on this was so good. I am a 38 year old adult man, and I even wanted to reach and touch. It's so good! An advice. In the end, look towards the back of the theater on the wall. Put it like that ... the first time I saw it, the effect was not working. Then I said to my friend ... "It would have been nice if ..." My friend said, "That's exactly what happens, it's not working for some reason." It is an incredible spectacle. You will not be disappointed !!!
