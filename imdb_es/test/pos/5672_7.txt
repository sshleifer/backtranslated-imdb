** SPOILERS ** Looking for a little more excitement and then see the crocodiles fed in the local game reserve, sisters Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn and Maeve Dermody, along with her boyfriend Adam, Andy Rodoreda, decide to take a trip upstream in the desolate and desert, inhabited by humans, the Australian mangroves. <br /> <br /> With his swamp guide Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized boat, the four are raised by a giant saltwater crocodile that quickly grabs and drags a terrified Jimmy to the bottom along with him . Grace Pat and Adam end up trapped in a tree in the swamp with Pat clinging to her life in the overturned boat. The rest of the film has the hungry and determined crocodile, which plays a cat and a mouse, or a "crock" and a human game with the trio that ends in a confrontation on a mud bank just where the body died and dismembered of Jimmy finally came to rest. . <br /> <br /> Both the director and the actors in the film make the most of the swamp, which sometimes makes it much more frightening than the gigantic crocodile that surrounds it. We got to see the killer crocodile almost a dozen times in the movie, but they all hit you, and Jimmy Grace Pat and Adam, in the stomach. <br /> <br /> So far, they were kept in suspense. The giant reptile that always does its damage from below arrives so unexpectedly that, the pitcher attacks, it has much more effect when you do not see them coming, as in the last ten minutes of the film, when you do it. You wonder from the beginning who, in the end, will survive the crocodile attacks and will eventually live to tell the tale. The ending with the human confrontation of crocodile and vrs was the weakest and unrealistic part of the film. <br /> <br /> The crocodile that was so cautious and effective in the previous scenes seemed to have hit, or swum, not to have the strength or speed to grab, with its deadly jaws, and finish off the only survivor of the expedition. In fact, the stupid assassin was so ineffective that even after he attacked his victim or victims, he simply could not cling to them. This in the end turned out to be fatal on his part. <br /> <br /> Much like "Jaws", the movie "Black Water" has the murderous crocodile, like the great white shark in "Jaws", more interested. It is killing its human prey and then eating them. With all the food available in the swamp and the rivers in which the crocodile lived, it was only after the quartet, Grace Pat Adam & Jimmy, to invade their aquatic domain that he felt he was the great ruler of. And for daring to do that they had to pay with their lives!
