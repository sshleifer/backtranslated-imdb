Who more than Troma can take the classic tragedy and change it to today's standards? Nobody ... in my opinion the Leonardo DiCaprio stank. Tromeon & Juliet is a definite stretch of the original Shakesperan tragedy, but it stays well. He is sick, demented, twisted, but incredibly funny and satisfying. For the most part, it follows the true story of Romeo and Juliet, but many elements of Troma are added. Will Keenan gives a great performance like Tromeo. The acting is solid and the story is great. Many people look beyond these films, not just the films of Kaufman Troma, but all those that distribute. Of course, Troma movies are an acquired taste, but you need to see some of these. It is the renegade cinema in its maximum expression.
