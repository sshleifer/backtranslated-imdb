For those who like their movies full of exploding planets and extreme violence, this is definitely not something to watch. In fact, there is very little plot (or, at least, very little that could not be summed up in a few seconds: A meets B. Mr. A falls in love with Mrs. B and has an affair with her. B then fall in love and wonder (to a large extent) if they have an adventure themselves). <br /> <br /> This is Cantonese Visconti. History does not exist, but what we do get is a succession of wonderful images and movingly trivial music that transmits the slow passing of the emotions of the central characters. There is also the possibility of seeing one of the most beautiful women in the world in a succession of incredibly elegant outfits. For my money, it's worth seeing just for that. How could this woman ever have been a heroine of action? It seems as if it had come directly from the pages of Vogue.
