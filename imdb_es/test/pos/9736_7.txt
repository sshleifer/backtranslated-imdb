I was a kid when I saw this series, shortly after I saw one of Buck Rogers, both characters played by Buster Crabbe himself, and I must admit that these movies have always been part of the best entertainment I've had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing, but I was more interested in knowing the final destination of Flash's love triangle with Dale and Aura. Barin approached and persuaded Aura to forget about Flash, a very innocent ending to her obsession with Flash's good looks. The series has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be seen by all audiences. Another thing is that I learned to float in the water looking at the way Crabbe did when he was fighting shark men. The soundtrack was also nice, although it was previously used in another Frankenstein movie by Boris Karloff. It would be nice to have the DVD of this series whenever it comes with subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).
