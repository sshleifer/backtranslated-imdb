I found a copy in a bargain of this classic of yesteryear. I played it with dosbox in a machine seen without problems. It's graphically dated to a large extent, but what do you expect from a 12-year game? The game is a hybrid FPS / Adventure game. It's what I call pseudo 3D, you can not look up or down, just turn 360 (think of Wolf3D). The game can become complicated with a very limited supply of health boats and a somewhat average interface (Tip: Press I), but in general it is passable. <br /> <br /> One of the main strengths of the game is the environment. . The game uses a lot of full-motion video, and while the performance is grade B and the plot is very choppy, the game as a whole feels really creepy. It also does a good job of making you question the 'good guys'. Are they really helping, or are they just waiting to stab you in the back? The other important point of sale is the duration of the games. There are 18 chapters in memory, which vary in game time from 10 minutes to potentially hours. My first game took a week with a serious dedication of time. <br /> <br /> Dated, yes, but if you missed this years ago and you can find it for $ 5, take a look. Cheaper than a movie, and more entertaining than most movies.
