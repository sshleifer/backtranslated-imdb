Having been a marine, I can tell you that the D.I. It is a portrait so accurate to date that shows the Marine Corp training camp and how children become men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sergeant Jim Moore, a tough simulator instructor but just on the island of Paris, North Carolina. The film focuses on a recruit who does not seem to "agree with the program." A more recent film, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is worth seeing.
