Every Sunday is a short 11-minute song featuring the talents of two of his young players with a youth contract, a couple that would become outstanding players in the future. It is interesting and entertaining to see the contrasting styles of Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin when they perform at a Sunday concert for Deanna's uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one knew how big these two ladies would be. . I've always wondered why Mayer kept Garland and let Durbin go to Universal. L.B. I always had culture pretensions and this was the guy who had Jeanette MacDonald in his studio and later hired lovely soprano voices like Jane Powell, Ann Blyth, Doretta Morrow, etc. <br /> <br /> Judy certainly had a glorious career at MGM, but she paid a heavy price for it. Deanna, along with Abbott & Costello and several Gothic horror monsters preserve images of Universal. She was smart enough to get to the top and make it stick. <br /> <br /> So, in your salad days, Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.
