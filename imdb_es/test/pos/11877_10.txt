I'm a big fan of Larkin's works, I think he was in the midst of the greatest poets of the twentieth century. The film itself does a great justice to the bard of Hull. Beautifully portrayed by all players in their roles. Bonneville does a service to the sexually repressed Larkin, avoids an impression and moves away from becoming a caricature. The use of his poetry was the culminating point of the piece itself. Instead of representing the massive intensity with which Larkin felt, the use of his own words provides a better understanding of the plot and adds a much darker but, on the whole, more fascinating atmosphere. Nicer.
