The three main characters have no remedy, and yet, you only feel bad for one of them: Ernesto, desperately dedicated to Mercedes. This was part of the frustration: shouting at Mercedes to get a clue and get rid of the not good Harry, in vain. <br /> <br /> Then there's the satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a big part as a transvestite, and Harvey Keitel's touching story about his indignity to a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino is doing half of a monologue, and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a rich man. <br /> <br /> Again and again great moments appear in the story, but in the end it is difficult to know. What to feel about this movie It does not have a happy ending, not even a complete one, but somehow it feels good. <br /> <br /> This movie is strange, but so am I; No wonder I liked it.
