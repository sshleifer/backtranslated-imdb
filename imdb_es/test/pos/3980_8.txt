This is what the movies should aspire to. Fun without being totally stupid, a little sexy without all the women in the cast show their tits, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' in each line. I have been watching Justin Long appear in many films in recent years, I imagined with the right paper that could break. (Mac commercials do not resist). This movie could put it on a quick list of A. The rest of the cast also did their job perfectly, this is an excellent little movie with a nice message. (But you do not need to buy the message to have a good time). Lewis Black is, as always, hilarious, and Blake Lively is a fresh-faced beauty. <br /> <br /> Take a couple of hours and watch this movie, it will not have been wasted.
