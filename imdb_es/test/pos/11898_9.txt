I just want to say that this movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> I loved it from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent. The director did an incredible job and I would like to see it again. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly had a very good performance, the guy who played her father (Manny) was another great actor BUT I CAN NOT RECOVER HER NAME. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for The Godfather II. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa looks so good and I think he's one of the most talented actors out there. There are a lot of Latino actors who do a great job as shown in this movie! <br /> <br /> Rent it! Rent it !!! Rent it !!!
