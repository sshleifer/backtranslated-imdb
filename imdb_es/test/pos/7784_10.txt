Well, this is the best comedy movie I've seen ... My two favorite actors did a good job. Salman Khan and Aamir Khan rocked. I hope to see Andaz Apna Apna part 2 as soon as I hear they will also return with part 2. I have a request for those who have not seen it yet. Please, buy DVD and watch it, you will not feel bored. I'm watching this movie 1 times a week. Everything else was also good in this movie. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others Music is also good, it also has good songs. There is some sense that will kill you with laughter. Salman Khan did a very good role and also Aamir. <br /> <br /> so you must see the film excellent work of actors and directors ...
