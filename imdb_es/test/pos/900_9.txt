Gen-Y Cops ... since I heard the movie was released, I wanted to see it because I loved the Gen-X Cops. I was a bit disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse did not come back and B) too much slapstick. However, I enjoyed the sequel because it may not be as good as the first movie, but it's good in its own way. <br /> <br /> Stephen Fung returns as the Lady of Match man, who has a stable girl. Oli (NOTE: Where is Haze?) And Sam Lee returns as the crazy Alien (this time wearing a Mohawk and speaking a lot of English!). The real star of the film is the newcomer Edison Chen. He makes a great replacement for Nicholas Tse as ... Edison. I also enjoyed Paul Rudd's performance of Agent Curtis ... it seems to be as hard as the nails, the smart mouth FBI agent you'd love to hate ... but soon, you'd like his character. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are much better in this ... although there are very few, but they are great, courtesy of Jackie Chan specialist Nicky Li. <br /> <br /> Look for a cameo by Ron Smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a tiny fight with Match. Smoorenburg is also double for Rudd. <br /> <br /> If you liked GEN-X COPS ... you'll love GEN-Y COPS!
