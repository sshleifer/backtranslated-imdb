Chen Kaige lost his sense of rhythm. I envy Europeans and Americans who can watch the film without following the dialogue with their ears, because it is painful to do so: slow, abnormally heavy and over-deliberate. But Westerners, on the other hand, suffer from the poor quality of the translation of subtitles, which manages to lose all the subtlety and double meanings that make a careful study of the film a lot of fun.
