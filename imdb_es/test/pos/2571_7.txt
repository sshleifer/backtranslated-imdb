In "Black Snake Moan," writer and director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with the heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the whole movie as pretentious: a parabola of the suffocating South with such a risky subject. The film also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being dragged into the image; once again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increases its advantage more and more until all the production is unleashed with the artificial quality of a play (and I admit, the last 15 minutes go too far in the territory "Happy Ending "for my taste). And that's not to mention the archival footage of musician Son House, who reflects on love and death (and who, of course, largely predict things to come). However, strangely, these demerits are also qualities of "Black Snake Moan", the aging story of Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently abandoned by his wife (by his brother, no less), which is nearby of death. nympho Rae (Christina Ricci, who easily offers the hottest representation of trailer waste on celluloid); Taking care of the girl so that she regains her health, she chains her to her radiator to overcome her demons and, with luck, to redeem her own fallen being. While there is a definite sexy appeal to seeing Ricci fall from her stark outfit, her acting is risky and mature, no trace of Addams can be found on Wednesday, and she is easily supported by Jackson, who personifies "the blues." in his portrait of a flawed and God-fearing man. While it lasts, the scene in which Lazaro sings to Rae a song in the middle of a thunderstorm / blackout is convincing, as is a scene inside a blues club jumping that makes you wish you were there. The stage is strong, and you can defend the literal symbolism (the chain, the radiator, the strange blurry man who pursues Rae's libido) is a deliberate consequence of superstition and spirituality. And it is the conviction with which this spirituality reproduces what lends to "Black Snake Moan" a large part of its strength: the committed performances of Jackson and Ricci make this a film that is going to tear up with, well, grace perfect While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a plot plot that he could have made without him, neither he nor the subtlety of Sledgehammer can prevent this from being a fascinatingly meditative movie.
