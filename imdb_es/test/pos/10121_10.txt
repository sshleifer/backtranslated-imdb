This is a very moving movie about life itself. The challenges that a disabled person must face in a land that expects perfection to be in the foreground so that everyone can see it and, hopefully, understand it. It must teach the fans of society that we are all human, and while some of us are endowed with a healthy mind, heart and body, there are decent human beings in the world who are not so lucky, or maybe, we 'the unfortunate' We do not always see beauty in the world because we are wrapped up in our 'blind' ambitions, and we see it only once and for all "what can this world do for me!" Maybe we all want to be like Radio, a happy and loving person ... who loves everyone.
