I've seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and every time I see it, the movie is as entertaining as the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of anti-war "hippies" from the 1960s and 1970s who live in New York City. This small group faces a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage) who has been recruited into the US Army. UU To serve in Vietnam. Despite his best efforts to dissuade him, Claude eventually reports for basic training in the Army. Still worried about leaving them, the hippie group stole a car and traveled across the United States to visit Claude "... for a couple of hours," in the words of George Berger (to an MP stationed at the front door of the Army Base Claude is temporarily stationed in Nevada). The result is really touching, so I will not spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie. The musical score is equally fantastic! Don Dacus (from the rock band Chicago), who plays "Woof," one of the hippies, is not a key character, but the film would not have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, a girl from uptown who became friends with the hippie group) is sensational in her role. YOU MUST SEE THE movie !!
