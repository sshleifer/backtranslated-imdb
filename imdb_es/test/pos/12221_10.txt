I bought the full season of Surface. I saw it in 3 days! I was so captivated by the plot, the theories and basically everything about this show. The actor who plays Miles is great. Mile's sister, father and mother acted as a real-life family would. You could connect on so many levels, it's fascinating. <br /> <br /> I think the animals are so wonderful that you can almost connect with them as a father is to a child. It would be something if there really existed a creature of this kind of nature. <br /> <br /> It saddens me that Surface does not have a second season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions that need answering and I hope that maybe they believe more or maybe in a book. <br /> <br /> I love the show. For those who have not seen Surface, if you like science fiction, you need to see this !!!!!!!!!!!!!
