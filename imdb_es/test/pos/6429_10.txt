When, oh, when will this be released on a wide-screen DVD such as Anchor Bay or Blue Underground? Le Orme, which I only know from my rare and classic habit of collecting videos, is a film from my collection that not only sat me, but also enjoyed watching. The fact that Klaus Kinski has a high level of billing, but only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (Although several comments expressed disappointment for their limited screen time). I can not say that this is a good horror movie, a good mystery, a science fiction movie or something like that. It is simply unclassifiable in the sense of "gender" of things. It is more like a confused, frightening dream (although not particularly violent or bloody), full of great images and mystery. It is based on visual effects and emotion, just like Bava "Lisa and the Devil". Both films are beautiful in almost every way, but almost impossible to describe in a logical way; both occur in a dreamlike atmosphere. Do not get discouraged with the Force Video synopsis on the back cover. It is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. Even though the release of Force Video from 1986 (the only one in the United States, to my knowledge) is trimmed to full screen on tape, even in that format it is still excellent. Your remastered release and / or mailbox would make it great (hint, hint ... DVD companies).
