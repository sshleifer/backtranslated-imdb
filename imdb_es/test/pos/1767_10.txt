This is the kind of unknown and forgotten movie that one dreams of discovering when watching old videos. It is a magnificent comic gem with bright and funny writing, embedded in the wonderful variety of characters, a wonderfully witty and funny musical score, and an ingenious and light direction from Montgomery himself. This is one to watch over and over again. Montgomery is an unimportant actor who is assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate the house of a young debutante to discover the identity of his former boyfriend, a presumed jewel thief. While the premise is quite absurd, the results are hilarious. Montgomery is the stunned plant, Ann Blyth is a marvel as the romantically obsessed, terribly serious debutante and the parade of comedic characterizations of the veteran stage actress, Jane Cowl's mother attorney and Lillian Randolph's caretaker, are fabulous. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, this only earned him an Oscar for Sound, when he deserved the best winks for Direction, Screenplay and Musical Score. <br /> <br /> DO NOT MISS IT, it's one of the best in Hollywood.
