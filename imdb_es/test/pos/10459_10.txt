Simply one of the best movies ever made. Worthy to sit next to European masterpieces such as THE RULES OF THE GAME, GRAND ILUSION, NOSTALGHIA, ANDREI ROUBLEV, 8 1/2, WINGS OF DESIRE, VIRIDIAN, THE NIGHT OF THE STARS OF TRIP, THE STRADA, ORDET, THE PASSION OF JOAN DE ARCO, THE FOUR HUNDRED PERFUMES and MADAME DE ... Both a blessing ... and an almost perfect work of art.
