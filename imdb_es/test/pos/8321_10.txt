and frankly that sums it up. <br /> <br /> It's a small computer-animated series that was filmed as an animal movie ... <br /> <br /> The animation is almost perfect (I thought the eyes of dinosaur neck swimmers long they seemed fake). <br /> <br /> However, some of the model shots did not seem so realistic ... <br /> <br /> and I thought Jurrassic Park did a better T Rex ... <br /> < If this is the kind of thing we see in a normal British television series, then I can not wait to see what they can achieve in the movies. <br /> <br /> I give this 10/10 star ... <br /> <br /> (and the video "making of" was also great ... the dinosaur on the skateboard was very good) <br /> <br /> <..>
