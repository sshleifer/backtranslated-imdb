The character Little Tramp or Little Man by Charlie Chaplin wins World War I. It was called The Great War at that time, alone, even capturing the Kaiser, something that the Allied armed forces could not do. Pity that everything becomes a dream, which is a kind of fight and the weakest part of this fascinating and silent short film (almost a film at 46 minutes). <br /> <br /> There are inventive gags in abundance. including Charlie who has to put on a gas mask to eat the Limburger cheese sent from his house, then use the cheese as a weapon against the Germans; Charlie sleeps underwater in a flooded ditch next to a soldier who continues to bother; Charlie disguises himself as a tree, one of his best sketches, and Charlie pretends to hit his friend who has become a prisoner of war, and then hugs him when the enemy is out of sight. <br /> <br /> One A surprising feature is how much Charlie, when he is behind the enemy lines disguised as German, looks like Hitler for ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs rose to dominate German politics. Obviously, Hitler modeled his appearance after the Charlie movie.
