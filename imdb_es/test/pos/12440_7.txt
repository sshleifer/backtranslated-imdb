The Happiest Days of Your Life showcases some of the best British comedy talent of its time in a traditionally ridiculous and high class fashion. In general, it is a journey through the sophistication of English behavior in school only for girls, which provides an ideal setting for specific events. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim and - more especially! - Joyce Grenfell are fantastic, they make us laugh a lot and express their absolute horror for what they have to face. As the film progresses, things become increasingly foolish with the tour of the school, as parents are an appropriate highlight. <br /> <br /> At this point, I will again mention especially Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage. She is so extraordinarily innocent, stupid, apologetic and ineffective that she seems to steal the entire movie. It offers the best laugh of the movie when flirting with a teacher ("Call me sausage!"). <br /> <br /> Although part of the film is slow or dated, and is not always very interesting, it still holds most of its brightness and barely stops for romance. Good for a silly and inoffensive giggle. <br /> <br /> 7/10
