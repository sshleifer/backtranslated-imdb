The Babette Festival, for me, has to do with healing: the repair of the schism between the spirit and the body in Orthodox Christianity. This puritan community in remote Denmark lacks an adequate appreciation of all the gifts of God in creation. They have taken St. Paul's dualism to an extreme, and they emphasize the life of the "spirit", not the life of the "flesh." Both older sisters, in their youth, were frightened by the temptation of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. They, and their parishioners, cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and the father of the sisters. The old congregation has become irritable and disputed, and the sisters do not know what to do. Enter Babette, a French stranger, and someone you can show kindness to. They have no way of knowing that they will finally return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry and dusty theology. Babette will give everything she has, and in the process, she will teach the sisters and her flock about grace, sacrifice, how sensual experience (as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist) can change lives, and why Real art moves. we so deeply When you can forgive one another, and they themselves, you can focus on the love of God that develops before them in a concrete way in the present. As a minister and artist, I can not recommend a movie anymore. True art and true grace!
