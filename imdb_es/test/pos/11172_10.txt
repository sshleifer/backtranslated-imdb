Michael Kehoe has achieved a great feat, especially considering that it is only his second start as a writer, producer and director. In general, "novices" lack vision and direction when they direct an important production, but "Dominion" shows that Kehoe is going to Hollywood. With beautiful scenery, Dominion has experienced cast members (especially Thomerson and James) who communicate Kehoe's vast vision with exceptional clarity. Few films can mix the slasher / horror genre with a genuine action / adventure feel, but Dominion achieved this completely. This film certainly qualifies as one of the best films in these two categories. If you are looking for a fast-paced action with more than a minimum of suspense, look no further. I look forward with great enthusiasm to Kehoe's future projects. Well done!!!
