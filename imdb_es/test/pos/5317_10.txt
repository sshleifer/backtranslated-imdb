This film was a masterpiece of human emotions and experiences. I think many people are trapped in the apparent mental illness of Leland as an argument, but I was attracted to the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the strength of human emotions. Much of the message of the film is that we never know the good without the bad, which is a small clich√©, but what makes this film so good and so original is that it portrays with great eloquence the overwhelming and devastating force that can have the bad. , whether you see the bad everywhere as Leland, or that you are experiencing the total impotence of unrequited love or a relationship that will not work, no matter how badly you want it. This movie captures how powerless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie you've seen, and it's as depressing as it is good.
