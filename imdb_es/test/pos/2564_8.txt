Black Snake Moan is noisy. It is excessively rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. In the continuation of Hustle & Flow, Brewer paints his portrait of the southern United States almost as a mythological land that one would expect to see in an epic fantasy or in ancient Greece. And yet, so far from us, his films are still rooted; rooted in the deepest and darkest soil there is. <br /> <br /> As in traditional fairy tales, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan using extremes and exaggerations. Sharp and rigid character traits, when combined with such extreme acts as chaining a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her from her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor in the same way that extreme techniques like some characters. The color in Pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fairytale movie. But Brewer does not start his movie with "Once Upon a Time"; In this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer presents a different fairy tale; A dark Gothic fable of sex, prostitution and, ultimately, redemption. These themes run through the veins of the film like blood and resonate and bloom in their dark and melancholic surroundings. <br /> <br /> But despite these extreme extremes, Brewer treats his characters as human beings, and creates extremely well executed, three dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, particularly emphasized with his relationships with Lazerus' friend At the pharmacy, Angela and Rae's mother. <br /> <br /> The performance is, in general, quite perfect. One has the feeling that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characterizations are so intense and so severe; It is even harder for actors to keep their heads and create realistic characters. And they achieve it admirably. Samuel L. Jackson, in particular, disappears completely in his character, which serves as a polar opposite to most of the characters he has previously played. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft and others, he has created for himself a box of "bad-ass ultimate". In Black Snake, Moan Jackson plays an old character, broken, defeated and earthy, quite different from everything he has done before. And, frankly, it's just fantastic. However, what is surprising is the casting of Justin Timberlake and, more specifically, the fact that it is presented as quite tolerable. Of course he does not have much time in front of the screen, but like what Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he actually makes Timberlake act and do what he's supposed to do, and not show him so little. convincing and irritating. <Br /> <br /> But the really incredible thing about the film is the atmosphere Brewer creates. Southern rural locations work to their advantage in creating a dark, dirty, grimy, crisp and rough texture for the entire film, which fits with the thematic and metaphorical aspects of the film. And by using all sorts of elements, such as the growing sound of cicadas when Rae feels his itching, or a storm of rage that increases and intensifies as Lazarus plays his blues number "Black Snake Moan" for Rae, Brewer really manages to create almost a fantasy. World, a mythology undermined by the rural environment of the south. And it works absolutely fantastic to create the unique vision of Brewer. <br /> <br /> And you can not talk about a Craig Brewer movie without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow, he used a soundtrack of hip-hop music on the street and dirty to emphasize the environment and vision. In this film, music works even better to polish and completely represent the unique environment. It's a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, driest, dirtiest blues you've ever heard. And it sounds absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> In general, it can be said that this movie had been a simple story of an old, broken, lonely, God fearing, black blues singer who redeems a young white woman who was sexually abused when she was child and now suffers from nymphomania, there may not have been much to write about. But this movie is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, as they are made in the film independently. No, this movie is about vision? And what a unique vision it is! It's about the atmosphere, the mythology, the environment. It's about anger, fear, redemption, and most importantly, blues. And everything is wrapped in a unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable ribbon. Brewer has secured a place on the list of most promising and promising directors, and with a solid follow-up to a great debut film, Hustle & Flow, it will definitely be on my radar for future projects. <Br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that the movie has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I've heard so far.
