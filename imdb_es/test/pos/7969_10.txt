Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing more than shooting and fighting! For people who say they do not take pictures as they usually do. Well, this is really hard! David Bradley is really good and his character suffers blows in the movie. He is hit by the stick more than a dozen times, is stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again, is beaten, recovers and is ready for more action. Your character is incredibly tuff! Charles Napier was also very good and possibly steals the show! Vernen Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka had a short and non-accredited role in Hard Justice! As for the action, it's really amazing with all the gun fights and in the beginning, the big scene like the one in the background makes the cars explode and move in the air! There is so much happening in the 95 minute run time. For fans of the action, they will be impressed by all the firepower and struggle that this film has to offer! Hard Justice is a film that is not easy to locate and if you are in a video store and you see it for sale, buy it because this movie is a great guardian and, besides, the box is great! There is a lot of action that you have to see to believe! Look and see if you can find good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! I highly recommend any action movie fan who loves to film ems and fight movies and who has been disappointed by other movies that look like a real non-stop action movie, but does not offer them to get Hard Justice.
