This short film, which won an Oscar, gave rise to two sequels and a television cartoon program, has minimal animation but an excellent script (by Theodore Geisel, aka, Dr. Seuss), and even a more memorable main character and charming. UPA pioneered an animation style that even influenced Disney in the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts made in the late 1940s and 1950s. This is one of their best. May God have it printed. Highly recommended
