Seth McFarlane is a true genius. He has created a program that is witty, culturally sharp and simply frankly fun. <br /> <br /> For those who think that their 'offensive' stance on social or cultural issues does not make meaningful comments, it only causes 'offenses', you can point to this quote: <br /> <br /> Peter ( leaving the stem cell laboratory): How long were I there? // Guard: five minutes. // Peter: Why are not we funding this?!? <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Thank you, family guy, for being not only the most entertaining television program (with the possibility of the much-loved, very missed future), but also for being smart enough to boot.
