I absolutely adored this movie. For me, the best reason to see it is the stark contrast to legal dramas like "Boston Legal" or "Ally McBeal" or even "LA Law". This is the reality. The law is not BS, he won in some final argument or through a ridiculous defense he gets out of his ass, like the "Chewbacca defense" in South Park.) This is a real farce of justice, the legal system went terribly wrong, and the work of GOOD lawyers, not the timid stereotype, which uses all its abilities to correct it. It will do more to restore your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra film or MATE TO MOCKINGBIRD. And most importantly, I cried. During the film, during the party included at the end of the DVD, it is incredible. Wonderfully made wonderful movie Thank God the filmmakers did it.
