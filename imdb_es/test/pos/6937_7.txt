"You can not take it realistically." -sheets <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world of its own. I have never really seen anything like it. The only thing I can think to compare it with psychedelic drugs. Forgive the clich√©? I do not mean simply that it is incoherent and absurd, although occasionally it is. I mean it takes you through such a wide range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly that they overwhelm you, and when it ends, you discover that everything happened while you were sitting on the couch. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that it is very low budget, as a disclaimer for those who, after watching "Shaun of the Dead", consider themselves fans of underground zombie movies . It is also noteworthy that it is much more "brutal" than you would expect. The children are destroyed, and someone mocks a teenager before shooting him in the groin. His body is later "raped". Certainly, these are not defects, and in fact I think it's a merit of the movie. But if it does not sound like your kind of movie, do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I do not want to exaggerate, with regard to brutality, do not wait. "Inside" or something like that.) I hesitate to give something of the argument, because it's really full of surprises. Even the initial scene, which has nothing to do with zombies, is both a classic horror scene and something quite original. <br /> <br /> Man, I have three paragraphs and I have hardly said anything. . Here's why I thought the movie was amazing: 1. It's big and keeps moving. At one point, you expect it to become another clone of NotLD, a board-up-the-windows movie where everyone stays on a farm and they argue among themselves. By the end of the film, however, the farm scenes will seem like a distant dream. There is also a series of urban outdoor scenes. These are rare in low budget zombie movies. <br /> <br /> 2. The makeup / gore is much better than ZB1. More convincing and more creative. Something funny: the first zombies look very bad. Then, in the middle, suddenly they look very good, with prosthesis and everything. Some of them resemble Fulci zombies, some remember Mr. Lengua from "Day of the Dead". And it has great scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling. It never ages. <br /> <br /> 3. There is something strangely emotional about it. A character affirms that heaven exists and that our dead / undead protagonists are now in heaven. In the context of the film, we believe it is true. Even though the characters behave with the typical stupidity of the horror movie, they seem to really care about each other and, consequently, I've worried about them. <br /> <br /> 4. The pace is great. There is hardly a dull moment. <br /> <br /> My only observation that borders on criticism is that Todd Sheets comes up with the strangest dialogue he has ever heard. Personally, I think that adds to the experience, but I do not think I do it on purpose, so I can not give the movie a perfect score. (Example: When a car breaks down, the owner shouts at the passengers, then says something in the sense of "I'm sorry, I yelled at you, you do not know what it's like to have your father standing over you with a straight razor when you are five years old. "wtf?) In the end, it becomes more than I can handle. It involves a montage with Bill Clinton, and then some final preacher credits that explain the zombie metaphor. Actually, at this point, I was firmly reviving my experiences with drugs. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 7/10.
