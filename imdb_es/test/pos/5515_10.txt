A lot of people give a lot of shit to this movie, and all that is really undeserved. People give this film a hard time because it is such a sick subject or because they insist on some technical aspect of the film that nobody else watches when they see it. Yes, just look at the cover, you think this movie will make you feel uncomfortable ... DO NOT GO! However, you would be missing one of the best cinematographic experiences of the late 1990s, despite what others say. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is wonderful here as Captain Howdy, the depth of the madness he goes to. Playing this character has to be beyond words, and it is much further away than any of us would have to be willing to go. The performance here is wonderful. The film itself beautifully filmed. The subject may be too much for many to swallow, but it's still worth it. If you have not seen this movie, take a look.
