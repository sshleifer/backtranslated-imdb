For me, or to break a love story is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click among them. Matt is quite unpleasant: distant, boastful, seemingly lazy and a misogynist. His dysfunctional mother has hurt him badly and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction, it was credible. He overcompensated by boasting of having nailed Amy. He acts so well with Amy that he struck out twice. When they speak, they can not show him who he really is. She gives him empathy and then knocks him down at the right times. She seems so mature and strong that the features of her that came out afterwards did not seem to fit. (For me.) I found her incredibly sexy and pretty. . . Pretty girl next door, I call him. So I was going to like this movie unless it really got ruined. <br /> <br /> Fun things happen with the coach, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. The football scenes at the end were disconcerting. Matt does not carry the ball but seems to be blocking his back. Friends, he is not the right size! He is fifty pounds too light for that position. But I thought his acting was skillful. I measure it by the way I wanted to twist his neck a couple of times during his scenes with Meredith Monroe. The movie was fine. Meredith M was better than everything.
