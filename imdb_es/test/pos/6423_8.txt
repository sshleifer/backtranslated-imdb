I saw this movie many years ago, I tried to locate it, but maybe it is understandable that it is not found anywhere. It was so esoteric and yet one of the few movies that stays with you for a long time. I'm still not sure what the reality of the film is, and perhaps, like the Uncertainty Principle, darkness is the definite. Acting is excellent, the atmosphere is always filled with a feeling of foreboding, a general melancholy pervades, and yet it is difficult not to be absorbed by history. I rented it thinking it was science fiction (it was in the science fiction section with some totally deceptive propaganda), but clearly it is not. Or the horror, or even the suspense. In fact, one feels grateful that the director has had the courage to make a film like this, for which, obviously, there is no solid audience. I know that some people have complained about the brief role of Klaus Kinski, but I think it is very appropriate: his limited exposure is critical to the formation of the mystery of this film.
