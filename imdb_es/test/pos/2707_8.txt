Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about the complex life of the singer Karen Carpenter. Although it fails to give accurate data and details. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb (plays Karen) was not a good choice. She is a good actress, but she plays a very naive and silly Karen Carpenter. I think the paper needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. <br /> <br /> The role of Louise Fletcher as Agnes Carpenter is excellent, she does a great job as Karen's mother. <br /> <br /> It has excellent songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately they were not, although this movie was on top of the ratings in the United States and other countries
