This is the classic Disney in its best live action cartoon! Clumsy college student Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) develops a mysterious liquid invisibility formula that makes objects disappear and helps him save his college with little money. Further experimentation reveals that it also works surprisingly well in humans! The surprising discovery of Riley takes new and funny turns when a group of delinquents headed by the notorious A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) steals the formula and tries to use it for his less legal activities. The dazzling special effects and a fast-paced story make this animated film a case of college comedy textbook! I love this movie! This movie has always filled me with wonder and joy. A nice little comedy that the whole family can enjoy. Not much violence or sex and absolutely no oath, makes this a film that parents can see with their children. Only one of a series of Kurt Russell films set at Medvale College. A nice little series set in a healthy America before terrorists, when people value integrity more than cash. I recommend this movie!
