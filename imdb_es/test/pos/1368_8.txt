Man, I can not believe the hard and negative comments of this movie. Well, surely it is not a sophisticated work of cinematographic art. But it's quite entertaining fun. To begin with, the supernatural assassin with the head of a pumpkin holder has to be one of the most ridiculously ridiculous and irresponsible things that have been found in front of a camera; It looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival ghost house. Secondly, the moderate gore is ridiculously false and unconvincing, with the definitive highlight that occurs when this annoying and ultra-conservative woman is electrocuted with a toaster. Then there is the always welcome presence of the always lovely Linnea Quigley, who in a memorable way presented herself taking a nice, long and totally free shower lasting two minutes. Surprisingly, we also have appearances of the legends of the deceased Schlock image, John Carradine as an evil sorcerer and Cameron Mitchell as a horror television presenter. In addition, screaming queens Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have fleeting cameos. The main child actor Ryan Latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of an old tree stump with mold. The beautiful brunette Rachel Carter takes off her shirt and discovers her cute little breasts. Raw special effects are decidedly less than special. The score is adequately saturated. However, in general, this movie has an attractive hokey that makes it a really delicious honey to watch.
