Very good film of 1939 where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. The problem is that the killer and Garfield's girl, Ann Sheridan, in a brief but good performance, die while trying to elude the police. <br /> <br /> A crooked lawyer persuades Garfield to flee New York. He lands in Arizona and meets the Dead End Kids ... They've been sent there for a financing program to keep them out of trouble. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garfield finds a new love interest but he must hide his identity like everyone else. He thinks that he was not only the killer, but that he was also the victim in the car accident. <br /> <br /> Robson may be fabulous as the kind of grandmother who runs the place for the young rebel. Claude Rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that Garfield is still alive and chases him when he takes a picture of him in Arizona. <br /> <br /> The movie really is about Garfield's relationship with children. While the ending is good, you want to see Garfield return to N.Y. to proclaim his innocence.
