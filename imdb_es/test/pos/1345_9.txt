Oh, my God!!! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid childhood memories of the 70s. Two hippie girls with pigtails, Carole and Paula swung on swings, told jokes about the patch of laughter, disguised themselves with the costumes they found in a chest giant called The Storybox, and they argued with a pink squirrel called Sherlock who lived in one. of your trees. They could also play an acoustic guitar and sing a beautiful melody. This was a great childhood show. Very 70s feeling. But that's the problem: they no longer DO programs like this. It's a shame that. You could say that these two girls really had hearts of gold and loved children, they were very sweet. MAGIC GARDEN is one of those programs that, if they came out with a box, people would buy it, because it is a MELLOW that walks by Memory Lane.
