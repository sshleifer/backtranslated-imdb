"D.O.A" is a small entertaining and entertaining image from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his best caustic; and, unfortunately, Quaid is one of the most underutilized talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, it really does not have much impact. <br /> <br /> The film is directed with elegance in everything, drawing a series of influences to capture Your 'queer' sensation. Would you give credit that it is actually run by two people? The answer is no. All this is very elegant, from its innovative camera work to its blatant use of black and white photography. All these elements help to keep the procedures updated. <br /> <br /> Actually, the biggest emotion here is having it with the dialogue, it's fast but complex, it does not waste a word and, nevertheless, it manages to be entertaining. The script for this is like a pocket piece of art. <br /> <br /> This went unnoticed for me for centuries before I finally discovered it late at night. If this is the first time you hear it, do not leave it like I did! Capture it soon, it really is top notch ...! <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a solid genre movie that manages to surprise you at all times, this really fits perfectly. <Br /> <br />
