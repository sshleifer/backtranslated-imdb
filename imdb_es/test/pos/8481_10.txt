Jamie Foxx is absolutely Ray Charles. His performance is simply great. He owns the movie, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire". In fact, it is difficult to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being played and not played by man himself. Ray Charles is legendary. He is well established as a musician and the music is deep, complex and innovative, even more innovative than he thought before watching this movie. The film should make new fans of a young audience can enter it knowing little about their music. The life of Ray Charles provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes beyond being just another movie about a musician. I confess I knew very little about man's life until I saw this movie. I came away impressed with the courage, strength and innovation of Ray Charles as a man and musician.
