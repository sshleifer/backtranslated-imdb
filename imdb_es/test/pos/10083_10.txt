This is a cut above other films of the genre: genuinely suspenseful, intelligent, bright and visually stunning. Yes, the plot can be confusing, but that is partly what makes it so much impact. Look twice if you can. You will get almost as much of seeing it when you know the turn of the first time. <br /> <br /> Do not be discouraged by the fact that this movie comes from Korea. a country not very familiar to most Western audiences. While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are too universal: guilt, anger, loss, insanity and retribution. All of these are handled superbly by Lim Su-jeong as Su-mi, the main character. Also worthy of special mention is Yum Jung-ah, who offers a deeply spooky and disturbing performance as the stepmother. <br /> <br /> While it has its moments of fear, this is not really a horror movie as most people would imagine. It is more a story of psychological suspense with an element of mystery. It catches you from the beginning and will keep you guessing until the end, and possibly beyond!
