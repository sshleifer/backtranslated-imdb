John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, Arsene Lupine. While nobody is sure that this is the case, the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure of it, but can not prove it. Then, Lionel spends much of the film following John, hoping to capture this brilliant and slippery thief. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the movie, I really believe that I had higher expectations and I thought it could be better. That's just because he paired John and Lionel Barrymore in the film and since these brothers were such dynamic actors, I think I expected sparks and magic, but instead I only glimpsed this here and there. Now, this does not mean it's a bad movie, it certainly is not. It just did not reach the level of being unforgettable or a movie that I recommend seeing. Thanks to a suitable script, the movie is quite good, but I was surprised not to hear any French accent in the film even though it was supposedly French people. Also, there simply was not much life in the movie until it was almost complete. The ending was really excellent and entertaining, so good that it raised the film from 6 to 7. It's good to see it ended on a high note.
