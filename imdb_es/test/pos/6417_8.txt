The prints are certainly not your average Giallo mill race, and that's not bad. Unlike his previous effort, The Fifth Cord (which was his 'classic' Giallo), Luigi Bazzoni's film abandons almost all of Giallo's trademarks and not murder; The focus is very much on the psychological mystery. It is obvious from the beginning that this will be a completely strange movie, since the movie starts with a scene set on the moon. Things do not clear up after that, since the lunar sequence turns out to be the dream of Alicia, a woman with problems. Alice is tormented by the dreams of an astronaut beached on the moon, which apparently comes from a movie called "Footprints on the Moon." After several things go wrong, Alice decides to go to an old desert tourist place called Garma. Upon arrival, she is surprised that the people she knows seem to already know her. Alice also meets a young redhead who also seems to know her; the girl tells Alice that she looks exactly like Nicole, except that she is prettier and with shorter hair ... <br /> <br /> The fact that Footprints does not have much in sex, murder and other trademarks of Giallo puts it somehow on the back foot with its main audience from the beginning, since most people who enter this film will not get what they expected (or, probably, wanted). But, on the other hand, Footprints demands respect for the fact that it does not just follow what happened before. By 1975, Giallo had begun to lose its popularity and many of the films that came out of this period (with some very notable exceptions) were simply retreaded from what was coming before, so Luigi Bazzoni would have had a great opportunity in this film. . Florinda Bolkan gives a strong performance in the main role; and the fact that she is not the most beautiful Giallo heroine is not really important. The mystery unfolds very well throughout, and although it can be a bit turgid at times; Footprints is, in general terms, intriguing for duration. It is probably not a surprise for many once they arrive there that the end does not make much sense and does not really clarify anything; but it adds very well to the bizarre cult value of the film, and in general; I give my approval to Footprints!
