This is a better entry than the average in the Saint series. He keeps his interest and, as the mysteries should be, keeps him guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from. <br /> <br /> Many films of the Golden Age is not for everyone, especially younger viewers. They are dated by clothes, cars, stages, etc. Who today asks for a highball? Or do you wear a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was much simpler: there must have been a shortage of lawyers at the time. Frankly, a lot of courage is missing in those days. <br /> <br /> In any case, go and enjoy. It's good, in an old-fashioned sense.
