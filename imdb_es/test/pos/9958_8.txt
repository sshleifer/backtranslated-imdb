"The Merchant of Venice" was one of the most popular works of Shakespeare during his own life, but has gone through difficult times during the twentieth century due to its undeniable anti-Semitic content. The work has also been called schizoid in its journey from comic scenes to tragic scenes, which leads some to say that they are two works that try to coexist as one. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in "Shakespeare in Love") is in love with Portia (Lynn Collins, excellent), but he needs to ask for a considerable amount of money to woo her. He addresses his gay lover at some point, Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who does not have the funds for himself, but gets a loan from the Jewish usurer Shylock (Al Pacino). Shylock is amused and offended that Antonio, who insults him because of his religion, now goes to him for money, but offers it, with the condition that the fine for breach of the loan be a pound of Antonio's flesh. Which is, of course, what happens. Bassanio and Portia offer Shylock much more than the original loan instead of the pound of meat, but Shylock, bewildered after his daughter leaves him and marries a Christian, refuses to accept it. Portia, in a scene in which the public is never sure where to place their sympathies, deprives Shylock of what should be legally his, and then takes away his wealth and religion. Shylock was originally rehearsed as a caricatured villain, but modern actors and directors have turned him into a tragic figure, who opposes the injustices of sixteenth-century Venice. Al Pacino does an excellent job as Shylock, and Jeremy Irons is good as Antonio, but I think that Lynn Collins's work as Portia is the best part of the play. Portia is one of the few notable female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is wonderful in the part. However, Joseph Fiennes is more than a little bored; I have never particularly enjoyed his often overloaded acting style. I give him "The merchant of Venice" an 8/10.
