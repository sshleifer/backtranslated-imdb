I can be a sentimentalist. But I found this movie really touching. It was the first movie that made me cry. And he did it more than once! I recommend it to anyone as gay as str8. Religious or not! Support for co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with its liners. The nude scenes were also very well crafted, and all were in good taste. Most striking was the description of the de-programming by reversion of orientation instituted by the Mormon church to the main character. I was surprised that this still continues in the world. However I really enjoyed this movie. This is definitely the best gay movie since Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movie he offers that year: The Fluffer.
