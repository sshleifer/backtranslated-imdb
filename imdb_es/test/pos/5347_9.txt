Imaginative, fast-paced, satirical! Americans go "crazy," but Britons make it "witty," and they love to make fun of themselves (eg, unattractive teeth, big lips / nose, common 'veddy' snobby or 'veddy', obsession with ' gahden '). Internal jokes for the elderly in the audience, a lot of action for the children. Subtle use of devices from other classic movies (look for 'Back to the Future', 'Indiana Jones ..', 'Harvey', 'Tremors' ... and more). In addition, an ingenious movie of "amigos" (Gromit is a calm, but ingenious companion). Add the brilliant voice work of Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (is it true? Is the best performance these days done in animation?) Enjoy! I saw him with the grandchildren. Fun time for everyone. - canuckteach
