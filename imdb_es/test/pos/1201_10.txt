I'm not a big music fan, but this is one of the few that I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as "The Sound of Music", none of the songs are about free themes. Each song is a social commentary, a vision of war, sexuality, recalcitation, spirituality and freedom. The especially amazing songs are "Easy To Be Hard", "Age of Acarius", "Hair", "Flesh Failures / 3-5-0-0", "Walking In Space" and "Hare Krishna". Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can not wait to see it live someday!
