What a shame if you give this movie a low rating. How is it possible that you do not like a movie that has Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, silly rubber monsters, fights? A lot of who said my mother "Was not chosen because of the color of her eyes", lava, silly wigs and a Victorian drilling machine very similar to the one used in the old series of Thunderbirds? Whoever saw this movie and threw it out, was watching it for the wrong reasons. It may be crap, but it's definitely a good shit. They do not do them like they used to, they sigh ...
