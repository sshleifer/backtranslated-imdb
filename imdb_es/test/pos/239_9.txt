One of my favorite musicals that are not from MGM is a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty jumps off the screen. Gene Kelly shows her dance skills and presents the musicals with her avant-garde and innovative choreography that would eventually change the way musicals are choreographers. Phil Silvers is the perfect second banana, and Eve Arden injects this film with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era in which the main Broadway shows come from Movies, Cover Girl has not been adapted for the theater.
