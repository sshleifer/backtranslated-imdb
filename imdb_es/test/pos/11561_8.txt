Well ... it's 2005 and when you finally see this movie, you'll probably exclaim that it's dated. But here's the point, the script was bold, the exposure of the music industry at that time was also so bold ... and it took a while for the music created by African-Americans to be promoted to the same level. How white works In some cases it still is, but in the 70s, this film tackled some of the "antecedents" that many never knew. Now we have "American Idol" - "Pop Idol" and other similar things that allow us to enter the minds of "record executives" and how they think they should market something that sells and not market talent. <br /> As a child, I loved the Earth, Wind and Fire version of "That's the way of the world", which contained some of his greatest hits: "Shining Star", "Reasons", " Yeanin ', Learnin' "and the title. Little did I know it was a SOUND BAND of a MOVIE ... until I moved to Los Angeles and got the wonderful "Z" Channel. <br /> <br /> Channel "Z" showed this film as part of a "Harvey Keitel" retrospective. Wow, I had no idea that Harvey Keitel made so many movies, and when I saw this one, he surprised me. This film is not a cinematic masterpiece, but deserves more merit than it got. It's a nice little movie. More than a "piece of vanity" for Earth, Wind and Fire, Harvey Keitel does a great job as a ripped record executive trying to "fight the system". There are many lessons to be learned from this, and a lot of "inside information" that was exposed. <br /> <br /> If you can find this without cutting ... it's worth seeing.
