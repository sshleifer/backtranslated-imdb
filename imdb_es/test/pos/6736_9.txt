Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey provide wonderful performances here when Jonathan Silverman, like Eugene, recounts his life on Brighton Beach in 1937. <br /> <br /> What makes the film so good is the relationship between the characters with an extremely wonderful background. Family values. <br /> <br /> Bob Dishy had a wonderful opportunity here as the father of the clan. It gives a moderate but convincing performance as the patriarch of the family. <br /> <br /> His children played by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger are fabulous. There are certain scenes in which Silverman is skating or jumping where I remember Jerry Lewis. <br /> <br /> As for Danner and Ivey, they are also wonderful. Their gestures, intonation and idealism of the Jewish culture are beautifully done by them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply wonderful. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Even when the inevitability of war loomed, the film is rich in many of the typical problems faced by families in that period. In a sense, you do not have to be a Jew to experience what the family is going through. <br /> <br /> A must see for nostalgic fans, and those of us who firmly believe in family values.
