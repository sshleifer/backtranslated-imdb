The French Babbette appears in the modest house of two Danish sisters, wet, cold and alone. Fleeing the revolution in Paris, he seeks refuge in a dark religious community on the coast of Jutland, whipped by the wind. <br /> <br /> Without the knowledge of those who so generously welcomed her, she is a great chef, an artist of food. Babette is delivered to her adopted community through savings, productivity and shared faith. She leaves only when she wins the French lottery: 10,000 francs. She returns loaded with exotic cargoes, the ingredients of a single meal that commemorates the birthday of the sister's father, the founder of the community. <br /> <br /> This food is darkly glimpsed in the minds of the faithful who deny pleasure, but its subtleties are translated by an old military officer who, as a young man in Paris, learned to appreciate the sensory experience that develops here. Food is the climax of the film, a communion of love in the transitory art of food, which does not cease to be stimulating about art, love and the meaning of life.
