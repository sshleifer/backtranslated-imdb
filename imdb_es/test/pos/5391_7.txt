Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. Directed by Stuart Heisler, the photograph is by Ernest Haller and the duties of the pen corresponded to John Twist. Produced from Warner Brothers, Dallas was filmed vividly in Technicolor from the ranches of Iverson and Warner in California. Very a film with its tongue firmly in the cheek, the film is a throwback to the westerns of yesteryear that exist without pretensions or meanings of deep penetration. <br /> <br /> The plot sees Renegade of the Civil War of Cooper, Blayde "Reb" Hollister, fakes his own death to nullify his reputation and free himself to pursue in Dallas the brothers who massacred his family. In essence, a routine plot, the story of Twist is encouraged along the way with many fun and exciting funs. There are role changes, elegant fashions, activities on horseback, shots, a love triangle, vigorous dialogues and small skillful turns to avoid that the piece is only painted with numbers. <br /> <br /> It seems that Cooper is also having fun. which further improves the feeling of a good factor in the offer. It is true that he is not asked to do anything more than be a laconic guy on a mission. But when asked to perform action tasks, he delivers the goods that his fans expect during his successful career. The villains entertain {particularly Vil and dopey of Bryant Marlow by Steve Cochran} because each one has its own little peccadillos to keep them from becoming tasteless. The two ladies of the piece look beautiful and hold up well between machismo, while the high production value allows Haller to really treat the eyes with the lush Technicolor and involve the camera work around the locations. <br /> <br /> is ideal to be a list A Oater does Dallas, something that simply can not reach. But it is not for lack of attempts and the final result is pure entertainment, which, in truth, should be enjoyed in the cold winter days when the viewer needs to be picked up. 7/10
