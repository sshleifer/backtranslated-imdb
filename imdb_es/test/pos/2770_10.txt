I'm absolutely disgusted that this movie does not sell. Everyone who loves this movie should send an email to Disney and increase the demand. Eventually they would have to sell it. I would like to buy copies for everyone I know. Everything and everyone in this movie did a good job, and I have not figured out why Disney has not put this movie on DVD or VHS in rental stores. At least I have not seen any copies. This is a good perverse movie and must be seen by everyone. The children of the new generation do not see it and I think they should. At least it should be put back in the channel. This movie does not deserve a cheap download. He deserves the real. I am sending you an email now. This movie will be on DVD.
