It is true that this is not a realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre that I look for realism. What counts is that the characters are nice and, as necessary, sexy. Shalom is beautiful and relaxed and Jake Weber is handsome in a casual way. They have enough chemistry to make the story credible in the area that counts, sexual attraction. I would love to see some of them in another movie. And yes, the clown is pretty cute too.
