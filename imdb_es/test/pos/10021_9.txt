A jewel of a caricature of the silent era: it was rediscovered by CARTOON NETWORK, and probably was broadcast for the first time in decades, if ever it has. Assorted cameos ... Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitoes; Will Hays makes a visit as "boss" of Static Studios; as well as the appearances of Chaplin, Keaton and William S. Hart. The image of the chewing gum that decimates the population's shoes (an idea to make money for the almost bankrupt shoe of Felix = chief seller) can not be described; It must be seen. A fabulous cultural gem.
