Doctor Who is incredible. It's everyone's cup of tea. It must be. The children will like the monsters and the action and the adventure, and the girls will like the emotion and the feelings that surround them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was extraordinary as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is also very witty and funny and is very nice to watch. <br /> <br /> But now Billie is gone and Rose is trapped in a parallel universe with her boyfriend Mickey and her mother and father (he died when Rose was a baby, but this Pete Tyler is from the Parallel universe) . It will be very strange that Martha is the new partner, since I have only seen her with Rose (apart from the fugitive girlfriend with Catherine Tate). > <br /> But nobody can beat Rose!
