Semper Fi! I saw "The D.I." in 1957. Two and a half years later, I joined the Corps. <br /> <br /> Web and the company did the best they could in '57. Boot, in '59, was more like, in fact, exactly like, the Boot Camp that is shown in "Full Metal Jacket" - Yes. A black recruit, in my training squad, was called "Snowball". They called me "palo" because it was as thin as a handrail. Each recruit had a nickname, some pretty vile, that remained with him through his service in the Corps. Receiving a slap or a blow to the ass when you made a mistake was SOP. "Go down, and give me fifty," it has to be boring. Then, it became "Drop it and give me two hundred!" <br /> <br /> The IDs were a group of sadistic bastards, but it was a controlled sadism, and for the main purpose of keeping us stupid MoFos alive when we faced combat. 200 years of experience were rooted in that "sadism", and in everything the D.I. He had, or said, a purpose oriented to his mission. <br /> <br /> A bad D.I. Get grunts killed. A good D.I., although apparently the greatest imbecile in the world, keeps them alive. You can not kill the enemy if you are dead. <br /> <br /> In case you did not know it, the Marine Corps has a primary mission: to kill the enemy. PFD. <br /> <br /> Everything else is pure bravo sierra. <br /> <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC (ret)
