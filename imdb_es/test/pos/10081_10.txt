Is this a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, what did you expect from a movie called "BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND"? <br /> <br /> It is a movie of "BABES in BIKINI" and has no pretensions to be otherwise. Given, this is not "A ROOM WITH A VIEW" or "SCHINDLER LIST". If you wanted a movie like "A Room With a View" then you would not be watching Beach Babes from Beyond. But if you're looking for a good Babes in Bikini movie without a plot, this is for you. This film fulfills what it promises and something more. It's pure 100% adolescent fun. <br /> <br /> There were many BABES inside and outside the bikinis. The movie was quite fun and great to watch. These were some of the most beautiful women I've seen in home videos. <br /> <br /> All children in high school should see at least one bad movie like this one. This is actually one of the most memorable movies I've seen in my life. So without shame, I say it again ... If you're going to see only one movie of "Babes in Bikini", it's this one.
