After seeing Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. <br /> <br /> The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent movie (it's not Van Damme's best, but it's definitely not the worst). The cast of VD support, but it makes sense. <br /> <br /> The story and the plot have been done before, so it's nothing new. I mean, this is Van Damme. We really do not expect much of an incredible plot, right? So let's talk about what we all want to see in this movie anyway: the fight. <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything, I thought that the way the fights and the shooting were filmed were well done, much better than a few. from recent VD movies, like Second in Command, in which the whole final fight is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you've seen Undisputed 2, he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it. Some of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of the oldest things in VD, which is what we all want to see. The fights were good, and I said "hah, incredible" out loud a few times. But I was just waiting a little longer considering how good I thought Undisputed was. <br /> <br /> Something I found intriguing was VD's daughter in the movie, I thought "wow she's a little sexy", come to discover it It's Bianca Van Varenberg, JC's real-life daughter. I had never seen it before, so it was a good gift. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not bad at all. Yes, the story has been done before, but at least JC was trying to make a good movie. However, next time, add more hand-to-hand combat. I think he still has what it takes to make another big-budget movie ... his acting has improved since he's doing DTV and he's really in very good shape at age 47. I do not know you, but I'm one of those who think that most of their DTVs are really good, with the exception of Derailed. All you need to do is get back in the form of "bloody sport" and make a martial arts movie ... and I think people would respond well even if it's not a Li jet. This movie is definitely worth the rent. =)
