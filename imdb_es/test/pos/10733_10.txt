Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of a marriage breakup and the consequences of it. They can be devastating for peers and even more so for a younger child who in this case is played by Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about Kramer versus Kramer is their greatest strength as a movie. It's the way that parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep present themselves to the audience as complete people with many aspects of their nature. Although the film is skewed in the direction of Hoffman and more about his relationship with his son, he does not present himself as any kind of saint, nor is Streep a completely black villain. Hoffman is a man oriented towards his career in the advertising game. He has almost ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, yet it is a big shock to him when Streep says that love is no longer there and that she wants to leave. She also wants to stop being a mother, at least for a while. <br /> <br /> Hoffman and Henry do the best they can. The pressure of being both parents causes Hoffman to lose his job and he has to pay a lower one at another agency. At that time, after more than a year, Streep decides he wants custody. <br /> <br /> Both parents make convincing witnesses and express their case beautifully, but in these situations, the bond always breaks down in favor of the mother. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won the first of the two Oscars respectively for this film, she in the category of supporting actress. I'm not sure how these things are decided, Streep gets less screen time than Hoffman if that is the determining factor. The film focuses on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his understanding that he is partly to blame for the failure of the marriage. As for Meryl, it is Hob's choice for her, as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. The conflict in your psyche is recorded for everyone to see on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's possible that Dustin Hoffman won that Oscar in part for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked up the first one, by performing the impossible task of not letting A scene of child theft steal the movie. The children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and Henry is great because he presents himself as a real boy, not as a Hollywood kid. I wonder if Hoffman saw the Brave Captains and saw how Spencer Tracy treated Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done much worse than the Spencer Tracy channel in his performance. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs. Kramer also won an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults who fall in love and try to deal with them the best they can for themselves and their children. Do not miss it if it is ever transmitted.
