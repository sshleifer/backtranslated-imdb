I do not really like reality, but this is exceptional because in the end, the viewer gets something useful as well as entertainment. I do not have children, but the SuperNanny lessons will be very helpful when (and if) I ever have them. My only complaint is that the program has been diluted since it was made in the United States. I prefer the British version, with the most severe approach of the nanny. Is it me or does anyone else think that the US version? UU It's a bit soft ... now it's the "kindest and gentlest" babysitter? I guess the Yankees need a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine come down after all. However, there is nothing wrong with a happy and happy ending, right?
