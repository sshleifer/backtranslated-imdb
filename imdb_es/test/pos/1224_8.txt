This is a decent movie. Although it is a little short of time for me, it contains a lot of action, guts, common sense and emotions in that time frame. Matt Dillon and the other main character do a great job in this movie. The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the film. It's not a typical Hollywood CGI fantasy action movie, but it was a very satisfying movie for the price. My evening was great because of this movie. This film is directly a traditional action movie with great acting, history and direction. I would recommend this movie. The character development of the characters was good and makes you believe that we are really seeing a real event taking place. Because this movie I think was made with a cheaper budget, the acting and the quality were much higher.
