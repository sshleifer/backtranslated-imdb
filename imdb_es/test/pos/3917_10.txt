This was the best movie I've seen in my life, the action was excellent, and I was so scared there was a lot of blood. WHAT MADE IT GREAT, I would see it 1,000 times more, and Paris Hilton, D * MN would do well in that movie. But anyway, I would recommend it to anyone, even children (like me). Adults like it. However, you are likely to have nightmares at night, but on top of that, IT IS AWESOME, SINGLED TO STOP ARRIVING ALONG. ALWAYS ALWAYS SUGGESTING WHEN I LISTENED, BRAGGED AND BRAGGED and at school I gave the brochure saying: May 6 wax I see it. I have all my school in it. But anyway, I would definitely say BE 6 wax house, be there It will kill you.
