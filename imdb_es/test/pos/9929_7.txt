Often considered the last "great" film by Argento, this entry in the giallo canon is undoubtedly better than any other Argento film that has followed it (although he has not yet seen "Mother of Tears"), but to call it his last "Great" movie could be stretching it a bit. <br /> <br /> The directorial and stylistic style, the hallmark of all the Argento films, is in fact present, with some of its suspense sequences that are at their best (the sequence of the "peephole" ) is especially memorable), and Ronnie Taylor's photo is outstanding (fluorescent lighting is beautiful). <br /> <br /> However, the narrative, which is a must in all Argento films, is missing here. In fact, there is a powerful sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot resorts to what is essentially a series of murder sequences, one behind the other, leaving no real time to build a correct and focused mystery to solve. All this results in a climax that is ... well ... anti-climatic, since the film did not have enough interest for us to really worry about. <br /> <br /> However, this is recommended simply because of the masterful direction and the beautiful images that Argento evokes. However, I would not recommend this as a starting point for the Argento films (for that, I would recommend "Deep Red" or "Suspiria"), but if you enjoyed them, or even any giallo, then this is a very good addition to his visual repertoire.
