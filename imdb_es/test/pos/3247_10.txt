Before starting my review, here is a quick lesson on Australian slang that can help you see the film and understand some of the other reviews from Australia and abroad. <br /> <br /> In Australian lingo, "thongs" are a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same American word that corresponds to the revealing butt underwear), the "stubbies" are a brand of Australian shorts, a "stubby" is a small bottle of beer can, and a "stubby holder" is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer. <br /> <br /> If you love black comedies about little criminals, you will love this movie, unfortunately many people in IMDB with weak stomachs and do not appreciate dark humor. I have reviewed this movie which, unfortunately, makes this movie seem more mediocre than it is. Many critics have also compared it to Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, although it is the same genre, it is a completely different and original style. <br /> <br /> Many critics have also criticized this film for using the dead brother of the characters of Heath Ledger to open and guide the narrative of this film, without seeing the film close enough to realize that its brother was killed by the same villain who wants to kill the characters of heaths, this is explained in the middle of the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand. <br /> <br /> This film also reminds of the Lock / Stock and Reservoir dogs, since it is the debut feature of Director / Writers, and for a debut film, it is classified as well as these two films. Actually, like Lock / Stock and Reservoir Dogs, I rate this film as 10/10 for the debut of a director / writer, unfortunately unlike Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan does not live up to expectations in his later films as Ned Kelly. br /> <br /> This movie is one that you should Definitely be able to add to your DVD collection and it is one that can contain several visualizations quite easily.
