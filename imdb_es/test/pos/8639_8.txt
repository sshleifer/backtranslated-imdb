Wow, what a strange movie. It's a David Lynch movie, so it's no wonder it's weird. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone to fully explain everything in this movie. It can not be done After some research after seeing this movie for the second time, I almost know most of the story, but at first glance, and without the help of other reviewers or external help, it is difficult to understand things. So, if you are on that ship and you are confused, do not feel bad; that is normal. Let me say that the key to the film is the character of Naomi Watts. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film seems fascinating to me. I love the wonderful visual effects and the rich colors and I find that each character in this movie is really different and fun to watch. The work of the camera is excellent and the music is spooky, like "Blue Velvet" by Lynch. There are also some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes. In general, it is very well annotated. <br /> <br /> Like the television series "Twin Peaks" by Lynch, this was a film in which the ending was joined later as Lynch thought that this movie was going to be a long-out series of TV. When that did not happen, he put this final at the last minute. This may explain part of the confusion at the end and the lack of explanations about the characters we see earlier in the film, but which mysteriously disappear. <br /> <br /> The theme of the story, supposedly, is a negative comment about Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are squelched. <br /> <br /> Both Watts and the other protagonist, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in her famous lesbian. sex scene Regarding the looks, both women were chameleons, sometimes they looked normal and other times they were incredible. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this film more in the second visualization than in the first one. It is not just a piece of curiosity; It's a very intriguing movie ... just do not feel stupid if you can not understand some things.
