I have not seen this movie for more than 20 years, but it shocked me so much that I remember sitting in the credits and for several minutes later, completely amazed. This is one of the most underestimated films of the decade in which it was originally released. I just ordered a copy on DVD and paid the overnight shipping and I can not wait for it to arrive. It is stimulating at times, and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. It's the story of a tight-knit band of regular kids growing up in the city center and making you feel like you're really sitting on the sidelines, instead of watching them on a movie or TV screen. Difficult to explain, but it is something that must be experienced. The story begins in childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters throughout high school and as they embark on their separate journeys in life. The entire cast did an incredible job and is by far the best job of Jodi Thelen's career. I hope the DVD is up to my memory and I plan to see it this Friday with a good friend.
