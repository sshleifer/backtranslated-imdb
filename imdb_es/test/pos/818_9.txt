This film contains essentially all the elements of a great exploitation film of the 70s, except that it was made at the end of the 80s for the direct video market. <br /> <br /> You have a young couple in love, but everyone around them is involved, whether in cracking or gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up being vulnerable to all the criminals, who are all in this movie, except the cops. First, she gets hooked on crack by a merchant and then, because she owes money to drug lord Jim Brown, she becomes Brown's property. So, basically she is enslaved in a military-style house for which she is named after the movie. <br /> <br /> As if this was not enough reason to see this movie, he also has Anthony Geary playing a seemingly conservative school counselor, but he is really a great distributor of crack. In a sordid but hilarious scene, he demands sexual favors from the heroine because he has no money for a solution. In an earlier scene it was established that he is his counselor. That scene and another where Jim Brown forces her to take a hot shower because she sucks are hysterical. The main actress Cheryl Kay was very good in this movie. Tarantino, bring her back. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that someone mentions in another review that Tarantino is a big fan of this. It has the perfect combination of comedy, action, sex, romance and yes, a central message to stay away from drugs. The evil turn of Jim Brown here deserves to be mentioned at the same time as another great villain of the 80's, Wings Hauser in Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be a movie b Oscars where you can recognize performances like this. Meanwhile, let's hope that the DVD makers directly learn to use this same kind of cheeky humor.
