Originally I posted the first user comment about this movie and I said it was crap and it did not make sense. I DO NOT HAVE SENSE. Campfire stories is a movie that enjoys the most (now that I'm 2 years older and I saw it last night). The actors were famous, but not so famous. The performance itself was more than acceptable, it was quite good. I will rate the film by movie segment. <br /> <br /> 1) The black-and-white scene (AKA- "The Hook") This was pretty It did not make sense, it looked good, but it did not have much grip, the only disappointing, I do not think it was included as a segment. Here is the fear meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Poor) <br /> <br /> 2) The story of RV (honeymoon trapped in a forest) Possibly the most entertaining of all the stories, the Performance was good in this too, disappointing about the typical sex scenes in caravans. However, it was intriguing, you think "who was knocking on that door". He had suspense, and not too bloody. I liked this <br /> <br /> -------------- ------------ (Very well) <br /> <br /> 3 ) Internet chat tale (Little Girl Meets Psycho) This was an intelligent addition, gore left to a minimum, frights left at EXTREME. Although boring at times, the last few minutes were most entertaining, do not get me wrong, it was still fun to watch. Really spooky, and it can happen to anyone, so look who you're talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (Very good) <br /> <br /> 4) Story of ghosts (man kisses ghost) ?? It was not the best, it was not too atmospheric for a ghost story. This was strange, the aspects were pretty good, they played music and shouted, but everything was too real to be scary, although it was good, it was pretty bloody, and it could have been better with that idea. <br /> <br /> ------------- (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) The end (the 4 lost teenagers) These are the 2 attractive boys and girls that tell the stories throughout the movie. The best of the film is undoubtedly the end, gave a great impression, the end was totally unexpected. Look at it, it was so well done. , the realism was spectacular. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (6) THE MOVIE IN GENERAL The story of Campfire was more than I used to play, actually I like it a lot now that I buy it on video, because it's a really entertaining horror movie, forget about the trash you see these days, like many, I'm disappointed that this I really did not go anywhere, it was straight to the video, for me it was better than all the "ho rror" hype you see these days. In general for Campfire Tales <br /> <br /> ----------------------------- (Very good) <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
