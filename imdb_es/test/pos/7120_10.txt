There are few movies that deal with things that I would consider myself an expert in, this is it. <br /> <br /> After some years of fantasy RPG we split up, I do not leave without a feeling of shame of what became: an idiot. <br /> <br /> You see, these things are really canonical, they happen to everyone. <br /> <br /> First you create a character fairly and die after the first attack. <br /> <br /> Then you help a little with the constitution, and while you do it, why do not you help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity too? This, in turn, frustrates the game master who does not know how to deal with this invincible gang. And after a while, it also bores players, so they begin to create increasingly exotic career combinations, no matter how ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I created a warrior monk Druedain, yes, not so far away. of the movie. <br /> <br /> And that's not all there is to be said about the destructiveness of the inherent dynamics of this diabolical game (think of the search for experience points), but just watch the movie, show it all . and, of course, the stupidity of its most basic premises. <br /> <br /> For this purpose, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard. I do not understand exactly why the bard became a character in the first place, after all, the blacksmith is none. But once it became one, it had to be assigned to the flow of the game, that is, it had to be lethal, at least indirectly. The fun of getting out of this never comes to an end, and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not exactly a professional production, but I have not seen a better satire in a long time.
