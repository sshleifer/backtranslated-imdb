Who could have thought that an actor without disabilities could act in such a realistic and immensely powerful way as a person with a disability in a movie? Probably someone But nobody, really nobody, could never compare their expectations with the incredibly moving and powerful performance that the two actors offer in this film. <br /> <br /> Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as he showed us at the beginning, he has great problems communicating. So it really is a lifesaver when fellow disabled Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands it. Thus begins a friendship that is based mainly on communication (ironically). <br /> <br /> In a hilarious scene, they manage to move from the house to theirs. After Rory had been rejected, Michael, with a good heart, submitted a request to move into his own home. Rory, who already had a bad reputation with the "judges", was going to be his interpreter. <br /> <br /> But problems will soon arise. They start to willingly harass a girl they met in a bar a while ago, wanting to be their assistant to do the little things that matter. She is reluctant at first; She does not know these men, but it seems they could be harmless; so it creates another friendship, but not necessarily a good one ... <br /> <br /> As well as being moving, this film really is based on the actors. But that is not a bad thing. For a non-disabled actor, you see Rory, although he can communicate properly, frustrated by the way he is completely dependent on other people and does not have a real life of his own. But the real star for me is Steven Robertson. He acts with such excitement, longing to fit and sadness / happiness, that he really sees him win the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Excellent. <br /> <br /> In general: 5 out of 5
