I thought that this was very "different" compared to most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It would not be useful for those who study it in school, etc., since it does not show the traditional interpretations of the Shakespearean characters (ie Miranda is quite punky in comparison to his traditional Shakespearean lady) but for the understanding of the work and the base of History is a very strong and fantastic piece to see. It also does not include the correct format, as in the design of acts and scenes, since I currently interpret Miranda in a production and most of its lines were cut and some scenes were divided and mixed, but it is very useful and definitely would. I recommend it as a must-see, if only to say you've seen it. Shakespeare fans would love this!
