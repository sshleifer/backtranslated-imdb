I can not believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than the pair, but the link story and its surprise ending hooked me. Many familiar faces will make you wonder "where have I seen them before?" Forget the operating time shown on the New Line tape, this is not 103 minutes, according to the timer of my VCR and the IMDB. Space Maggot turns off the fire in its special way and goes up this 8.
