My father has worked with top secret information in the DIA before and he is the one who mentioned this movie to me. As a child, I always asked him what would happen if he revealed secrets and he recommended this movie. <br /> <br /> In the movie it really puts 2, FRIENDS almost completely different! in a tangle they never really knew what the result would really be. The snowman, Daulton, really laughed at me because the movie described him as just a drug dealer who did not know what he was arguing about, and in the movie he seemed to have the worst of everything. Chris, the hawk, is just a boy who wanted to express his feelings about the government of the United States from a very radical perspective.
