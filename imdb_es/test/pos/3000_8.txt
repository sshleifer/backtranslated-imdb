The hasty approach that Lewis Seiler adopts with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while maintaining an efficient execution time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is transported instantly from a doctor's office to a luxurious suite at the most prestigious inn in the city. This development is critical to understanding the position in which doctors have been thrown. History suggests from the introduction that these two people are generally happy to provide medical practice to the less fortunate. By abruptly cutting off this scenario to the morally conflictive occupation (the mafia's personal physician), the viewer must experience this sudden turn of events. The Nelsons (Kay Francis and John Eldredge) are employed by the force of Gurney (Bogart) without objection. This stylized notion that organized crime is too influential and powerful to defeat has become a standard component in every gangster image. The only aspect of this film that raised me some questions was, ironically, the pace of the story and the speed at which it was told. I believe that character development and social identity may suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined. This paradox turns out to be a result of personal taste, since I believe that the experience of going to the cinema can be improved through the rigorous development of the character. However, for the purposes of this film, I must admit that fast action contributes to a more dynamic pop to the impact of the movie. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 (from ****)
