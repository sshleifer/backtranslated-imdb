I am not a golf fan in any way. On May 26, around 10:30 PM, the film began with a scene in the late nineteenth century. The old movies that I like, but not golf, however, within the first scene, a child (Harry Vardon) is awakened by the voices of men. He goes out to ask what they are doing and he is told that they are going to build something to play golf ... Then, I turned off the television, but something moved me and it was on again. The movie is excellent. Then we see this young man now a man; Professional golf player who is obsessed with the visions of his childhood. Then we know the true focus of the film Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet your mother and father who want to protect you from the class that is so obvious during the period. Then there is the little Eddie Lowery, his caddy, with words of encouragement and small pushes that are fundamental for Francis to win. I do not want to give too much. I was until 2 a.m. This is super please see the movie.
