Once upon a time, Troma, the company that brought us film classics like: The Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grannies, Poultrygeist, Redneck Zombies and Surf Nazis Must Die, decided a long time ago to adapt the famous Shakespeare play, "Romeo and Juliet". This adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding perverted sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercing and incest, and managed to create a strange but hilarious film. Anyone who enters a production of Troma should know what to expect, and that is an irreverent and perverse comedy with a lot of political mistakes. Expect many winks to other Troma movies and many reused gags (flip cars and smash the head). Many may think that it sounds like a total shit that only imbeciles would find it funny ... they may be right, but at the same time they may have to lighten up and enjoy the madness and numbness of mind that are Tromeo and Juliet . <Br /> <br /> With a great cast, a fun script (by James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), an adequate soundtrack and many excellent visual gags, Kaufman has once again managed to turn what is just upside down and assault hell all over the world. Get popcorn, have a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what it is, an adaptation of Shakespeare with many balls. The end. <br /> <br /> 4/5
