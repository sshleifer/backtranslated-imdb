This game is very good for the n64. You can skate like Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska and maybe some more skaters. The game does not have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The School II level is a great level with a lot to skate. In career mode, you accumulate SKATE, you get money, you get high scores and other things in 2 minutes. There is creating a skater, which is very good. I created a skater named Butt Mulligan, a black man with an afro and a girls' board. There is a park editor, some great parks, free skates and a single session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score. You can see repetitions, which is always great. Each skater has 2 styles: A and B. The graphics are not so good. Well, they're good for a n64 game. I wish I had a package of drivers to be able to save my data. In general, this game is incredible. I give it an 8/10 for n64. But with the GBA version, it's as fun as the n64 version, but a bit difficult to control. I give him a 7/10 for GBA. Then, go to a place that still sells n64 games and take a copy. There are also versions for PS1.
