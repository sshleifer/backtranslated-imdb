Cowboys and Indians is an excellent movie. The writing, the acting, the direction could not have been better. This was a story that asked to be told, and this group of talented people and teams did an excellent job of doing it. Stories like this are not pleasant, but they serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist throughout the world. I hope that when this film is seen, attitudes and prejudices are changed. A movie that can do that is rare and special. Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer, and his talent and experience in this field stood out in this film. <br /> <br /> Thanks for telling this story !!! <br /> <br /> Ruby
