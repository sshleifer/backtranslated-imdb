Screenwriter and director Dean Bell offered many surprises and pleasant moments in this modest but compelling road movie. His dialogue was agile, and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the narrative structure of the film. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film is the character of Alice, who is escaping from her New England. Passed in a desperate effort to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a couple of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who incredibly try to groom Alice as a prostitute by earning money at truck stops. <br /> <br /> As a newcomer in her first screen role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There is no false note in your character choices. But it's worth watching the film, especially, by the astute but sensitive character of Sandra, masterfully created by Judith Ivey. There is a particularly cunning subtext in practically every moment that Ivey is in the camera. As a spectator, I found myself holding the tape, pressing rewind and reviewing her scenes to try to discern the psychological subtleties. <br /> <br /> The film raises the following question about the characters: Are Bill and Sandra good Samaritans, or are they an evil couple of Dickensian predators who take advantage of young Alice? One of the strengths of the movie is that it never fully answers that question. Alice seems more sure of herself than what began as a result of her experiences with Bill and Sandra. But is he really a better person? <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy, part of the film and part of the drama of coming of age, this carefully crafted film manages to engage us on many levels.
