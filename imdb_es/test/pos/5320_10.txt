Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a disgruntled teenager who has apparently murdered a long-delayed partner, the brother of a girl he was dating. The problem is not whether he did it or not? Leland admits it, immediately? but rather why. Interestingly, instead of a criminal drama, Leland becomes a story of a character, examining why people do what they do. It is not necessarily the easiest terrain to cultivate. <br /> <br /> And Leland has the required indie group of fucked up people. Apart from the title character, there is also Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional institution and who sees directly that Leland is different. We meet Leland's aloof and selfish father (Kevin Spacey in an extended cameo), who never seems excited in any way for what his son did. But the real flavors come when we immerse ourselves in Pollards, the family of the retarded child. First, there's Leland's girlfriend, Becky (Jena Malone), a drug addict who can not stay clean; his sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most normal person in the film, who simply seeks to get away from everything; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with the Pollards and is Julie's boyfriend. Finally, there is Ryan (Michael Welch), whom everyone else calls a fool, who can not communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings. <br /> <br /> Leland focuses mainly on its self-titled protagonist, but the film slowly. occasionally too slow? It is buried in everyone's life, it asks the main question: why do people do what they do? While Leland openly discusses it in a magazine that Pearl allows her to keep, examining the notions of good and bad personal responsibility, all the characters at some point in the film are faced with a moment in which they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or someone else's. Perhaps the most basic choice that any human can make. And the film analyzes what those choices imply and the consequences of them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, you are simply surprised at the depth of the cast. Spacey. Cheadle. Gosling. Michelle Williams Even Chris Klein? These are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in, and by putting them together it becomes a heady drink. For a space in the middle, the film seems to stop, sizzling as it develops; He looks for a moment as if he were content simply to ask questions and not provide answers. But when we reach the final stretch and the film begins to move quickly and join, Leland becomes a silent piece of film. Leland's explanation of the world and his actions, in the end, focuses on each story, and all the investment he has made in the film is worth it. <br /> <br /> To say that Ryan Gosling is excellent is like saying one the sunny day is nice At this point in his career is redundant? This is one of the best young actors working today, and it is a pleasure to see him design what could have been an unpleasant character in a protagonist that makes one think. Gosling employs a subtlety here that barely seems to act; he has to face most of the film in front of Don Cheadle, who we know has the assets, and not only owns his own, but also elevates Cheadle's game. Cheadle himself is in a first class form, imbuing Pearl with a completely rounded humanity? for good and bad Spacey is a kind of note, but that is the character, and he handles it in an excellent way. I was surprised by Chris Klein; With this level of acting, I thought I would be buried in the mix, but it probably gives the turn of his career so far. Great work everywhere. <br /> <br /> Leland is a bit depressing and, again, it's full of spots. But it ends strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer (in this case, anyway). There's also a subtle comment about racism in the movie (on Leland's first day in the youth room class, he's the only white person in the room) that, like so much of the movie, is handled very effectively . I would not go so far as to call this required visualization? Can some people find it too slow or too strange? But I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, much stronger and more satisfying than most of the movies out there. I recommend it ?? with the previous warnings? if only to see Gosling further refine his craft.
