Valentine "Dogkiller" Dussaut and Joe "The Judge" Kern team up to clean the streets of Geneva. Exciting when they put the international smugglers of heroin, Polish fugitives, furtive toms, bragging girlfriends, renegade dogs and bugs that are too lazy to store their recyclable materials. Do not be fooled by the misleading advertising campaign of Miramax that paints it as a pretentious and artistic film. This movie is 100% action!
