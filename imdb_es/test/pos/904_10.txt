Genius or absolute madness? That depends on your interpretation of this movie. I responded to the level of a "parody of police and movies" aware of itself, and sincerely hope that that is the intention, since I do not see anyone who takes it seriously! : - Paul Rudd, for example, seems to be chewing the stage and really getting into the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark an exit for Rudd from his background in the genre of comedy? Any kind of insane attempt to reinvent it like a hard-action star? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> With the cheesy, almost cumbersome, low-budget action effects and the crazy action games over the top, all of that evokes a bit of the old television show "Sledge Hammer" for my! HAPPY! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course, you may have misinterpreted the movie. If in fact it was an attempt at a 'direct' action film, then it was a funny failure !! <br /> <br /> Look with a lot of alcohol and some friends !! ;-)
