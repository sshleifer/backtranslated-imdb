Shawn Michaels against Edge-8: Hard to believe Shawn Michaels is in the first game, but it's still a great match between both men, Edge, whether you like it or not, he's a great actor in the ring, and Shawn Michaels just is not old when it comes to his performance The Undertaker vs. Heidenreich. Casket Match-2- OK, after a good opening match, now this, what a fucking match. Undertaker has given some great matches at the Royal Rumble, and the 1998 Royal Rumble against Shawn Michaels was the same type of match, but this is much worse than that match. <br /> <br /> Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6- Ok, I think the three men could have performed better, this really did not show them at their best level. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton vs. Triple H. World Heavyweight Championship-9- Triple H gets a clean victory, can you believe it? I'm sure he takes out the Sledgehammer but he does not use it. Randy Orton did very well when he acted as if he had a concussion, but the way he received the concussion is really ridiculous. I really liked this game, this was the best performance I've seen of HHH since always. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble Match-7- This was very entertaining and I do not usually score the Royal Rumble Match. this high The winner is again, very predictable, but this had many moments that were very entertaining to watch. The segments with Flair and Guerrero are fun, the best segments I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great PPV and a must for wrestling fans.
