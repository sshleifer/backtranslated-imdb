I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore at the Rotterdam Film Festival in 2005. It was the first of the ten films I saw there. <br /> <br /> Le Conseguenze has left the most powerful impression of the ten films. From the first shot, you know that the movie is going to be something special. The beautiful cinematography left me amazed at what can be done with a camera. The music is also on par with the visual, complementing the colorful images and architectural style. <br /> <br /> Toni Servillo plays the main character of the movie, Titta. He is a tax expert who went wrong and lives in a hotel. Each week, he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story is based on this. <br /> <br /> It is always very controlled and almost does not show emotion for anyone; He looks calculated and well dressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who are not important to him. For example, Sofia (played very well by Olivia Magnani), who works as a waitress in the hotel where she lives. Although he has been working at the hotel for two years, he never greets her, even if he greets him. One day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits in the bar, instead of his usual place in a window. From here, the story really begins, and will develop into a strong story of love, sacrifice and the mafia. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the rest of the movie. Watch this movie if you like movies with style like David Lynch, The Godfather, etc. Do not see this if you are an action fan.
