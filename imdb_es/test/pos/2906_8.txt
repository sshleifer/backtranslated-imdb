One morning I was going out when I was reviewing something on TV and I found this movie. I never remember seeing this or hearing it. What fun and interesting to see. Well, my meeting was rejected, because I could not get out of this movie. I had some really interesting things that marked their moment in history, and some fun things that do not make people do in the movie today because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it. The performance was good for a 1954 film. Subtle and genuine actions by the characters that made me see what they were going to do next. That's why I ended up watching it. I do not know why they do not show it more often. I prefer to see this than some movies that play more than necessary. For history buffs, people who like vintage films and those who belong to movie appreciation groups will like this one. "The Egyptian" has a variety of tastes that deal with many things to see in human nature that have not changed since the time came. What does that say about us? Those who do not like movies that take time to develop and tell a good story ... are not in the film. <br /> <br /> I have not had time to rent it if it is available, but if I have the opportunity to see it again, I would probably vote for a 10.
