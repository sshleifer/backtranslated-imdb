We just saw the last of the series shown on the SBS network and we will miss our weekly dose of Danish Delight. My wife and I picked up the program after the Swedish program "The Eagle" ended and, in comparison, seemed to be a very poor substitute for our favorite show on television. However, week after week, the program grew on me, and although it was not as brilliant as the Swedish program and definitely more cheesy in its investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly meal. <br /> <br /> Before these 2 shows, I had not really been a fan of the police genre and I can not say that I am now, but the 2 Scandinavian shows really gave us an insight into life in those northern countries of Euopea through his special eyes. Police units.
