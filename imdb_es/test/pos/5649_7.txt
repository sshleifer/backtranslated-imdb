I saw it in 1993 on a VHS tape, but since then I have not been able to find it in any source. This is a very grim and inflexible look in the last days of the Japanese army in the Philippines. Anyone interested in the Pacific War would do well to watch this movie and see under what conditions the other side fought. As far as I can tell, this is historically accurate and describes how easily men can descend to complete barbarism. I understand that by 1945, the Japanese Army had been totally excluded from any replenishment in the Philippines, so there is no doubt that many of the horrible incidents described here occurred. I may not have been able to identify with the characters in the film, but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive. If I had to compile a list of the ten best war movies, this movie would be in it. See if you can get it.
