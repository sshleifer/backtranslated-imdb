It has been widely accepted that Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his trade when it comes to combining rich animations with well-thought-out story lines and characters with a similar imagination. His films, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL MOVEMENT CASTLE, are not only magnificently represented in terms of art, but also in terms of filmmaking. Can this man do nothing wrong? Not really, but it is impossible to expect that each of his films is always a five-star wonder. His newest film, PONYO, a story for the whole family without shame of a "colorful fish out of water", is as animated and animated with interesting characters as expected ... and, nevertheless, this is the first his movie that appears in "minor territory." Do not get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie in any way, as mentioned, it's a spectacle for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. it does not stay afloat to satisfy anyone who is anxious about another fascinating and profound plot. <br /> <br /> For its opening time, PONYO is Miyazaki's narrative at its best, in which a riot and the young golden fish (later called Ponyo) makes a forbidden trip to the human world, where it is later adopted by a child of the same age named Sosuke (modeled, curiously, after the director's own son). father of Ponyo, a miste a fiery magician named Fujimoto, who is very angry at humans for their destruction of the sea (this environmental issue is not very different from the other Miyazaki films) ... a problem that he tries to rectify. Creating jellyfish from the bow of your submarine. He separates the couple and tries to convince Ponyo to stay underwater with him. However, the golden fish has already tasted both Sosuke's blood (healing a cut on his finger) and some of the human food (ham, to which she becomes inexplicably addicted), and of course steals the forbidden potions from her father, becoming an overactive young woman (which is the image of Mei from MI VECINA DE TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami that threatens to engulf the entire world with water. Conspiring with his wife, Gran Mamare, a diaphanous goddess of the sea that alternately changes supernaturally from titanium to human size, Fujimoto decides to prove the love of the two young men for each other. They do so by raising the sea level to the level of the house of Sosuke, which leads young people to cross their ocean-infested world in a large toy boat (made possible by the magical powers of Ponyo). <br /> It is at this point where PONYO begins to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes that involve them are fun and beautiful, they slow down the movie. Unfortunately, the place where the film acquires water is in the climax in which Sosuke must show his love to Ponyo, presented in a strangely anticlimactic and hasty way, which abruptly stops a charming story. This will probably not overwhelm viewers who are expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered much more interesting endings to many of his other films. Do you remember the destruction of laputa? The search for Satsuki for little Mei? The rescue of Kiki de Tombo? The Porco Rosso fight with Curtis? The rescue of the head of the forest spirit? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All those resolutions were much more satisfactory and felt fuller than this. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, PONYO can not be criticized. The animation is absolutely beautiful to the eye, produced in its entirety without a single take of computer generated images, and of course, Joe Hisaishi gives us another impressive musical score; The best moments are the sequences in movement under the water, accompanied by a choir and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are carefully painted and detailed like any other Ghibli movie. <br /> <br /> It has been proven that they are worthy of translating and bending past Ghibli movies into English with high quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide a complete English dub with a cast of mostly actors able. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, sounds very natural and believable at all times. Noah Cyrus as Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes exceeds himself by shouting his lines before finally settling towards the end. Leaving aside, the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as the overprotective Fujimoto (who manages surprisingly well in the character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare (in an omnipresent tone that is not very different from his Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS), Matt Damon as Sosuke's father, constantly navigator, Koichi (which is good but nothing great), and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them, Fey is the best voice of all the cast, giving the character the right amount of spirit and personality. His scenes with Sosuke show a real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, is disappointed in a disappointing way as one of the three disabled old ladies (who barely has ANY lines!), Which are also played by Betty White and Lily Tomlin . Of them, only Tomlin's character, a cantankerous woman named Toki, shows a real personality, but if he were filming the film, he would trade Tomlin for Leachman. Probably, the only really jarring drawback of the dub is a blasty techno-remix of the catchy (but ridiculously repetitive) title song, which fortunately does not appear until half of the final credits. <br /> <br /> On the whole, PONYO is a good movie; An excellent work of animation that is perfect for young people and family audiences. However, due to the loss of momentum towards the end, it is very far from the classical status. However, since Miyazaki is at least even better than most other animated films, I will be generous and I will give PONYO a star recommendation, as it is worth seeing some of its features, especially on the big screen. (Make sure you see it in the theaters while you can).
