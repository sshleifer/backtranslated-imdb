"Tale of two sisters" has to be one of the most spooky movies I've seen recently. In the end, there is no real supernatural element, despite what is expected to occur throughout the film. The story seems to be about two sisters who, upon returning to their father's house after some kind of absence (which was later revealed as a stay in a mental institution) are forced to deal not only with an apparently schizophrenic person and possibly bipolar. stepmother who attacks the youngest of the girls when the mood hits her and cheerfully tells them that she has prepared a special dinner at another time, but that her presence has not yet been explained. It is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and only exists in the troublesome minds of her older sister, who could not save her, and her stepmother, who was insensitive enough to let her die. Much of the details of the strange family is not revealed in the film, but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a lingering hint of confusion. Definitely not a light vision; Look at this when you really want to think about what you have seen. It's a hell of a puzzle.
