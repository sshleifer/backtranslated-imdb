After visiting the Kimbell Museum in Forth-Worth, Texas, USA. UU., Enjoy the art and architecture (also from the adjacent Museum of Modern Art), and have a pleasant conversation with the expert lady of the bookstore, I bought this proposition DVD with quite high hopes of inheriting ?? and I was not disappointed in the least. <br /> <br /> The thematic focus, the dramatic tension, the revealing interviews, the archive images and the impressive architecture are also mixed in a coherent whole to explore the life of the iconic Louis I Khan. . <br /> <br /> The documentary begins: contemplative classical music, the files are scanned with a shaded and reflective face superimposed, blurred letters that refer symbolically to the window of a train that passes through a landscape in the background. A trip, focus and out of focus, the search finally culminates in an article in a newspaper. Nathanial Khan reads from the front page of the New York Times, where his father is simultaneously praised as the best American architect alive and his death announced. <br /> <br /> "When I first read that obituary, I must admit that I was looking for my own name, I was also his son, his only son, I did not know my father very well, he never married my mother and he never lived with us (??) He died when I was eleven years old. "<br /> <br /> Then, years later, this illegitimate son is still obsessed by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure, but the secret personal life escapes him and affects him to the point where he tries to do something about it. <br /> <br /> "For years, I struggled to be satisfied with The little pieces of my father's life have allowed me to see, but it was not enough, I needed to know him, I needed to find out who he really was. I had to travel to see his buildings and find what was left of him out there, he would take me to the other side of the world, looking for the man who left me with so many questions. " <br /> <br /> So the documentary is two. -fold, by a slow systematic discovery of the world-renowned architect, we came to know: 1) his ideas, buildings and architectural perspective and 2) his family, coworkers, the lives of the people he affected and the human perspective <br /> <br /> The DVD also offers an additional perspective with questions and answers with the writer / director and additional footage that includes such great quotes from Louis I. Khan as "Everything that everyone says is true It's your truth, it may not be a fact. " And "A good idea that does not happen is not an idea at all." <br /> <br /> This movie is a journey of discovery. The self-discovery and the discovery of a man, a great man, however, a human, imperfect as all of us. We know him through the eyes of an admiring and somewhat bitter son, but with openness and objectivity to really explore without drawing easy conclusions and without judging. <br /> <br /> For key interviews with people who interacted with him in different ways. Slowly, we put together some pieces until the final interview with this Bangladeshi man who really seems to bring him back home with visceral and sensible comments. <br /> <br /> Bright architect, brilliant documentary.
