I think that every critic who criticized "Tommy Boy" when it premiered in 1995 should see it again and learn that it's not a bad movie. All critics criticized the films of Chris Farley and David Spade. Yes, "Coneheads" was fun, but in a way it had a joke premise and "Black Sheep". I agreed with the criticism and it is one of the worst movies that have been made. But "Tommy Boy" does not belong to the category of "Coneheads", which could have been a little more fun and "Black Sheep", which is a piece of gut. It's very fun and entertaining. I agree with the critics that Chris Farley was not John Belushi or John Candy, since he claimed to have idolized those guys and that they had a genius for comedy, but Chris Farley was very funny and I would like him to spend more time to demonstrate to the critics that Yes, he was not John Belushi, or John Candy, but it was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are hilarious and the premise also laughs out loud. It's very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh, but we have movies like "Tommy Boy" to remember how really funny it was. "Tommy Boy" is one of the best comedies of the 1990s.
