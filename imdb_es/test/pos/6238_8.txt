As one of the other reviewers (it could have been @ Amazon), around January of 1983, I was introduced to Tourist Trap by the beloved and decrepit old WOR-9 in New York. Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell. waiting to see it, since it debuted on Halloween in 1978, had just ended, and I thought I had filled the horror during the day (stopped laughing, that monster of "Borgost" (sp?) with three eyes that Ike Eisenmann traces in his room is terrifying). <br /> <br /> As much as I still enjoy Richard Crenna with his horror hat made for television, it was the first 10 minutes of Tourist Trap, following Devil Dog that day, which really left a Mark - and Months later, it ended up being the first movie I recorded on TV. WOR used to play this quite often, often like the Million Dollar movie on Saturday afternoon, as others have observed. It's one of those offers that offers a powerful blow of terror in front, a real left hook, and then practically starts with the rest of the cast, dances and hits, putting the opening scene in a wider context on the way, and then advances to The True Climax (see The Night of the Living Dead, Re animator). <br /> <br /> Two paragraphs and I have not mentioned a single mannequin. Face it: the damn things are terrifying enough, without the music and the script. I can also remember some scary and similar mannequins in the attics and basements of several relatives, and say what you like about the relatively simple approach of Schmoeller and Carroll: nobody, before or after, has played it that well. In real life, a good mannequin will make you take a double take, and here, that's the last thing you'll probably see, if you get stuck in the extinct wax museum of Slausen and at the road stop. Yes, there is a point ("I loved her a lot"), where Chuck "Slausen" Connors is trying to pass through Vincent Price. Yes, the plot could have occupied a whole paragraph in the early stages; I do not see that the script is so thick. No matter. From the direction to the competent performance (Meryl Streep did not attend emphatically, and here, that helps rather than hinder), to another useful and effective score of Pino Dinaggio (see Carrie and several other Palma films), at various lights, material of film, use of different levels of sound ... could continue - all the elements of this production of low budget come together and you get a job much greater than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that it's scary like Hell? Stephen King talked about this film in Danse Macabre about a year after its release, and rightly so. Like a lot of his work, it may not be a great art, but he sure tells a terrifying story, and he does it well. The rest of the cast may be relatively unknown (was not Jocelyn Jones in that Texas car chase movie too?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are, familiar enough to the public, to make you think: the style by Stephen King - may this happen to you or to people you know. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Psycho (plot) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (general appearance), even if they are not the first associations in my mind, are valid. I just wish I could comment on the DVD, which I hope to buy, because that Tourist Trap has become very difficult to find on video since the almost complete extinction of independent video rental stores, where he had a home other than WOR and cable in the 1980s (although TMC / Showtime seems to have picked it up and played it regularly now). No, there are no spoilers here, I'm afraid there is no breakdown of the plot: go see it yourself (okay, there may be a tiny little one underneath, so scroll if you want, I better be sorry). The mannequins are very scary and I prefer to show you what to say ... :) <br /> <br /> For the record, Tourist Trap is also full of great lines, from "let's have a party! How I look, eh, how do I look? ", A" you're so pretty "," you can not hurt me "," you should not have to hide it, it feels good! "(listen to Vincent Price's inflection again there), the inevitable" are you crazy!" (delivered at the right time, and in the right tone) ... and try, just try, keep the hair in your arms down when you hear the manikin's head screaming "Molly!" - especially once you realize who the boss was ... :) <br /> <br /> PS ... I think Charles Band was the producer of this song and probably owned the music rights of Dinaggio . The band, from what I understand, was the brain behind Full Moon Entertainment, which could explain both the later use of music in Puppet Master, and, well, the commercial focus of 40 has characterized Full Moon, from the nice franchises Puppet Master and Subspecies, a, uhhh ... Trancers and Bad Channels (sorry, BOC).
