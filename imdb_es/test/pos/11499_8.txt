Some people drift through life, moving from one thing or from one person to the next without blinking; others cling to a cause, to another person or to a principle and remain firm, committed to whatever, and, figuratively or literally, they give their word and support it. But we are all different, `Made of different clay ', as expressed by one of the characters in this film, which makes life so interesting. However, some people are just crazy, and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to make things, life, work? Writer / director Lisa Krueger takes a chance, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being engaged, and how one "commits", and obsession, in "Engaged", starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is inflexible , committed, obsessive and maybe also a little crazy. Her name is Joline, and this is her story. <br /> <br /> It's true that Joline has always been a committed person; In work, relationships, in life in general. She is a woman of the word who sticks to her no matter what. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to tell Carl ... and 597 days after the marriage, he left; Go out to 'find' yourself and solve everything. When Joline realizes she will not return, she refuses to give him up or his marriage. Maybe it's because of that "clay" from which it is made. In any case, she leaves her home in New York City and goes looking for him, what she does in El Paso, Texas, of all places. But once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him her "space" and not letting her know that she is there. She considers that Carl is in a "spiritual coma", and his job is to maintain a "spiritual vigil" on him until he regains his senses. And while she watches and waits, her life is anything but boring, as she meets a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velázquez), a waitress at one of the local restaurants; 'Grampy' by Carmen (Alfonso Arau), which is something mystical; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has problems with Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes pride in it. For Joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about Carl, but even more about herself. <br /> <br /> There is a touch of humor, a touch of romance and some ideas about human nature in this peculiar film that deals more with characterization and character than with plot. And Krueger presents everything extremely well, delivering a film that is both attractive and entertaining. His characters are very real people, with all the desires, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic group through which she tells her story. We see it from Joline's point of view, since Krueger lets us know Joline's thoughts and, therefore, his motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. That, together with the deliberate rhythm that establishes that allows him to absorb the atmosphere and the atmosphere he creates, makes it a very effective piece to tell stories. There is an underlying seriousness in this subject, but Krueger chooses to avoid anything with a hard or too deep hand and focuses on the natural humor that develops from the people and situations that Joline encounters. And the result is a well textured, emotional and optimistic aspect of what we call life. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham takes on this role from the first frame of the film to turn Joline into a character entirely her own. creation. She immerses herself in the part and offers a convincing and credible performance, adding the small personal traits and nuances that make all the difference between a representation that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real. And for this film to work, it was imperative that Joline be viable and credible, and Graham succeeds on all fronts. His presence on the screen has never been more attractive, and his vibrant personality, or even the way he uses his eyes, is enough to attract him completely. everything is part of the character that she creates; There is a call to Joline that exudes from all her face, that she is inside and outside. He is a pleasant and pleasant person, and as you have shared his most intimate thoughts, you know who he is. It's a good job in every way, starting with the way the character was written, the way Graham gives it so vibrant life. <br /> <br /> Like Carmen, Patricia Velázquez is also totally attractive. His performance is very natural and direct, and he uses his instincts to effectively create his character. It has a charismatic presence, but is less than extravagant, and gives it an appearance that is attractive and practical. She is refreshingly open and up front; It gives you the impression that Carmen does not hold anything back, but that she is totally honest on all fronts, and that is also part of her appeal. And, as with Joline, this character is well written and Velazquez brings it to life convincingly. <br /> <br /> In general, there are a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who, with very little real screen time, manages to create a memorable character. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl's Editor) and Mary Kay Place (psychiatrist) A film that says something about the value of taking a step back to consider The Big Picture: reflecting on who we are, where we are going and what we really need: "Committed" is a pleasant experience; A trip that is definitely worth taking. 8/10.
