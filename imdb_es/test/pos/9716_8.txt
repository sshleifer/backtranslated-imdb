It would be a shame that the sprint has not yet been seen, either bent or replaced (I prefer the bent version (which is weird) because it was fun ... in a good way). The good thing about Speed ​​Racer is that you're never too old to see it. Go red and yellow !! I saw it for the first time when I was about seven years old and I enjoyed listening to the catchy opening. It disappeared for a while and then I saw it again a couple of months ago (I'm 19 years old). Imagine the feeling of nostalgia that arises, singing "here comes, here comes the race racer! It's a devil on wheels ~~~" over and over again. Anyway, the concept of the machine 5 generated so many "special cars of multiple functions", but none could surpass its genius in the construction. The other cars seemed too much. and it was not just the races or the different bosses that made it interesting for me. it was the mysterious character of racer-x and how the world of speed racer "happened" to revolve around him. They made some adjustments in some lines of manga history, but everything went pretty well. although I can not remember if the program really revealed how it looked racer-x, in the manga, they did.
