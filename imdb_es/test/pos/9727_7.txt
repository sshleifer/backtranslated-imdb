Apparently, a B ... B movie should represent a better performance and a better message than the one we receive today in big budget "A" images. Today's movies aimed at young women are surely not designed to encourage depth of character rather than shallow selfish behaviors ... or increase the self-esteem of young women who do not meet "feminine" standards. (After all, criticizing the fake and flashy, as this film does, will not help sell more products that depend on girls not * being * satisfied with their natural attributes or their inner beauty). <br /> <br /> Laraine Day is worthy of being loved as a mechanically inclined tomboy who "walks into" rooms and confesses his inability to flirt. She is linked to Robert Cummings due to similar interests, a shared sense of humor and her honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which is gradually being valued by the superficial "charms" of her selfish glamorous sister (who only brings out her tendencies selfish and imprudent playboy). <br /> <br /> Although Laraine is also beautiful in appearance, it is refreshing to see that inner beauty is valued more and the representation of true friendship that leads to the most satisfying romantic relationship. I wish the girls (and the boys) received this kind of realistic message today. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Hollywood returns to making films "B" again, with modest budgets and tries to be happy With modest gains ... What am I saying? Sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a smaller scale would be like expecting a guy to give up the superficial sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him. That's crazy. <br /> <br /> Please, someone invent a time machine now! I belong to 1940. <br /> <br /> I would rate this movie with a higher score, but the end is a bit too abrupt, and maybe it lacked enough evidence of Robert Cummings's change of heart. (I like the fact that B movies are short and fast, are not bulky and are self-indulgent, but this could have taken more than 70 minutes). I also found it unrealistic that a widow and small children were not affected by a sudden death in their family ... or be so lenient with who caused it. I mean, I suppose it's good, but a little more grief or bitterness would have been natural. Maybe it's a deliberate choice to make this family act happy about its loss, to lessen the impact of the tragedy and make sure that we * forgive those involved in the death, since it's just a plot device anyway, not the real point of the movie. Still strange.
