This show has an incredible plot with good and recognizable actors (like the Boston Legal girl and Boris the Butcher of Snatch). Even the extras and the child, who thought the ad could be a weak link, surprised me with their ability. It's just the little things that the director needs to modify. Like the guy who makes the summary of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode, he must be fired. Having a narrator to tell you what happened ruined the story. The only other small problem I had was that sometimes they take too long to do things, but not as far as some programs like Prison Break. Does anyone know when the season will resume?
