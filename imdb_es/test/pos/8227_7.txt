Ronald Colman plays a prodigal son. Although he is NOT a bad guy, he is a bit volatile and has not done much with his life, apart from traveling around the world and having a good time. Now that his last adventure in Africa has failed, he is on his way home to England. His rich upper-class father plans to throw him in the ear, though thanks to Ronald's winning style, he is reluctantly welcomed with open arms. <br /> <br /> At this point, there are two women in your life: -showgirl Myrna Loy and rich girl Loretta Young (who is already engaged). How will this work? Will Ronald know and act like a responsible adult? These are the main themes of this nice little movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie and it certainly will not. It changes your life, but it is certainly very entertaining and fun. Most of this is due to the always brilliant performance of Ronald Colman. Hell, at the height of his career in the 1930s, he could have played in REEFER MADNESS or some other dreck and still make it entertaining and enjoyable because of his charming personality. His seemingly effortless style in this movie makes it very easy to like and it's easy to see why both Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with him in the movie. In addition, the writing is very ingenious and makes this a good romantic comedy.
