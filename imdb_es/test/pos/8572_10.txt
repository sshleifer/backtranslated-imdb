I'm rating this movie on a curve, in other words, it's not the best movie ever made, but it does exactly what it set out to do. This is an excellent T & A movie. I have no idea how many T or A you saw in this movie, but I did see a shot that had 16 T naked at the same time, just to give you an idea. There are topless girls all the time. There is a scene from the wet t-shirt contest. And the climax involves a touch football game between two women's teams and every time you score a touchdown, the entire opposing team loses a piece of clothing. I do not know why this gets such a low rating here. Perhaps the people who gave him low scores thought they were going to see Citizen Kane. I love this movie and I hope to find more similar. If you are looking for a good campaign movie, I recommend this one.
