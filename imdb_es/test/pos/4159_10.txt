THE GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) is for this viewer the best film of the year to date. It is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. More importantly, this radiant and beautiful film is a very necessary reflective mirror for us to see the history of the immigration of "foreigners" to the United States at a time when the mere mention of the word "borders" is a political fuse. Writer / director Emanuele Crialese has not only given us a moving story, but has also provided a touchstone for viewers to revisit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of Native Americans, we all enter to the United States as "foreigners." 'at some point in our stories, and it's humiliating to see this movie with this fact in mind. <br /> <br /> The film opens, in turn, in the Sicilian century as the widower Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) affected by poverty and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climbs a rocky hill to present your chips to the cross to ask for a sign of whether they should continue fighting for existence on the island or go to America, the land of dreams. The silent deaf son of Mancuso, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with images of America (money growing on trees, fruits and vegetables larger than people, etc.), and Salvatore accept this as the signal that you must move your family to America. After convincing his reluctant mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and his sisters Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only possessions (two donkeys, goats and rabbits) and the man with the boat. organizes your trip, giving the family shoes, appropriate clothing and instructions to board a transatlantic as third class passengers. When the Mancuso family prepares to board, they are asked to take a photograph, and as they pose behind a painted set, an English Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) enters the photo as if she were part of this peasant family. Lucy can not board the ship for America without a male escort. <br /> <br /> The journey begins and Luce, in her gentle way, identifies with the Mancuso family, finally solidifying her safe passage by proposing Salvatore to marry her 'for convenience, not for love' when they arrive to America. Through a violent storm and living conditions that are terrible for the poor, the multitude of third class passengers survive, join and eventually reach Ellis Island, believing that their US dream has been fulfilled. But all must pass severe physical evidence, dismissal and even intelligence tests to determine if they can enter the United States: officials inform them that the United States does not want genetically inferior people to enter the new world! Each woman must be selected by a man to marry on Ellis Island before they are allowed admission. The way in which the Mancuso family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the closing of the story. <br /> <br /> Few of us understand the strict rules and cruel treatment that immigrants face (or at least we face at the end of the story). century) on Ellis Island, and if we do, we have chosen to immerse that information. THE GOLDEN DOOR presents the case of immigrant struggles in a way that not only touches our hearts, but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation. But, apart from all the political problems, THE GOLDEN DOOR is above all a film of great beauty, exquisite photography, performances felt by a great cast and a story written and directed with great sensitivity. It is a film that deserves a wide distribution, a film that must be seen for everyone. Highly recommended Harp grady
