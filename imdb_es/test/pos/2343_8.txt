I have to accept that this film and its talented director do not receive the applause they deserve. We hope that the DVD works very well and attracts the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Maybe the film is a bit long overall, but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy his actors when they are giving good results and, therefore, sometimes keeps them in longer close-ups than necessary. Good for the actors, I'm sure, but sometimes, as a public, you're ready to go ahead and talk to the plot. May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our most important digital film directors,
