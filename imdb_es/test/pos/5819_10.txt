I feel that I know these people and I have met people similar to them. These days, however, people are discouraged from showing such passion for anything, especially love and loneliness. It has a slow start, but then look! If you love romantic comedies, but you would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change (or at least you had it in the 70s), you should see this movie!
