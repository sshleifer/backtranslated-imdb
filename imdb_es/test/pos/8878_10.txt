This movie was one of the laughing movies I've seen on the floor. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly. Mom is excellently represented, and it was one of the highlights of the movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it starts differently than you would expect. Larry is trying to write a book and has some problems. Larry teaches in a writing class and Owen marked it after Larry tried to read his story. Owen finally asks Larry to kill his mother and, in return, Owen would kill Larry's ex-wife. The whole movie was really fun. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when Owen writes "Throw the train mom". Larry is furious because he has just written a book of a similar plot. It turns out that Owen wrote a pop-up book for children. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend this movie. I gave him a 10.
