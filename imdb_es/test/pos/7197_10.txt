I've read all the adventures of Asterix and Obelix at least 5 times and I'm also a fan of "Les Nuls" and "Les Robins des Bois" and Jamel, so I expected a lot from this movie ... and finally I was satisfied. Asterix's first adaptation on the big screen (Astérix et Obélix contre César) that was not a true success besides the appearance of Laetitia Casta, it really captures the spirit of the comic (and we have the beautiful Monica Bellucci). In the first film, the director tried to be too realistic about the time the story unfolds and killed all the spirit that made Asterix hilarious. In this, all the clothes, the way of speaking and everything is identical to the work of Goscinny and Uderzo ... more, they really adhere to the original story with the inconvenience that we know almost everything that will happen, but Alain Chabat He gave us some surprises at the end. I really enjoyed that movie, and every time the first sign of boredom appears, Jamel comes in and makes us laugh like crazy. This movie is a great mix of all the kind of humor that I really like, and although I may be mixing it too much, I can not help but like it. So, if you like Asterix and the humor of all these young talents that started in "Nulle part Ailleurs" (a French mix of tonight's show and SNL) go see this movie.
