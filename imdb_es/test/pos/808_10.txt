David Suchet, (Poirot), "FoolProof", '03, gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to wipe the excess in his mouth with incredible perfection! You can only see the expressions on the detective's face and see that an element of importance in the behavior of the suspects was never lost. The beautiful colored waterfalls throughout the English countryside were simply stunning. Megan Dodds, "Bait", 2000, had an excellent performance as a very sexy and wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from Mr. Poirot. A very nice movie if you really like the performance of David Suchet as Mr. Poirot.
