In Spain, former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has been quadriplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right to practice euthanasia through an association that defends freedom of choice and led by his friend Géne (Clara Safe). . Ramón is presented to the lawyer defending his cause, Julia (Belén Rueda), who suffers from a deadly degenerative disease; and meets Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a lonely worker who has been mistreated by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and point of view of Rosa and Julia's life. <br /> <br /> The Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary directors. His filmography premiered in Brazil is composed of excellent and original films: "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "Los otros" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain today. Their association produced this sensitive drama on a very controversial subject, the right to commit euthanasia. This drama is never cheesy or depressing, since the script uses humor as a relief valve in the most dramatic situations. The performances of the cast are perfect, with characters that have and defend different positions regarding this unpleasant topic. The dialogues and lines are very solid and intelligent. I noticed in the plot of IMDb that this movie is based on the real life story of Ramón Sampedro. Unfortunately, neither the film nor the DVD gives this important information. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("Sea Inside")
