For anyone interested, I have managed to get this on an Ebay DVD (I have not received it yet, no day). <br /> <br /> I've been desperate to get this even if it's a quality VHS put on a DVD I do not care. So, for any interested person, contact me and maybe I can help you. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it is ridiculous that you had to wait almost 7 years to see this again, but it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> All my colleagues at work are desperate to see it too. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I will publish later with regard to quality. <br /> <br /> Just do a search on Ebay if you want it guys. is there to buy
