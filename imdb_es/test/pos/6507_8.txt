The omission of Jazzy Jeff, the creator of the squeak and scratch of the transformer, raised some eyebrows, but it's good to see that he got to the extras of the DVD, after all. With SCRATCH, Doug Pray, who previously narrated the grunge phenomenon of the 90s in HYPE (1996), made an excellent documentary about the world of hip-hop DJ and the evolution of turntablism. His latest documentary, INFAMY (2005), explores contemporary graffiti culture in the United States. After a couple of visits four years ago, my DVD has been accumulating dust since then, but recently I saw it again and, in addition to the material, I was surprised at how good this documentary is and what is edited. A very nice soundtrack too, and not just talking heads, but a lot of music, old-school recordings, parties, break dance, whatever. One of the best things about the film is that it examines mainly where the art of turntablism is today (in 2001), without ignoring the pioneers, of course. Good things. <br /> <br /> Dark Chamber --- 8/10
