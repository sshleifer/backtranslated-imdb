WARNING: MAY contain some minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say anything bad about this movie, except for one thing. <br /> <br /> YOU CAN NOT SEE MUCH MORE! !! On the other hand, maybe it's because you have to be at home in the morning or at 3 am to catch it on the Fox Movie channel. <br /> <br /> Pity, because this is another gem lost in time, Clifton Webb takes his patented, know-it-all behavior he had perfected as Lynn Belvedere ("Sitting Pretty" and its aftermath), and becomes " Nature Boy ". <br /> <br /> Actually, it's like that. <br /> <br /> Webb plays Robert Jordan, the host of a Sunday school education program for children who is losing an audience, and the network tells him he needs to do something about it, either. <br /> <br /> Part of The problem may be due to the fact that the married guest does not have children. But as such things happen, the pastor of the local church needs a leader for an ungovernable troop of Boy Scouts, and finds a willing victim ... ahhhh 'VOLUNTEER' ... in the host, so Jordan takes the position . <Br /> <br /> Problem solved, RIGHT ??? <br /> <br /> INCORRECT! Like this movie there are other problems. <br /> <br /> For example, it turns out that one of the Scouts is the son of his boss at the TV station, which causes a bit of friction; especially because the child is overweight, has asthma and also an attitude. <br /> <br /> And he is the most reasonable one. <br /> <br /> There is also this Cub Scout, Mike (George). Winslow) that wants to go around, being the kind of "street puppy". <br /> <br /> It turns out that the reason is that it does not have people of its own, but that it is taken care of by a relative who does not have it. There is not much time for him. <br /> <br /> It is these things that make your job more difficult than expected. <br /> <br /> In short, Webb becomes more understanding with children, and not only keeps his program but learns a rewarding lesson and, finally, even adopts Mike. <br /> <br /> It's still a great movie after all these years.
