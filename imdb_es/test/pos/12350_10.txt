One Dark Night has a typical horror movie for teenagers with a unique touch. The musical soundtrack and the gothic / claustrophobic atmosphere contribute enormously to this small film that it offers. Meg Tilly is excellent as "Julie" and leads us through the labyrinth of the mausoleum, giving a sense of premonition and loneliness. The other teenagers are equally effective in their roles, as is Melissa Newman, the definitive heroine of the film. The special effects are excellent, although dated. This film is highly overlooked, but that can be good so that it never gets ruined by endless sequels. There is a great dark magic that flows through this movie; Once connected, you really understand it and you will have a little fun. The double-disc DVD is available, although the original negative could not be found to restore the movie. Maybe one day it will be located. I suppose that, somehow, the carbon particles in some parts help the film by giving it a respectability from the old school and making it more unexpected at the end when suddenly there are many effects. <br /> <br /> The second album has a rough / alternative version with a temporary scoring version of the film that gives a more detailed explanation of the disappearance of two of the girls, very Poe-ish ("The Cask of Amontillado "comes to mind in a new way!) Also, great end Tension entering the dark crypt opening. I'm not sure it had the impact for the main audiences, but it certainly worked for me and it was extremely scary. also, there is an accomplishment of a documentary that is interesting because it gives information about what was happening at that moment with the actors, the team, the director and the writer; Frank material, then current logos, discussions of shots and scenes, essays. Very unique that this material exists for a small movie back then.
