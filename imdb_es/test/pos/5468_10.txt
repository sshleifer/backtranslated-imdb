I have not seen it since 1998 and, even so, STILL can not get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find it to show the impression it caused. <br /> <br /> It's just a wonderful story. <br /> <br /> I just hope to see the staircase at least once in person ... <br /> <br /> I did not know much about Mr. Petersen before this movie since I had not seen any of his previous works, but his subtle performance in this impressed me and I think that his interpretation of Grissom in CSI shows more of the same. He knows enough to let the character shine, instead of the actor shining, which makes him a much better actor. <br /> <br /> I can not remember enough about the "poor accents" to comment, but I must say that I have always enjoyed Barbara Hershey in all her roles as well and I thought she also did a phenomenal job in this movie.
