Some time ago I bought the Chinese box of Fist of the North Star that came with all of Fist of the North Star, Fist of the North Star 2, New Fist of the North Star and Fist of the North Star. While there is a version American and some European versions, they end up in the middle of the Fist of the North Star, which is about to reach the film. <br /> <br /> The series is about the successor of an old martial ship. art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Fist of the North Star) called Kenshiro, or Ken for short. There is only one successor each generation. It takes place in a post apocalyptic future where martial arts are the most powerful weapon. The two most powerful arts are Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken, as my version calls it. Nanto is actually multiple styles but they are all the same as they allow a person to cut someone into pieces. There are six Nanto teachers and each one has its own star. Hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage / kill or heal someone by hitting a point on their body. Each art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Big Dipper, Nanto - Gemini. Kenshiro is saving the world from the evil of chasing his two brothers and three of Nanto's teachers and their armies. Each army captain has his own way of fighting, which makes each episode different and the number of bloody soldiers. In addition, Kenshiro is looking for his girlfriend Yuria, who was stolen by Master Shin de Nanto. Throughout the trip, Kenshiro joins his brother Toki after rescuing him from his brother Rao, who calls himself Kenou or Boxing King. He is also joined by two Nanto teachers, Rei, who is looking for his sister, who was taken by Ken's brother, Jagi, and Shu. Both and Toki die on the way. Other characters that join Ken are two children, Rin and Batto, who do not do much. That's all I can say for the story, since it's so long and full of details. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this show is excellent is the fight. Ken usually faces a group of people who think they are hard and then die in one fell swoop. Which is fun and rough, but it makes for quick fights. Another big part is the comedy / badassness. Ken hits someone, and they think it's nothing. Ken says they are already dead. Then they die. Other parts are when he hits them and tells them they have a few seconds to live. Then a counter will appear. Or when he tells them they are not worthy to know his name. Then it is when he makes a quick kick or a punch and goes to give, gives da da da da, etc. Eventually, you may find yourself doing it with him. A big part was when a bad guy thought he knew Hokuto. He approached Ken and hit him. Ken stayed there, said he was dead in a few seconds. The bad boy counted and then died. It's not limited to Ken, everyone else kills just as fast. There has never been such an incredible character as Ken and he probably never will. <br /> <br /> However, there are some problems. One is the repetitive nature. Some flashbacks, mainly that of Yuria that is being taken, reproduce too much, and there are too many episodes of summary, especially in the fourth part of the series. In fact, the last episode is a summary of the whole thing. Another problem is the end. The final battle with Rao was not that impressive. Ken and Rao fought, then talked, etc., until Rao realized something and killed himself instead of Ken killing him. But it is better than the American and European versions that are cut in half. <br /> <br /> Who would you recommend this to? This is for older teens and adults who like action. Since styles cause people to explode or break into pieces, the violence is very graphic and there is a lot, but they do not show much blood because they usually make of death a silhouette that still looks like the person but less colorful. This was probably done to avoid censorship. If you do not like the action, rent the American version. However, if you like the action, I tell you to go to the import since you can see all the series, but they do not have the best English translation since it is subtitled by the Chinese. Note: My import came with everything I said at the beginning, some imported versions do not, but you still have to get an import to see all the series and Fist of the North Star 2. If you do not think you can handle the subtitles by any reason then they go for the American version. Another note: in the version I got there were no subtitles on the latest album of New Fist of the North Star; although, to begin with, New Fist of the North Star is not very good. <br /> <br /> I give the program an 8/10 for its great amount of action, good story and the genius of Kenshiro. <br /> <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Toei Animation released a subtitled version in English. You can download the episodes as well as Hokuto no Ken 2 from Direct2Drive from IGN or watch it for free on the FUNimation site.
