In these days of ultra-fast processors and the Internet, creating a movie like "The Matrix" may seem like just the next step in coining the term "cyberspace," but do you remember what computers looked like in 1974? Right. Creating the notion of virtual reality back then is an amazing feat of imagination. The Fassbinder film, of course, has none of the massive guns and pyrotechnics, but many "artistic" elements, but the atmosphere it creates is intense and raises the question of how we can know what is real in a dark and exciting way. Making this a chiller and a thriller for the mind. It also takes it to a higher level in the more recent VR stories: if you leave a cyberspace, can you be sure that it does not just emerge to another level of virtual reality?
