After seeing this routine of John Leguizamo, I finally realize why he is such a talent. I enjoy a great job on stage, and this is work on stage at its best. I can not label it as a standing routine, because Leguizamo is so intense when he plays the different characters. The only time he breaks character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part in which he does it so coldly, that you can not help, but you appreciate his talents. I was not really sure how I felt about him as an actor, but Freak solidified my appreciation for him. For those who have not had the opportunity to see this show, I am sorry for you. Definitely take a look. It's one of the nest routines I've seen. It is aligned with Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars and more.
