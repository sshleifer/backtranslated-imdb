I just saw Mar Ardentro and I felt I had to comment on this movie. Euthanasia is a difficult subject in any field and, unfortunately, it can distort the true value of a movie. Many people have commented enthusiastically on the excellent cast and their beautiful images / camera work. Certainly, Javier Bardem is an actor who contributes something extra to each film he makes. To say that it covers the real Sampredo is a bit silly since I do not think any of the critics have known Sampredo personally. Staying still and using a certain charm is an acting skill that, while performing well, does not constitute a "perfect" performance. Bardem only does what he does well ... and that's it. The camera work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the film itself lacks. Here Sampredo is shown as a man who is about to die so much that he leaves his beloved family and marries a woman who only seeks when the other does not help him in his search for a dignified death. Now I am not here to say anything about the right to or against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting on movies like this you can barely escape. The theme of the film is so strong that you are almost forced to discuss the film on that strong theme. I think it's a weakness for the film that, unintentionally, portrays Sampredo as a non-lymphatic character. Someone who is much smarter than his family as shown by the simple cousin who does not "catch" the double layer poem directed towards him. Someone who will leave a loving and loving family because HE thinks that his life is not worthy. A scene that juxtaposes the lawyer who, according to the film, makes the "wrong" decision and ends up in a state of remote dementia, which indicates that Sampredo's election was the correct one. The woman who looks for him constantly is almost ignored by the beautiful lawyer, but suddenly marries Sampredo when he agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo a calculated figure, no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Argumentivo I would say that it does not convince at all and I think that Amenabar did not intend to add this unbalanced element in his film. For a young director it is still an impressive film and it certainly has its strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo, for example). The camera work is impressive and the film is well acted. But 10 out of 10 ... no, the film does not reach that excellence.
