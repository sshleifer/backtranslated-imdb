This revision contains some small but significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I just finished seeing my copy of Noroi ... <br /> <br />. ..and it was great! This may sound corny, but several times during the movie I forgot that it was not real XD. The performance is convincing, although the performance of Masafumi Kobayashi (interpreting himself, I think ...) sometimes seems a bit silly. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka in the Rinne of Takashi Shimizu) seemed to change the levels of credibility throughout the film: sometimes it is REALLY good, then, the next moment, it is very cheesy (especially the exorcism of the end and the subsequent Possession. <br /> <br /> A character who was ridiculous at first was Mr. Hori, a man covered in tinfoil who believes that "ectoplasmic worms" come to eat them all.

The ending has to be one of the most disconcerting sequences, if not the most frightening, which I have had the pleasure of witnessing. <br /> <br /> In general, Noroi is a very fu One way to spend 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD offers excellent picture and sound (more importantly, the SUBTITLES in English, for free !) for an excellent J-Horror experience. I highly recommend picking it up.
