A look at three geishas that are beyond their best moment. Now they remember their past with love and lament their present. Kin (played by Haruko Sugimura of Floating Weeds) has sworn men and made a living as a lender; Everyone in the block owes it to her. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, want to be able to have husbands, but they are not foolish enough to believe that they will ever do so. Meanwhile, their children, one has a son and the other a daughter, are about to get married (not between them). Tamae is angry at how much prettier her daughter has become than she is, and tries bitterly to convince her not to marry that man. Nobu's concerns about his son are more legitimate in nature, but they are also (understandably) selfish. After her son leaves, she will be alone. A bit in the movie, two of Kin's former clients came to look for her, one was so obsessed with her that he tried to make her commit a double suicide with him, the other of her best clients. Unfortunately, he comes for his money, not for his love. The way I've described the movie makes it sound implacably depressing, but it really is not. Sad, but not fatally. It's more bittersweet. Unfortunately, I only liked the late Chrysanthemums. The story seems better when I remember it, but it is very slow and boring. In fact, I fell asleep twice during the movie, and I was not tired before I started. This is the kind of film that I can appreciate more than how; It reminds me a lot of my reaction to a couple of more famous Ozu movies. 7/10.
