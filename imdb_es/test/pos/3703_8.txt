"Caribe" is not a masterpiece in any of its narrative aspects. However, it offers a perfectly pleasant story, along with a magnificent photograph. The narrative structure is established around two narrative axes, one of them embedded in the other, each with elements that are related and coexist in excellent harmony. History never loses the correct rhythm, and shows a very good combination of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The performance is excellent, and that is why we owe our recognition to the emerging director, Esteban Ram√≠rez. In addition, the characters are very well written and masterfully complex; therefore, once you become familiar with them, you can perceive their feelings without them saying anything. I can not say that I liked this image because of all the exaggerations it generated (in Costa Rica), but rather because of the way it really manages to show an interesting portrait of what happens when it interferes with the balance of life of the people. With luck, the Caribbean will establish a reference for future projects in Costa Rica, since it is a very good example of the creation of good films.
