The relationship between the main characters that I thought was very realistic. How the two end up involved is credible. It does not have all the "oh, yes, right" that most Hollywood movies have. Do not mention too much how they captured the attractive, beautiful and painful side of the trapeze. I am a trapeze student and I love that they have shown how hard it is for the body, the hands and yes, those cloth burns are brutal! Definitely a must visit for the relationship, as well as the art that is made in the movie. I loved! I'm happy with the way the movie ended, but I definitely wanted to see more. Be sure to stay seated through the credits for a special treatment hehe. Great scene
