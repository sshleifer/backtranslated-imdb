LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining, absorbing and emotionally charged film by HBO-TV based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a small role). This joyous cinematic experience centers on the childhood guardian of Santiago-Hudson, Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in New York State during the 1950s. Nanny was a one-woman social service organization whose pension was full of drunks, homeless, cripples, drug addicts, misfits, and everyone else in the city who needed help rather than labor. The knot of the story revolves around the relationship of Nanny with young Ruben (played wonderfully by Marcus Franklin), a child whose divorced parents could not raise him properly, so Nanny welcomed him. S. Epatha Merkeson, who has been squandered for years in the ungrateful role of Lieutenant Van Buren on NBC's LABC & ORDEN, becomes a powerful performance as Nanny, the neighborhood's maternal figure whose pension became a symbol for the people black oppressed in her city. Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent, in a performance that earned him a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. Merkeson is backed by an impressive star cast that includes Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as Nanny's husband), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Henry Simmons, Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def and Hill Harper as the adult Ruben. Colorful and exciting, beautifully photographed and exquisitely qualified, this is a unique cinematic experience that works on all levels, but if for no other reason, it is worth watching the electrifying performance of S. Epatha Merkeson, who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it.
