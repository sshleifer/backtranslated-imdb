A lovely story about two evacuees, it has become a nice little movie, by the BBC. Most children who like a good story will enjoy this. The characters are played very well by a very good cast. I'm not sure if our American friends will appreciate it, but they do mention it, since Aunt Lou flees with a magnificent American soldier.
