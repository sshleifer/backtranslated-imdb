I've been strangely attracted to this movie since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early '80s. I say it oddly because it's a bit ridiculous of a soft fluff, a genre that does not particularly interest me. The dialogue is pompous and without philosophical sense (it makes sense, no doubt, only for French-Italian producers) and the plot is completely strange. What he achieves is a wonderfully hypnotic and completely pleasant state of mind. The landscape (the beautiful Philippines), the nudity of soft focus and the wonderful score contribute to a strange and extremely visible exercise in a kind of film that is rarely seen today. It is truly one of my great "guilty pleasures". I was lucky to find it on an old laser disk and I have seen it more times than I think are healthy. A piece of courage that is worth it.
