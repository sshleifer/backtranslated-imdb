I grew up outside of Naila Germany (where they landed), all the details of the film were 100% authentic, the power lines that flew, the nosy neighbors, the grandmother telling the kids that they can not watch TV from West Germany, etc. This film brings many good memories to those who are European, a great Disney production ... The same film in German makes Klaus Lowitsch and Gunter Meisner use their own voices to translate the English version into German ... German version also use Cookoo birds, a bird that is originally from Germany as background noise to let you know you are in Germany. I showed this movement to many of my German relatives and they really liked this movie. they made a prototype of a balloon that they had to give up because the materials they used were too porous and the other 2 balloons that they used for the escape. The problem of the burner was solved when they flipped the propane cylinders upside down.)
