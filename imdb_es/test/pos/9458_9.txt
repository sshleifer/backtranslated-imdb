When I went to see this movie, I thought that this would be another elegant film that I would have to endure with my sister. Also, the last Amanda Baynes movie was not so good, which made me doubt the film since she is the main actress. However, within 5 minutes I was laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes, the jokes were not "out there", but more. Then a second to understand it but very funny. The script was not too complex, I could not understand the love triangle, but it was very faithful to the original work of Shakepeare. I loved every minute so much that I kicked a guy two seats away in a fit of laughter hahaha! Very embarrassing! Definitely, I would recommend people to watch this movie, especially the girls, since the guys in this movie are very fashionable. (Laughter) So much that I could get it on DVD.
