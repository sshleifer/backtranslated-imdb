Aaah ... The Thing. <br /> <br /> To see a horror movie in which not only all the characters are over thirty years old, but also clearly not attractive, they make a refreshing change and remind me of those distant times in which Actors were chosen for their talent and ability to play realistic characters, rather than for their adolescent appeal on the cover of a magazine. And Carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can really create realistic environments instead of too stylized parodies. And there is no truculent 'twist' ending, nor a celebrity appearance, nor a lame pseudo-romantic subgroup. <br /> <br /> AND REALLY I miss the physical effects on the set; With all those 20 year olds trying new crazy ideas with blood, latex and early animatronics vats. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984, we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Company of Wolves, A Nightmare on Elm Street ... what time of effects Of horror! And do not make me start with the death of the matte paint. The work mate in this movie is beautiful and perfect. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? CGI third-rate, former directors of music videos and professional stylists, which makes even "hard" horror films look like brilliant MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to Netflix's "The Howling".
