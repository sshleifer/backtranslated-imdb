Roy Andersson "Du Levande" is not totally original, since it is a counterpart to Andersson's previous film "Sånger från andra våningen". Still, the film has an aura of total originality. Some filmmaking conventions are still dismissed: most actors do not look anything like what you would expect in a movie and shots take a long time. Most of the time the camera does not move, but people move around it. The shots start somewhere and many times the landscape accumulates in surprising proportions. W.G. Sebald comes to mind in literature with the same technique. Due to the time spent on each shot, the suspension is really high in many of the scenes. There is a story and there is not: the spectator is left to accumulate in his own mind. This movie is positive. He is determined not to see all this in a negative way and at the same time he will not overlook social injustices. One of the messages I received was that maybe all the failures and accidents are not fatal, after all. Great movie.
