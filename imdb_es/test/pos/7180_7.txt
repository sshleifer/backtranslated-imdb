You can not be watching the same movie if you did not grow up in France (or you spent at least 10 years there, like me). I do not know if he will ever achieve it outside the French cultural borders (here I include Belgium and Luxembourg). You can not translate their kind of fun: all the names are jokes (how many people outside of Paris would understand the play on words in "Couloirdebus", the name of one of the Roman legionaries?). However, Monica Bel (l?) ​​Ucci is so beautiful that I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her.
