After having seen this, I find it hard to believe that you do not know yourself better. This and the COME AND SEE (Klimov, 1986), slightly better known but almost so shamefully forgotten, must be two of the greatest war movies. They are significant, powerful, incisive. THE ASCENT is also endowed with a slightly used but brilliantly bright Schnittke score.
