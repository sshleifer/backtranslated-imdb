In many ways, the perfect movie. The "Incredible Journey" and the story of Horatio Alger come together to give a positive turn to the generally depressing theme of existentialism. In essence, the tribulations of the muppets are reduced to the final song of the film: "Life is like a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending". They create their own reality, which has all the traps of each epic story: a high goal at the end of what is necessarily a journey loaded with obstacles; a growing group of like-minded individuals for camaraderie; an unpleasant set of villains that are not beyond redemption; and a big-budget Hollywood ending because, damn it, they CAN. <br /> <br /> Only Jim Henson could achieve this. He walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without deviating too much or too hard in either of them. Of course, it seems strange to invest so much weight in a movie starring puppets, but in the end maybe they are the perfect puppets to make these points. The atmosphere of the film allows the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream, the "happy" ending, the unnecessary cameos and the explosion of songs in the blink of an eye. In general, these aspects are anathema to film quality, but the self-deprecating way in which the story is delivered makes the vision guilt-free. One of the few movies that can really be called "suitable for all ages". <br /> <br /> The other films related to the muppets (including "The Empire Strikes Back"), although they are tasty, do not touch the simple grace. of this movie. Take, for example, the musical number "I hope something better comes", the duo of Kermit and Rowlf. Amused in his vaudevillian madness, however, he makes a scathingly crucial point about the motivations behind the choices of life. Sparkly.
