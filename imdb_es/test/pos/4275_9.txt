As a local artist, I thought "Grease" showed what the Broadway producers are looking for and highlighted a bit of the active population. Although my favorites did not win (but they came in second place), I enjoyed comparing myself with them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as an interpreter. <br /> <br /> Olivia Newton-John was brought in because she is the obvious link between the Broadway production and the television audience. <br /> <br /> They sang songs from the movie ("Hopelessly Devoted" and others) because these songs will be included in the new production. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that the cast of B'Way seems much older, but you should keep in mind that these are people who have been on Broadway and have tried hard to be there. If the whole cast was green and fresh, then I think it would have compromised the selection process by which the producers choose their talent.
