What can I say about this band, I was hooked on 68, I was a ten year old boy, I grew up on the Blues even though my dad, then these guys from the Midlands appeared, a fusion of Country Rock, Heavy Rock and Blues, I wish I could see them at I live in the early years, I was lucky to be there in 79 (Knebworth), it was the best concert I've seen to date. I await a full version of that warm August. The night will be very soon. This CD gave me the opportunity to see the boys again and again. The song is still the same, but it's great, but this CD is cut to the chase. <br /> <br /> Live the Zepp.
