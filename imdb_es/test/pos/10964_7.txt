In many ways, the film career of legendary independent filmmaker John Cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock, the consummate studio director. Where Hitchcock treated his actors like cattle, Cassavetes tried to work with them in an improvised manner. Where all the elements of a Hitchcock shot are composed impeccably, Cassavetes cared less about how a scene was figuratively composed than the way he felt, or what he transmitted, emotionally. Hitchcock stories were always first-line narratives, with the human element placed in the background. Cassavetes highlighted the human experience in each of his films. If some things do not make much logical sense, so be it. <br /> <br /> One can see this even from his first film, 1959's Shadows, filmed with a 16mm handheld camera, on a tight budget. of approximately $ 40,000, in Manhattan, with the repertoire company of the Cassavetes acting workshop, and promoted as an improvisational film. The story is quite simple, as it follows the lives of three black Manhattan brothers, Benny (Ben Carruthers), a trumpeter and no account, Hugh (Hugh Hurd), a singer and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), the younger sister. from both. The three main arches of the film deal with Hugh's failures as a nightclub singer, and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Crosse); The adventures of Benny in a Manhattan affair with his two friends without an account; and Lelia's lover, first with a white Tony boy (Anthony Ray), who does not notice the light-skinned Lelia race, even after sleeping with her; then with Davey (Davey Jones), rigid and appropriate, who can be a misogynist. <br /> <br /> In the first arch, nothing happens, except Hugh of dark skin that pontificates on how degraded it feels to be singing. in low class nightclubs, and opening shows for female acts. He dreams of triumphing in New York, or even in Paris, but you can say that he is the kind of man who will continue to deceive himself of his limited ability, for the only time we can really hear him sing, he shows that he is a marginal Talent, in the best case. The fact that Rupert keeps encouraging him allows us to glimpse how destructive friendships work. But is this the least important of the three arcs? While this movie is better in general than, say, the first Martin Scorsese film, a decade later, Who knocks on my door? Another story of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers, has none of the brilliant moments, neither cinematographic nor cinematographic. - What's that movie? Nor is it naturalistic, since naturalism in art is something very difficult to achieve, especially in the cinema, although the Manhattan exteriors of the 1950s, at ground level, are a jewel to relive. While Shadows may be, in fact, an important film with regard to the history of the independent film circuit, it is certainly not close to a great movie. Some parts are sermons, of bad performance, the scenes end in any way, almost like dark sketches, and sometimes they cut apparently in the middle. In general, it is a very sloppy work, especially because of the atrocious jazz score that is often not synchronized with the rest of the film, since Cassavetes showed that as a director, at least in his first film, he was a good actor. The only reason why anyone can see Shadows is because Cassavetes finally got better with later films, and this gives an idea of ​​his later work style. <br /> <br /> The National Film Registry has rightly declared that this film is worthy of preservation. as 'culturally significant'. All this is in line with the creed of the art that Cassavetes has defended for a long time, as typified by this quote: 'I have never seen a helicopter exploded. I've never seen anyone go and blow someone's head. So, why should I make films about them? But I have seen people who destroy themselves in the smallest way. I've seen people retire. I've seen people hide behind political ideas, behind drugs, behind the sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and I've done all these things myself. So I can understand them. What we are saying is so smooth. It's sweetness We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems. ' That this film is 'culturally significant' is true, but that truth is not synonymous with being 'artistically significant'. It is in the difference between these two definitions that great art really thrives.
