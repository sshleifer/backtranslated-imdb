I have seen the 1973 film, Lost Horizons, and I read many of the reviews of this film. I agree that the move had many opportunities for improvement, but unlike all those who seek the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best performance, I was looking for something a little different and this movie was given to me. I saw this film not as a criticism, but as a person in search of a little hope, a little joy, a little liberation from my daily life, and this is what I got. You can be critical of singing and dialogue, but that's not what I'm looking for when I go to see a movie. I am looking for a little liberation from my daily life, a little time where I can sit down and imagine a better life, where people love another and help another. It is a pity that we can not enjoy a movie for what it tells us and stop disarming it as an English teacher reading a fifth grade essay. This can be very simplistic, but in reality, would not it be good?
