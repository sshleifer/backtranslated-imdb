The novel by Jennifer Egan was presented on the screen by the Canadian director Adam Brooks in a film that, based on some comments from the contributors to this forum, seems a bad proposition, but in fact, it is much better than you think. <Br /> <br /> This is a story about two sisters who loved each other deeply. Faith, the happy and carefree hippie girl, takes her younger sister, Phoebe, under her wing. Phoebe loves faith; When the oldest decides to follow her boyfriend Wolf to Europe on a Berkley summer vacation, she promises to send Phoebe a postcard every day. Faith does that, until the cards stop showing up and one night, some time later, the family receives a phone call informing them that Faith has died in tragic circumstances. <br /> <br /> Phoebe can not forget Faith. That's why after a few years, she decides to take the same route that the older sister took. Take the letters of Faith and visit each place, starting in Amsterdam, then to Paris and want to finish the trip in Portugal, where Faith found her untimely death. <br /> <br /> In Paris, Phoebe hooks up with Wolf, who is no longer a hippie and lives with his girlfriend. Wolf, tries to persuade Phoebe to abandon her trip and return home; she suspects that Wolf has the key to solve the mystery, and when she goes to Portugal, she makes a discovery when she finds an image that clearly contradicts Wolf's version of what she told Phoebe. He feels guilty and, against the wishes of his girlfriend, decides to accompany Phoebe to the city where Faith died. The story changes at this point and we return in flashbacks to what Faith experienced in Europe and what happened in her last days. <br /> <br /> The best in "The Invisible Circus" are the performances of the directors, something for which Mr. Brooks has to take the credit. The big surprise is the variety of Cameron Diaz, who, like Faith, seems to select parts of light comedy, when he is able to do a good dramatic job with the right director. Jordana Brewster is seen as the older Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. She is an impressive beauty with what seems to be a naturalness to act. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows that he is also capable of making a more serious drama. Sweet Camilla Belle plays young Phoebe quite convincingly. Blythe Danner appears as the mother of the girls. <br /> <br /> The European places are gloriously photographed by Henry Braham. The film is also reinforced by the musical score of Nick Laird-Clowes and the original song by Petra Haden. Elizabeth Kling edited with great elegance. Ultimately, this film shows Adam Brooks in great shape, as he gives the right tone to the adaptation of the novel and is rewarded for having the right cast doing wonders for him.
