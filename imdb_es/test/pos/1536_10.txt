"Closet Land" tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements. I could read many things about the plot of the movie beforehand, but it really is not necessary. All you need to know is that the movie has to do with an interrogation. On the way, we learn many things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated. We also learn that the world can be a dark and terrifying place. Especially when you have absolutely no control over it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film amounts to a warning (although, in fact, the movie has several different aspects) about what happens to the freedoms of people when they "look the other way" and ignore the injustices that happen to those around them. <br /> <br /> If you have about an hour and a half and you know where you can rent this, I strongly recommend that you do so.
