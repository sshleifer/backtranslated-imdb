This is a jewel. As a production of Film Four, the anticipated quality was effectively delivered. Filmed with great style that reminded me of some Errol Morris films, well organized and simply exciting. It is long but horrifying to the point that it is unbearable. We know that something bad happened (you can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews) but we are forced to see it, a bit like a slow-motion car accident. The story covers most of the conceivable aspects and, unlike some documentaries, it did not try to refrain from showing the dark sides of the stories, but it also deals with the guilt of the people Don left behind, wondering why he did not They stopped in time. It took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this documentary very well done.
