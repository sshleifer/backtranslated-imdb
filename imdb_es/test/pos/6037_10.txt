Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor who has a secret romance with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he does not leave his wife, he sees that he has no choice but to murder her and make him look like he committed suicide. Pity for him, our wrinkled detective, Lieutenant Columbo (Peter Falk), is in the case. <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco has written another episode of the series with great clarity, following wonderful details with wonderful details. We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we are completely absorbed. Then, when Columbo appears on the scene, he gets even better. <br /> <br /> First we see Columbo after the murder (as usual). This time he's at the vet with his new dog. The scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest in the program (think of Columbo's discomfort for the nude model in "Fit for Framing"). Columbo is very funny when he is trembling or spinning deliberately to trip his prey; but too many writers make the mistake of showing it ridiculously when they are with people who are not suspicious. Bochco, on the other hand, shows Columbo a little uncomfortable with his new pet in a handful of discreet scenes that are fun and cleverly integrated into the story. (And I am grateful that he did not strive for a finishing line in the search for Columbo to give the dog a name.) As far as we know, the dog remains nameless.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode, and Peter Falk takes full advantage of them. He is particularly good in a monologue in which he expresses disbelief that someone could commit suicide, let alone this brilliant and beautiful pianist. And it's even better in his scenes playing cat and mouse with Cassavetes. It is to be hoped that these two friends and long-standing collaborators will face each other brilliantly; and that is what we have. Notice that Alex Benedict can not stop admiring Columbo, who is a foolish fool, even when the brilliant detective is tightening the rope around his neck. <br /> <br /> Bochco takes full advantage of every situation in his script. When Columbo is going to question the presumed Benedict mechanic, of course? Of course! ?? he asks the man to look at his own shattered heap. And when Benedict finds Columbo in the Hollywood Bowl before the rehearsal, of course? Of course! ?? He is at the piano playing "chopsticks". And what should our daring lieutenant bring, but the victim's typewriter with the fake suicide note still on the roll? <br /> <br /> Columbo also has good scenes with a precocious girl (Dawn Frame) and the charming Blythe Danner, who plays the wife of cassavetes. It's nice to see Myrna Loy appear as Danner's mother, although she has recently played her secondary role. <br /> <br /> Director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted, especially as a Coach in "Cheers") does a perfect job worthy of credit, although he follows the example of almost all the other directors of "Columbo" by adding a or two silly flourishes. The scenes end up blurring and begin to focus. So is that fragment where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the scene of the crime? and we see a zoom in his image reflected in his sunglasses. There is also a scene with Myrna Loy and a group of old fogies that are interpreted atrociously by all, except Cassavetes. <br /> <br /> However, these are issues. This is a splendidly entertaining episode, the kind that made me a "Columbo" fan.
