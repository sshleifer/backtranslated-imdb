For some reason, I always enjoy movies that people hate, when I really do not think they're that bad, and this is one of those movies. In the case of this movie, I think it's too criticized, I'm really not as bad as a movie. In fact, I think this is one of the best sequels. "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" begins the night before Halloween, where Michael brutally murders Jamie Lloyd (who was captured by the "Man in Black" in part 5) after she gave birth to her baby. Then we are introduced to the Strode family, who now casually live in Myers' old house (which seems to change in each movie). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, the now-adult child who survived the original murders. They must fight together to save Jamie's baby from an evil cult that takes care of Michael, while Michael himself is forced to kill by an ancient Celtic ritual in which he must sacrifice a whole family in Haddonfield. <br /> <br /> This is surely one of the best sequels of the series, in my opinion anyway, and I can not understand all the hate it has received. I had a good suspense, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, I admit), some moments of fear here and there, and a lot of cuts of gore and knife to appease all you gorehounds. Not all the acting was not particularly good, but it was convincing enough for me. Marianne Hagan is the protagonist and is very nice. Paul Rudd plays an adult Tommy Doyle, he is also very talented and plays his role very well. The rest of the cast (apart from the brilliant Donald Pleasance) is not much to praise, but it was not that bad either, considering all things. I'm still not sure if giving an explanation of why Michael kills was completely necessary, but in the end it turned out that he was fine and was not upset about the way they linked everything up. The open conclusion was also strange, but it could have been something else. <br /> <br /> I've also seen the infamous "Producer's Cut" of this movie, its original cut, and I think, in some ways, it's better. It also explains the Thorn curse that drives Michael and has some extra scenes that really helped to back the movie, and the ending was much better in my opinion. It felt more natural than the conclusion given to us in the studio cut of the film. I would like Dimension to release this alternative version of the film, because personally I think it's better. However, the possibilities of it are very scarce. <br /> <br /> In general, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" is a very good sequel and will please all fans of the series. This movie is not the best of all horror movies, but it's definitely worth renting if you want to see Michael do his thing. Just do not expect shine, and you will enjoy it. 7/10.
