This is my favorite horror movie, almost the second of 'Poltergeist'. I saw "One Dark Night" when he first appeared in theaters in 1983 at the theater where he worked. <br /> <br /> I was born in 1963, so I have a certain love for the horror films of the 80s, despite being a little outdated and the dialogue is not well written. What I thought was so original was that the phenomenon of "psychic vampirism" has not been addressed (at least, as far as I know at the time) and it is a very real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> I did not do it "It does not matter if Adam West was in that (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but he thought that Meg Tilly was a good cast. Hutton (from 'Brainstorm' and 'Invaders From Mars') as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw the studies on Ramar's skills was sadly overlooked.As a gay man, he was paying more attention to David Mason Daniels, the unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend from Meg Tilly, he's selling real estate in Texas now. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie 'realist' in two ways: Raymar, who was discovered to have murdered 6 girls in his surrealist apartment, had a funeral with little assistance, which reflects the fact that it was not only the mysterious, a hermit, but a murderer, as you know, these guys are buried without fanfare, second, if the corpses were telekinetically mobile, they would move, dragging their feet. The filmmakers pod They would have opted for the divers walking, moaning, with arms outstretched zombies, but opted for what would be credible. Prestige! The buzzing of the electric shock from Ramar's eyes in his 'coffin of the throne' (as if he were supervising his kingdom of the dead), throws a mysterious magenta light into the mausoleum that will remain with you for years. If you have ever been to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by the stained glass windows. Do not make me start with cavernous silence. Even Ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric and perverted old man. The score was unique and memorable, and I keep kicking myself for not having received it on the cassette when it first came out. The taxiway was made where it was supposed to be. I especially liked the carefully planned features of each corpse: the bride, the very broken girl who still holds her teddy bear, the grandmother, the tall, thin black man, and the veteran of the Second World War, and the one with thin green eyes. elder who was the first to greet the initiators of the clique of the "sisters". Even corpses can be good actors, I suppose. The only thing he had to moan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and drowned. Julie's boyfriend could not be done unless a corpse was placed on the stomach and feet first, but why? It seemed a bit cool too. <br /> <br /> The movie starts strangely, and we never see Ramar's face (until the last quarter of the movie, which is like unwrapping a birthday present) while he picks up a teenager. Runaway girl in her daughter's psychic flash. Then we see forensic doctors dragging his body in his one-bedroom apartment, where we see that he is experiencing his telekinetic art by placing dishes on his wall. The rest creeps when the group of "Sisters" in the style of the Heathers makes Julie a final initiation to spend the night inside the mausoleum, but it is a well placed accumulation until the unpleasant horror later. The movie is not bloody in any sense of the word. The saddest part is when Ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to give him back his power, and he bubbles and then melts. I have always felt that a power like Ramar's could never die and a sequel might be worth seeing. I can see it now: One Dark Night II: Turning In The Grave. But let's be honest: the movie is alone. I heard that the movie had other titles, but the original settings. <br /> <br /> A remake would not make sense. But if there was one, he would write a better dialogue and lengthen some scenes, such as showing the studies on Ramar's skills performed in the laboratory instead of listening to them on a tape recorder. In this age of information, something like that would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why only raise the mausoleum when the power of Ramar could also be extended to the cemetery? Let's say that I would hate to be one of the people who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax; something that can also be shown. I think having one of the initiating sisters recognized one of the corpses as a relative who would have added some good, though disturbing, character. With the effects of CG, some amazing scenes with Ramar animating cremated remains would be out of the wall. <br /> <br /> Say what you want, 'A dark night', but it has everything. So look at least once in your life ... or death!
