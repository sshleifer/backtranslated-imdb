Lady and the Tramp II: The adventure of Scamp is a great movie with which many children today can relate. It is a well-presented story about a child who yearns for the freedom to do things his way, and how he manages to get this freedom is only part of what makes this film interesting. Just forget the little disappointments, like the fact that there were only adults in this movie based on a puppy's point of view, because that's only 0.5% or less of the wonderful effect of the movie on the viewer. Good music, lively acting, talented animation and direction, and a powerful story tell the difference between freedom on the streets of New England and a welcoming home with your family. And no matter how bad things seem, your family and friends "are always there" to help you in any difficult situation. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get the soundtrack!
