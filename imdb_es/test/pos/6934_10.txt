I just saw this again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had a great time. This is the reason why these kinds of movies are made, to entertain people and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does that for me and for all those who showed it to them. <br /> <br /> The story is about a group of teenagers in a van running in a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farm. When a scarecrow (which is really a demon, I think) is disturbed, comes alive and animates again the bodies of local cemeteries. This leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two crazy assassins who are in the process of torturing some people in a delicatessen in a small town. Very soon it is a confrontation with humans fighting against zombies. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie! From its different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast pace and good music, something always happened and you NEVER get bored! Sure, it's cheap, but you can say that in this film a lot of attention was paid and it was worked hard. I have read other comments and all I can say is that these people did not understand the point. If you want a 35mm full moon fluff, or if you like modern things like Urban Legend, then I tell you to pass this. If you like low budget things like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I tell you to buy this now. <br /> <br /> The makeup and the gore are very good, the acting is uneven at times, but in general It's pretty good and the editing is very impressive. This is enough to fill two more movies! Actually, it's one of the best serial movies I've seen in a long time.
