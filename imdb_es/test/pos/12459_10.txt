The best Tarzan ever made! This movie is made in a way that no other Tarzan has come close to doing. It has everything you would want in a Tarzan movie. No other Tarzan film has played the character so well. I would say that if you have seen a Tarzan movie and you liked it, you should see it, you will love it, and if you have never seen it, you should see it and forget about the rest.
