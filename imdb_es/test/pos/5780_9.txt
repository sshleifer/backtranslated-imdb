I give this film 9 out of 10 just because there are not enough specific scientific references about how much energy is needed to produce food to satisfy those who hate science. It seems that mdixon believes that biased commentators are inventing these things, but even an elementary understanding of the resources and laws of thermodynamics will indicate that, at least, they have a solid scientific basis when they claim that we can not continue to depend on them. Oil, we must make the transition to different types of energy, and we do not have a plan that replaces the amount of energy we obtain from oil. Other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have perished. Read "Collapse" by Jared Diamond, which is a popular book, or any elementary Ecology or Earth Science textbook, and you can verify the basic premise of this movie. Go ahead, play the violin while burning Rome!
