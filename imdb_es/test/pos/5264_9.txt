This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson shine in this romantic comedy. One is a business executive who reassesses life based on the expectation of his death in one year. The other is a playboy who has grown tired of looking for young women looking for gold and looking for a relationship with a mature and vital woman. If you have silver in your hair and / or romance in your heart, put the popcorn in the microwave, cuddle up with your honey and get ready for a treat.
