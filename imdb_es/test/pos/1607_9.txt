I can not explain why I find this so attractive and "The Leopard" does not; It may be because the focus here is on everything that was great with that movie, those intimate moments that Visconti can represent so magnificently. Like that movie, it has a majestically slow pace, but this time it's not too long. It's the kind of movie where nothing happens, but twenty minutes pass like this. I think that's partly due to the way the movie deals with the flashbacks that act as their own mini story. Like "The Leopard," he has a sympathetic leadership that brings out the same kind of worn-out pathos, although Bogard's performance is more willing to open up to being unpleasant, especially in appearance: he has a really stupid smile that's easy to dislike. It is often quite beautiful at times of tranquility. It is the opulence of Visconti's films, the grandeur of the ball scenes, which I find tedious, since they exchange individual clarity with mass precision. But here, that's part of the point: Gustav surrounded by a visual noise. <br /> <br /> The way in which the subject of Gustav's affection is presented to us is quite bright: the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this beautiful child with feminine characteristics. It's like an allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets, and it does not feel heavy. (It is not until the camera sees Tadzio completely, he retires and we see his long, thin legs, that we realize that he is not a child, but a teenager, at first we are forced to question Gustav's attraction. Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav, we have an idea of ​​man, we know him, it is a largely silent performance, and when he opens his mouth it is to spit poison; it's strange that I want the angelic and open child to project on him, there's a difference with Tadzio (we never know him, just as we never know a bunch of Fellini's grotesques, but that's because his life is different, it's his own movie ), but it is not as flirtatious as it seems, however, where it revolves around a stick that is too much). Tadzio is not necessarily guiding him, he is looking at him; Visconti only zooms in on that. <br /> <br /> The film does not detail Gustav as if he were gay. Tadzio is not even really a man, it is a version of a child (delicate, pale, dim, with golden locks) that everyone seems to love (including a beautiful young man, a little older with whom he fights). The closest they are to showing what could be understood as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality is the famous barber scene, which unlocks his repressed vanity. <br /> <br /> It is not totally successful, the whole section with Alfred is a waste, and some unnecessary scenes, people loaded with suitcases, could have been eliminated. Some parts are heavy, like when Gustav's boat stops and the rowdy boys pass it by: the looks on his face are too obvious. (But during the same scene, Gustav launches an attack, wants a new rower, something so inexplicable that it makes up for it). But there are some scenes, which are played for the first time, that accumulate a remarkable and silent intensity. Tadzio repeating a piano song over and over again, the notes trembling in the air, can be the best example of the anxiety that the film has. There is a discussion that contains a debate in which I am especially interested: can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses, or does it have to go beyond them? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who considers Visconti and Mann, as the best example of someone who goes beyond mere sensory sensations). I think he manages to do both. 9/10
