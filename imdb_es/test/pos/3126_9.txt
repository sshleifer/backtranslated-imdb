Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford <br /> <br /> Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> John Ford brings the stock company to the desert of Utah to film a western and Come out with this minor classic. Not John Wayne, there are no antiheroes in conflict, there is no psychological exploration, there are no fireworks, only an image jewel. <br /> <br /> This ensemble piece features Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They are horse traders who come to the city to do business, just when a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, shows them the way out. The group is about to embark on a trip to their own settlement, but they know that the odds and the harsh terrain are against them. Then they hire Travis and Sandy as wagon masters for their trip. On the way, they meet a peddler of medicine and his two female cohorts (Alan Mowbray as a doctor, remembering his appearance in My Darling Clementine and Joanne Dru as his "daughter"). Tension is added when Clegg's murderous gang arrives at the train of wagons. And there is also an atypical meeting (for Hollywood) with the Navajos. <br /> <br /> Most of history and humor are motivated by the clash of ideals / cultures; first between Travis and Sandy and the Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (he's constantly trying to suppress his desire to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and Mormons, between the wagon and the outlaws, and finally , all and the Navajos. There is also a classic Ford scene of a noisy dance that expresses one of its characteristic themes of civilization approaching the border. <br /> <br /> Again, there is no Duke here, but I have found Ben Johnson, especially young people. , Ben Johnson sure, to have an attractive screen presence of his own. He comes with his own background story, with that accent and also when you see him doing all the trick riding himself. It's great here in one of his first accredited appearances. Harry Carey Jr., despite having existed for a few years at this time, is still quite crude, but it's nice. Ward Bond is his wonderful and swift habitual self. I have found Joanne Dru as a fanatic in whatever you see her, but here she is fortunately discreet. Other familiar faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford and Hank Worden, who play "dumb", as they will in The Searchers a few years later. It's not more fun here. <br /> <br /> There are some absolutely spectacular black and white photographs of Ford's frequent collaborator, Bert Glennon. Not only is there the typical master class on landscapes and horizons, there is also some flowering in a handful of scenes with shadows and light (sun). The soundtrack features the legendary country music group, The Sons of the Pioneers. I can not get more cowboy than that. <br /> <br /> *** Â½ of 4
