This particular title is very interesting. The whole movie was like watching a ninja role-playing game, which is really cool. Three magic swords, three clans, a horrible demon, a political power, yotoden has it all. The animation is decent, but a little grainy, the story is top notch and the fight scenes are really great. One thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters. They are pretty freaky. If you liked the reign of blood and the displacement of ninja, Yotoden is the one to see.
