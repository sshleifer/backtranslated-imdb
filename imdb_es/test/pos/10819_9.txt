First, a word of caution. The DVD box describes this movie as a comedy. I do not think that was the intention of anyone related to the film that they were not marketing idiots. Although it is light and a bit funny in some places, it is NOT a comedy and if you expect to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of this movie and had absolutely no expectation in one way or the other. other. Considering that the other two DVDs I picked up were great disappointments, I felt very happy when I saw this movie. The acting, writing and direction were excellent. The story itself definitely interested me, since I do not usually watch movies about the last month of France before the Nazi takeover in 1940. He gave an idea of ​​the parasites that surrendered so quickly and agreed to divide his beloved country. Along the way, there are plots that involve a selfish and weak actress very well played by Isabelle Adjani, who looks wonderful after all these years. She kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor fool to fall. This sap escapes from prison and finds it, with another lover, a high government official and weasel played by Gerard Depardieu. In addition, a secondary plot is presented about a Jewish physicist who tries to smuggle deuterium out of the country and eventually becomes the main plot. The story has many nice twists and turns, a slight sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy) and some genuine moments of suspense. Together, they create a good package that will surely please.
