A sick man, Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider), crosses the lines of Teen Chat as Captain Howdy. He pretends to be a teenager and invites other teenagers to his house at the party. Instead, he hits them, pulls them, closes their mouths and tortures them (mainly with needles). Capture the daughter of policeman Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds it, arrests it and is institutionalized. Four years later he is released ... fully healed. But a lynch mop (directed, amused by Robert Englund) attacks him and hangs him. He does not die, but he snaps and Captain Howdy is back ... <br /> <br /> A very sick, disturbing and twisted horror movie. Captain Howdy enjoys the pain and torture and is trying to show the children that he kidnaps how to enjoy it too. The scenes of torture are not as explicit (you hear more than you see), but what you see is very, very sick. There is no humor and the (silenced) cries of their victims seem too real. I was moving away from television during most of the scenes. <br /> <br /> The performance varies. Kevin Gage is not as good as the policeman, it's not terrible, but it could have been better. Dee Snider is very scared as Captain Howdy: his attack scenes are not pleasant. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not your typical horror movie. I probably never see it again (this movie really gets under your skin), but I recommend it to all horror fans, at least those who have strong stomachs. I give him a 7.
