This is one of the classic episodes of TWILIGHT ZONE, where, in the simplest situations, the viewer was involved in an apparently symbolic conflict, only to find the surprising and strangely acceptable solution. Five figures are inside a container / prison: a commander, a dancer, a piper, a clown and a vagabond. No doubt, they are a strange choice of guys to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (though) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. What do they have in common? No one can solve it. But gradually the Major organizes them to work and to bet leaning on the shoulders of the other. And the commander, arriving at the top of the line of figures, arrives at the entrance, and ... I leave it that way, although one of the other criticisms in this thread actually reveals the story. <br /> <br /> The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, the famous work of Pirandello. If the real purpose of the show was to falsify that work is questionable: Pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relationships with each other. But the five characters here, while trying to understand their situation, are completely dark: they are not in the situation of the six characters in Pirandello who know their current situation. This uncertainty of what is happening allows viewers to think that it is an abstract drama. <br /> <br /> The actors, William Windon as the Major and Murray Mattheson as the Clown in particular, give good accounts of themselves. And the conclusion, whether planned as a parody or not, is quite effective.
