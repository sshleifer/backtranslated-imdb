This movie would have worked much better if this was the first Critters movie, this is a low budget movie with only two (2) Critters shown on the screen. The reason why this seems like a failure is because this is the latest Critters movie and it has such a low budget that it seems that the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money. However, I liked this movie, I compare it mainly with the third movie (which was bad). The Critters 4 have a more serious tone, the first half of the movie (even without seeing a Critter yet) you have a feeling of fear to see her, it's a pity that they do not "milk" the Critters, I mean even if they only had two (2) puppets that could have used them on the screen much more. The Critters also have different deaths in this movie, which made this a bit special, especially at the end with the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and it's different in this movie that took me by surprise. Finally, I liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series, so at least we will not see more Critters 5. Oh, one last thing, I missed a scene in this movie, we never saw a Critter shooting a peak from their back, maybe these puppets did not have that feature, but I was very disappointed not to see that (in Critters 3 we see a lot of shots of spikes, which was the only good thing I liked about that movie).
