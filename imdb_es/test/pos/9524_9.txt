I admit that I possibly missed some small moments when I was not paying enough attention, but I had enough of the story to agree that it's a great family movie, from director Lionel Jefferies, who played Grandpa Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang . It basically starts with a happy middle-upper class family that lives in Victorian London. One night two parents visit the Father (Iain Cuthbertson), and he goes with them, and does not return. They move to a country house in the countryside, and here to the children; Bobbie (Jenny Agutter, whom I saw for the first time in Child's Play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep their spirits up, with their fascination for the nearby railroad. Every day they greet the passengers faithfully on passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and become heroes. Their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father. Also starring Dinah Sheridan as Mother / Mrs. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks, William Mervyn as the old gentleman, Peter Bromilow as Dr. Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as the Russian. It was number 29 in The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 24 in The 50 Greatest British Films. Very well!
