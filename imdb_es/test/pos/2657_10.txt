This movie is not only good, it's amazing. Besides giving us good interpretations, an original plot, fantastic special effects, smart messages and much more, it was a world for the public, until then, completely invisible. This is the first science fiction movie that takes us to the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and a reality that makes the audience run out of words. I'm only 16 years old and, therefore, I was brought up in a world of modern effects and 3D animations in movies. But, nevertheless, I was really impressed by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects were just one of the merits of this film, the camera was in true Kubrick style, surprising and charming. It feels as if the screen consumes you and absorbs you in this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the size of this film surprised me from my guards, although I had seen the classification before buying it. But this movie has more than this. The meaning of this film can also be interpreted as you wish, although I think there are some clear points related to humanity (also the true style of Kubrick). The way in which humanity, in addition to its evolution, is simply a maintenance on board and, therefore, is not necessary for the computer, one of the tools of the humanities. How we see ourselves in space as babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero gravity, breathing through equipment like fish out of water. At the peak of evolution, we embark on endless adventure as simple primates. Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridiculous or just a waste of time. But before you can draw those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with quiet music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, in many cases, beauty does not receive the legitimate respect of the spectators. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not a normal movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can see with other movies, this requires time, thoughts and, above all, commitment and feelings to see. All this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving images. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
