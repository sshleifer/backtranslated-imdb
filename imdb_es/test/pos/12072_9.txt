Blubbered like a little girl during the end of this movie and I dare someone else to hold it together without a sob. Absolutely moving things, but encouraging in their essence. <br /> <br /> A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret, who plays a mother with ten years of terminal illness who, knowing that her arthritic husband worker will not be able to support the family when she is gone, Organize your children's adoptions before they leave. The paper really deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> You really feel for this poor family as the dying mother gives everything to make sure that her children do not end up in a poorly managed state orphanage system. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, get it if you can.
