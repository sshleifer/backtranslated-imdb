Um ... a serious movie about troubled teenagers in Singapore, a country I do not know much about, but I have the mistaken impression that all the children there are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and the government. Well, I guess I'm wrong, like other cities / countries, they also have their teenagers with problems that also carry the not-so-surprising rebellious lifestyle of drugs, fights, bad language and ... many other obvious signs to be a bad boy The surprising part of this film is not really about how these running children cause problems to themselves and others, but to the subtle homosexuality hidden behind their so-called loyalty between them. The link between these "brothers" may well originate from an unconscious gay tendency within these children. Although it is not uncommon for the boys of str8 to have a close friendship with each other, but to watch this film up close, they should be entering all kinds of gay film festivals and I would not be surprised if they can win many more prizes for this direction. !
