I saw it for the first time in black and white, around Christmas in the early sixties, when it was aired on British television. I was absolutely hooked, and I saw it every time it was repeated on TV (possibly only two or three times, as it happens, if only we had video recorders!). <br /> <br /> As indicated by other contributors, the plot describes the return of Hoppity the Grasshopper, after a period of time, to a US city in the 1940s. He finds that everything is not as he left it, and his good insect friends (who live in the "lowlands" on the outskirts of the garden that belongs to a composer and his wife) are now under the threat of "humans", who are trampling through the broken fence that precedes the property, using it as a shortcut. <br /> <br /> Insect houses are being crushed by their feet, and they are also often burned by cigarette butts and matches. Old Mr. Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey (Hoppity's childhood sweetheart) are in grave danger of losing their Honey Shop in the face of this threat. <br /> <br /> To compound their problems, the tortuous "insect property" C. Bagley Beetle has Romantic designs on the same Honey Bee, and waits, with the help of his followers Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito, force Bumble to give him his hand in marriage. <br /> <br /> Will the heroic and audacious Hoppity win the day, and manage to save the insect community from its disastrous fate, and especially its precious Honey from hers? Enjoy the classic songs ("Katy Did, Katy Did not" is a great example of swing and optimism), and the colorful visual effects as the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Time has not mitigated my fascination with this. Masterful work of animation and storytelling, and I was very pleased to find out that it had been released to the video, although I later discovered that it was in PAL NTSC format. It does not matter, I sent the video immediately, and only then did I buy a portable TV / video combination (complete with NTSC playback). <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed many nostalgic presentations since then, and I have even discovered that television rights have gone from the BBC (which informed me that they were unlikely to show the film in any of its stations) to FilmFour, which (finally!) Had been showing it on their digital stations in early 2007. <br /> <br /> My granddaughter (three years old) was absolutely fascinated while we watched her together, and this is a child who has been influenced by the digital era and the resulting productions generated by computer! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie at any age, and especially to younger viewers. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fleischer a posthumous Oscar!
