"Subliminal cruelty" has to be one of the most disturbing films I've seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" did not bother me much, but there is a strange psychological element in "Subconscious Cruelty". This movie invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos, surreal images and one of the most disturbing movie scores and sound designs. Repulsive at times; Yes, but his visual style can be compared to Avant Gard directors such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makavejev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and launch the graphic violence of a Luico Fulci movie, and you will be able to guess where you are. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into 4 parts. The first part "The Eye of the Ovary" is really short. A narrator tells us about the parts of the brain and their functions. Then, a naked woman opens her stomach and pulls out an eyeball. The second part "Human Larvae" is like the movie "Eraserhead" but with incest. It is about the sexual obsession of a man with his pregnant sister. Where is Frued when you need it? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of "Begotten" and the 1972 short film by Jame's Broughton "Dreamwood". In this segment, people have sex with the earth. Men make bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. The branches bleed when they break. He watches in horror as a man blows a knife protruding from a woman's vagina. These people really know how to get in touch with nature. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is the most disturbing and, at times, it borders on hardcore pornography. This part of the film made me think of Jodorowsky's "The Holy Mountain", "Sweet Film" and "Cannibal Holocaust". I have never been more disturbed in my life by what I witnessed. A businessman gets his hooks separated by the hooks. Yuck and ay! Two women urinate on a figure of Christ and proceed to eat it cannibalically as communion bread and sodomize it with a tree branch. Poor guy. The last part was so extreme that if I watch the movie again, I will close my eyes or move forward a little. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are obviously very talented. To think that they did this project there in the early 20's. Hussein went on to direct the influence of Tarkovsky "Ascension" (2002), which is a much better film and co-wrote the screenplay of Nacho Cerda after the masterpiece of the dark horror "The Abandoned". "Subliminal cruelty" is a fascinating and disturbing journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds. Kind of.
