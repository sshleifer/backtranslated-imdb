A recent survey of children in the United Kingdom reinforced the notion presented by this film 27 years ago. Being more than anything, young people want to grow up to be someone famous. It used to be the doctors and the firemen what the children wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is the story of a group of children accepted at the High School for Performing Arts in New York City. We saw them at the first audition, then we took classes and learned about life for the next four years. The movie has many good qualities, but ultimately, it leaves you a little unsatisfied. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker's bold directorial style fits very well with the story. The film has been classified as musical, but more than anything it is a drama. The musical numbers and dance routines explode here and there, and Parker keeps them as realistic as they really could have been filmed. The performance is, for the most part, first class, with some exceptions. The tempo is a little off, particularly towards the end of the movie, but by that point, the story has already taken some wrong turns anyway. <br /> <br /> First, the auditions at the beginning of the movie should have eliminated some of the main characters. It seems unlikely that someone will show up and audition for one department, and then stumble on admissions to another. Some of these people just do not seem so talented or interested to begin with. Once the first year of classes begins, the film settles at a good pace. The interaction between students and teachers is very well handled and leaves you wanting more. The movie begins to get lost later as we see more and more student lives outside of school. Some of these people are simply not worth worrying about. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of the movie is making Ralph Garcy's character so prominent. This guy is a fake; self-centered pull An "a-hole professional" as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routines. The audience is supposed to feel somehow for this guy and his tragic personal situation, but he just expected them to throw their ass out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people that will interest you when this movie ends. As much as I try, I still can not develop crunches like Gene Anthony Ray did in this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is good. It is memorable, interesting and full of daring scenes and performances. It may run a little too much, and maybe some of the wrong characters will fully develop while others remain in the background. The musical numbers are great, and there is even a surprise or two waiting to be discovered by the time the movie ends. Although it is not perfect, Fame will be a film that will live one way or another for many years. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
