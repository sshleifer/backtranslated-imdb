BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is simply a wonderful movie! The writer / director Shemi Zarhin has created a story like no other and presents it with such good and consistent actors that it seems to me an enigma that this film has not become one of the favorite audiences in the whole world. It is intelligent, emotional, uplifting and warm, entertaining, and in all categories it is a winner. Shlomi (Oshri Cohen, in a brilliantly underestimated performance) is a 16-year-old boy who cares for his highly dysfunctional family: his mother (Esti Zakheim) is a shrew as unpleasant as ever, and in a constant state of temper because his husband cheated on her, and because she is stuck working two shifts to support her sickly father-in-law (Ariek Elias, who as Shlomi's grandfather is a bright, amusing, wise and loving old man who cares deeply for Shlomi, a married sister Ziva (Rotem Abuhab ) who moves periodically to the house due to the constant disputes with her husband who does not help her take care of her twin sons, her brother Sasi (Assi Cohen), whose life is noisy electric guitars, braggadocio about feminine conquests, and the son favorite of his mother, stir this mixture and the result is the penultimate dysfunctional family unit Shlomi prepares gourmet meals for them, buys, cleans the house, runs errands, bathes and worries He takes care of this grandfather and, in general, leads a life of submission to a family that sees him as a "retard." Shlomi longs for a girlfriend and practically fails him. the school because of his lack of time dedicated to the care of his family and the lack of concentration. By chance, his math teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) observes his natural mathematical genius in a discarded test, and with the help of the director (Yigal Nair) the two encourage him to take the test and discover that he is a genius (with dyslexia?) and arrange for him to try a special school in Haifa. Shlomi's mother will not hear any of that, but between the fights with the absent father of Shlomi (Albert Iluz) and the confrontations with the teacher and the principal, they finally accept their tests for the school. Meanwhile, Shlomi discovers a girl her age, Rona (Aya Koren), who has moved. next door and gradually the two intertwine in a physical and intellectual relationship. Always in the background is the support of Shlomi's grandfather, and when the grandfather dies, Shlomi undertakes the journey to live his life for himself, to realize his gifts, to find his happiness. The way in which the family faces this is the top of the film and does not need to be revealed simply for losing the power of the message. The film is beautifully photographed, the musical score is creatively beautiful and the final result is one of exaltation of the human spirit. Highly recommended at all levels. In Hebrew with English subtitles.
