Yes, I see this show. Because my girlfriend looks at him, of course. Well, at least, that's what I tell my friends. But since nobody here has known me, I can say this; I love! That's excellent junk television. <br /> <br /> First, there is the panel; The same Tyra, who does not miss a single opportunity to talk about herself, however, must be taken seriously, since she is a business woman. Then there's Jay Manuel, a sober gay guy, very serious and surprisingly professional, and Miss Jay, an extroverted, "queen" of the catwalk and a very funny guy, and Nigel, self-described as the only man on the panel. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the show is an in-depth look at a shallow industry, and we must give it to the producers to show us the internal vision, which can be informative and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editing is great; there is the right mix of everything; The girls who live together in the ego house, their impressions in the sets, the competitions in themselves and the judges. All this slips smoothly with the correct rhythm. There are no lengths. <br /> <br /> Of course, there must be other factors that lead to eliminations that we do not see in the shows; The panel is formed by capricious, extroverted and quick divas on complaints; Woe to those who offend them! But saying that, whenever a competitor does not step on the toes, his judgment is usually fair, I think. <br /> <br /> So, give your brain a break; If you can not beat them, join them and have fun watching this reality video with your loved ones. It will make you crave for more, in some way.
