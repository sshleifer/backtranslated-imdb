Despite its setting in New York and its characters in New York, 'Summer in the City' is not an American movie, it's better than that. The most unusual is the mixture of styles and genres. The director Niami shows a skillful touch when combining the comedy with the tragedy, the pathos with the drama. <br /> <br /> The secret to Niami's success seems to be a board of great characters: everyone could have their own movie built around them, and then complete them with beautifully rendered interpretations of one of the most wonderfully eclectic models that one would struggle to find in the same country, much less in the same film, from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, from Robert Burke to Peter Stormare, who here reveals that he has much more in him than the bad guy stereotypes he plays in the movies from Hollywood. Even Sandra Bernhard is fun here! <br /> <br /> An additional advantage, cream in the substantial cake, is the soundtrack of John Cale.
