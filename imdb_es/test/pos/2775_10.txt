Susie Q is original and is not like those other bad Disney movies, *** spoiler *** a boy named Zach moves to a new city and has problems in school, he is a good basketball player. A girl in the 1950s died with her boyfriend, when her car crashed on a bridge. Susie (Amy Jo Johnson) of the Rangers (pink ranger) is helping Zach as a ghost to get a necklace on the way to explain his sister about his ghost, and finally, when getting this necklace, Susie returns to the bridge in which he died. And then she gets into her boyfriend's ghostly car and they float. Later, when he misses her, he finds a girl who looks like her. (Do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie to watch from time to time, but they barely give because Disney needs to fill everything with stupid movies and shows. I give it a <br /> <br /> 7/10
