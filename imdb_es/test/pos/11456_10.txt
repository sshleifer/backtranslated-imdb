I love these young people trapped in a movie of the house of horrors. Not only because I'm a big fan of Linnea Quigley-Jill Terashita, but because it's fun and, in fact, scary at times. <br /> <br /> The special effects are incredible, especially the Linnea scene with the lipstick and towards the end, when almost everyone is dead and possessed. <br /> <br /> Linnea and Jill provide a lot of nudity, lots of humor, good soundtrack, lots of bodies, etc. By the way, if you have never seen it, try and buy / see the Unrated version that has more gore and in some scenes the classified version is missing.
