I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he told me he was looking at Hoods and that it was fun. So, as I said, never go against the family! The demand for more lines is fine since I like to express my own opinions quite frequently. If something is poorly written, it is more likely to be my sight and not my brain. This gives me another opportunity to take my photos in "The Departed". When you know exactly what is going to happen in the last scene without prior knowledge, that usually means that it was not all that suspense. All you need is a good manager, the same guy that I think made my favorite Mafia movie, "Goodfellows", but in a completely different way, and then, just throw Jack the big one and you get an Oscar. I have to see hoods to make sure it was not better than Gibbs "The Departed"
