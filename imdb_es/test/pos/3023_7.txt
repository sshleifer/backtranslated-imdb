A serial killer, Carl Stargher, has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them drown in a cell full of water. He is arrested by the FBI, but he is in a coma and his last kidnapping victim is waiting for him in a cell programmed to fill up with water. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the previous premise and you will see that there is one I have seen all much before looking at it. The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes an old chestnut tree diagram to something very different from what you're expecting. If I mentioned that the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter Stargher's mind, then he prepares a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> This would not be enough to make THE CELL a different kind of thriller , Director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surreal thriller. Paul Laufer's cinematography, where the opaque primary colors are in the foreground, is impressive, but Singh does not let it end there, things like the costume design where Stargher wanders through his idiosyncratic universe with opulent costumes, has a visual impact that It does much more than However, what makes THE CELL become a classic film is that you begin to be increasingly aware that the whole movie revolves around the visual instead of having a natural narrative. We see a third character, an FBI man enters Stargher's domain, but this seems more like an ideal plot twist only to present the audience with more impressive but very disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that This is a rather disturbing thriller with an atmosphere that is very depressing and that prevents the film from being, if not pleasant, involving. A scene in which an FBI agent recounts a case in which a pedophile hits a blow only to then cut off the victim's heart, will fill his heart with such desperation that he could reach the off button. You probably have to watch a lot of thrillers until you see another one as disconcerting as this one.
