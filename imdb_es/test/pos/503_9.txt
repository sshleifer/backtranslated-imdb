For a brief moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and the techno bar <br /> <br /> is amazing. I would probably follow her until my final death too! The best vampire movie of all time but with a touch. The fight scenes are impressive. Wesley Snipes shows a track that you can not see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very credible as a new and ambitious recruit who rises in the hierarchy by whatever means necessary. Great movie 9/10. Where is Blade II?
