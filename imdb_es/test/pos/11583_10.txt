THE SEA INSIDE (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jimenez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernandez Luna. (Dir: Alejandro Amenabar) <br /> <br /> An inspiring story of a death in life; Bardem is excellent <br /> <br /> The real life story of the Spanish quadriplegic Ramon Sampedro and his request to fulfill his desire for euthanasia for the right to die can not be considered a probable source of inspiration, but this film is precisely that. <br /> <br /> Sampedro (played superbly by Bardem) was a virile and energetic young man when he lost his limb function after a tragic diving accident (horribly reported in a flashback with a visceral jolt to the senses) and For almost thirty years they were paralyzed in bed, while their loving family cared about all their needs. Although his ability to move was nil, his mind was very active and proved to be an inventor, poet, author and artist who kept his mind occupied until he could no longer bear the idea of ​​living longer in his stunted condition. <br /> <br /> Enter beautiful, but also afflicted with a crippling disease attorney Julia (the ethereal Rueda who combines perfectly with Bardem as if they were truly soulmates) is hired to see through Sampedro's last wish of to end his life and, in turn, he becomes a camp helper when he begins to open up to her like nobody before. It has not been long and Julia begins to investigate the past of her position discovering many letters hidden by her family. When Julia confronts Ramon with this, at first she is reluctant to discuss anything with her, but finally agrees with her that this can help her case and the project becomes a book in preparation. A memory / biography of freestyle poetry and prose. <br /> <br /> The film is a harrowing story of the human spirit and how love finally triumphs over heart pain in many ways, including for Ramon the improbable love he shares with a complete stranger named Rosa (Denas), a single mother who one day sees him on television, inspiring her to go by bicycle to his remote farm in Spain to meet him and possibly change his mind about the end of his life. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Amenabar, who co-wrote with Mateo Gil. The fascinating script allows some fantasy in the mix when Ramon imagines himself magically leaving his bed and flying through the bucolic landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years ago the cruel turn of destiny that has imprisoned him for three decades . The film is not a total disappointment with a sly wit and occasionally a humorous tone that does not dilute the impact of the final act of the story. Congratulations also to the remarkable makeup work done by James and Jo Allen to do a great job in aging the vibrant Bardem to make him an older man who must get an Acadamy Award recognition. <br /> <br /> Bardem and Rueda deserve Oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and, despite the fact that Julia de Rueda is married to a loving and affectionate husband, a couple of people join to the other, it is impossible they were never together to begin with. That is just one of the cruelties that seem true, but it is not, by definition, the film in its entirety; It is a must and one of the best of the year.
