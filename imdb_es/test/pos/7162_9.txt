As I skipped from film to film at the SXSW Film Festival, this inaugural movie has stayed with me. Curious, because it is a dark comedy with a rather absurd premise. <br /> <br /> A family of very stressed fundamentalists in a small community of similar minds is affected by a car accident. Three of the four have the same near death experience in which they are completely open, since each one receives an inversion of the concept of original sin (I will not spoil this scene with the details). The fourth, a high school cheerleader, is not only the one who suffers physical damage, but also remains unchanged and now witnesses what has become her crazy family, apparently in spiritual bankruptcy. Each new moment brings a new indignation, since they have become innocently naked and frank in every way, horrifying her and then the community. <br /> <br /> Forgive the Franklins has the most beautiful sexual awakening scene between a husband and a wife I've ever seen, in Sarah Brightman's song "Deliver Me," a song that can now bring tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic. Robertson Dean as the father, Vince Pavia as the son and Aviva as the cheerleader's daughter are excellent, Mari Blackwell plays Peggy, the neighbor questioner of the mother and her best friend to perfection, a real character much more nuanced and full of details of what could have been (everyone in the middle of America knows a Peggy). And Theresa Willis shines positively like Betty, mom. There are many risks assumed by the actors who interpret the three characters changed, and these risks are amortized. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie has a great release. If so, I intend to see her again. <Br /> <br /> Very accurate review at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm
