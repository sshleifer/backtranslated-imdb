I just got it and it's a great movie !! I loved! Although the voice of Jane Brighton in the beginning is very annoying because of the braces, she does not open her mouth ... but you have to see her because it's a great movie !! The things he says here are very funny and extremely nice! and I'm sure Aaron would probably say some of the things in real life because I do not know, it seems so! ha ha, there's a part in the movie that's really funny ... it's when Jane's little sister meets him ... but I can not tell you what's going on because I have to let you see for yourself! I went to see the Aaron n concert and it was really fun !! It smelled so good, ha ha, I still can not believe I can meet him! I have photos if anyone wants to see them !! Steph
