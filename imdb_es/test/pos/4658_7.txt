Somewhere in the darkness of the cells of my brain there is a song in my head. I can not forget it, no matter how hard I try. It is NIGHTFUL MADNESS and it will reach you! I wish I could find a copy of this in a 45 rpm record. Five disparate teams leave one night in L.A. looking for clues instead of physical objects. A sloppy game master with two great assistants is the brain of all this madness that is about to unleash in Los Angeles. All teams are stereotypes (this movie is from 1980, before political correctness ruined everything): the "good guys", the "nerds" led by Eddie Deezen, the "silly sportsmen" who love beer, " Ladies of the "we do not need a man" type, especially the redhead, the laughing twins are also a scream, and finally, the "bad guys" with Stephen Furst as leader, Furst is hilarious as the overweight sloth of Harold, whose attempt Using a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a disaster Movies like this are no longer made In these days, movies should have a "nervousness" with some dark characters and other nonsense.Go back to the days when "good "led by David Naughton were still good and they were not in conflict, so get rid of all the serious pretensions and go back to 1980. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS.
