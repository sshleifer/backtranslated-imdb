It is very true that this film defies the conventions by not explaining the plot to the viewer. While some may have a problem with having to solve it for themselves, I accept "Uzumaki" for their irreverence. There is a PLOT, it is just that it may not be immediately accessible for a lazy viewer. This is a film that invites many interpretations, as does all great art. However, this film is also very entertaining, which makes it an unusual film experience. It is both provocative and fun.
