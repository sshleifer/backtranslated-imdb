An intelligent and very literate drama about a group of international travelers imprisoned virtual in the Hungary of 1956 to invade the Russian communist regime. Kerr and Robards play with the lovers, she a British baroness, he a Hungarian freedom fighter who tries to do his part for his country. Other New York theater stars of the period Anne Jackson and E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young children, including Ronny Howard in his screen debut. The character of Jackson is extremely pregnant and is not anxious to give birth in a communist country that will soon become a person; She makes a passionate plea in the third act of this film that boasts the naturalistic acting styles that we have come to know today from Redgrave, Fonda and Streep. Leading the pack of Soviet wolves is Yul Brynner, magnificent as a commander and sexiest since he played against Kerr in "The King and I". He is petty, unpleasant and terribly in conflict for his attraction to the charming, patriotic and heroic Kerr. This is one of the great transition movies of the latter part of the Golden Age of American cinema. Do not miss it.
