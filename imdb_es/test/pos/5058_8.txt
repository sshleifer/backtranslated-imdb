When I was going to see Rendition, I was expecting an exciting movie about a controversial subject with renowned actors. I did not expect a film so fascinating, exciting, poetic and sad that it picked me up from the beginning and did not let me go, even after I left the theater. A tip for anyone who has not seen it yet, do not let your politics get in the way of enjoying (or not enjoying) this movie. Take it for what it is. I saw this with my conservative Jewish family (I am the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal university student) and I thought they would call it "liberal propaganda". Instead, they said it was a great movie with excellent performances (they like to become movie critics). It's sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors, while it's leaving. the Sarsgaard constantly underestimated, as well as new talents such as the excellent Metwally. All the cast gave good performances, with some standing out much more than others; my only problem was that there were many things that did not allow much screen time for each of the characters. In fact, I felt that the "secondary plot" with Fatima and Khalid was as prominent on the screen as the part of Anwar's story. <br /> <br /> All the characters have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have. Streep is really great, like a ruthless senator, and as much as he does not want to see the actress in such a terrible role, it's impossible not to believe him. Gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the Oscar nominees for this film, seems a bit insecure in his role at times. H is trying to portray his internal conflict, but usually it only comes out as if he forgot his lines or does not know how he should feel. Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance; His unforgettable confrontation with Streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie. Metwally, once again, was great, and I hope to see it in more conventional films. It is a pity that Gyllenhaal is nominated before him. Yigal Naor, as shown in IMDb, has already been some movies, but it is a newcomer to my eyes. He, along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach, gave excellent performances. <br /> <br /> The story of Fatima and Khalid did not receive any credit in the ads, but it brings a sad humanity to the story. The narration was interesting, since I was trying to really connect the story of the two until they told us in the end. I have read some comments here that say that the love story was useless, but I do not agree. I think it definitely shows another side of the controversial issue, as well as of humanity in general. Khalid was the real terrorist, but he was doing it to take revenge on his brother, and although he is responsible for the attack, you see a human side through the story with Fatima. I do not think we should feel bad about the real terrorists, but I think the theme "we are all people" was certainly relevant. <br /> <br /> Whatever your opinion on terrorism, politics, etc. theater. The bottom line is that this is an interesting story with a message that we all need to hear.
