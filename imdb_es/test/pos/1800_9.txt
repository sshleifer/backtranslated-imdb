This is a good film that is defective in many aspects with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she only had $ 350,000 to work with. This is a movie that I loved growing up in the Midwest. I remember friends and I having the nostalgia trip in this movie 10 years ago. Great things about this movie ... Great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. Negative points of this movie ... For a small budget that requires too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had been given more money and time in this movie, the results would have been even better. They should have taken the story from the prospective point of view of the first 20 years and not from the point of view of a high school from 15 to 17 years old. Most of the actors / actresses were between 20 and 17 years old trying to play between 15 and 17 years old ... (come on) The music is extremely memorable and the two soundtracks are played all the time in my car. The best scenes of this film take place in the crappy Hollywood clubs of the character of Nicolas Cage. I gave this movie a high score of 9/10 for five reasons ... the improvisation of Nicholas Cage on the spot; The work and the angles of the camera are excellent given the budget they had and only being able to have one shot of each scene; The sytles, the music and the jargon are captured perfectly and forever; Once again, the music is amazing and takes the story from scene to scene; And finally ... Martha Coolidge could turn a weak script, unknown actors and a very low budget and 20 days of filming the whole movie in such a good and memorable film is amazing!
