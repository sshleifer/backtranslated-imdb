Here is another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD. I saw it a few months ago, when it was first published (even in the metropolitan film capital of Los Angeles!) For a couple of weeks and then it disappeared (the audiences of the art houses seem to have opted for their own special territory, where older favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities). <br /> <br /> At first I was disappointed, I thought the pace was unbearably boring, and that the man had missed an opportunity (for years Antonioni had found it difficult to find funding) at an old age to add another masterpiece to his canon; but knowing Antonioni for what he was and how he had reacted at first to Blow-Up and the passenger, I refused to pass judgment until I saw the film again. I returned the next day and I should not have been surprised that the film kept insisting on me, making me aware of the things I had thought and lost sight of all my life, driving home, in a contemporary environment, points exposed for the first time, About forty years ago, in 'L'Aventurra', it formed an atmosphere of subtle moods, so characteristic and fascinatingly alienated in tone (and actually quite funny) that I could not get enough. The scene with Malkovich sitting on the elegant swings of colors on the windswept beach, with the beautifully silvery weather, and the Eno / U2 track in the background flowing at his own pace, was my favorite; It still was, but now the whole movie was just as great! What a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex that Antonioni's eye only seems to be able to grasp and communicate. The strange thing is that, although it seems at first sight a kind of soft porn and has a lot of sex and the incredibly beautiful Sophie Marceau and many other international stars to distract you, this film is undoubtedly Antonioni's essence. , but you will not feel until what point, until you have seen it several times and have become accustomed to its rhythm. For example, it's a very funny movie with a deep sense of humor, something I did not notice at the beginning, but another critic caught my attention and noticed that he delighted with the future presentations (4 before they took it out and they would do it) ) I've come back for more). If this movie had been promoted correctly and people had been guided to some extent as to how to approach it, I have no doubt that it would have succeeded in the circuit of the art house like most of Antonioni's films in the sixties. But the 60s no longer exist and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen, where half of its beauty will be lost even in a version in DVD format in mailbox format (if and when it is released). I urge all fans of films in general or esoteric to see 'Beyond the clouds' and add a piece of magic to the tragic.
