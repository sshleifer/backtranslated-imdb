This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the stereotypes of New York City at best. However, if you want a simple and beautiful story, you will not find it here. The related stories are interwoven in a way that does an excellent job of capturing the anonymous but contrasting lifestyle that is Manhattan. A perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at New York life in its most natural state.
