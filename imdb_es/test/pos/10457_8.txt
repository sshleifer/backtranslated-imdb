It feels like an impressionist movie; if there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> The story is well told, it is very poetic. the characters well developed and well interpreted by the performers (or played by the actors :)). <br /> <br /> The film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well, unless I hate such emotion in the movies - Not so in my case. <br /> <br /> It's a very humanistic film. <br /> <br /> The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> A good classic for any good movie collection.
