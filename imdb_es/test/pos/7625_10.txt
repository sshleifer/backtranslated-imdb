Once a wise man from India once said, "First they will laugh at us, then they will hate us, then they will fear us." Know that yes, the budget of this film was a bit outdated, but even so, with its history, it continues to interest us many years later, regardless of how it was seen. But know soon, in due time, "Masten Thrust" will appear again on the big screen. Then he and the new redesigned T-Rex will surprise you more. It will scare many during the next centuries! This movie is in the current preproduction and will not look like anything you've seen before! <br /> <br /> This will be beyond the THX format ..... directly in the 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Be afraid, be very afraid!"
