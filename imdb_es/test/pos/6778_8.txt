De Gr√∏nne slagtere or The Green Butchers, as it is called in English, is a very dark comedy about two losers who work for a popular butcher. They are fed up with the criticism of their bosses and decide to start a business on their own. Your store is expensive and does not even have electricity everywhere. And to make matters worse, they have no customers (as predicted by their former boss). When the man visits them in his shop, he challenges them to give him the meat for a dinner he organizes. <br /> <br /> A tragic accident happens. One of the butchers encloses the electrician in the freezing chamber when he closes the store. The man dies and the neurotic of the two butchers decides to cut the thigh fillets of the electrician and serves it for dinner instead of calling the police. It is an incredible success. Suddenly, every person in the town wants to try that amazing "chicken". Overwhelmed by his sudden success, the butcher has no choice but to kill more people, whom he can sell as chicken. <br /> <br /> I suppose cannibalism can not be enjoyed by everyone, especially because it is shown with a lot of humor. Personally, I liked it a lot. It shows perfectly how far some people would go to achieve some social acceptance and get out of their isolation. It may seem a little exaggerated, but I'm sure you'd be surprised to see how people act in real life. <br /> <br /> In addition to the original theme, the actors also pleased me. The performances and the humor. There is no overacting, as expected in this type of film, everything is very sober and realistic (I guess that is typical of Scandinavian and Scandinavian films). The same for humor. I'm sure I would not have liked it as much as I did now if the humor had been exaggerated, or with a lot of farts, vomiting, ... as is often seen in American movies. I loved this movie and I give it an 8/10.
