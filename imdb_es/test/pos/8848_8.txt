In an era in which almost all the great horror films of the 60s and 70s are being remade for weaned audiences in today's horror films that are not too terrible, it is instructive to remember John Carpenter's opus in 1982, THE THING , which in itself is a remake - from a childhood favorite of the director, Howard Hawks' s science fiction / horror classic in 1951 THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not initially such a big box-office success when it was released in mid-1982, it has since gained many followers. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Carpenter movie is not a new version of the Hawks movie. after returning to the original idea raised by the source material, namely, John W. Campbell's story "Who's going there?", in which a US scientific team in Antarctica is threatened by an alien who changes defrosted form of ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who had starred for Carpenter in the 1979 television movie, ELVIS, and in 1981, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, directs a cast of unconditional character actors, such as Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart and Richard Masur, in this tension. The full exploration of paranoia, as the "thing" that changes shape, that first arrives at your camp in the form of a guide dog that a Norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. It is not long before everyone in the camp begins to distrust their peers. The end of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity similar to codas similar to both THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS. <br /> <br /> Almost universally, when the theme of THE THING is purchased, the emphasis is on the extremely bloody makeup of special effects and weird designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the horror classic 1980 THE FOG, and in the movie of werewolf of Joe Dante in 1981, THE HOWLING. These effects are, in fact, quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also turn the tummy. But all this would make Carpenter's film no more than a high-quality epic if the direction, the story and the acting were not up to the task; And fortunately, each of them is. When he is not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter creates suspense in the same way influenced by Hitchcock who informed his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with filmmaker Dean Cundey in the camera work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. The performance improves a script adaptation already well done by Bill Lancaster; In addition, Ennio Morricone gives us a tense score, whose work in the classic Italian spaghetti westerns of the 1960s by director Sergio Leone is well known to everyone, including Carpenter himself. THE THING also presents additional fine visual effects by Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2. <br /> <br /> Carpenter's The movie was not the success it could have had because Universal opted to launch this graphic commotion just two weeks after launching the much more familiar Steven Spielberg game: EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, critics and audiences of the time favored Spielberg Excellent film about Carpenter, equally excellent but extremely different). In addition, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 went to another film produced by Spielberg, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $ 15 million, THE THING suffered from lack of attention at the time. <br /> <br /> However, over time, many have come to see the Carpenter movie for what it is, a very A bloody but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, made with a lot of talent and a real understanding of psychological paranoia at the heart of its history. Although it is still quite frightening, THE THING must be remembered both for the skill with which the story is constructed and for the bloody alien designs and makeup effects; because it is the narrative ability and the suspense that makes it so memorable in the final analysis.
