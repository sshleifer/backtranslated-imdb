The Universal Studios version of "Flipper" (1996) is a great moving movie for the whole family with good values ​​and sentimentality. It's the story of Sandy Ricks, a Chicago teenager who reluctantly spends his holidays with his uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas. This ultimately changes the lives of adolescents and he grows in the process. Learn to appreciate nature and respect the environment. I grew up in the 1960s and the NBC television show "Flipper" was my favorite childhood program. Elijah Wood is perfectly presented as a Sandy Ricks from the 1990s and offers excellent performance. As much as I liked the NBC television show and the MGM theatrical feature films with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I liked this feature for the best! I feel that Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. With respect to Luke Halpin, I feel that Elijah Wood has more talent for acting and he broadcasts more as an actor, which makes his performance excellent and more credible. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor who works in movies today. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the script and has done an excellent job as writer and director of this film. Paul Hogan gives a funny and pleasant performance as Uncle Porter Ricks of Sandy. Mr. Hogan's performance perfectly compensates for Elijah's role as Sandy. I'm a big fan of underwater movies. This movie was beautifully filmed in the Bahamas as "Thunderball" (1965 AU). The director of photography was Bill Butler A.S.C. who directed the movie "Jaws" in 1975. Butler is a very talented filmmaker. The underwater director of photography was Pete Romano. He did an excellent job with underwater cinematography. I enjoyed the score of Joel McNeely's movie. This good score of the film featured Crosby, Stills and Nash among other talented artists. This movie was filmed in Panavision as "Thunderball" in an aspect ratio of 2.35: 1. If possible, try to see this movie in a range version as originally framed and visualized by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. Another very good thing is that Mr. Shapiro gave the original "Sandy Ricks" (Luke Halpin) a small part in this remake. He portrayed Bounty Fisherman # 3 in this film. This was a very kind gesture from Mr. Shapiro! As you can see, I am a true true fan of this movie. Unfortunately this beautiful film was received with harsh words by the majority of film critics. Originally I saw this movie on my birthday, on May 31, 1996 in a movie theater. It meant a lot to me. I have it in numerous video versions. The VHS versions are in "panning and scanning". The laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have a VCD in 2.35: 1 of Hong Kong that is "mailbox". But my most precious possession is an "original" 16 mm theatrical print that I will cherish for the rest of my life! Thank you, Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan and everyone involved for making this a memorable movie for you to enjoy! <br /> <br /> P.S. I must add that the quality of the Universal DVD is excellent! It is the best DVD in terms of quality that I have seen. The color and resolution is spectacular. The soundtrack is great. I think Universal must have used the same transfer for the DVD they made for the laserdisc version. The print of the 35mm scope is "impeccable" and Alan's film really looks wonderful. A great tribute to a wonderful movie! The resolution of the DVD is even superior to the quality of laserdisc! It is simply spectacular! Thank you, Universal Home Video for the excellent quality control and transfer. Thank you very much for doing an excellent job in this wonderful family movie. Also, thank you very much, Alan, for all your extreme kindness towards me. It's a real honor to meet you! (Revised / updated on June 27, 2005)
