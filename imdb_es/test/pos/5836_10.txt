In relative terms, after having seen a lot of disgustingly bad, the TV Tom Fontana & Levinson are geniuses for creating and delivering In this book of writers, the best television show of all time. Oz was treated horribly In this country, the end was well gone 3 In the morning, before that It was strictly considered an alternative vision for those oblivious to the trash in prime time. <br /> <br /> First I caught Oz towards the end of the first series and from then on it was an inescapable watch. My man, Adebisi, possibly the most intimidating villain of all, Beacher, the perfect antihero, Eammon Walker's Saeed, an acting class in evocation. Of course, there was the issue of hardcore: a simple evil, but essentially Oz had a soul. Augustus narrates the plot deployed with Insight pearls, while the battles of Beacher, Mcmanus, Saeed, Rebedahl, etc. They are better than any other telenovela before or after. Compassion violence wisdom tragedy Intelligence pain joy brutality love and heroism Oz crossed the spectrum of human emotions, all within a maximum security prison! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Thursday nights with the excellent Vids to follow the 2/3 Oz series back, at 99, was the best television I've ever seen. Beacher assaulted Vern in the gym. It's a moment I do not need a video for, a classic on the small screen that I'll never forget. <br /> <br /> Imagine what Oz would have done with the same impulse as the Sopranos. a schedule of 10 pm and all promotions ??? Well, I've overcome that now, for those who got it. It's considered privileged for those who did not do it on TV, it's crap ... and you deserve it.
