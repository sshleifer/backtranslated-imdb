The most entertaining program on television, although humor is not for everyone. I realize that it would have been difficult to keep the program fresh if it had lasted longer, but it is a pity that only six episodes have been filmed. The gags quickly fly from the opening credits to the end, when he would see Drebin and his boss, Ed Hocken, pretending to be frozen while shooting the closing credits, during which the criminal (still in motion) would see everyone else motionless and try to escape. In another episode, the building began to collapse around them when Drebin and Hocken were kept in freezing mode. <br /> <br /> Was Leslie Nielsen a brilliant comedian like Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show? How he managed to keep a straight face through some of this overcomes me. Because the jokes and visual gags were so frequent and fast, you can watch the episodes for the second and third time and capture things that you missed the first time. If you are like me, you can see them again and again and still find yourself laughing. Even jokes that did not make sense or apparently had any reason for them, like the identification line "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln" in the opening announcement, somehow worked? perhaps they were thrown there precisely for that reason. <br /> <br /> Cleverly deceptive about the old Quinn Martin detective / police programs of the 1970s, Police Squad would return from the commercial break with the words "Act Two" appearing on the screen, which was immediately followed for "Yankees One" or some other joke. In the opening credits, the title of the episode would appear on the screen, but the announcer would issue a completely different title. My favorite jokes and lines from this series are too numerous to list, but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks a boxer who has fallen in the fight: "Do you think you can beat the Champion?" The boxer answers: "I can wear it blindfolded!" To which Drebin responds: "But what if he does not have his eyes blindfolded?" A minute later, in reference to the boxer's dirty little apartment, Drebin says: "I'm going to help you out of this sewer." The next thing you see, Drebin is appearing through a well cap on the street! In another episode, Drebin and Hocken question the weak alibi of a bombing suspect. Drebin, without believing him, says: "Very well, let's say you went to the movies". After a brief pause, Drebin, Hocken and the suspect look at the camera and in unison they say: "You went to the movies". A few moments later, when Drebin is forced to let the alleged attacker go free due to lack of evidence, he walks away and shouts furiously: "Tell the bomber to take off!" What you see next is a policeman who gives the approval signal to a World War II airplane on a runway just outside the building! While there were many classic quotations from Drebin, one particularly memorable one was: "I'm sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Twice, we would have arrived earlier, but your husband was not dead at that time." Another classic was "I'm a locksmith," and I'm a locksmith. "When the father of a visibly agitated kidnapping victim asks Drebin," What do I do? "Drebin, in the classic way, replies," Well, As I understand it, you are in the textile business. "As I said, humor is not for everyone - many people simply will not" catch it. "During the short tour of the show, I remember that the reaction was very varied. they thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things, while others thought it was stupid and without grace.For me, Police Squad, even more than 20 years later, is the funniest thing I've seen on television. the younger viewers who enjoy this kind of humor but have never seen the Police Squad because they were too young when the series aired initially, I highly recommend it. I found that the six episodes were even more fun than the movies Subsequent "Naked Gun"
