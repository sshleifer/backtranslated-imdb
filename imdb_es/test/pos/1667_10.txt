In order to perform a job like this caper in Rififi (for example, The Score and its opinions), one must have nerves of steel. This apparently demands and sends it. Jules Dassin is the teacher. <br /> <br /> I was on the edge of my seat all the time. It deserves to be better known, although it was not at the time of its release in 1954, because, I suppose, the director was on the blacklist in the Hollywood hypocrite of his time. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who does not have the pleasure of seeing it. <br /> <br /> I can not give you enough stars.
