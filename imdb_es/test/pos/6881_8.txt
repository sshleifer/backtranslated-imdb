Excellent movie with Anthony Wong that certainly lives up to his title. Erotic, but increasingly violent, courtesy of dreams bought from a crazed occultist that quickly turns into nightmares of some magnitude when the sorcerer steps in to manipulate poor Mr. Wong. Well filmed and very fast, this is a tale of serious magic, herbal medicines, power and corruption, but it also gives time for some scenes of sex and very bloody violence. There is also a little touch of humor from time to time to catch you more unsuspecting and all this results in about 90 more stimulating minutes. Excellent performances throughout the year.
