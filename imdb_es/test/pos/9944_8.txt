I have noticed that many people are taking care of Opera for the way Betty reacts to the murders. I think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine that a "normal" person would react. The thing is that ... Betty is not a "normal" person, due to traumatic events in her childhood. She has problems long before the movie starts to work ... and at the end of Opera ... in my opinion ... she has completely deranged. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- SPOILERS -------------------- --------------- ---- You have to bear in mind that when she was a very small child, she witnessed how her mother's lover committed at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochistic mother I was going to see him. <br /> <br /> She was raised by a woman who achieves sexual liberation tied watching the girls being hacked, cut and strangled. That does not make for a healthy home life. I think it's fairly easy to conclude that her mother would have used all kinds of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to make sure her daughter never reproached her. It is also likely that at her impressionable age, Betty was deeply confused by what she saw. Is this simply something adults do, etc.? Betty, obviously, looks at her mother ... I mean ... she's become an opera singer like her. If Mom likes it, it can not be bad, can ... Mom can not be bad, right? He could not tell the police about his mom or this mysterious hooded man that she associates with her. <br /> <br /> Betty has many deep-seated emotional problems. For years, his mind has tried to block the memory of what he saw his mother doing ... but it keeps coming to the surface, manifesting in the form of horrible nightmares, throbbing migraines, a dependence on relaxation techniques. and sexual frigidity She associates brutal violence / bloody death with sex on a subconscious level. There is an internal struggle between the part of Betty that has confused the murder / sex and the part of her that believes that these things are wrong. <br /> <br /> After seeing her boyfriend killed by the hooded man ... she calls the police, but is not willing to give her name. The part of her that thinks the murder is wrong forces her to make the call, but the part that is ambivalent will not allow her to admit personal participation. The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can get to the end. So she walks away from the phone in the rain ... and when the director sees her, she's acting in a surprisingly calm way, not as annoying as you would think she would be a "normal" person ... because the part of her that has been Blocking things since I was a child is doing everything possible to block the horror of what you just witnessed. <br /> <br /> The state of affairs in your life contributes to a dead end within Betty's psyche. Her career as a singer is beginning to bear fruit ... she will be a great opera singer like her mother was. But will he be like his mother in every way? In the darkest forms? Or can she make her own way? Add this to the resurgence of the hooded man who murders everyone around him. <br /> <br /> It is not until the hooded man kills the character of Daria Nicolodi that Betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer. Here is a person who loves Betty, who has supported her unconditionally in her emerging career, which is in fact a mother figure in Betty's life since Mom died. Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then see the woman who is the closest you have to a mother to be shot in the eye. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I will not. The main thing I'm saying is that Betty's character is much more complex than most critics here have been willing to acknowledge. <br /> <br /> Opera is one of the best ... and not only for the visual effects (although they are really great) and not only for the inventive murders (although they are). There is a depth here ... and you have to pay attention.
