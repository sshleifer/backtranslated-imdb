I'm not going to wander about it, but I'll make it short. Basically, for those who do not know how the tests really died ... the first time the demonic killer comes to Piper and tests it with a ball of energy that they fly through the blood of the wall everywhere. Phoebe, the third sister, goes down the stairs, says the spell that sends him away, but not beaten. (NEEDS THE POWER OF THREE) Leo comes to heal the two and so on. They are exposed along the line and the only way it can be saved is for a demon called tempus to go back in time. The only way he can do it is if Phoebe stays in the underworld. She agrees, Tempus turns the time. now around 7:00 in the morning again. Demon comes structured, piper and test with energy ball. They fly through the wall again. but this time Phoebe is not there to say the spell to defend himself against the devil. The devil kills the doctor. The doctor flies through the window. is dead. The demon goes in a kind of rotating wing and the glass of the doors is broken, which is a great effect, by the way, and there is a wide sound. That's where it ends. NOW .......... what the whole world does not know if they did not pay attention to the next episode. although what I am about to say was not shown, what happens trusts me ................ because this time there was no phoebe to call Leo, this time more late. Piper survives because her injuries were not as fatal as Ree's and Leo cures her first before they try it, so by then she's already dead. There the mystery is solved. Calling the tests with a spell should have worked !!! and she should have made a surprise appearance in the last episode.
