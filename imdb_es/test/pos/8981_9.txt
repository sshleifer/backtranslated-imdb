It does not happen very often, but occasionally a man can make a difference, a big difference. <br /> <br /> George Crile's bestselling book in 2003, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and revealing account of the most unlikely "creator of difference" imaginable. A relatively obscure congressman from the Second District of Texas, "Good Time Charlie," was better known for his libertine lifestyle than for his libertarian legislation. Pleasant and licentious (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well since the good people of Lufkin only really wanted two things, their weapons and to leave them alone. It's Easy Street full of its many beauties of known circumambulations, adequate enough, like the Charlie's Angels. <br /> <br /> When asked why all of her office staff was composed of attractive young assistants, her answer is a classic: "You can teach them how to write, but you can not teach them how to grow tits". There is no discussion there. <br /> <br /> But even the most preposterous rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere below, and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities that are committed in Afghanistan led him to gather all his political intelligence to finance the total humiliation and humiliating. The defeat of the Russian military and possibly even to help accelerate the end of the Cold War as a result. Great opportunity, huh? <br /> <br /> Under the skilful direction of Mike Nichols and an intelligent and agile script by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a brilliant and sophisticated satire that describes the behind-the-scenes machinations of three. Colorful characters that comprise the "Charlie Team". <br /> <br /> The "Team" on screen is composed of three wonderful actors with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations among them. Charlie is beautifully played by Tom Hanks in a solid and slightly discreet way that is among his best works in years. He is helped, harassed and enrolled by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by the still elusive Julia Roberts. Hey, why more have the bikini scene than let the world know this? Anyway, Mrs. Roberts looks good and holds up, but the script never gives us a clue as to why Kabul and the country are so important to her character. Maybe the two Afghan dogs usually by his side know it, but we, as a public, never know. As for the third member of the "Team", Philip Seymour Hoffman steals all the scenes in which he appears as Gust Aurakotos, a smart and intelligent dissatisfaction of the CIA (that is, not a graduate of the Ivy League) who knows the score, both in the boardroom of the Agency. and in Wilson's bedroom. <br /> <br /> For the Mujahideen to be successful, the most important assistance that the USA can provide. UU is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 combat helicopters that rule the skies. This requires money, a lot of money and, finally, the "Charlie Team" forces the congressmen to finance the $ 1 billion dollar effort for advanced weaponry to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes state-of-the-art antiaircraft and anti-tank rockets, as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Unpleasant and unpleasant things. <br /> <br /> The fact that this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind the doors of Congress is really alarming. All Americans should watch this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the usual political scene, which is rarely seen outside the walls of our own government. Oh, mom, I wish it were not like that ... <br /> <br /> Although the initial result for "Team Charlie" was an unconditional success, the unimaginable and unforeseen end result is that these sophisticated weapons are now being used. against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the funding was totally "disguised", the young generation in this part of the world has no idea of ​​the fall of Soviet oppression and the end of Russian barbarism was the direct result of US intervention. Yes, once the Russkies left, so did our help: zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip to maintain meaningful relationships with Afghans. As a result, the general consequence is an absolute disaster: it is like the precursor of "Mission accomplished". <br /> <br /> As Nichol's film points out so clearly, "The ball that you set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it." Mike Krzyzewski knows it, Eva Longoria Parker knows it, little Lateesha in Lafayette knows it, but the typical American politician does not. So we went from good to bad because we could not let the world know we were good. Talk about a Catch-22 (another movie by Mike Nichols). <br /> <br /> Maybe Charlie Wilson said it best: "We screwed up in the final game." <br /> <br /> Again.
