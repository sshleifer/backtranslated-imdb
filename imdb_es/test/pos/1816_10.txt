leaving aside the phrases "I'm so sure" and "totally twisted", this is one of the sweetest and most realistic romances portrayed in the film. Deborah Foreman (where is she now?) As Julie and Nicolas Cage As Randy are as classic as Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maryia, Jake and Samantha ... you can not help but fall in love with them. In addition to the soundtrack, the plimsouls, the sparks, the skins, the leagues and, of course, modern English, they are also outstanding. For fans of movies about young love, I would also recommend the recent film of all the real girls of David Gordon Green.
