This is an excellent movie, but Moment (another big budget movie by Nolan) is much better. I would recommend that people go to see Moment and then, if they like it, watch this movie. The film was shot in black and white, which bothered me a bit at first, but once you get into the movie, you understand that black and white is the best way to see the movie. It is extremely exciting and reasonably easy to understand, although the way it is done is extremely intelligent. The elements of the story I think are a bit silly, but the film is definitely worth a second visualization. So that the film has an intelligent plot, twists and turns smart, very good acting and taking into account the budget of the film, I must say that it is quite surprising.
