"Sweeney Todd" is, in my opinion, one of the few "perfect" musicals. Like "My Fair Lady" and "West Side Story", it has a wonderful and intelligent score. It offers the two potential clients and several interesting support characters roles. It has a timeless theme, revenge. He has a lot of humor and is just as powerful when presented in a simple or large scale. <br /> <br /> "Sweeney Todd" tells the story of a man who was simply mistreated during the industrial period in England. It shows the inhumanity of men to man, as in Sweeney's own words: "There are two types of men: there is one who stays in his proper place and the other with his foot in the face of the other." In an effort to correct the mistake he was made, Todd devises a plan to seek revenge. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, who owns a meatloaf shop under Mr.Todd's barbershop, they proposed that "those above, those below". <br /> <br /> I was lucky to have seen the original Broadway version eight times (six with Cariou and Lansbury, the other two with Hearn and Loudon). I saw the revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler, and several other concert versions. <br /> <br /> Although the technical aspects of this production are missing, at least, I think that this production version is the best filmed. Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles, and had a great time playing. <br /> <br /> Very good support work from Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck. Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal, as young lovers have no chemistry, and are basically impossible to see. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
