ONE DARK NIGHT is a very overlooked and little known film of the early 80's that deserves an audience that I fear will never get, and that's a shame. I have seen this film in comparison with others that have received a bigger name over the years, especially PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. This is a film very different from those and I do not see the comparisons other than the mausoleum, which is a bit similar to the PHANTOM, but not enough to make real comparisons. I'm not sure how this slipped without wider acceptance. Maybe it's all in marketing, I do not know. Maybe a new version would give him new life, unless Raymar exhausted all the life he is. I'm not too big with all the remakes that abound these days, but I think they work well with lesser-known films (except for the horrible remake of GHOST SHIP, which in addition to the opening scene and the hustle and bustle of Mudvayne's Not Falling, was total shit). So, if a new version of A DARK NIGHT would fall into the right hands, I think it would make many people go to see the original. I know that's what I do if there's a new version of a movie I have not seen before. Therefore, I fear that everything that is not a remake would not give life to this movie again. Unless, of course, Raymar has seen it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, ONE DARK NIGHT is a must see for fans of horror, especially for fans of the 80s (because we all know that at that time the best horror movies were made). Creepy environment. Pretty good acting. Very good story Campy What more could you want from a horror movie from the early 80s? What is that ... nudity and blood? Well I'm sorry There's no nudity or gore in this movie, but it's still great! A solid 8 out of 10. Enjoy.
