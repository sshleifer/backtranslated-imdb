Seriously, where is Al Pacino's Oscar nomination for this? Do we take it for granted at this point in his career? Pacino here is extraordinary. It gives a complex and heartbreaking performance as Shylock, the Jewish moneylender. The film as a whole was quite good, with beautiful images of Venice in sight and a perfect score to listen to. other actors also do a good job, but the real reason to see this is Pacino ... I've seen all the Oscar-nominated performances of 2004, and I must say that Pacino was rejected ... blaming him for the anti-Semitism associated with the play, the lack of campaign on the part of the study, late release date without further impulse, or most likely, all of the above. In my opinion, the best performances of the year belong to Jamie Foxx in Ray, Don Cheadle. at the Rwanda Hotel, and Al Pacino at The Merchant of Venice.
