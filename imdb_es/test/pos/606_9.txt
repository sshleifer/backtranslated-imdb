MINOR SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The misunderstood classic is still one of Henson's best and most personal films. It may seem funny to call such a beloved movie 'misunderstood', but people seem to remember this mainly for Jerry Juhl's quick script and Paul Williams' knockout songs. Now, although these things are really good, as is the formal joy of the film (script within the script, pause for the film, etc.), what distinguishes 'The Muppet Movie' from the other Muppet films is the serious and melancholy thread that runs through the image. It's a road movie, okay, but like most road movies, the pleasure is in getting there, and the achievement of the characters' goals is tempered by uncertainty, and by the knowledge that they can never back again. Throughout the film, we are shown the negative side of the show world, even before the Muppets have "achieved" it: Piggy leaves Kermit without a second thought on a phone call from his agent, Gonzo expresses loneliness and the repentance of an artist's life. the road in its disturbing "I'll go back there someday", and, worst of all, Kermit is tortured and tested continuously by Doc Hopper, who wants him to market his art for the most naive purposes. (One can only wonder what Henson would have done to the management of the company by his family after his death). Kermit himself is agonizing over his choices in the conversation scene in the desert, and the final number of the "Magic Store" asks if everything was worth it, before concluding that it probably does not matter in any way. All this is peppered with the expected Muppet chaos and satire and deliciously horrible jokes, and of course serious things would not work if it were not. However, 'The Muppet Movie' is not just another contest, like the rest of the Muppet movies with decreasing returns. No, it's a lovely and gentle metaphor about the relationship between art, entertainment and business, and it's as effective today as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10
