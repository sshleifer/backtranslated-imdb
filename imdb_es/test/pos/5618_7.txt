I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to achieve two things in this movie. First, the film is a tribute to Jascha Heifetz, considered the best violin virtuoso of the last century. Secondly, by bringing the Dead End children to the screen with their movie of the same title and watching them sign with Warner Brothers, I was trying to create a second band of attractive hedgehogs. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie was good, there was certainly no demand that the children in this movie be re-programmed for another movie. <br /> <br /> The leader of the gang is Gene Reynolds, who at one point played the violin, but now runs a street gang of hedgehogs of ill repute. His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin that his late father gave to young Reynolds and threatens to send him to school because of the faint protests of his mother, Marjorie Main. <br /> <br /> The young Reynolds runs into a music school run by the old music teacher, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They receive it, but they have their financial problems with a large number of creditors led by Porter Hall. <br /> <br /> This film is mainly seen today because it is an opportunity for classical music lovers to see and listen to Jascha. Heifetz who, as you meet, is the solution to everyone's problems. Joel McCrea is also in this movie, but he has a pretty colorless part like Andrea Leeds' boyfriend. <br /> <br /> In addition to Heifetz, one thing the film does do is touch, albeit cautiously, the issue of child abuse and battered wives. Arthur Hohl is a bad man and Marjorie Main is clearly a very battered wife. <br /> <br /> The children of the cast are doing well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a little girl by the name of Jacqueline Nash who grew up and acted as Gale Sherwood, a member of Nelson Eddy's nightclub . She had a good soprano even as a child. <br /> <br /> But it's to Heifetz that you see the show.
