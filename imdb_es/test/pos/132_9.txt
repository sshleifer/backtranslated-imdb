This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply rooted in ritual and tradition. All this in the context of an India that, in turn, struggles to free itself from these same values. This film is both political and personal and is never too predicative or idealistic on both sides. It is easy to see why the "Fire" has caused unrest in India, but tragic nonetheless. A true movie like this deserves to be seen by all the people of the world, not just the privileged Westerners.
