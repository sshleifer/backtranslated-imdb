This is one of the smartest movies I've seen in my life. The script language, the costumes, the stage, the plot, the characters, etc. They are supreme. You will not get bored. I have watched intensely or even heard this movie while working so many times that I lost count. Scarlett ages with grace, acquiring wisdom beyond her years at the end. This film takes you from Tara to Ireland, where your family is originally from and you can see the results of another civil war that takes place there, this time between the Irish and the English. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the double standards of Men at that time: a man is still respected if he has girlfriends and whores, but not a woman. If you only see her in a private place with a man, society accuses her of impropriety. And, of course, Scarlett was always thinking outside the box, breaking the rules when it was necessary to create the necessary change, help people and / or survive. <br /> <br /> Scarlett's beauty is definitely in the bone. Your strength, self-esteem and wisdom grow as you get older. <br /> <br /> I remember your lines when I faced too much on my plate, like for example, "tomorrow is another day", and the way he behaved, his determination and his courage, and I learned from it . experiences. This is a good movie to show your daughters, since it teaches a woman how important it is to have respect for herself, and that men, especially the very handsome ones, can have two sides and can treat a woman of different way, depending on how she acts and respects herself An attractive woman needs to learn what this film teaches. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a therapy for me, and it's better than Gone with the Wind. The second part takes place in Ireland and anyone who is Irish decent will appreciate the landscape, the people and the character of Scarlett within it.
