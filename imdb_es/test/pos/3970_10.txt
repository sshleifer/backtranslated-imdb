Accepted is one of the best teen comedies I've seen in a long time. It has an original script, a talented cast and offers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of a high school graduate Bartleby "B" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he requested, to avoid his parents' disappointment, he creates a collage of fiction . In the attempt to cheat his parents completely, he creates a fake website and converts a former psychiatric hospital into a school. Everything is going well until many other "accepted" students appear at the door of their house. Now he and his friend have to discover that collage thing not only for themselves but also for others. <br /> <br /> Justin Long, as a leader, is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be and the supporting acts are outstanding: Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Columbus Short as Hands, Maria Thayer as Rory, Adam Herschman as Glen and Lewis Black as Uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> The humor is fresh and simple, and the most important thing It's funny, from the beginning until after the credits. The plot develops so easily that when you stop laughing with the last joke, you start laughing at the next joke. Along with all the fun, the film brings a very common theme to our attention, that is, collage education. If generally the students in the film are united against the school government, in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learn. <br /> <br /> However, the film does not qualify all the other schools as bad, it just shows that there is another way. You say "If there is a will, there is a way, and sometimes children know better what their parents need. <br /> <br /> This movie is a small story that can not be missed about great opportunities in Life wrapped in the best possible format.
