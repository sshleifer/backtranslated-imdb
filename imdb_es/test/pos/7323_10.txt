Columbia Pictures' short theme unit never had any illusions about the production of 'Art' movies. They wanted to give movie exhibitors a little more for their money by booking an image of Columbia in their theaters. This would double for the films of The 3 Stooges. <br /> <br /> MEN IN BLACK (1934) emerged as close as any of his comedy shorts, as he received an Oscar nomination for Best Short Comedy, Comedy. Although he did not win, he could have done it. It was good enough, and even those who are not counted among the Stooge files, still seem to be defeated by the cry of "........ calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!" This was the second entry in the long series of comedy short films made by the Stooges for producer Jules White, head of the Columbia Short Topics Department. Only WOMAN HATERS, described in her credits as a "Musical Novelty", preceded her in Harry Cohen's Poverty Row shawl factory. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in the office of Dr. Graves, the Head of the Hospital. He is receiving new interns and, when addressing the group, he relates that three of them pass Medical Conditional since they remained there for so long. But, the good doctor declares that he will not reveal his identities as long as they commit themselves to everything "... for duty and humanity!" The Stooges run to the front promising "... for Duty and Humanity!", And they run out of office, breaking the glass in the door window. The game was on. <br /> <br /> The Stooges took off and did not stop for the rest of the 2 Reels. Each type of gag was in evidence. From broad jokes in Sennett's sight, to word games, dialects of humor, "theater of the absurd" and a surrealistic joke that involves a system of public addresses, which apparently takes on a life of its own and has the real culprit, a radio. tube was fired at a "........ he got me!" (Everything works pretty good, honest!) The sets used were very authentic and, without a doubt, borrowed from the characteristics of Columbia that were created almost at the same time. There are a lot of wheelchairs, surgical beds, stethoscopes, scalpels, etc., as proof to maintain the illusion of a hospital. <br /> <br /> A true strength of MEN IN BLACK is the high number of people who usually do not have a name. Players, whom we all recognize by face. Along with them, the film features a large number of veteran comedy actors, who always give good results, often stealing the scene. People with names like Billy Gilbert, Hank Mann and Bud Jamison shine even in small parts. <br /> <br /> And, finally, we have the Master, the Director and Conductor Raymond McCarey, youngest brother of Leo McCarey, who showed his Skills to get this little movie 'in the can'. He cleverly kept everything moving, acting like a traffic cop at times, with all the actors, extras and the team behind the scenes moving and out of each other's way. And that does not count with the giant 3-man Tandem bicycle, the Sway Backed Horse and the miniature racing cars, not to mention the 'Giant, green canaries'.
