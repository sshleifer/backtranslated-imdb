Leno speaks through his lines of blow. This ruins the joke, for those of you who have not discovered it. Your show takes place in a micro-sized studio for a reason, or two reasons: the small amount of laughter will be amplified and few want to see it. The Letterman set is the polar opposite: Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony will always be full. <br /> <br /> NBC, NBC, will never understand. The megalomaniac company of founder David Sarnoff is still all about money. At least CBS has a familiar feel. <br /> <br /> Leno collects cars, or is stamps, while Letterman competes with cars. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I talked, I used to ask other users to send me an email if Leno ever said something that was funny. I never received a single email. Letterman has an excellent time. You can also reuse the funniest joke in such a way that it becomes one of the funniest things in that night's show. <br /> <br /> Letterman has developed other careers. Paul is now well known and respected in his own music law. Even the other members of Paul's band get recognition and improvement of their career. Biff Henderson has become a name that America knows. Even businesses in the same block as the Ed Sullivan theater receive a boost. What has Leno done for someone else? Personally, I'm glad Dave has moved and Leno has got Carson's concert. I had never seen NBC shows before and I had no reason to do so. <br /> <br /> The list of the top ten is an American icon. This is Letterman. Leno is a caricaturist's dream, nothing more.
