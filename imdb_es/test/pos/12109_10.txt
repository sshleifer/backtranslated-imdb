This is a movie about the music that is currently playing in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two superpowers of the Old World, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today, it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. So it's no wonder that a lot of music is being played in Istanbul, with a wide variety of voices, styles and influences from all over the world. It's Turkish music, of course, and Turkish music fascinated me since I bought my first album a long time ago. The film has different singers, instrumentalists and bands. The spoken comments of the musicians illustrate very well the music that is reproduced and the social context in modern Turkey. For my perspective, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. In addition, the cinema shows an urban scene mainly of Istanbul that is very pleasant to see. <br /> <br /> "Crossing the Bridge" appears as a documentary and includes minority music, for example. The Kurds and the Roma. Other important topics are omitted, such as Turkish jazz music or the music of Armenians and Greeks. <br /> <br /> This film is highly recommended for lovers of music and culture of Turkey, the Balkans, the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It may also be worthwhile for those who have a great interest in the global effects of musical styles such as Rock and Roll or Hip Hop.
