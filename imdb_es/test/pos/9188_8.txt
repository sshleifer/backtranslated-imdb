This was a movie that, in the end, I thought: "That was a pleasant two hours!" I hate to spend around $ 20 (not including the number of nannies $$) so that my husband and I have that "it was good" feeling. <br /> <br /> I think I like Will Will more as a comic actor than as an action hero. He was well thrown into this. His character was very nice, as was Kevin James. <br /> <br /> There were several scenes of laughter. It's also a romantic movie, so if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her to this. Women will like it as much as any girl, but I would not classify it as one. There is a lot of men's humor for men to enjoy. I think that's one of the reasons why this movie is as perfect as a dating movie. He has romance and slapstick. Normally I do not like the slapstick so much, but it was not exaggerated and I can not think of any of those scenes that did not produce laughter. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband told me after he finished was: "I want to see him again!"
