Carly Jones (Elisha Curtberth), her bad brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and her friends Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) travel to Another city to see an important match. They decide to camp in a field halfway and continue their journey the next day. However, Wade's car fan belt breaks and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in a nearby town, where there is a wax house. When they arrive at the place, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two deranged Siamese ex-brothers have transformed people into wax statues. <br /> <br /> I liked this "House of wax", in fact, it's worth it. Horror movie for teenagers. The story follows the standards of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and other slash movies, and is well made, has a good team of actors and actresses and special effects, and the death scenes are incredible. Even if the movie was not good, it's worth seeing the sexy and delicious Paris Hilton. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa de Cera" ("The House of Wax")
