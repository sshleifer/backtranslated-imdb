I have tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years. Finally, read something today, 03/09/2005, that mentioned the name of Stacy Keach, and it reminded me that I had seen a movie I was in 1974 at the Atlanta Film Festival, so I did a Google search to the movies of Keach. and found the salsa train. We were supposed to see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they could not show it, and instead they replaced The Gravy Train. We were terribly disappointed that we could not see the very exaggerated Duddy Kravitz, and we had not heard anything from The Gravy Train, and we have not heard anything since then. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised by how good the film was and, as I recall, it was quite funny. I would love to find it on the tape.
