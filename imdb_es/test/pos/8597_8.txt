Why is there so much anguish among the IMDb critics who hate this movie? It is not a masterpiece, but seeing it twice, it is presented as a compelling drama set in the world of network television. Robin Stone is the epitome of every Dan Rather, Phillip Stone and Brian as it is called on NBC. A mannequin of a man incapable of love who triumphs professionally, but fails miserably in his personal life. I worked for eight (8) years on network news and DO EXIST! From Robin Stone <br /> <br /> The supporting cast works for me from Cannon (which may be annoying, but not in this movie) to Greene (who plays Pathos just right) to Wexler (who note as the young model in love with the image of Prince Charming and can not reconcile that image with the real ugliness inside). It is also noteworthy the end that some reviewers say IMDb is an annulment. It is not! Listen to the song "He Moving On" to get clues about the bow that runs through Robin Stone's character that finally leads him to face his problems. He realizes that the answers are not in the life he has lived and the symbolic distance from those with whom he has associated, in the end it is perfect.
