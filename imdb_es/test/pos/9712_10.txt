The sequel is exactly what you expect it to be. And it's good enough that everyone who wants to see this should leave it happy. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that will win an Academy Award. But it takes what made the TV show and the original Jackass movie a success, and makes it into a category. It's more fun, more brutal and more unpleasant than the original. And I loved every minute of this. <br /> <br /> The original had some notorious tricks, and there is at least one trick by which this movie will be remembered. You will make a face, you will shake, you will look away and you will laugh a lot, very hard. <br /> <br /> In any case, you probably do not need to read this review, or any other, to know if you will like this movie. , unless you've never heard of Jackass.
