I first heard on this site while searching the Web for reviews of another Italian giallo / horror effort, the contemporary PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK (1974, whose DVD R2 Rare Video, by the way, I recently acquired it). ? where it is referred to as being in a similar vein but also as good. Having seen FOOTSTEPS by myself now, I can see where that critic came from. In the sense that both films deal with the psychological fusion of its female protagonist. Stylistically, however, does this owe much more to Art-house cinema than to anything else? in particular, the work of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonioni (and, specifically, LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD [1961] and THE PASSENGER [1975] respectively); As a result, some have accused him of being "deadly bored"? An epithet often attached to such a 'pretentious' rate (read: cerebral)! <br /> <br /> Anyway, does the film involve the search for a woman (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements in the previous three days? Of what she seems to have no memory. Following a series of cryptic clues, he travels to the 'mythical' land of Garma (the nearby locations, then, bear the equally fictitious names of Muda and Rheember). where she meets several people (including Lila Kedrova as a regular aristocrat of the resort) who apparently remember the heroine who stayed there during her "blackout". However, the most prominent are a young man (Peter McEnery) and a girl (Nicoletta Elmi, from BARBON BLOOD [1972] by Mario Bava). The first always seems to happen on the scene at propitious moments, while the second apparently confuses Bolkan with another woman (sporting a long red hair and a medium streak). <br /> <br /> Although it is essentially a piece of humor, this is nevertheless an exciting puzzle: inevitably, do vague events happen at a deliberate pace? and where much of the power of the film is derived from the outstanding central performance (which can be seen as an extension of Bolkan's role in the fine of Lucio Fulci Giallo TO LIZARD IN THE SKIN OF A WOMAN [1971]). However, one can not deny the contribution of the filmmaker Vittorio Storaro (which offers an unlimited number of camera movements and an effective color scheme: it adopts orange / red / blue filters to create an atmosphere and creates a saturated environment for the disorienting end and strange.) and the adequate melancholic score of Nicola Piovani (the composer is best known today for his Oscar-winning work in Roberto Benigni's tragicomedy about the Holocaust LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL [1997]). <br /> <br /> With this in mind, it's worth discussing how FOOTSTEPS was presented in the version I saw: well, apparently it's hard to get it in its original form (I can not be sure if it's cut or not here, except to say that the movie lasted 89 years). minutes while the IMDb shows it in 96), this edition is extracted from a VHS in English quite abused (the dubbing is surprisingly good, given the international cast) with Swedish subtitles recorded to boot (in addition, the DivX copy was frozen during a few seconds to a crucial point in the story around the 82 minute mark)! However, we received a welcome bonus, that is, a "minute of the soundtrack" of 9 minutes in MP3 format. <br /> <br /> I realize that I have not yet mentioned the secondary plot of the mission to the moon, in which the presence of Klaus Kinski is restricted: by the way, almost at the same time, it had a similar role. brief but fundamental in another good artistic thriller with sci-fi inclinations (and also located in a distinctive location). Namely, LIFESPAN (1974). While watching the movie, I could not understand the possible connection that this had with the central plot, except that Bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a film he had seen once, though not until the end, called "Step by Step on the Moon" (an alternative title somewhat deceptive for the film itself)? In a funny way, at the beginning he remembers that the image was called BLOOD ON THE MOON (which, of course, is a 1948 western classic with Robert Mitchum and directed by Robert Wise!). That said, I took this 'detour' calmly as a mere extravagant touch for the film (also given Bolkan's previous job as a translator at a conference on the future of Earth). And they certainly did not expect the astronauts to appear on the Garma beach at the end to pursue the female protagonist, where the sand sinisterly turns on the surface of the moon? <br /> <br /> Will the plot of the movie probably make more sense in a second visualization? however, to be honest, this is best addressed as a visual / auditory experience and one should not expect it to offer a narrative that is in any way clear and easy to rationalize. For the record, the only other effort of Bazzoni that I managed to capture before this was the medium and straight THE FIFTH CORD (1971), starring Franco Nero (who had recorded on Italian TV at night); Some time ago, I got your interpretation in Spaghetti Western of "Carmen" entitled MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968). Also with Nero and Kinski? as a DivX (after I had already missed an issue of the matinee), but the conversion had somehow been defective and, consequently, the disc did not work properly!
