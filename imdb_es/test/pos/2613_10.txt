He is a talkative, alcoholic, talkative ASS speaker! I have seen the first and second episode. The illustration and animation fit very well (consider the facial expressions, hahaha). The main character is a gun, with a badge, a pair of buttocks, shooting anyone who thinks he is offensive or "guilty". So far, the episodes have had simple and tractable plots that work very well with Assy's research. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, the game is the serious answer to A.A. mischief and randomly "I have a feeling" leads. The lines of Assy are very funny and intelligent, here is one, for example, "I have a bullet and you have your email address, do not make me hit." Bang * "It looks like your inbox only has something new mail." The think box at the headquarters of Assy Mcgee is up to now, coherent and at the right time. As for the sound, it's perfect, the sound effects and the voice work are 9/10. The whole seems that Sylvester Stallone got drunk, Don Sanchez, the mayor, the police chief, all have voices that "fit" there, the person is very well. I recommend it to everyone who wants to laugh before going to bed, since on Sunday nights they go swimming with adults. Very funny, imaginative, visually different comedy. 10/10
