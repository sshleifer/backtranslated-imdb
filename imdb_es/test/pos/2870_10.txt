Kane is a murderer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this old burnt down hotel, where eight teenage convicts go to clean up a little. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it was not the best writing nor the best one of all. I still thought that the murder scenes were very well done. Like when the girl eats the hungry dogs. The best thing had to be when he pushed the cell phone through the mouth of the Blonde Girl. Kane was a really cool horror movie actor, he had a serious look throughout the movie and it would never change. That was his only look at the whole movie. Great action scenes and killings, I do not think I can give you a total of 10 out of 10, but 6 looks good.
