In dramatizing Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed the events, removed several characters and, in general, implied instead of showing the essential evil of Dorian. If you want a more explicit representation, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in the same period of time, but they were certainly very different men and writers. This story is really about a theme similar to Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", but keep in mind that Wilde chose to treat his story as a fantasy, while RLS took the scientific route. Both protagonists are men in which good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end. <br /> <br /> The actors in this BBC film also take a different route from the 1945 film. John Gielgud says the same caustic and caustic jokes as George Sanders, in his role that really projects Wilde , but with a subtle difference. You will suspect that Sanders really believed what he was saying, but Gielgud may be saying what is expected of him instead of what he sincerely believes. Peter Firth also shows both sides of his character sparingly, but then we do not see as many of his adventures as Hurd Hatfield had the opportunity to show. <br /> <br /> It is a very good production, with the dramatization that reflects the essence of the novel, if not all its ramifications.
