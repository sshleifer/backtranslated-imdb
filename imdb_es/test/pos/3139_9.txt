Wagon Master is a very unique film among the works of John Ford. Mainly because it is the only one based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was written by Frank Nugent and the son of the director. Patrick Ford became a script, and due to the personal opinion of the director about it, Wagon Master is the film that John Ford called the one that "came closest to being what I wanted to achieve", to say that it is not a little, but as Ford once confessed to Lindsay Anderson, his favorite was, however, My Darling Clementine and not another. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master has all the ingredients one would expect to find in a John Ford movie. Wonderful cast that offers the best of itself, do not you present any important star, except the most "fordian" of all the actors? Ben Johnson Very peculiar little characters, who provide obligatory comic relief, and Wagon Master has some of them, such as the horn of the sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell) in his takes, but very inspired concerts. And last, but not least, the legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth passage after Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache and She Wore to Yellow Ribbon. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with two cowboy friends Travis Blue Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr) were hired to be Truck Masters or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers heading to Silver Valley, a place for them as a promised land. On their way, they are joined by a very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women, who supposedly are his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. They are heading in the same direction simply because they were recently expelled from the nearest city and have nowhere else to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens until they run into Cleggs, a dangerous family gang made up of the father and his three children fleeing the Marshal of the city where they recently committed murder and bank robbery. <br /> <br /> In general Wagon Master is neither more nor less than a precious pearl more in a necklace of the wonderful westerns of John Ford. You must see it. 9/10 <br /> <br />
