This film was working towards two objectives: make a political point and tell a terrifying adventure story. It is often difficult to make a political point and still tell a good story (consider Ellen's highly political but rarely entertaining final season). Beyond Rangoon, there is a good balance between politics and storytelling. <br /> <br /> I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and she knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma, so the political message. Most of the movie was a dramatization of what I already knew. But I thought the film did a good job of talking about Aung San Suu Kyi and the mostly faceless dictators who for years have tried to silence her. The device of presenting an unknown environment through the eyes of a character with whom viewers can identify is quite common, but it is quite well done in this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value. Arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant and unknown place to shake her from her depression by the violent deaths of her husband and son. She is convincingly detached and depressed. His mourning condition gives him a clear reason for his distracted wandering in the middle of a dangerous situation he does not understand, something that would otherwise be too smart to trip over. <br /> <br /> Once the dangers become so obvious It is obvious that you can see through them, even through the cloud of pain, that you are trapped, without an easy escape. That puts her on an adventure path where she needs her intelligence to survive. Writers deserve a lot of credit for making her smart and witty enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations, and at the same time find a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place. The direction is also strong, maintaining the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship. <br /> <br /> This movie had an additional impact on me and my wife due to other events of the same period. We were preparing for a trip to India and heard news of Western tourists who had been kidnapped by a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is a very different matter than escaping an oppressive dictatorship. But the film and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unknown country. That common characteristic gave the film a meaning beyond the strength of its own skilful narrative. The film illustrates the worst nightmare of international tourists.
