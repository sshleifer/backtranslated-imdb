"The Couch Trip" by Michael Ritchie is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and perverse that you begin to realize what a sharp satire really is. It is also Dan Akyroyd's best film, made for him in a particularly good cinematographic year (1988). First, "The Great Outdoors" and now this. <br /> <br /> Akyroyd plays John Burns, a career thief who feigns the madness to escape from prison. Now, a silly comedy would be just about this. But "The Couch Trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. The psychiatrist of Beverly Hills, George Maitlin (Charles Grodin, subtly hilarious here) has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected: Lawrence Baird, who is Akyroyd's psychiatrist! You can guess what will happen, but the good thing about "The Couch Trip" is not what happens, but how it is done. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comic creations in the history of cinema. Wicked One Liners and physical humor are part of this, but what makes it special is that Akyroyd makes Burns an adorable character. We support it and we grow so we like it a lot during the 98 minute race. <br /> <br /> But Akyroyd is not alone here. He gets strong support from other great comic actors. Walter Matthau joins the hilarity as a con man who captures the secret of Burns and commits a delicate blackmail. Charles Grodin "burns slowly" on his way to another great comedic role as the burned psychiatrist. Grodin has been one of the least appreciated actors in Hollywood. It is criminal that they have not used it more often. Richard Romanus plays the perfection of Grodin's lawyer Slimball. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" is one of the many films made by the now defunct Orion Pictures Corporation that are currently unseen. MGM spent a fortune buying the Orion library, but has not yet made its acquisition effective. "The Couch Trip" joins "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and countless people to accumulate dust in the vault. Shame on MGM for his inaction. Hopefully, with the new administration, "The Couch Trip" will find the audience and the respect it deserves. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
