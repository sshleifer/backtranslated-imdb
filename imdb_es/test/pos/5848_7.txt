Not bad, but it could be much better, it also seems to follow a basic diet for criminal drama. You have Sandra Bullock as the police who find it difficult to work with other people, they placed her with a new partner. There is a closed case but a policeman who works on him anyway, and there are so many corney lines in the movie that it makes you want to scream. <br /> <br /> However, if you can look beyond the elements of the formula, there is a good film hidden underneath. It's exciting and the subplots worked for me. Well worth a rent, but maybe not a purchase.
