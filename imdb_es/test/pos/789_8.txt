I saw this for the first time on UK television, with good musical accompaniment. The elevator scene is first class, especially when he does the lowering in the phone booth, and then plays with the floor indicator. The jump through the crossbar is really impressive, and there is much more. Apart from all the things that have been mentioned before, there is the fight with the man who has been harassing the woman with the dog; It seems very simple. The only drawback is the plot: mixed with Dead Eye Dan, who then escapes but does not reappear, even when some more gang members get involved later. The scene where he seems to be shooting at the fat inspector is fun, but it would have been better if Dead Eye was the one who pulled the trigger.
