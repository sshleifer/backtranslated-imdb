If you have not seen this, then look for this. It is available on DVD. It is a production of Channel 4 (United Kingdom), possibly together with German and Danish television. If you have seen the movie it is basically the same plot. Several interspersed stories are connected through the drug trade. The story jumps among the housewife (played by the excellent Lyndsay Duncan) who tries to complete a deal on behalf of her husband, who, to his surprise, is an international drug dealer (and a generally dangerous man). <br /> <br /> A The minister, who is imbedded in his work to the detriment of his family, is investigating the entire state of affairs with international drug trafficking. Get some eyes open to the reality of the heroine when your daughter turns out to have a "problem". Then he officially visits Pakistan, where he seems to be taught that abuse (not just drugs or casual use) is the problem and that he can also try some products (an excellent scene in which he simultaneously realizes what the attraction and why). is and why is such a problem). In Pakistan we can see the other side. The desperation of farmers who can barely survive resort to the production of opium and the lords of crime. The useless subsidy attempts that result in the enrichment of the system. And a country so steeped in drugs, but only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the west. Because of all this, a customs / interpol agent tries to trap the "Dutch" connection in the smuggling of heroin. Seeking justice for his murdered partner. This really is a masterpiece. Impressive, underestimated performances of all the main actors in a way that only European cinema can do. <br /> <br /> A must see. Especially if you have seen the film, they complement each other and present some subtly different opinions / attitudes on both sides of the pond.
