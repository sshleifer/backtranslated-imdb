This is another one of those rare movies that one feels grateful to be presented instead of the usual gut of Hollywood. It really is a roller coaster, as we follow the effects of a 500 euro bill forged in a crowd of people. One asks "what if" all the time, but it's certainly a butterfly effect captured in the movie. It will make you laugh, cry and bite your lip. I loved every minute of it! And thanks to SBS Australia for showing movies that are really entertaining, it's even worth the effort to read the subtitles. The only drawback that I have in my mind is that I will not book a vacation in the Frozen Land (everyone seems to be too depressed) it must be all that cold weather. Either way, look at it, it's worth every second.
