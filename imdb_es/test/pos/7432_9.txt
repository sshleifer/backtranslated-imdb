I am an avid fan of FF7, for example, I have the game and then I sell it (bad mistake) but then I buy it again (good mistake ... erm) <br /> <br /> anyway, yes, this movie It's very good, The fights are very good, the music is very good and the CGI can not fail. <br /> <br /> The only disappointing thing with the movie that I felt was the lack of participation of other characters, it was almost the whole cloud, although it is a great character, you can not beat a cid and barret. <br /> <br /> but even though the movie was great in my opinion, and I must see it. <br /> <br /> in general, a great da and da movie will give you 9/10 <br /> <br /> squaresoft, it will make more movies like this and it will be adored more than it already is !!!!
