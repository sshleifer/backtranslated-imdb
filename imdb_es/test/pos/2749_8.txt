The Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has a bad flight in more than 4000 hours and is forced to abandon the commercial flight. Meet a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two initiate an act that involves flying and performing acrobatics. The two begin a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly sad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a previous code for several reasons. First, Jim and Jill have consummated their relationship without being married and with no intention of getting married. Secondly, Eilers appears in their underwear, and a scene absolutely restricted when the Production Code came into force. <br /> <br /> This film does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and, as a result, ends in a bittersweet way.
