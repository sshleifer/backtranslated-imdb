The main reason to see this image is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Mrs. Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter whom, without conditions. This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing. <br /> <br /> Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing together this distinguished cast of some of the best American black actors. This joint group, under its strict direction, helps to create the appropriate atmosphere in which the action is carried out. <br /> <br /> Of course, none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson had not written his wonderful work. Working with Mr. Wolf, perhaps the best theater director of this generation, they have opened the play in a way that evokes the not-too-distant past where a child lives under the influence of Mrs. Crosby, when her own parents are not around . to take care of it Mrs. Crosby becomes the worshiper mother of little Ruben; Somehow, he represents his reward for losing his own daughter. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no time to develop some of the characters, as the action focuses solely on improving the relationship between Nanny and the young. Ruben, played with such charm by the young Marcus Carl Franklin, who is a natural. The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice-over narration that is sometimes intrusive, since it does not clarify or justify what one is seeing. Frankly, just by seeing the interaction of the players, it explains itself. <br /> <br /> In the background there is always music. Regardless of the difficult times these people are going through, Nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that goes back to that time. <br /> <br /> Aside from Mrs. Merkerson, other notable performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the rising stars of the moment. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr., Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Ejogo, Jimmy Smits and the rest. <br /> <br /> Ms. S. Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience. In "Lackawanna Blues", she clearly demonstrates that she can do whatever she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma.
