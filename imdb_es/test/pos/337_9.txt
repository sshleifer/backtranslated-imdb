I finally got a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent the eve of New Yera watching an incredible drama unfold. It began with Shyama (an attractive Nandita Das) marrying Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp when she gives birth to a child. Several years later, we see Amudha, a playful and beloved child (Fr. S. Keerthana), who is the beloved (or burden) of teachers, parents and schoolmates, in a sequence of How to solve a problem like Mary. On her birthday, her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) tell her that she is not her biological daughter, she was adopted. This tilts her world full of love and constantly trusts in why her biological mother left her. Several attempts of school absenteeism later, adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her biological mother. The country is torn by a furious civil war and the trio is inevitably caught in the mess. But this also leads them to meet the new Shyama, one who finally confronts Amudha and asks her why she abandoned her daughter. <br /> <br /> The story of a girl who has to deal with the fact that she was abandoned. At birth, his obsessive drive to reconnect with his biological mother, the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons that lead to the biological mother, the normality of Chennai and the horrors of terrorism devastated Sri Lanka. Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that combined Many ingredients in a saga that is moving. The music of AR Rahman beautifully complements the magical and moving moments of the film. The film features excellent performances by Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolute stunner role like Amudha, the abandoned, performed by the child artist P. S. Keerthana. This performance earned him a national award. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is visual poetry: each frame is beautifully designed and with an impressive shot. I am intrigued by the connection that Mani Ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. I think your exploration of these issues is absolutely exceptional. Mahadevan's character was quite unique: his passion and his idealism did not make him selfish, but it was related to how much he cared for the girl. His only liners were hilarious. Simran's mother was also quite multidimensional: she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter but was also worried about her biological children. The shock, anguish and obsession of the Amudha girl were highlighted by P. S. Keerthana. His big accusing eyes made the most of the conversation. In fact, the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das and her husband. Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as not to give us open ideas of why they were the way they were, the puzzle of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes as he or she is. It also prevented him from being critical: this was another conflict in which he did not take sides but limited himself to reporting while showing the human tragedy. <br /> <br /> Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a moving drama, I rarely cry. The movies, but this left me with damp eyes and a little discouraged. This is a beautiful movie: a treasure and a guardian if you can find a copy; Borrow or steal one today and watch the movie!
