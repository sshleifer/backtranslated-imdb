For a television movie, it was definitely worth seeing. The whole performance was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read / seen the original and, as a rule, I can not stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie (the stage of the civil war was also very well done). Do not expect to see an epic, however, you should find it exciting enough to enjoy it. By the way (in a side note) do not compare this (or any other movie for that matter) with the original work. Movies are not supposed to transfer a book to the screen, but take the general idea of ​​it and then adapt a story. When people say that "the book was much better" (usually they are wrong), what they are really trying to say is that the book was so different.
