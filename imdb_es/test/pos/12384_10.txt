Seriously, I really do not understand why the people here are criticizing him. I mean, <br /> <br /> the idea of ​​a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical paradise island is pretty absurd. The good news is that the producers realized this and turned it into a comedy in the line of Army of Darkness. <br /> <br /> Especially in the second half of the movie, when the little snowball killer attacks, I started laughing. For example, place one of the small creeps in a blender (to Gremlins 1) and mix it. After that, he transforms back into a snowball and screams with a high-pitched voice "That was fun!" <br /> <br /> In a few words: an incredible movie, rent it.
