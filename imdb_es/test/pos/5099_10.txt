Peter O'Toole is Arthur Chipping, a Latin teacher with strict adherence to detail and meticulousness to help young minds understand the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is considered cold and unfair and is not in contact with the times. But when meeting the theater actress, singer Katherine Briskit (Petula Clark) not only at a late dinner after a performance in London, London, but in an amphitheater in Greece, her closed-minded world begins to open. <br /> <br /> Goodbye, Mr. Chips is a new musical version of MGM from the 1939 film also from MGM. During this time, the musicals were out and the Hollywood studio system was in total chaos. When it was released in New York, Los Angeles and London, the musical numbers were left intact, but when it came to the main street theaters around the world, it was without songs, so the movie was shorter and opened to the maximum. <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA Home Video under Ted Turner in the late 1980s, when VHS and Laser Disc were the main home video formats chosen, the musical numbers were re-instituted and the gaps closed. However, Laserdisc was the only format chosen to see Goodbye Mr. Chips in the widescreen letterbox format format. <br /> <br /> For a while, the original soundtrack of the movie was only available on the original and original vinyl and cassette tape. You can still find it today on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the wonderful people at Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the soundtrack was digitally remastered and re-mixed into a set of 3 CDs with the score completely rebuilt, the original 1969 general release of the release album, and narrated sequences source of music and interviews a lot. You also get 1 unused song, which is a real lost gem, "Tomorrow With Me" by Petula Clark, who would have been chosen instead of "You and I" in advance. <br /> <br /> This film is both a classical music and a true tribute to educators from around the world. Most likely, I would buy this movie if Warner Bros. MGM and Sony put their money where their mouths are and restore this film from all the sources of master films and put it both on DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles Again in Place with all the extras you can find and things in a launch.
