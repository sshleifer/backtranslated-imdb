Then, the couple that does not coincide begin their adventure together. <br /> <br /> REVIEW Okay, it's another Journey To The West movie, which is not a bad thing for me since I love the story and the characters associated with it. , so I was a little excited to have the DVD in my hands. So I think I'll start my review with the story, which is everywhere, at first it was your standard fantasy movie, then it became a ridiculous comedy and then it suddenly became science fiction, if the director Jeff Lau was experimenting with the mix of genres, then he did a pretty scatological work with this movie. I think it's a pretty unique approach to having the center of the story in a character other than the famous Monkey King, especially taking a character as pacifist as Tripitaka and then putting it into what is in essence a love story. So, in general, I liked it. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly solid, with the protagonists Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi performing some really good performances, although Ah Char spends most of the time on screen behind some rather ugly makeup. The cast of support is very well organized, it includes all the usual EEG main rooms, so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong make appearances, an actor that I would like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays the Monkey King, made a good I work with the limited material that seemed to have given him, he played a version of the Monkey King that was tenuous but arrogant, I had the feeling that he was retreading the territory of the effects of the twins II, but fortunately that is not the case here. I hope you can keep track of this with himself in the central role, since the movie is left open for a sequel. <br /> <br /> Ok, so let's go to the address, which is a bit everywhere again, Lau gives too much time to Stephen Chow-esquire's mindless comedy, which includes a scene in which Tripitaka to get hard, he dresses like Spider-Man, which I assume leads me to a great moment to scratch his head. since the film is destined to be acclimated in ancient China. He creates some really nice and tender moments between the two drivers and goes into the territory of Sappy, but this critic enjoys a bit of sap on occasion, so it did not bother me in the least. <br /> <br /> Right Now, in the CGI, which for the most part is quite bearable, there are many moments that probably belong to a PS2, as many other critics have said, but there are some interesting moments, especially in the scene in which Monkey fights against a flying subject. Many of the CG gags are provided in the form of a golden staff that becomes a range of different things, ranging from a giant fly swatter to a suit mech directly from The Matrix Revolutions. So yes, it seems crazy, but I think you should see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Correct, so when closing A Chinese Tall Story it is not a film without its flaws, but it remains at the same time. enough time to entertain and, in general, be a pleasant movie in general. If everything above does not make you see it as I say it this way, it's much better than Twins Effect II.
