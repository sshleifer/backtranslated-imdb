Although this film destroyed the career of director and screenwriter Michael Cimino and the bankruptcy of United Artists, it is still one of the best movies of all time. There are a lot of reasons to prematurely dismiss this movie for sure. Among them: its length, its technical problems, its colossal mistreatment of animals on the set, the list goes on and on. And yet, for all this, it's still a movie that captures something. It is a classic example of naturalist narration on par with Strindberg: their moments last as long as they can, in fact, they have not been speechless for the cinematographic good time. He feels real in his moments of anger, love and war (and despair). This film should be seen by anyone who appreciates the cinema and the narrative.
