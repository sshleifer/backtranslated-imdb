Honestly, I found that Wicked Little Things is a very cool and funny horror movie. My friend had given me this, and I really saw it as nothing more than a bad bloody lower-class horror movie. After seeing this, I was wrong. very cool and very good, and although I say that sometimes seemed a bit unnecessary, and although it may not be the best horror movie, it is still good. I think the performance was very good, especially on the part of the girl who plays the mother (she seemed very credible and very nice to me). And while it is a bit clich√©'e and above all it is good. In general, I must say if the Afterdark Horror Fest movies are not your style, then you should not have anything to do with this, but if you like horror movies, or a bit of wicked time you check out Wicked Little Things . 8.0 out of 10 stars
