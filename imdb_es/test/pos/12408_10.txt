This film about a group of teenagers from a small town who decide to rob the local bank is excellent. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to leave his small town, like Jimmy Stewart in "It's A Wonderful Life". However, unlike George Bailey, Brian is going to rob a bank to finance his dream of attending an art school, even if his father does not support it. The offer to Brian is to act as a client and distract the guard. It is a tempting offer that if offered to many, I question what they would do. Anyway, Brian does it. When the Sheriff (James Remar) and his force surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. It is a confrontation with even the feds who move to kill the children if they have a clean shot. The Sheriff must avoid this and try to end the confrontation peacefully. Unfortunately, the tensions increase, and the teenagers inside turn their backs. Some are out of control. The paper cutter scene is horrible and hard to see. Very intense!
