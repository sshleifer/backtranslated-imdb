I can not believe it ... after all these years I finally trace this ... I was destined to be named "The Great Pretender" at the production stage. I lived in Oz on time and, through a friend, took care of one of the locations of the house through filming ... It was me who showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realize That he was Russell Crowe now. !!! It has taken me all these years to trace this, I was not even sure if it ever went to the screen when I left Oz the following month after the closing party. At that time, Russell Crowe was not the demanding actor he is now and I had no idea it was him until I saw the previous comment and then I remembered the days during the filming ... amazing ... Really delighted with myself now! !!
