Easily one of my three or four favorite movies. Definitely one for the desert island. There is nothing "bright" in this movie. Rather, it is illuminated warm and cozy. The public is invited to a party and, like any good party, joy occurs in the interaction of the guests, and what you learn as you move from one to the other. With apologies to Joyce, the title of the film evokes a series of ideas that distance the audience. The movie is not horrible. It is not depressing. It is a beautiful look at a time that has passed, in which people are growing and others are relaxing. Some are frustrated, and others are serene. And around, always present throughout the night, are the people, and the parts of the people, who have been rested. The words that are given to these exquisite actors to speak are perfection and, adjusted to the music of the Irish actress, they are an auditory party, especially for us, the flat-toned Americans. About the lack of brilliance to which I referred earlier, I withdraw it. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann. Speak calm volumes about ?? well, all A beautiful snowy night, rent this movie and let it happen before you. No shootings, no car chases, no dinosaurs? It simply films in its maximum expression.
