Unfortunately, this is Carlin's last recorded concert on HBO, a series that lasted more than 30 years. Although this is not your "best" job, it is excellent, fun and stimulating. This recording is also a little different from most of his other concerts, as it is a bit longer than most of his other concerts. <br /> <br /> Throughout his long, prolific and influential career, Carlin has moved away from the more observational Humor and joke jokes, towards a more "humanitarian" point of view of society and culture. His focus on the English language and euphemisms increased over the years, and culminates in this performance. However, I would say that your audio book "When will Jesus bring the pork chops?" Best shows his great ingenuity with respect to language, euphemisms and the rupture of our values. It's bad for you, it's pretty indicative of his long transformation from comedian to writer. <br /> <br /> If you are offended by the rude language or contempt of the church, you probably do not like any of Carlin's advocates. material. However, if you like to be mentally stimulated and can tolerate language and blasphemy, you will probably enjoy this concert a lot.
