For my money, probably the best movie, or at least the most purely cinematographic film, that director Ford has ever done. The dialogue is fast, cut to the point. The story starts from the beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs and photographs them with a brio and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimaciously realistic, warmly funny, he acted brilliantly (it's hard to believe that Johnsonj could not become a prominent man after this), with the best photography and editing of any American film in black and white. It owes a lot to the editing technique of Sergei Eisenstein, but never as distant or as "scientific" as Eisenstein could get frequently. And a great musical score. A magnificent panorama of an important and misunderstood episode in the history of the United States. <br /> <br /> A small objection: it is not clear why the film involves the Mormons, who, as far as I know, were never the Quaker pacifists. and the Amish were. This confusion leaves a slightly bitter bitter taste. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the movie is a party, this is easy to ignore. In all other forms, a true masterpiece of American cinema that needs to be revived and seen again (again and again).
