This is one of those movies that are very underestimated. Again I am voting for an underestimated movie. This movie has a good story, maybe a bit exaggerated, but it could happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actors) shows us again a good performance. The boy does a great job in acting but is never recognized for his roles. He has done well since the goonies. Not only him but Louis Gosset JR. Do a good job I thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters, but who cares about the money anyway. All this is a good movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat at times and the plot will keep the movie moving. I enjoyed this movie and I hope the rest of you do too.
