From 1950 an exciting thriller arrives on a pair of contraband diamonds from the outside and also smallpox, a contagious disease. Evelyn Keyes pulls out all stops as the essential victim of this black cinema. Once he returned to the United States, he does not know that he could be spreading the disease to everyone and everything he has in contact. Finally, it is persecuted and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. Apart from the amazing performance of Keyes, there is a good support of the villains Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The ending is a humdinger with Miss Keyes on the ledge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below. A good movie of B!
