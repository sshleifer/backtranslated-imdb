This classic has so many extraordinary scenes and funny scenes without intention that I do not even know where to start. If you want advice on dating, it's here. Just ignore the person you want and then issue classic lines like "Chicken is good ... I like chicken", and before you know it, you will have a night in a basement (it's a NICE basement) with a Woman who is 35 years younger than you. Bronson does it all in this movie. He buys a car without a good reason, only to be able to kill two gang members ... paying with "CASH" ...... chunnng ... He buys an ice cream, simply because "this is America, it's not T it ", and ends up wasting someone called" the laughing one: he laughs when he runs "simply because he stole the camera. By the way, this "laughing" is so fast that Bronson's regular gun can not even reach it, you need to order a special one just to get this elusive run-off. It is cleansed only to be able to eat a REALLY smelly meal (stuffed cabbage) in a rat trap with a couple of older people who like to wear heavy clothes in a 90 degree climate. Enter the dentistry business. He always seems to find a crow bar when he needs it (and it's the same!). And last but not least, he always seems to have a rocket launcher in case he needs to fly to Richie Cunningham's older brother, Chuck, who is now tied up and in great need of a makeover. Anyway, all this will make sense once you've seen this classic ... all I can say is that you enjoy! "I owed you a DOUBT"
