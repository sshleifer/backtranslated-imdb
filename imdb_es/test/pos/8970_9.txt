Here is a film that almost understands everything, with good performances from all, and three outstanding performances by Hanks, Seymour Hoffman, and an excellent presentation by Julia Roberts that enchanted me from the first seconds, these are performances that raise production to stars, and they keep it there for the entire duration. <br /> <br /> Apart from one or two really small problems with the script, the only thing that disappoints this movie, is the technical direction, there are too many cuts (falsified continuity) and several Camera "cheaters" that simply they do not work. This is surprising for a movie of this stature, and it's a bit annoying to watch, but it does not destroy a movie that is otherwise beautifully designed.
