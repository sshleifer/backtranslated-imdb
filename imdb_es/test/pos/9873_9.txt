This movie is pretty good as it is, but the unpublished Producer's Cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original. Jamie's story is handled differently, death scenes are made 10 times better, there are more images of ritual-type things that provide more stories about Micheal, Jamie and her baby. There is also an alternative ending that is also better. Why did not they release this version instead of that I do not have any damn track. If you can find this version, look at it.
