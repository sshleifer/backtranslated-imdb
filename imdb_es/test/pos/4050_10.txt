When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel, I have to say that of all the programs I've seen that ADV was released, this is one of the best programs of all time. I had to see him again, and that's when I had my chance. I bought the full box of this series at Best Buy for my twentieth birthday. And I could enjoy it and see more episodes that I missed on Action Channel and the same 3 episodes I've seen. My favorite characters in this show are: Sylvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation in this series was the best, and the hard suits were great too. But the program also has a great voice like: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Auten and Hillary Haag, and more. So, if you like this program on Action Channel, you should have it on DVD. It's the best, and you'll see what I mean.
