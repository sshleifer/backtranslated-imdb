I saw this series on PBS in 1980 in college and I still can not get it out of my head, although I've never seen it since. I remember each member of the cast (the casting was perfect, as mentioned in other comments), the design, lighting and, of course, the story, which is by itself, is enough to keep you stuck to the set. Probably the best television series I've seen with the original "Roots".
