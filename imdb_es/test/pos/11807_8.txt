There was nothing else on television yesterday afternoon, so I thought "well, let's see this". I did not know the plot and I did not have any expectations at all, I was thinking about a few minutes or so I will be navigating the channel again. But then the story began to unfold, and the characters played beautifully by the two children. The story had unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a good movie. Very well worth seeing.
