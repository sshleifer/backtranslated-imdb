The "rock star" is not on the way to any "stairway to heaven" category as one of the best rock movies of all time, but it does make you "jump" from time to time due to its high level energy . The theme of the film is about a fan of a rock group that becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based on the true story of what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think that this movie is full of an ingenious script and a direction of intellect, then you have "something else coming". However, what `` shook me all night '' was the excellent performance of Jennifer Aniston as the rock girl's devoted girlfriend. I could not say the same about the rock star; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than as a rock star. I enjoyed the retrospective tour of the 80s, the shots of the film. It reminded me of my teenage years, where everything "smelled like teenage spirit". I think the movie is worth seeing, but for you to enjoy it better, make sure you bring some `girls, girls, girls'. *** Average
