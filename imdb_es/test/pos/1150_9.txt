I just can not emphasize enough that it's a beautiful movie. Only <br /> <br /> the memory of this movie at the moment I love it. If you want <br /> <br /> to see a dramatic epic from a movie, with wonderful actors on a vivid stage <br /> <br />, with a great dialogue, reminding you of what was early America <br /> < It could have been like [what the world could have been like back <br /> <br /> then] ... well ... I recommend this movie. Especially during a time <br /> <br /> of war and conflict in Iraq ... when our American image is not in <br /> <br /> everything used to be ... this movie takes you back at a time when we were just beginning. When being American really meant <br /> <br /> getting up with your boots and getting going. When <br /> <br /> the world was an untamed and unknown place. Well, this movie <br /> <br /> has that ... and more. Enjoy.
