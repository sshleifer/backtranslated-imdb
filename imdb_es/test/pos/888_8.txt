Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea, and despite the negative responses I've heard, and the DVD release in a suspicious and late manner, I could not help but pick it up: any wu xia movie is better. opinion, most movies that are not wiaxia: D Maybe low expectations were an advantage, because I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> A murderer is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne, and the main government swordsman has the task of identifying the culprit. This does not take long, but the answer is not one he would like to hear. Through prolonged flashbacks, we learn why, and the history of the swordsman and the murderer, and of the revolution. <br /> <br /> The film is typically melodramatic for a Korean film, and would resolutely be in tone, without comedy in the HK style. Moments that are here. The story may be a bit difficult to follow at the beginning, but everything makes sense eventually. The movie wobbles a bit at the end, but not worse than a Chang Cheh movie, and for the most part I found it nice. The production values ​​are high, with a good photograph to capture them. The fight scenes are not of the caliber of the best films of HK wu xia, but perhaps they are not meant to be: the fights are more "realistic", since they are less like choreographed dance routines, but there are some wirework and occasionally cgi that put the movie in "wu xia" mode. The film does not have the best cast, unfortunately, since the cables have a bit of charm and are sometimes difficult to distinguish one from the other. There's a young woman in the movie that I do not think I've seen before, but who gives the best impression of any of the main actors, not just because you see her nekkid ... or maybe it's: p The film does not have the charm and grace of the best movies of HK wu xia, and perhaps beauty too, but I only wish that HK makes them half of these good ones already. TWINS EFFECT 2 does not give me hope that that happens soon. although Tsui Hark surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and the cast. SWORD IN THE MOON will not go to my favorite wu xia list in any way, but it's much better than the ROMANTIC WARRIORS or THE LAKE OF THE BAD LAKE, maybe better than BICHUNMOO, although I liked that movie. A little more on a second visit. Obviously, it is not close to the wonderful MUSA, but in reality it is a completely different matter. SITM will probably get a second view within three years, which is perhaps the best indicator of how much I liked :) 7/10
