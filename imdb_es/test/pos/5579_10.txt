Well, how can I categorize Farscape without resorting to the superlatives that sprout? Ok, here goes! The scripts are fantastic, with each episode offering a lot of entertainment, drama, humor and observation skills. The casting is perfect, especially that of Zhaan (the blue lady) played by Virginia Hey, each character has a depth that is simply not in the Star Trek series. <br /> <br /> I think it has an Australian turn. The program does this for me, Australia has been eliminating quality films for years and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I've only seen the first four episodes in the UK and they have a quality that makes each one The shows per minute (in the UK) stand out more like a movie than a television series weekly. <br /> <br /> The episode that really does it for me is 'I, ET', which turns the strange concept into the place where Moya (a living ship, even the spaceship has a great character) is forced to land on a planet that has not yet made the "First contact" and is surprisingly similar to Earth and Crichton is with a radio telescope operator and "the" is the "little green man" to them Grip material. <br /> <br /> In summary, the effects are great, the scripts are of the best quality and the main characters (none of them really have more importance than others) are interesting, they are not always "good" and well, simply excellent. <br /> <br /> Roll in the second season!
