I'm not sure if talking about the television series is exactly where the comments should go, however, it's on television where The Lone Ranger really made a name for himself. I do not even mean the original radio transmissions of this masked pilot from The Plains, although I mean a point where in a little boy, about 9 or 10 years old, he was going to watch the movie "The Lone Ranger" and I never forgot it. I can remember that I was in a line or I was heading towards the Paramount Theater. The theater was located in the theater district, if I remember correctly. It was directly on the other side, going from this to the building from the building that has the ball that falls on New Year's Eve. This is, of course, if someone I do not know, New York. On the street, on the rooftops, there was a moment, and maybe even today, huge billboards publicized what was being shown, and so on. It was at that moment in time that I looked up and I was never more impressed by what I was when I looked at that billboard. The Lone Ranger through the rooftops: it was great. I was impressed and never forgot. That day we went to see The Lone Ranger. It was the story of how the Lone Ranger was born. The terrible ambush that Texas. The rangers entered and the subsequent rebirth of one of their fallen heroes. It was in this film that we learned that the lone ranger will not shoot to kill, but to wound in order to allow the law to be the judge. That kind of thinking is worth it that we could be good at learning something from history. This is where we learn that Fool discovers the fallen Ranger and seeing the symbol of childhood friendship that The Lone Ranger established years before, when he, as a younger person, went to the assistant of a young man wounded in Tonto: by the assistant Given, Silly gave his faithful friend, a symbol of his gratitude that was now part of a necklace that Fool recognized. Silly said: "You are Kemosabe." The Lone Ranger said: "Kemo - you know, that's familiar?" Then Fool tells the story of this "rusty scout t" (the meaning of Kemosabe) I think the Lone Ranger is one of the true heroes of the silver screen and one It must also be said that these highly respected people, Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels, sought to live there live according to the legend of The Lone Ranger-It may well be that there is an inspiring story in history of Lone Ranger and his faithful fellow Fool, I myself was very pleased with the ability to find and buy the DVDs, that I stayed up all Saturday morning and watched the many episodes now available, Long live the lonely ranger and his faithful Silly fellow-Hi-Ho Silver-
