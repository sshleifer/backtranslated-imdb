I watched this movie at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida. What a beautiful movie A simple and simple account of morality about a young man without care who has to take responsibility for his actions. Neither pretentious nor flashy, my two teenage daughters loved it and, for a change, I did not feel embarrassed by the content or language of the film. A real family movie and the best British comedy movie I've seen since Billy Elliot. The film won without surprises the best prizes of the Best Film and Best Director festival. Ten out of ten.
