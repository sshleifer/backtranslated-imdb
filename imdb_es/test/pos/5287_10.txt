Few would argue that the main animation director, Hayao Miyazaki, is one of the few who possess this ability. <br /> <br /> (No. Too many focus on John Lassiter's "incredible" ability to steal other movie plots, turn them into I like pretty puppet shows and then praise them as a genius ... but I'm digressing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Miyazaki has given us one film after another that deals with important issues of maturity (usually with ecological themes) and has a smart script that even the viewer More jaded than I would normally despise any animated film I could enjoy it if I had the chance.Although, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies, children. <br /> <br /> That said, I can not Think of another filmmaker with this ability Where else is going to have a movie in which a three year old boy (my nephew Link) will stand still during the whole move, enthralled, a 7 year old boy (my niece Amber) loving him everything (and you will appreciate the "star" to "the power" of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a 12-year-old boy (my nephew Aaron) who reviewed was "of course it was good! Everything Miyazaki-san does well! ", a fan of the 32-year-old animation that the powerful direct and a magnificent animation (er, that would be me), and a 58-year-old woman (my mother) able to connect with the characters of the mother (and I also bet to the big charas) and love the "tenderness" of the child characters. <br /> <br /> And that's what I respect Miyazaki-san most.He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker On the surface, "Ponyo" could be seen as a simple story about a small fish girl who proves the human world and wants to join her and her friend there, a little boy called So Ske (something like "The Little Mermaid"), but there is a completely different level at stake here.Following her form, Miyazaki fills her film with intensely strong female characters Ponyo's mother, Soske's mother, the elderly women in a nursing home are characters Genuine with their own minds and extremely strong. <br /> <br /> But the girl who takes the cake is the same Ponyo. Once you decide that you like the human world, simply use your own will to achieve your dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her as a magical fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human simply because of her own determination. <br /> <br /> Once human, she joins her friend Soske, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as the ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at the age of five) when his mother Lisa decides that she has to help the people of the nursing home where she works during a typhoon that was inadvertently caused by Ponyo in her search to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes, it's related to the Jonas brothers, can we get over that, please?) It gives, perhaps, the best acting in the film as the young Soske (which is good since he has most of the lines). Your character also has a strong will, but he is also very respectful and friendly, characteristics that you probably will not find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacific. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto, must deal with his daughter's decision and his wife's wishes to allow her to be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske "remember him with affection". And once again, Miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotyped "bad boy." Although Miyazaki (for some reason) has received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his films magical and, nonetheless, relatable. No one in real life is completely a "bad person". All humans are several shades of gray. And that's exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /> <br /> And then there's the animation itself. In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the large number of effects shots in this movie, especially on the water, Miyazaki has opted to incorporate NO CGI at all. Certainly, the hand-drawn animation was colored by digital media, but each film in it was drawn by hand and I, for one, was extremely grateful for that. The animation of the character was extremely fluid, and it even seemed that there was some lip synchronization (quite unusual for an anime movie). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with a colored pencil and had an effect on the audience. This is how the animation looked, and how it SHOULD be. <br /> <br /> In the end, I found that Ponyo was completely nice. Certainly not the best of Miyazaki (in my opinion, that honor is still in the hands of Kiki's Delivery Service), but it's still a fun 10-star movie for the whole family.
