I wanted to see this movie since the previews came out. I do not understand why everyone is so hard in this movie. Not everyone may be technically faithful to the sport of rugby, but this film is not primarily about sport. It is a rugby team that learns to be more than what the world expects of them. They are taught to become men, and not temporarily vain boys. Hollywood is never 100% correct in its productions. They are there to make a product that sells. Something entertaining. The story of Coach Gelwix and what he has taught over the years is simply amazing. He teaches about service, honor, integrity and moral cleanliness. How many other movies do they teach our young people these days? I was proud to see such an amazing story that taught reverence and respect.
