I saw it for the first time at 5 in the morning on January 1, 2009, and after a day I saw it again and I want to see it again. I love everything (well, almost 9 stars) about it. No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camera work, music. Well, sometimes you just want to listen a little more and the music stops. But this is not a musical after all. I like the performance of Anna, this naive aspiring mafia, how she talks, holds the gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not so funny, although in some moments I've laughed a little, it's very subtle. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Although 3d nouvelle seems weaker, but they are also gangsters, maybe even worse, because they are stealing ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. It makes me feel so warm and ... romantic. Yes, I would recommend this movie for romantic souls with a taste for this kind of artistic films. And I do not agree with those who compare it with Pulp Fiction. It is not action and twisted history, although all the vignettes are crossed. It's a quiet movie and maybe too slow for most people. It's about characters, their feelings, very subtle. Anyway, probably this revision will not be of much help to anyone (my first), I just wanted to express my gratitude. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: This movie does not have a Goofs section. Wonder, did not anyone notice that part in part 2 when the kidnappers decided to go home? It seems a part of the crew, hehe. I know I should post this on the forums, but I do not agree with some policies here.
