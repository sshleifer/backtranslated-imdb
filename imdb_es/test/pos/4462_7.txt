In a small and picturesque Sicilian village, someone is brutally killing young children with sexual curiosity. The local police keeps busy trying to track down the killer and reduce the list to five or more of the main suspects, including the voyeurist Giuseppe (Vito Passeri) and an elusive, voodoo, wooden doll assaulted doll named Maciara (Florinda) Bolkan). There is also Don Alberto (Marc Popel), a young and handsome priest who runs the local children's school, Andrea (Tomas Milian), a journalist who helps the police, and the beautiful Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a beautiful but fucking screwed . a drug addict who seems to have something for very young guys (ie, VERY). As is typical in the subgenre Giallo, the plot will not be fully revealed until the last frames, but if you can stay there long enough, this movie is worth it. The script (written by Fulci, Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) keeps the false tracks to a minimum and will keep him interested and the story has the support of an excellent location work, cinematography (by Sergio D'Offizi) and musical score (from Riz Ortolani). The performance, particularly Bolkan, is also very good. Fulci fans who were weaned in their grotesque 80s like THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE will find more art and less gore on display here than they could anticipate, but they will still enjoy a particularly nasty string whipping scene in a cemetery (from strange, but effective way acclimated in the ballad of the singer Ornella Vanoni "Quei giorni insieme a te") and a long fall by a rocky embankment that Fulci liked so much that he reused it in his movie THE PSYCHIC (1977). The scenes of the children who are killed are mainly kept off the screen (except for a brief strangulation), but the camera does not hesitate to stay in their corpses. The film did not premiere theatrically in the United States and, presumably due to some anti-Catholic elements in history, it received only a limited theatrical premiere in Europe.
