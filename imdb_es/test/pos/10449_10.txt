What looks like a Porky scam turns out to be a very moving movie about being young and in love. <br /> <br /> The story is about three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, who spend their after. School hours looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in the city, Gary falls madly in love with her. <br /> <br /> The film goes from being a shoddy sex movie to an examination of teenage insecurities. It's fun and sad at the same time. He never completely gives in to that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made. You know that the boy knows the girl, the boy loses the girl, the boy returns to the girl in the final formula. That formula is thrown aside after the boy meets the girl. Maybe that's why I liked the movie so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a final tear of tears. It could also be one of the most realistic endings I've seen in a love story. <br /> <br />
