Right now I had seen some episodes of The Leauge Of Gentleman that I found fun. When I brought the film I was not sure I knew enough about the series to get it, but I was wrong. This is one of the best comedy movies I've seen in my life and the intelligent performance of The Leauge makes the movie. It has a very good and funny plot, and using only a few characters at once helps because it does not make it too confusing, which would have ruined the movie. Even if you have never seen The Leauge Of Gentleman get this movie, it will make you laugh and this is a movie that can be seen more than once and it is an excellent movie to watch with your classmates. It really deserves a definitive revision of 10 out of 10.
