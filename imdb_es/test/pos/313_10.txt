"Apocalypse Now" by Francis Ford Coppola is not a film from the Vietnam War. Do not confuse it with one. It is located in the last drop of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition about the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made, produced or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.) To call it a masterpiece would be an underestimation of such ambitious proportions as the production levels of the film. . <br /> <br /> Opening without credits and following a memorable first scene by playing the melody of The Doors "The End" while Captain Benjamin L. Willard of Martin Sheen hallucinates images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially presented In the first 15 minutes, Willard's mission is "to end ... with extreme prejudice", Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who invariably has left without permission in the confines of the Cambodian jungle and, as said by his In general, he is "out there operating without any help." Decent restriction, totally beyond the reach of any acceptable human behavior, and he is still in the field commanding troops. "Kurtz is a Corone The delirious who is now adored by a large group of followers who have baptized him as a god. For Willard, this covert operations seems to be somewhat more manageable than real combat, however, the journey he is about to embark on will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior. <br /> <br /> Teaming up with a small team, they embark on the vast stretches of the river in a ramshackle ship. On the way, Willard is educated in everything related to Kurtz. During the husky voice of Sheen, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family, until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and headed down the road leading to Willard. The descent into the jungle is marked by a fascinating aura that echoes the battles that are fought not far away. Finally, the power of experience weighs on the group as drugs and a kind of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems immutable and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. While reading about this mythical figure, he is attracted to the power of man and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decline will be parallel to Kurtz's. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatched. His genius: undeniable. But for those who are not familiar with their acting skills and are not used to their physical nuance, Brando can be perceived, in the eyes of a movie buff, as a hack. He certainly is not. It was difficult to work with Brando, difficult to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for incomprehensible criticisms and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing, even if we did not. Your Colonel Kurtz is a being of unlimited illusions and continuous depth. <br /> <br /> If the film is an indication of the trips to hell that the real experience of Francis Ford Coppola in making this masterpiece, is a story of the life of a man. Fanatical fight to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film calendar of more than 200 days of the film, Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; It is an exhausting movie to watch. The sweat and blood of Coppola seeps through the pores of the smoking rooms and their dedication seeps through the holes of the enchanted Willard soldier of Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> I can not help but feel a warm feeling of nostalgia for this kind of movie. At the beginning of everything that was original and unprecedented, the films that challenged and stimulated were common. Leaving aside the audacity, Apocalypse Now is pure film making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the first order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for the film's current standards: the lack of innovation. It is not simply the originality of the current film world; It is the fact that nobody seems to mind telling a story or telling it with a heart. But we still have the greats as the masterpiece of Coppola, a film that bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than we could understand. <br /> <br /> That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step towards madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can get out of hand. But it is the damage from within; the innumerable images of images that anguish us, disconcert us and detach us from our daily world and the memories that torment our deepest thoughts that eventually separate us from humanity and drive us to the realm of the instinctive, the wild and the animal. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance, the act of killing gives man his fundamental catharsis.
