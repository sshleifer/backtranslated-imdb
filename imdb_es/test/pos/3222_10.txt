Obsessed!!!!! I have all seasons of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason why I like it so much is because of how smart the script is, it's not your average comedy show, there's no pause after a joke that follows, if we miss you. lost. And it's not like a telenovela drama either because it does not use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid looks of surprise. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the best television and television programs of its time. It's fun because they talk so fast that you can not get everything the first time. It's good to come back and laugh at the other jokes. They also have so many references, it's amazing how smart they are. <br /> <br /> And you can relate to the characters, they are also so real and the actors are excellent, from the witty Lorelai to the hermit Luke and the immature Kirk the. The show is simply amazing. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend some time with their family, this is definitely the show for them. There is only one word that can describe Gilmore Girls ... CLASSIC !!!
