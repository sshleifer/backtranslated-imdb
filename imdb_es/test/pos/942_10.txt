The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard complaining that there are not enough great Australian films, or that they are all the same. <br /> <br /> Well, in this case, this movie is not a carbon copy. from other Australian movies. It is unique: it will make you laugh out loud, it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself. <br /> <br /> The casting of this movie is excellent and the acting is second to none. any. The script and the photograph (color / light, etc.) are wonderful. But more important, this is a great movie. I do not want to talk about the plot because I think it's always better to see a movie that knows as little as possible about it. Suffice it to say that this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences. Take your girlfriend, take your mom, take your friends, for a great night out. <br /> <br /> 10/10 !!!!
