Being an Israeli Jew of a naturally sarcastic nature and a lover of different and independent cinema, I am always happy to see a film that shows the holocaust that is sensitive and respectful, at the same time that it is original and unusual. While I have not read the book? Or, for that matter, have you heard about its existence before watching the movie? and therefore I can not, like some other critics, comment on how they compare in comparison, Everything Is Illuminated gave me great pleasure, and I can certainly comment on that. <br /> <br /> Label Everything Is Illuminated as a Holocaust Movie It would be a great injustice, even if it is undeniable about the holocaust. So I would label it as a comedy or a travel movie, although it is a journey and it is as exceptionally fun as it is moving. Is everything illuminated is it about Jonathan Safran Foer? Performed to perfection minimalist by Elijah Wood, in the most impressive dramatic performance I've seen so far, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals everything? a young American Jew and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts, who travel to Ukraine on a trip to find the woman who saved her grandfather from the Nazis. It is also about Alex, his tour guide from Ukraine and Alex's grandfather. The fascinating thing about these characters is that at the beginning of the film they seem like a comic relief to balance the melancholic nature of Wood's character; but both Alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film and turn out to be at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin is the blind, moody and self-declared grandfather, who becomes the best dramatic performance in the film. <br /> <br /> Apart from the surreal nature of the film and the characters, the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of landscapes and the horrors of the story, what made Everything Is Illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that Alex and his grandfather get a very different and original point of view on this painful subject; several excellent films, such as The Gray Zone and Downfall, have already given us the point of view of lower-ranking Nazis who present themselves as human beings who are not necessarily aware of the moral implications of their actions, but are trapped in reality from the war. Everything is illuminated presents a point of view that is rarely discussed before: Alex's point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war, who sees it as something more than a cold historical fact, which has to face him. The horrors of his own people? And maybe his own family too? were they able to change Alex's attitude? and that of his grandfather ?? towards Jonathan, towards the Holocaust and towards the Jewish people in general, the film is a fascinating and original study in the development of character. <br /> <br /> Everything Is Illuminated is an excellent directorial debut for actor Liev Schreiber, and one of the most original and unique films of 2005. It is a highly recommended viewing experience, especially or for anyone interested in the holocaust and the Second World War.
