I like historical (vintage) films and I get new ideas for costumes for my historical group, and a friend recommended it to me. I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor, so I thought it was worth it, and I was definitely rewarded !! His representation as a member of the English noble class was much more accurate than I have seen in the past. The comic aspect of it made my sides hurt, the costumes were not horrible, and historically, I did not shudder too much. I also noticed the fact that England did not have a proper sewer system until much later, but anyone who does not take the dose does not delve into the details of England's past will not notice or care. Absolutely worth seeing. I recommend this movie.
