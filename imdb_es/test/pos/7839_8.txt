First of all, I would like to start by saying that it is a refreshing start to see a British Drama that finally looks and feels credible. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart plays the role of justice as (Ian Hood), the government science adviser, with his constant and unwavering views on authority and thoughts on the future of "real world" science "and how it feels. being used or abused by others <br /> <br /> Not only is the cast thoroughly maintained throughout the series, but it makes the characters seem more believable than most other British dramas. <br /> <br /> Ashley Jensen also offers top-notch performance as Dr. Hood's designated bodyguard (Rachael Young), she brings a refreshing insight into the non-scientific, uninteresting everyday visions of science, and his constant struggle with Hood makes some very funny and memorable moments between them. <br /> <br /> The way the series keeps all the most realistic scientific elements. I find positive and more attractive than the psychobabble to which we are accustomed in other television programs of fiction or science fiction. . <br /> <br /> However, there are notable disappointments with the series, every time an episode ends I feel disappointed that they did not seem to cover all aspects of the plot and, sometimes, leave the stories open without closing. <br /> <br /> Although considering that this is still the first series, I hope we will see a return to form in the near future, where these open stories can finally come to a meaningful conclusion they deserve. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoy slower story lines related to science, this is the ideal program to watch, as it always manages to be credible and more important to the point.
