I finally discovered what I thought I remembered when I was four years old. After watching the color version of 1960 on VHS, I kept saying that I remembered seeing it in black and white twice before. Now, the IMDb has helped me to know the truth, which was broadcast twice (2 productions) in black and white in 2 successful years, 1955 and 56. These are the ones I remember best at four years old. I did not realize that issue 56 was not the same as 55. In 1960, I was 9 years old and production in color just did not do it for me. The black and white version was wonderful with as much amazement and astonishment as today's high-tech movies, even without any computer effect. You must have been there! Please comment if you had a reaction similar to the b & w version.
