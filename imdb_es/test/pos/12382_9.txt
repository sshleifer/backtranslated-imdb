Where to start, I like the fearsome snow monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought I would go back and I was. Changing local works to a tropical resort. See old friends and meet new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job as Jack Frost, you can say that when an actor has fun playing a villain, you can see him or, in this case, listen to him in the performance. Yes, Jack Frost 2 is a welcome sequel that is better than the first one. I have a complaint, the little Jacks or the Jacklings as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings, the mouth might have opened more, but the CGI was good and, in general, it's worth watching the whole movie over and over again. If you liked JACK FROST, then you will like this sequel. Without questions or debate, 9 BIG STARS.
