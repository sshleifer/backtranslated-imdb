I have a 4-year-old daughter, and before this movie she talked about the Disney princesses, now she saw this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie for all the young girls. This movie is one of the best in the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values ​​that any mother would love to encourage girls. With the great songs and dance moves, my daughter gets up and tries to imitate the movements. The extras are also good, you even work on how good your memory is. I would definitely say it is a must see for children and adults alike.
