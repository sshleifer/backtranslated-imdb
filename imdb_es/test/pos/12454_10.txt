I've seen most of Tarzan's episodes. Certainly, the X classified with O'Keeffe and Bo Derek, which is totally deplorable. <br /> <br /> I have seen this version several times since it was originally shown. <br /> <br /> The entire cast had memorable parts, great acting of Ape sequences. <br /> <br /> Last night I saw the same in the Spanish station and apart from some dialogues in French, all in Spanish. <br /> <br /> As for Hudson, he did not want Andie's Voice to do anything until the end. He saw the newspapers and could have hired a dialogue coach. <br /> <br /> It seems silly that a story about monkeys and a man raised by all of them jokingly said that Hudson attacked Andie. The story of the movie was the following. she was an American cousin. The last time I checked Carolina was in the USA. UU <br /> <br /> She was beautiful in the movie and in her eyes, and her beautiful hair, the alabaster skin disconcerted all men. She did not have to resort to Bo's level. <br /> <br /> She has remained a LADY for the rest of her career and should see this movie (half of her previous life), as a starting point. His performance, sincerity, made this movie pleasant, believable that a half-wild man could determine his inner beauty. <br /> <br /> Great shipping point for Sir Richardson: he stole the movie.
