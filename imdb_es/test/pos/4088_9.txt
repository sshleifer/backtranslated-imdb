Like some people I know, I was late for 'Stingers'; Not until 2000. Three years later, there's no way I'm going to miss an episode. The show really is so good and, to put it in some way, it has maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. Crime is the thing; Personal lives are there, but they only deviate when it affects an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but it really adjusted, which did not surprise me. Gary could live up to any British or American actor in a similar series. The cast changes from time to time, but each change brings something new and fresh. With possibly the best Australian team behind the scenes, 'Stingers' will remain a cutting-edge drama series.
