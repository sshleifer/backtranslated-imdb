While Boris (Aleksey Batalov) is going to fight in war against the Germans for his Mother Russia, his beloved Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) marries her connoted cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents died in the air. Raid on Moscow. Through various trials and betrayals, Veronika will wait for a word or letter from Boris no matter how long it takes, in the hope that he will return with her. <br /> <br /> The powerful cinematographic piece has an incredible photographic work by the director of photography Sergei Urusevsky. Some of the many beautifully framed and moving shots include the scene in which the camera follows Veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the crowd of bodies to bid farewell to Boris ... and it does not reach him. even as we watch Boris looking impatiently at the swarm with no luck. The sequence after the airstrike where Veronika climbs the standing stairs that circulate through the destroyed building that once called her home and the scene where Mark makes his lustful move on Veronika while another airstrike continues just outside the building while the wind shakes the curtains and the flashes of light that emanate inside are just two of the MANY examples in which Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius by framing images that will last forever in the film. But, without the power and tragedy of the story about how war can forever shape the fate of a loving couple, they love each other deeply, this film could not stand the beauty of the visual alone. Together, however, we were left with an incredible film ... simply a disturbing masterpiece of the Soviet Union after Stalin breathed for the last time. I am honored to have seen a great movie.
