The Violent Men is a good western that benefits from its excellent cast. <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson is the great rancher who tries to squeeze the smallest ranchers, one of whom is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to appease his fianc√© (May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother (Brian Keith) murders one of Ford's hands. Then you will know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is, along with Robinson's intriguing wife, the kind of paper on which she specialized. Dianne Foster plays her daughter who comes to admire Ford. <br /> <br /> The Violent Men is nothing more than a "B" plot with an "A" cast, but it's very well done.
