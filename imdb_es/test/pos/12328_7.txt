Flashes of lightning; an extensive cemetery; the name of Adam 'Batman' West: they all appear on the screen before the opening credits end, and yet, despite these rather unpleasant elements, One Dark Night is not as cheesy as it might seem. <br /> <br /> Meg Tilly (Jennifer's sister) plays the beautiful student Julie, who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into the exclusive clique of The Sisters High School. What Julie does not realize is that the plan of the other 'sisters' to scare her with some macabre jokes or that the most recent body that has been buried in the mausoleum is that of 'psychic vampire' Raymar, who feeds on the lifetime. The strength of frightened young women. <br /> <br /> It is true that this is not the most original configuration, but fortunately there are enough inventive touches to help differentiate this film from the competition, my favorites are the macabre view of the everyday objects embedded in the walls of Raymar's apartment, and the chilling way in which the moldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent end. The impressive cinematographic image of Hal Trussell and the marvelously macabre special effects of Tom Burman also contribute enormously to the chilling atmosphere.
