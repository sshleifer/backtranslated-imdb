Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply too long, varied and cerebral to be completely perfect in all areas, especially with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstract dialogue. In any staging, it is likely that there are certain moments, scenes or intonations with which one does not agree. I have seen many Hamlet productions filmed: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi. In terms of faithful and long-lasting productions, this is classified among the best. <br /> <br /> Most of Hamlet's productions are drastically reduced, because the execution of the entire work requires a stage time of four to five. This production seems to be complete, that is, ALL of Shakespeare's original dialogue is intact, so it is essential for scholars and Shakespeare lovers. And although the lines seemed hasty on rare occasions (for those less familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well acted, spoken and well interpreted. The subtitles are available and are very useful, although sometimes they are delayed a bit. <br /> <br /> Jacobi does a very admirable job with the longest and most impossible role of the theater. Actually I cried when Hamlet dies, and I do not think I've done that before. Patrick Stewart (as Claudio) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the cast in the point. The sets are minimal, so fortunately we can concentrate on the game without distraction or attention to what is not essential. <br /> <br /> At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this long-duration Hamlet is a long journey to sit down. But once again, if you want the real deal, it's worth 100%, even if you need to take an intermediate for yourself. I recommend this production to all the lovers and scholars of Shakespeare.
