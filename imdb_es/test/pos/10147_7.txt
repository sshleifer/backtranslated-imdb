The charming little Hitchcock thriller, with many scams surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists. Jimmy Stewart is, as always, a great hero to Hitchcock, the story reaches its climax at an embassy function, but lacks the menacing threat of Hitchcock's low-budget black and white original. However, another wonderful movie of the stable of the great master.
