For years I've had a distant memory of watching this movie, I searched the net to find it somewhere and I did not find it anywhere, so I thought it must have disappeared. <br /> <br /> UNTIL ... my grandmother showed me a set of boxes that she sent in the Daily Mail and I, although not, there will be nothing decent there, but to my great surprise, among other gems, I was The Water Babies! I have not been so excited in a long time! It's a great happy movie, the songs are not memorable, probably if I was a child during the time it came out, I would have stayed more in mind. Unfortunately, it was just a movie I saw in my Grans 10 years ago when I was a little older. And see it again now the animation is terrible! And the re-recorded voices they make for a wealth of sound in the movies are totally off! But who cares when you're a kid, you never think about those things, even if the main guy is about 10 years old and sounds like a kid in the middle of puberty. <br /> <br /> A great classic movie for children!
