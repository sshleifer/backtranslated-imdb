Who can ask for more? Taking my 2 and 4 year old children was a risk, I admit it. But it's well worth it. They were captivated by credit on credit, with their parents with them. <br /> <br /> I have taken the children to see films with mixed results: too frightening, too boring, too sophisticated, whatever. However, with this movie, I was happy to see an intelligent movie with ingenuity, style and a sense of passion that emanates from the screen. Any film that takes 5 (!) Years of production, whether good or bad, deserves some respect for the courage and patience it takes to film a movie like this. <br /> <br /> O.K. I'm dripping a little. Then again, why do not I get excited? Looking at the list of movies today only reminded me of the poor quality of the films that are distributed. At least for the moment. However, W & G is a well-made movie. Perhaps the originality was not the most inspired, however, well told and with good rhythm. <br /> <br /> Too much adult humor? Too many sexual references? Perhaps. Although my children did not reach them at all. Very young. So, in my case, I did not really notice. <br /> <br /> Well, it goes without saying that I liked it.
