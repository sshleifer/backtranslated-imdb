I saw this movie when it was released and being very young and not very interested in the cinema, it was one of the most fascinating film experiences I've had and it really left a mark in me. At first I did not understand the story well and probably I could not establish the necessary correlations between the past and the present, since the film is presented to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Years after the first time I saw him, I managed to see him again and this was the moment in which I fell in love. "The English patient", moved me deeply and for me it became the best film ever made. <br /> <br /> Anthony Minghella made an absolutely stunning film, all the places are incredible and, through his camera, he manages to create incredible emotions inside of you. <br /> <br /> Of course, the music of the film is such an important part of the entire emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> But personally the best thing was the fragile performance that Ralph Fiennes gave in it is the masterpiece. It plays so well the man who falls slowly but deeply in love with Katherine Clifton, opens his heart and immerses himself in this matter prohibited. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking scene for me will always be the only one. where Almasy takes Katherine to the Cave of the Swimmers and she carries the thimble that he bought her. She says: "I always used it, I always loved you" and at that moment he starts to cry with so much pain that it flows from inside him. <br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the Oscar she won. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a movie that anyone who proclaims himself a movie lover should see in his life.
