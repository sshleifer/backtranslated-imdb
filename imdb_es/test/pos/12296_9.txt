Nobody would ever question that director Leos Carax is a genius, but we wonder if he is a demented genius. Many people hated this movie! I am usually the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the horrible recent film 'L'Enfant' and the useless and offensive 'Feux Rouges'). But, oddly enough, I really believe that 'Pola X' is an incredible movie, made with great skill and passion by a master of his trade, and that contains remarkable performances. The film takes the melodrama to more extreme lengths than I think I have seen on the screen. But then, Carax is extreme, we know that. The film also contains what I consider to be Trotskyist fantasies or exaggerated anarchists and wet dreams, with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the bourgeoisie while they play the rather fascinating music of Scott Walker in a band having their recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse full of illegal squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels. Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a castle (whose stepmother is Catherine Deneuve, and he enters her bathroom while she is naked in the bathroom, by the way). But suddenly he 'breaks down' completely when he discovers that his late father, a famous diplomat, had sired an illegitimate daughter whom Deneuve had effectively dismissed as an inconvenience. This is because the sister suddenly appears as a kind of Romanian refugee with her hair disheveled, her face expressionless and her inability to speak French coherently. Depardieu then becomes a "class hero" of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for his hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in extreme poverty and misery, while despising a vast heritage. Then he begins an incestuous sexual relationship with his step-sister, which is shown in an explicit sexual scene that has offended many people, although I have no objection to it, since I believe that people are too hysterical with regard to sex, especially in United. where apparently never happens. The intensity of the performance and the filming make this unlikely scenario become a powerful, albeit depressing, hyper-melodrama experience. The differences between Carax making an extreme film like this one and the many extreme French films that I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent filmmaker, and (2) he is seriously trying to explore a meaningful, albeit distressing, experience. extreme emotional, by which a human being disintegrates and turns against his background. Many would say that the extreme elements in this movie were free, but I do not agree. I think Carax was genuine, and he was not making an image of exploitation at all. It is very difficult to defend a man who goes so far and who, as far as I know, can be a complete madman, but I think he deserves the defense of this remarkable cinematographic achievement.
