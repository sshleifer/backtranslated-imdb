The "silver screen" is polished with this beautiful film about how to happily grow old and enjoy the rainbow of life. There is a lot of silver hair on this silver screen, but the name of the movie is more than 85 years old, 25 with its energy, humor and lust for life. The story of the extraordinary artist, Uncle Frank, his devoted wife, Aunt Tillie, and the zippy residents of nursing homes in the local area inspires us to "live each day as if it were the last" and offers a glimmer of hope to those longed for golden years. . A great movie for the young and old audience!
