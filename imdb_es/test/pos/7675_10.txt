The many comments made by others have been very informative and I join his calls for the release of Porgy and Bess, the 1959 movie. <br /> <br /> In my early teenage years I joined a record club and this album was one of the free that I chose to join. I knew that some of the voices were dubbed, but only Robert McFerrin was recognized on the album. Recently, my daughter bought a CD from Austria, I think. The quality is excellent, so I'm confused about why it's available in Europe for CBS Records, Inc., when I have not had any luck in local stores. <br /> <br /> Actually, I never saw the movie, but it was years ago. They have begged the local video stores to get it. Now I know why it was never available. <br /> <br /> I add my voice to other people who defend the heirs of property and rights and who accept to disclose it, no matter how imperfect they may perceive it, The beauty of music and history reached so many of us that we would never have had the experience in another way. <br /> <br /> Trudy
