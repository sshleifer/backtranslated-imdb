Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting movie, and one that his followers will undoubtedly track and see. <br /> <br /> Before starting the review, I preface it by saying that if you have the opportunity to see it, it is definitely worth seeing, and it is not the easiest movie to track in the world. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the premise: Luke Wilson is Private Joe Bauers, an Army librarian who is considered to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or obvious flaws, which makes him totally average in every way. This, coupled with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a prominent candidate for an experimental cryogenic procedure. Also frozen with Joe is a prostitute named Rita who was harassed at the project by Upgrayedd, her abusive proxenator. Unfortunately, a few days after they freeze, the top secret project is abandoned, and they are forgotten. <br /> <br /> They wake up in 2505, and discover that with the foolishness of society following the tendencies of In recent times, everyone on Earth is only a little more intelligent than a chimpanzee. The way "every man" talks to Joe Bauers is considered "queer", in the same way that someone who spoke like Shakespeare would now be ridiculed, and a former professional wrestler is the President of the United States (actually, this probably not so outrageous. The best television show is called "Ow! My balls!", Which certainly sounds pretty good, and not only is everything written wrong, but it seems that the signs have run out of space for writing, leaving them grouped in the End. <br /> <br /> It's a fun premise for the movie, but this is the problem. Apart from the initial premise, not so much in the movie is really fun. What I mean by this is that the ideas that come to mind after reading the premise of the movie are probably as fun as the movie itself. Obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been more fun. <br /> <br /> There are some winners in the script, such as Starbucks that now offers "happy endings", and people who put their blind faith in the universally misunderstood "electrolytes," but are very few and far between. , therefore, unless you are going to laugh hysterically whenever one of the idiots of the future spreads a phrase laden with blasphemy and profanity with little or no logic and / or intelligence, then the laughter could be quite well spaced. <br /> <br /> It's unfair that everyone compares it to Office Space, because it's a very different movie, but as a movie, regardless of what came before, Idiocracy is a fun concept that will probably make you laugh a lot more in the first 15 to 20 minutes than in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 5 out of 10 because it's nice, but it's not like that. Do not do enough to raise it above the middle of the road.
