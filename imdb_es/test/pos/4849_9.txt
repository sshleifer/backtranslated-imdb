MPAA Rating PG-13 <br /> <br /> My Rating: 10 onwards <br /> <br /> My Rating 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> William H. Macy offers impressive performance as The role of Mr. Neuman. It makes you feel nice and scared by him simultaneously. The story begins as a comedy and, slowly but steadily, becomes almost like a horror movie with twists and turns that Macy performs masterfully. I could not take my eyes off this movie even after it ended, and I could not believe it would end when it did. MUST SEE IT. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH CAN BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER FOR SOME <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, look at the plot in this way: the Neumanos are the United States as a whole, and the character that plays Meat Loaf Aday is the people in the United States that is antisemetic. <br /> <br /> This was a very nice movie and I would recommend it to anyone I saw on the street.
