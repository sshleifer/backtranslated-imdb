After reading the other commentary on this magnificent television drama, I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like your murders, be firm and serial, and your cops be British, and scream a lot, and blood to be bloody and have a religious inclination, then this hits all the buttons. The 'government' is not enough to put the screams in the rarefied heights of Sweeney, but otherwise highly qualified. Ken Stott is excellent as the "cop on the edge" and the guest stars are also fine, like Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended. (In response to the above comments, although I accept that 'Red' would not 'normally' get away from a stroke and a run, he had just seen his brother arrested for murder, and I'm pretty sure he does not see the boy move. .)
