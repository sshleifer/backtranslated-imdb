Another film "essential". Henry Brandon is a favorite! It surprised me so much when I learned years ago that he was from Germany because it sounds and looks so typically American. And was not it great in "The Searchers" as Chief Scar? Another one of my favorites, I have it and I see it again and again. Now if I could add this to my collection, it would be my day! This is a great story and wildlife movie for all ages. The landscape is absolutely beautiful and the plight of snow leopards in danger of extinction is said with such emotion that it will awaken interest in endangered species in anyone, especially children. If I could, I would give a copy to all my grandchildren and grandchildren!
