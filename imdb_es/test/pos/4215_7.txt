I'll be honest, I rented this movie just because it was part of the "Child's Play" series. I expected a boring and boring 4th part of the series too, but I was surprised. This movie was surprisingly good, and I found it quite funny. There was a lot of dark humor, and the idea of ​​having two dolls was a good way to spice things up. The two dolls worked well together and added a type of Bonnie and Clyde that fell in the movie. In general, it was very good for a fourth movie in the series, with some gruesome death scenes (just look how they kill the Marilyn Manson guy at the beginning, not to mention John Ritter who has a face full of nails). I applaud the writers for spicing things up, and the ending, although it seemed a bit strange, leaves yet another sequel ... maybe "son of Chucky"!
