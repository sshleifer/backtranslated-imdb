I am a 58 year old man. On a rainy afternoon my wife suggested we go see Las Mujeres. After reading the reviews, I thought I could take a nap in the afternoon. Wrong, this movie kept my interest from beginning to end. It was great to see Meg Ryan looking super again. Let's face it Meg looks much better with long hair. Annette Benning looked different to me in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen is showing her age just like Carrie Fisher. The daughter, Molly, was exceptionally acted by young India. I was able to understand the dialogue that is difficult in many current movies because of the quick speech. Cloris Leachman and the woman from Finland were great as housewives who fulfill their usual obligations. The scenes of New York were nice to see. Oh, and Bette Midler had a short role, but as usual it was great. So I gave this girls movie a 9. Guys, go see this even if it's just for the eyes like Eva Mendes. You will not be disappointed.
