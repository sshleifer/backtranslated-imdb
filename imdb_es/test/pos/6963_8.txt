The charming, but lethal Alexandra (the stunning blonde and statuesque beauty Stacie Randall, who looks absolutely sensational in a tight black leather outfit) must find a magical amulet for her evil demonic teacher Faust to cross into our dimension. It depends on the intrepid and robust police Jonathan Graves (the sympathetic Peter Liapis) to stop it. Meanwhile, two dwarf creatures and dwarf gnomes of "comic relief" go crazy in Los Angeles. Jim Wynorski, veteran expert in the exploitation of foxes, tells the extremely insane story at a rapid pace and does not take any of this nonsense remotely. The cast struggles with the silly material: the adorable Barbara Alyn Woods, so daring, going to look for the captain of the police Kate, Raquel Krelle as an actress, the sexy prostitute Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco as the clumsy and excited companion of Graves Scotty, Peggy Trentini as curator of the MÃ³nica museum, and Ace Mask as the merry Dr. Rochelle. The screenplay of Mark Stevi's childish cookie cutter, a fun sense of clandestine humor, the inflatable tip of cornball by Chuck Cirino, the two dwarf boys wearing obvious cheap Halloween rubber bands, the simple cinematography of JE Bash, without tension or feminine nudity free, and the sticky special effects (less than) further enhance the delicious cheese in general of this main slice of cellulose Velveeta. An entertaining brainless piece of funny evil.
