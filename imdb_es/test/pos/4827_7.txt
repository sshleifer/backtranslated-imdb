It may contain Spoilers! In no way, the way or the way in which this film breaks the mold of the horror movie. Not for a moment. However, it offers a spooky atmosphere, characters believable enough and gore. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and does not bother to unfold more than necessary. A group of children died in a mining accident in the early 1900s. Since then, they have stalked and killed the residence of their small and peaceful city of Pennsylvania in the mountains. <br /> <br /> Simple: they want revenge on the man who caused his death years and years ago. Naturally, his great-grandson, great-grandson is in the city and is a real asshole. <br /> <br /> Along with that, a mother and her two daughters inherit an old house after the husband dies. The oldest daughter is rebellious, hateful ... a typical teenager. The youngest is curious, has bright eyes and enters with ghost children. <br /> <br /> The most spooky part of this movie is the simple lack of emotion of the children and they make their way through victim after victim. Excellent performance It was so scary! I mean, the children of the corn movies are one thing ... but this surpassed any of them (as for the creepy kids). <br /> <br /> A look. I bought it before seeing it and I was not unhappy. But I'm a fan of horror.
