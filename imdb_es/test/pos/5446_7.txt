"Man of the Year" tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), a political comedian (like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his own television show. In his program he talks about all sorts of things, but his main focus is political issues about which he is very critical. One day on his show, a fan of the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should run for the president of the United States. After that episode aired, millions flocked to the web to create several petitions and express their views on why Dobbs would be a great candidate for the President of the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for the presidency and goes down and here he wins the election. Everything seems to go according to plan, until a woman by the name of Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) appears and begins a certain controversy regarding her position. Is there a funny but serious political thriller? <br /> <br /> The man who enters this movie expecting to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are movie advertisers when I see how misleading their marketing campaigns are. "Man of the year" is a great example of bad and deceptive marketing, because everything from the poster to the trailer and online ads, makes this film look and feel like a comedy. Honestly, I would have to say that about a third of the movie is fun, while the rest is presented as a political thriller that presents good arguments and allows the audience to think. In this case I wonder if the marketing was done on purpose, since this film deals with quite serious problems in his comedy routine. <br /> <br /> But enough about marketing, let's go to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> I really liked "Man of the Year", although I expected to see a comedy instead of a serious movie. One of the many things that I am going to give credit to this film is that the film does a decent job changing between comedy and drama, although at first it seems a bit uncomfortable. I really believe that after you discover this, the film is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy that you feel comfortable with. Some may not do it because they think they are watching a comedy and do not understand what this movie is trying to say at the end, but these people can blame the advertisers for not advertising this movie well. <br /> <br /> "Man of the year" talks about many things and seems to have a very strong opinion. While Tom Dobbs is talking, he is saying things that need to be said and it is not about the sweets covering them. I also think that the whole political plot, while most critics say that hurting the film probably again due to deceptive marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​computerized voting has been launched in recent years and, with all the problems that computers have, the problem addressed in this film could be realistic. It also addresses the control that large companies have over voting. <br /> <br /> Regarding the performance, I think everyone involved did a good job. Robin Williams had the opportunity to be funny but serious at the same time playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams has surpassed his welcome as a comedian, but personally I still think he is funny and that he is also a good serious actor. This is probably one of the few times we can see him going from one side to the other from serious to funny and I think it works well. It is also good to see the star of Lewis Black in a decent movie. Once again, I like Black when he appears on "The Daily Show" and he remains firm, however, most of the films he has been in were horrible. This was a good movie for him because I think his political views fit the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is an excellent addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and, finally, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum do a very good job as always with these papers that have been granted. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who brought us films like "Rain Man", "Good Morning Vietnam" and "Wag the Dog". Levinson does a good job writing the film and directing it. As I said, I know that many critics did not like the whole aspect of the political thriller of the film, but I thought it fit very well. It was actually nice to see a conventional movie that allowed me to think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a good job with this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, do not enter this movie waiting to see the movie that the ads are selling to you. He laughs, but at the same time he plays more like a political drama. It's not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign makes you believe. I really liked the fact that this movie this movie was not a typical Hollywood movie. He tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and at least it worked for me. I like the fact that the film did not really attenuate any of the themes it addressed or had a typical Hollywood ending. I was trying to call the end from the beginning, but surprisingly it did not end the way I thought about what made me happy. It is a movie that will make you laugh, but then, a few minutes later, you can think and ask what will happen next. I think it's a good movie that will be harmed by its bad marketing.
