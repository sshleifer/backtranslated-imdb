I do not think I'm alone when I say that 2005 has not been especially kind to the horror genre. While "Cursed", "Hide and Seek", "The Ring Two" and "The Amityville Horror" showed flashes of interest and potential, there have been more failures than hits. To see the test, see: "White Noise", "Boogeyman", "The Jacket", "Mindhunters" and "Alone in the Dark". Imagine my surprise when "House of Wax", written by brothers Chad and Carey Hayes, turned out to be ... well, a surprise. <br /> <br /> Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a young woman, traveling with her brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki). They, along with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams), hope to score tickets for the last football game of the season. On the way, they encounter some problems with the car and are forced to enter a desolate city where nothing is what it seems to be. <br /> <br /> Upon hearing about this, a new version of the classic Vincent Price B-Movie, I rolled my eyes. I did not even want to think about the disaster that the first-year director Jaume Serra had prepared for his audience. At a time when most high-profile horror films are disappointments, latent with bad writing, static direction and amateur acting, I consider myself fortunate that Serra and the Hayes brothers were in charge of making a good ghost festival. . Unlike the disappointments I mentioned before, this film makes no effort and uses all the film tricks of the book to give everyone exactly what they came for. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that the Hayes really took the time and effort to create nice, believable characters, which makes the events much more urgent. It also gives some grip to the young actors who represent them. As she did in "The Girl Next Door", Elisha Cuthbert demonstrates to the public what an expert actress really is. In the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" in 2003, Jessica Biel silenced the detractors by offering a raw and emotional interpretation, one that put the viewer there with her. Here, Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray ("A Cinderella Story"), in one of his first more mature roles, is not as vague as Nick. Murray exudes charisma and a hard edge, as well as impressive athleticism above him. Murray and Cuthbert combine perfectly and have tangible family chemistry. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the press and the American public have done a field day on Paris Hilton's debut as a major actor. As expected, Hilton is not ashamed. In fact, she is as good as anyone else in the movie (do with it whatever you want). Like Cuthbert and Murray, Hilton is present on screen. She is sexy and playful. I can not think of a reason why I received the worst of the film's harsh reception, other than that they are simply bothering her. Jared Padalecki ("Gilmore girls" on TV) memorably surpasses his assured role. Robert Ri'chard ('Cousin Skeeter' on television) and Jon Abrahams ("Meet the Parents") do not have much to work with, but they do the job. With a single scene, Damon Herriman ("Soar") leaves an unforgettable impression, and his presence hangs over the rest of the film. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is excellent and threatening in a double role. <br /> <br /> Once again, we should congratulate the writers for avoiding cliches whenever possible. Despite popular opinion, "House of Wax" is quite unpredictable for most of its execution time. Take this, for example: it seems as if the murderer had fallen for the count and Carly crouched to retrieve something from his pockets. What do you expect to happen? Watch the movie, and you will understand what I mean. It is also refreshing to see a horror movie in which the characters show even a minimum of good sense. <br /> <br /> Unlike most horror scores, the exciting work of John Ottman never distracts. However, as with other Dark Castle releases, the visual aspects of "Wax" are worthy of a prize, and elevate the film above its genre adornments. The talents of cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, production designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum and editor Joel Negron highlight the macabre images. Speaking of images, I think gore hounds will be delighted with the many makeup effects and tricks here. Each scene of death is more upset than the previous one. Taking into account his past in music and commercial videos, it is obvious that Jaume Serra has a great eye for style. His "in your face" approach is a great asset to the success of this film. Just when you think the camera is going away, it does not. He is also particularly good at building thick layers of terror and atmosphere. A prominent shot is our introduction to the killer, as it slowly emerges from a trapdoor. <br /> <br /> In a case like this, I generally admit that I am in the minority (Shut up, okay? I liked "The house of the 1000 corpses!"). In this case, I am firmly convinced that the detractors have misunderstood it. I'm not sure why people are so tough in this movie, considering it's much better than recent genre entries. Maybe they're afraid to admit that a horror movie starring Paris Hilton could be worth watching ... Who knows? This is a horror movie, and a very worthy of style and style. As a fan of the horror of a lifetime, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed "House of Wax," in all its glory and sadistic glory. Surely I consider it a great achievement in modern horror, as well as (along with "Sin City") the first fully satisfactory release of 2005.
