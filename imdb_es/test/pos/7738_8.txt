I love this movie despite the fact that it just misses being cool. It is an entertainment for adults, full of problems that an adult can relate to. The acting is excellent. It's fun to see John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands as a middle-aged couple. Who knows how much of that came from his own marriage? Susan Sarandon has never been sexier or more attractive than her free nature, Aretha. Raul Julia is a hoot like a lustful shepherd. The landscape in Greece is spectacular; the configuration of New York causes me to writhe because of many shots of the World Trade Center. Fantastic score from Stomu Yamashta. With so many things in his favor, why is not this a great movie? It is a bit confusing and excessively long, unfocused and uncomfortably unbalanced between humor and drama. Still, it is attractive, entertaining and deeply reflective.
