This show is pure entertainment and does not try to be a Greek drama. It certainly contains elements of one with all the twists of the plot, but it is immensely attractive and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and surely you will never have a lack of material to work with! Anything and everything happens there! The actors in this show are extremely nice and you really want to see what they are doing every week. The show is also very fun. Humor arises from the characters and situations. Not just shot for free. It is a well-prepared show in that sense. It certainly makes me wait on Friday nights and I'm glad that I now have the first two seasons on DVD!
