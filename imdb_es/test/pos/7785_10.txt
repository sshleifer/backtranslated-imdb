According to me, a movie can be better rated by the number of "best scenes" there is. There are probably at least 80-90 scenes throughout the movie that are probably rated as "the best" by someone or another. <br /> <br /> This movie is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who have called him ahead of time, probably because he bombed at the box office. However, I believe that any generation can relate to this movie and laugh. <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm glad that Mahmood is also part of the movie. His role is not so 'fleshy', however, it's good to see that he is part of the cast in the funniest Hindi film in history.
