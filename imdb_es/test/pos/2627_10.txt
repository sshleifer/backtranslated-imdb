I have never forgotten this movie. All these years and it has remained in my life. I have searched for this movie in so many places and stores. If someone ever reads this and has a copy, I will pay you for a copy or, please, let me know where I can find one. This is a movie that should be a classic Romance known, as well as my other favorite, Somewhere in Time. It was really brilliant. If the correct actors remake this film and give it the patience it needs, to act correctly, it could be a block destroyer. A love story as powerful as it should be for all lovers to see it. I remember how sad I was at the end and it really surprised me. I believe with all my heart that Johnny really loved the woman and she loved him. This was a fantastic movie and it is a pity that it is not available for me to buy it. Please, contact me at shawe49@aol.com. I want to thank a wonderful lady who responded to my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the movie and was kind enough to send it to me. She is a big fan of this movie like me. With your help, there have been 3 happy women to receive these DVDs. ' She is waiting for the book on which it is based. I am consulting with my local library, entitled 'Mrs. Maitlands Affair, by Margaret Lynn. I'm sure it's great too. Many thanks to Julie for her kindness and friendship. I'm your friend forever, / Sharon
