I recently visited the Magic Kingdom as an adult with my mother, her best friend and my adult sister. Disney World is often misperceived as a place just for kids, but when you watch quality shows like Mickey's Philharmagic, you realize that the magic of Disney is for everyone. It was such a good show that we left the theater and turned around and lined up again. And then a third time. It was absolutely impressive. I would encourage anyone who goes to Disney World to see this show, which is not just a show but a world full of fun, full of fun with Donald, as he once again lets his temper get him in trouble.
