The opening of Imamura's masterpiece avoids mere sensationalism in his description of the unfathomably horrifying events of August 6, 1945, in which 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were annihilated in an instant. Instead, Imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the catastrophe, focusing on such portentous images as the diabolic mushroom cloud that silently slides into the distance and the black rain that splashes the face of a beautiful young woman. The rest of the film traces the ramifications of this latest incident, bringing the atomic holocaust and its aftermath (more than 100,000 people died from radiation poisoning) to the intelligible level of the plight of Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) and her small "united community" by the pump. " <br /> <br /> Survivors struggle for normalcy and continuity, especially when trying to find a suitable marriage for Yasuko, but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness hides all aspects of their lives. Potential suitors of Yasuko, naturally, move away from a young woman, no matter how attractive, who could suddenly get sick and die. Genuine love, when it finally appears, does so in an unexpected and ambiguous way. We are left wondering if the love through the class lines is more a sample of the state of Yasuko as "damaged goods" or of a common humanity, launched in a bold relief by the harsh circumstances, that transcends the class divisions. <br /> <br /> The movie The restricted classical style intensifies the impact, the spare and eloquent interior shots remind us that Imamura began his career as an assistant to the great Ozu. The mastery of Imamura is evident, for example, in the matching scenes of Yasuko's bath, the first emphasizes his back and beautiful legs, the second how his hair falls. The shots are almost like colophones to the trajectory of the narrative, distilling its tragic essence. The documentary-style realism of the film is violated for expressive purposes several times, perhaps most notably in a scene that exposes the problematic inner life of a shocked veteran. Both the score of the renowned avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu and the impressive black and white photography contribute greatly to the disturbing atmosphere of the film. When, in the final shot, Yasuko's uncle (Kazuo Kitamura), the laconic narrator of the film, looks at the empty sky in search of a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration, the black and white images suddenly They become so moving that it is almost unbearable. Few films from Japan (or anywhere else) could be compared to the great Japanese humanist masterpieces of the 1950s. This movie is one of them. When I finished seeing him for the first time, I was stunned, unable to move for at least five minutes, overwhelmed as I was by the emotions that the great tragedy should inspire: terror and compassion.
