I love the movies that take you to them. A movie that really makes you feel weak when it ends and this kind of movie is weird. <br /> <br /> Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on the screen. This movie has a vanguard. A mainstream cast for such a low budget. Why is it that a Man with so much talent and Charisma, (not to mention sexual attractiveness in ways that go beyond most other actors) can do so with so little money to work? These actors really believe in their script and their talent as a director, writer and actor. I am very pleased to know that such a modern genius is out there, let the passion for art take him and take us as an audience with him. Damien, I've heard about you through so many different circles and do not let people jealous of this world affect you. Martin receives this, Fellini got it and you will always get it. The fire and passion in you is what we love to see on the screen. Thanks for being different and having the guts to write like you do. You are a unique Director, do not listen to empty containers.
