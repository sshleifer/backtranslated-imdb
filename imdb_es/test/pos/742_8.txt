I'm not sure what intrigues me about this movie. It is grainy, badly written, discolored, often ridiculous, and in many places the mind numbs me (the person I was seeing it fell asleep twice). And yet, there is something in this movie that fascinates me, although I'm not sure. what; perhaps the character Sam, a former patient who was huge lobotimizado by former chief medical officer and is sucking a perpetually ice pop), or the wonderful doctor (I forget his name). <br /> <br /> Anyway, look at it and form your own opinion; It has one of the best endings I've seen in the movie.
