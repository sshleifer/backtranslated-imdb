The first time I see this movie seems to be a kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse that once seen was never forgotten. However, seen strictly in the context of history, the implication is that to survive in America after the immediate Civil War, one had to have a horse, and not an old horse, but a really big one. And the Eagle Wing is a horse like that. But for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter. Who should own it? The native American or AWOL soldier? The history along the holes primitivism against civilization. As other commentators have said, it is ironic that it has been necessary for an English director to perceive this fact and then develop this simple theme in a western like no other he can see again. The film is basically about this beast and the brutality of the environment and the people who make a living. The photography and the soundtrack are exquisite. Martin Sheen's performance is a revelation. This film, released the same year as another great performance of Sheen as Willard in "Apocalypse Now", points to his abilities that somehow never returned to have so much freedom. More is worth it. A comparison of the two stories throws the surprising similarities between them, among others, that both films trace the journey of a man towards his soul to find redemption. While Willard is redeemed, I'll let the viewer decide if Pike will eventually do it. The ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word, and very touching; be warned Together this is an extraordinary movie.
