A lot of "alternative" comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular, wrong, too political and not funny, and the worst of the Comic strip's present ... everything was included in this category. <br /> <br /> But this is at the other extreme: an extraordinary film that works at different intellectual levels. <br /> <br /> Is Dennis a criminal brain or is he lying? <br /> <br /> Are you telling the truth? , double bluff, against double-bubbling bluffing whatever? <br /> <br /> I've probably seen Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and I still can not decide 100%. That is the wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> In addition to Ade Edmonson, there are important roles for other pillars of Comic Strip: French & Saunders, Pete Richardson, Alexei Sayle, Keith Allen, Nigel Planer and Robbie Coltrane. Interestingly, not Rik Mayall. <br /> <br /> All the actors of Comic Strip, as much as I did not like the hidden agenda of some of its members, are convincing actors and become excellent performances in this big screen, although the work of the team The writing of Richardson-Richens is often pure genius, with small details of details. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is a study of crime, criminology and human nature, in all its marvelous complexity. And very funny with that. You will not be disappointed.
