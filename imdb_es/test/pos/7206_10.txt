This is definitely a movie that "you must see". The excellent director Alain Chabat (who also acts as Ceasar) has managed to capture the very essence of "Asterix Adventures" (the French comics on which it is based) and create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also a tribute to The world of animation cinema. This movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it can take two or three projections before you notice them all, between their laughter. The only drawback is that a non-French audience (or at least a hearing that does not speak French) might not get all the "private jokes". There are so many dialogues impossible to translate, so many situations directly related to comics or with the French lifestyle, that the fun could decrease. However, it is still totally worth seeing because of the beautiful image, the incredible acrobatics, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent performance. All the actors are great, but the film would not be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer. And, please, NEVER compare this magnificent film with the previous terrible one based on the same comics: "Astérix et Obélix Contre César" and directed by Claude Zidi.
