I've seen this movie so many times, it's so good. Maybe because I can relate to Tittas way of life is the reason. Not everyone would find it to their liking. Also, my Italy is improving after every visualization. Am I a sad case? Thank you Mr. Sorrentino. I wait for your next movie. Although I did not see the film in a movie theater, I have the DVD and I would encourage anyone to buy it. The special extras feature alone is worth the price. The amount of time that a director spends in making a movie is very little appreciated, the extras in the DVD provide an excellent view of the making of a movie. As for the history of the film, I have prejudices. I like to talk to all my friends, but as I said before, I relate a lot to the main character who is a loner in a situation that is not of his choice. . The mafia in Sicily uses Titta to launder its money in a Swiss bank. He owes them for costing them millions of dollars years ago in a stock deal that went wrong. Love Kills.
