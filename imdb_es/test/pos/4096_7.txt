This version of "The Lost Horizon" is not really a bad movie. I think the problem is that people like to choose musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film in its original release in 1973 (I was ten years old) and I really enjoyed it, especially music. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is funny, the acting is good and, technically, it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two pretty silly dance numbers, but hey, you can not win them all. I have this movie on video and I see it from time to time ... and I enjoy it every time!
