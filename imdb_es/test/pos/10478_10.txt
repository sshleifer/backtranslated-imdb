If it's not the best movie ever made, "La Fiesta de Babette" is certainly one of the most endearing. This is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of art, generosity, loyalty and grace. Humor mixes with tender yearning; The characters are treated honestly, but also with deep respect. Here there are meditations on memory, destiny, old age and fidelity. Marvelous camera work by cinematographer Henning Kristiansen: rarely did the wrinkled faces look so bright in the candlelight. The food is accompanied by delicious music of the time, Brahms, Mozart and simple folk hymns. Enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit, because, as the general says: "Mercy and truth have come together, and justice and happiness will be kissed".
