PUBLIC ENEMIES is a kind of throwback to those gangster biographies of the early 1960s such as PORTRAIT OF A MOVIE, MAD DOG COLL and KING OF THE ROARING TWENTIES. Although made at low cost, the film has a lot of energy and the overall performance, particularly by Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone is quite good. Theresa Russell may seem too glamorous like Ma, but she has some very good moments. There are two action scenes that are worth mentioning: a shooting in a hotel and a machine gun fight in the middle of the street between the Barkers and the FBI. Both sequences are well done, and compared to other types of low cost gangster garbage, such as DILLINGER AND CAPONE, this movie shines.
