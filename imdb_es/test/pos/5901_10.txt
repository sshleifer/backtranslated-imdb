Everyone agrees with the technical excellence of this Jutra movie (whose life ended so tragically). As for the content, of course it makes a difference if you are a Quebecker, and this explains some of the divergences of opinions. For me, it is for the cinema what Vignault "Mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays" is for the song. In addition, Jean Duceppe himself was part of the legendary Quebec. <br /> <br /> This film can be contrasted with "CRAZY", a current release from Quebec that is successful enough to be shown here in Spain and also about the 60s. Urban Quebec (crazy) against rural Quebec (Antoine). But also a film that must be something very different for foreigners and for people who know Quebec from the inside.
