After having read so much negative press about this film over the years, I had always avoided it, but the arrival of the cheap public domain DVD encouraged me to finally see it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it has been transferred from a poor copy. The modern prequel, shot in tinted material, is blurred and the contrast is non-existent. The faces are sometimes difficult to distinguish. That said, the real story is entertaining and Lou appears as an accomplished actor, more than in many of the movies for children. <br /> <br /> Once the film changes to the story of 'Jack', the film changes to 'color' and I use that term lightly. Most shades are orange or brown. The greens look particularly bad. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Ford as 'Polly', the giant's maid, was a great advantage for me, as I enjoyed her in an early appearance of 'Andy Hardy'. <br /> <br /> With so many negative comments about the real quality of the print, I'm still happy to give this movie a 7. It gave me a lot of laughs and that's more than most of the comedies I've seen. Decades can be administered. <br /> <br /> One to see if you have the opportunity.
