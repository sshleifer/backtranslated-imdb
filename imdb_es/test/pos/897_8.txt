The main reason to check it is to see Laura Gemser in all her glory. <br /> <br /> That is a sufficient reason for me. <br /> <br /> He heads to Africa as guests of another rich man. That seems to be in all these movies. Huge mansion near the jungle. Hunters stay for parties when they are not hunting zebras. And those parties are turning into drunken orgies. <br /> <br /> All the high society types in the Emanuelle movies seem to have fetishes out of control. And most of them are Emanuelle beds. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato did NOT lead this one. He just ripped it off and used the same cast (s). And did someone notice the 'subliminal' sexual images at the gas station? And why did most men stay dressed during sex scenes? <br /> <br /> Consistency? Barely. BUT THE GOSSER DIOSA IS BEAUTIFUL.
