Not because of the apprehension, but because of the number of turns, the inventive uses of situations that use the mythology of vampires, the magnificent visual extremes, together with interesting and peculiar characters, make this one of the most impressive horror films I have seen in my life. It descends to total madness along with the characters, but never seems exploitative or horrible without a purpose. There are abundant amounts of bloodshed accompanied by some dirty sucking and crushing sounds, but also subtle moments in which you laugh out loud. As tends to do, Chan-wook Park keeps you out of the center with jumps in time, the plot and the situation that you must complete for yourself, forcing your participation in the story and the characters. <br /> <br /> And there are many literal jumps. Staying in the vein of vampire myth (pun), they have superhuman strength and can almost jump tall buildings in a single limit (to coin a phrase). The first time our heroine is transported along the tops of the buildings by the vampire with priest problems, she has all the magical romance of Lois Lane and Superman, but this romance becomes increasingly disturbing, but driven by a strange and conflictive "love story". not for mere horror. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, particularly OK-vin Kim, the beautiful actress in the role of female protagonist who, at 22, shows a range that is remarkable. The character borders on a kind of black widow movie. She takes care of innocent to evil fox and demon with absolute conviction. This is a really smooth and nervous performance. <br /> <br /> If you love real art in horror, or you're an Oldboy fan, do not wait for the video, see it right away.
