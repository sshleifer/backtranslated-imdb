Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave Theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie just because I realized that it is a WWE movie that would be good to laugh. Then I sat down, watched him and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He's probably one of the weirdest guys on the big screen (much worse than Freddy or Jason) and has a big advantage in other movies that attract me to a horror movie. It shows Jacob Goodnight as someone who is human. He has a heart, no matter how twisted and creepy it is. He feels pain, something that Jason never does or seems to show. He feels sorry and pleasure, although once again, both are crazy, which he will notice if he sees the movie. In general, in my opinion, it was a different experience from that of many slashers, and it surprised me in several ways, like who lived at the end.
