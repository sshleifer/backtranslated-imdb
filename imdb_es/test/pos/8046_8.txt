The battle at Elderbrush Gulch was Griffith's longest and most expensive short film that he had achieved so far. In it we see him trying to perfect the large-scale action scene that would be necessary in his feature films, with all the elements that made his previous action shorts successful. <br /> <br /> Griffith uses the western format? Is it already the ideal backdrop for pure and straight action pieces? As the scene of his first epic battle. Like many westerns of the 1910s, the starting point is a character from the east that heads west. a device that perhaps helped facilitate the audience in the desert, and here those orientals are a pair of children, which was important for the type of image in which it develops. For Griffith, you can not act without a sense of vulnerability and here you mess with the children of the east, Lillian Gish as the anguished mother of "the only baby in the city" and even some puppies who are at risk. to end up in the menu of the Indians. <br /> <br /> This all paves the way for an extremely complex and layered action sequence, combining the scenario of trapped heroin and the journey to the rescue with the battles that Griffith had been representing since his first images of the War Civil in 1909. Here is a phenomenal amount, and Griffith does it very well to keep the pace stimulating and keep everything coherent and logical. However, juggling x amount of elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make it many times more exciting, no matter how cleverly balanced, and Griffith created better endings soaked in tension before and after it. <br /> <br /> But even an image of Griffith so focused on action would not be without its drama, characterization and atmosphere. In The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch, emotional configuration is treated briefly but economically. First, we have the scene in which people leave their home. The car in which they travel away from the camera, making use of depth and distance to express their departure from security and civilization. An equally effective scene is one in which we are introduced to the young family of Gish, Bobby Harron and their baby. The people of the city lull the precious totem, then walk off the screen, revealing that two Indians were watching from the bottom, adding a sinister note of danger. <br /> <br /> Of course, many today's spectators have pointed out the battle in the offensive depiction of Native Americans by Elderbrush Gulch (in contrast to the more sympathetic vision of the red man), but it may not be all that what it looks like First of all, take a look at the waistcoat of the Indian chief's son. It is black and covered with bright white spots. It looks like a pearly king's jacket, perhaps slightly modified by the warmer weather. Now take a look at the "dance of war" that you perform later? has a certain air of "Mother Brown on her knees". These are not Indians, they are cockneys! So it should not be offensive to Native Americans. Only cockneys.
