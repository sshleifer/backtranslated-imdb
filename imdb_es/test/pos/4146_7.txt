Where I start I say how big is cinematography? Do I praise certain scenes that show the creativity of the directors? Do I tell you how realistic are the scenes on Ellis Island? I should mention that for a change we do not have the cliché scene of seeing the Statue of Liberty. (Now, the immigrants who see the statue from the railing of the boats is a cliché) <br /> <br /> Now it's not pleasant, two main things, one of them is a modern song and not even a good one to boot . <Br /> <br /> Secondly, and almost deadly, the film is boring, it moves so slowly, that seeing the painting in dry would be an improvement. <br /> <br /> The execution time of 118 minutes is too long and yet the movie seems unfinished. We do not see scenes of this family in the United States. Our hero mentions that he wants to find his twin brother, I would have liked to see scenes of his futile search for maybe lucky, instead of other strange scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost a fault. <br /> <br /> Qualifications *** (of 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
