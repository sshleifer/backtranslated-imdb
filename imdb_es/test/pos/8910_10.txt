MONKEY is surely one of the best programs that have been seen on television. I remember when I was a kid, I went to my grandmother's house every Saturday morning and turned on the television so I could see MONKEY. I loved. I had kickass action scenes, great special effects, a great story, a fantastic song that guaranteed that I would never leave your head and the hilarious dubbing. But it's a bit strange that it's set in China and the actors are Japanese and filmed in Japan, but that's not an obstacle to making this TV show adorable. <br /> <br /> MONKEY is about the adventures of three people: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (Shir√¥ Kishibe) and, of course, the most unforgettable and adorable character, the monkey (Masaaki Sakai) traveling from China to India to get a lot of sacred scrolls to save the world. <Br /> <br /> MONKEY is very funny and magical.
