I am a professional musician who was inspired almost 20 years ago to start playing the guitar after listening to Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II. While I do not play in the same genre or style, the impact of that man has been enormous. Now, almost 20 years later, I could finally see something more than the not so good song that remains the same. Once again, I have seen MANY bands playing, some small ones, some of the current "teachers". No band, no place, no way has NEVER been able to take out the magic that you can really try to see this DVD. <br /> <br /> Robert Plant can be a bit too much sometimes, and you can almost feel Page's annoyance to forget the lyrics, but I guess that did not matter, especially for the time. The genius of Bonham shines more in this DVD than in any album with Zeppelin, Band of Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is quite common, but the magic of this DVD is how well the four behave together. The world loved to imagine that they were in black magic (k), etc., that was just a matter of interest for Page. The magic (note that I say a lot), is that this DVD captures a rare look at the harshness of 4 young children who can play brilliantly, no matter how careless they are playing. It did not matter <br /> <br /> A quick breakdown. The first of the two DVDs is where the real magic is. You should be able to feel the power and rawness that Zep had in his early days. At the end of the second page of DVD you are struggling with your sanity during the Knebworth songs. (It is no secret that at this time he was severely addicted to heroin). Therefore, I would recommend the first album to ANY music lover, and the second one to the only true Zeppelin fan. <br /> <br /> It may be getting too far for some guitarists, but I would say that after seeing this, Page is certainly more creative and inventive than Hendrix. Yes, I said it. And if you do not agree, watch the DVD.
