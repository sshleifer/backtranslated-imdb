This movie probably gave me the most pleasant surprise of all I've seen. It was not a big budget production and its premise, the amateur middle-aged jazz musicians getting an unexpected professional commitment at a resort like Catskills, seems quite modest. What is not modest is the success of the film. This is a small movie of life that is more entertaining. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script and is full of interesting subtopics and unexpected twists. <br /> <br /> The actors are day laborers who do solid work. The biggest revelation for me was Cleavon Little. He plays a professional musician who is hired to complete a member of the sick band. His attitude collides immediately with the others. While they see it as an opportunity for great fun and once in a lifetime, he sees it as his work and not one particularly interesting. This leads to conflict, but when the group gets into trouble, he leads them. Little, who died too young, really showed me that he was a good actor with this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is for those who really sleep, the kind that a movie fan always hopes to discover. I recommend it wholeheartedly.
