"Pink Flamingos" is a cult classic. The plot of this film revolves around the challenge of the supremacy of Divine as the dirtiest person in the world. "Pink Flamingos" contains some repulsive scenes memorably like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where Divine eats. Stool of fresh dogs. Yes, the film is shocking and fun at the same time, but the biggest laughs come from the lines of the actors. Look especially at this line of Divine: "Kill everyone now! Condone, murder in the first degree! Defend cannibalism! Eat Shit! Filth is my politics! Filth is my life!" In general, I really liked this movie. Still, his motto "An exercise in bad taste" should be taken seriously, and even those who are used to the rude. Today's movies can find this gem difficult to digest. Highly recommended
