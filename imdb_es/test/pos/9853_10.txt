In Sudan, the Arabs rule and are constantly at war with the Christians and animists who inhabit the southern part of this East African country. This film follows a group of Dinka children, a tribe of cattle herders, who were orphaned after their village was destroyed and their families died in a brutal attack carried out by Arab forces. Most of these guys are now teenagers and have been nicknamed "The Lost Boys". <br /> <br /> The filmmaker follows a group of "Lost Boys" on their trip, as they have been accepted as refugees in the United States. , where they will land in Houston. Those who have been accepted as refugees gain celebrity status, as they feel (from what they have heard) that the United States is incredible. Making a trip from Sudan to the United States is like "taking a trip to heaven," says the young man. A large party is organized for their departure, and they are told to do Sudan well and, once they have been educated, return to Sudan to be able to contribute to Dinka society. They are also warned not to be like "those in baggy pants" who are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men, and also, no matter what happens, do not forget the Dinka culture. <br /> <br /> You see how children come from a third world country to America and how they try to integrate into American society, since they have gone from a practically nothing place to this abundant world in which everything is overproduced and consumed to a large extent. They are taught about cleanliness and how to use all the public services that we take for granted daily. It is humorous at times, to humiliate others. <br /> <br /> Listening to the comments they make about black Americans and American society / culture is quite interesting. As the film progresses, we see how American culture begins to corrupt their previously humble thought forms. <br /> <br /> One of the children, Peter, is not content with working and doing enough to survive, so he and his son get up. He moves from Houston to Kansas City so he can pursue an education. When the other boys visit, they talk about how they can not enter any school. The main reason they came to the United States was to get an education and the media say that children have been brought from Sudan for an education. This happens because children were given arbitrary ages, making them older than they really are, which prevents them from enrolling in high school. <br /> <br /> The film juxtaposes images from Houston to Kansas. We observe how Peter enrolls in school, where he befriends a group of conservative Christian children, and when Santiago tries to drive to school (even though he drives without his license anyway), and works at Walmart. We see Peter struggling with high school life as he strives to form the basketball team at his school, and how Santiago has trouble keeping up with work, rent, easing tensions at home in Sudan and, above all, face loneliness. <Br /> <br /> You get to the point where the boys want to go back to Sudan and tell them that everything they are taught about the United States there is a lie. "You should do it alone here, do it all alone," says one of the boys. A condemnatory message for a liberal capitalist lifestyle, which shows how people become radical individualists (a trend that led to the creation of neoconservative and radical Islamist movements). His biggest problem with America, however, is that there is no time; Time is money and we do not lose a second! <br /> <br /> Despite all this, the children never lose their sense of the Dinka culture. They celebrate the Day of the Liberation of South Sudan, which marks the day when the SPLA began to fight in Sudan, a struggle that continues today. They also meet with other "Lost Children" on the anniversary of their arrival in the United States, where they discuss their experience in the United States compared to that of Sudan. When asked, a child says that if he could make a living, he would rather live in Sudan. It's too lonely in America, he adds. They never lose their sense of community, which has been conditioned on them as part of their culture! <br /> <br /> This movie makes us question the way we live, it makes us question the artificial happiness that materialism and the nature of Our societies have created within us. It will also change the way I see refugees, I will never take for granted how hard they have to work and what immigrants mean to a country like mine, Canada. This is a wonderful movie. I laughed, I cried ... a very emotional trip and a documentary very well done. 10 out of 10
