If it had not been for To Kill A Mockingbird, this movie would be much more famous. If it had not been for Gregory Peck as Addicus Fitch, the performance here would be much more praised. If it had not been for William Faulkner, maybe To Kill a Mockingbird would never have been written in his shadow. <br /> <br /> I found this movie sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies, To Kill a Mockingbird, may not have been as original as I had always thought. Maybe it was inspired by this very similar movie. Oh, the "whodunnit" is different, but the underlying story, a fair and lonely "white" lawyer against a white southern city defending a black man is very familiar. And, written by a woman, Mockingbird concentrates on rape, the ultimate betrayal of a woman while this film focuses on the hatred of brother against brother, the rape a man feels for brotherly betrayal. <br /> <br /> There is no Mockingbird depth here. It is not the comfort that Addicus brings with his presence. So you're left with the sadness that, whether she tried to raise the plot of this movie or not, Mockingbird reflects on Harper Lee. Nothing changed in the approximately 10 years since he could have read Faulkner's book and seen his film at the University of Alabama, and he unconsciously took most of it in later years. Nothing changed in race relations and some may say that nothing has changed even now, many years later. <br /> <br /> It is very sadly familiar, and one would wish there was an Addicus of our day to do it well. Where Mockingbird leaves you with that hope, rocking in the arms of Addicus and waiting for a morning of better times, this film leaves you sad because the pride of blacks can equal or improve the pride of whites. But the pride of either is not an answer at all. <br /> <br /> Rather, it is the Addicus response we need, the comfort that we are all imperfect and that in our frailty we must have mercy, not pride, in facing each other. Another in our differences.
