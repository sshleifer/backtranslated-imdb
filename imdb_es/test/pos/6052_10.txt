I have seen this movie and anyone who has been with the Marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this movie. It is a must for any collection. Jack Webb does an excellent job as a hard drill instructor. My father went to the Marines training camp in Camp Penelton and says that this movie is so accurate that it feels like he's back in basic training. There is a line in the movie where the character of Jack Webbs gets angry with a boot for killing a sand flea. Well, let me tell you, there's nothing but sand fleas in the camp. I've been there and I can appreciate it. In fact, the exit to the camp is Las Puljas, which in English means city of fleas. You must see the movie to appreciate what I am saying. Anyone who is interested in World War II movies, all battles start here with the Sergeant's exercise. An essential collection for you.
