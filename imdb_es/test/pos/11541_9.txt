I will put this as clearly as possible for those of you who are unaware of Bill Hicks' legacy. He was simply the best comedian in the world, almost certainly in my opinion, the greatest that ever existed (his standing idol is the great Richard Pryor, whose battles with addiction are parallel). His death in 1994 was barely noticed in the popular media and came just weeks after Kurt Cobain had committed suicide. His tragic death at such an early age eclipses any sense of injustice that, of course, was criminally ignored during his life. But the hard truth is clear as day: nobody has come to claim his cloak. There is not a stand-up comedian with almost skill and invention. <br /> <br /> The observation is made in the affectionate tribute "It's just a walk" that stand-up comedians often see work as a step forward. The stone for the richest activities: lame films and moral comedies, made to occupy, but never enrich, the lives of an unimaginative public. It's all what Bill Hicks talked about. His sermon was always a war cry for people to think for themselves, to analyze authority, to unite as a single race. <br /> <br /> His appeal continues to grow with every year that passes since his death. Your star will continue to shine long after so many minor lights have gone out. Once you have been exposed to your brilliant, intelligent, but ultimately compassionate result, you will be enriched and rewarded. <br /> <br /> The man himself wanted to quote Dylan: `To live outside the law, you must be Honest, 'said Bill Hicks was honest, beyond that, it was the funniest of all.
