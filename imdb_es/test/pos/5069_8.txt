I am Egyptian. I have a green card. I live in the United States since 1991. I have a very common Arabic name. I'm married (not American wife but not Egyptian, not Arab). I have children born in the United States. I have a Ph.D. in cell biology from the United States and I travel for conferences. I make 6-figure income and I own a house in the Washington, DC area. I pay my taxes and, out of 1 or 2 parking tickets, I have no stains on my record since I came to this country in 1991. I look more Egyptian Ibrahimi's character, but my spoken English is as good as his. <br /> <br /> A couple of months ago I was returning from a conference / company in Spain through Munich Germany to Washington, DC (Start). A German officer picked me up at the Munich airport as soon as I got off the Madrid plane. He was waiting for me. I was about to start questioning myself until I just said, "I do not have any business in Germany, I'm just going through." He had let me go with the greatest disappointment. That was nothing compared to what happened in Washington, the Dulles airport (which was not as bad as what happened to Ibrahimi in the movie). The customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the duration and purpose of my trip. Then he wrote a letter C on my custom declaration form and let me go. After picking up my checked suitcase, I was stopped at the last exit point (some National Security garbage). I sat there for 3 hours together with many different people of different nationalities. They did not tell me the reason for my arrest. I was not allowed to use my phone or ANY other phone. At first I resisted asking them to tell me the reason or let me go, but I decided to absorb it and wait and see. I asked if I can call my wife to tell her I'm going to be late but they said no. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said "hello", an officer pulled the phone from my hand and threatened to confiscate it. When I asked about the need to call home because my family was waiting, they told me "Three hours is nothing, we will get in touch after five hours". When I asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me there. The bathroom was fun; I guess it was a prison style toilet that is completely metal without a seat. Finally, they called my name and gave me my passport / green card and told me I could go. I asked him what the problem was, they said "nothing" !! I know it only lasted 3 hours, but I was very tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and children. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it was very well made. Unlike most films that involve Arabs and use non-Arab actors who only talk gibberish, this film in Arabic was 100% correct. I suppose the country is Morocco (North of Africa).
