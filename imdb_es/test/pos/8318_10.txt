Walking With Dinosaurs is an amazing documentary, educational for both Ignorant of Dinosaurs and for Dinosaur-Lovers (like me). I admit I was very young when I saw this on Discovery, but I became obsessed with that immediately. (Spoliers !!!!!) The series contains 6 episodes, ranging from the Late Triassic when the dinosaurs just evolved to the Late Cretaceous, at the end of the Reign of the dinosaurs. The first time I saw this movie, it was as if I had really traveled in time. The majesty of Diplodocus, the adventures of Opthalmosaurus and the affectionate mother version of T-Rex amazed my family and me. It's an incredible movie, and I think the BBC managed to do exactly what they set out to do. Awesome job!
