One of my favorite childhood movies. The chipmunk adventure offers incredible fun for young and old alike. The animation is animated and colorful and the film itself has some of the best songs that have been included in an animated feature. Who could forget the dynamic "Boys / Girls of Rock n 'Roll", the exciting "Diamond Dolls" and the heartbreaking "My Mother"? <br /> <br /> This should be considered as a nostalgic classic animated gem of the eighties. It's a pity that they do not do it that way anymore. Most of the animated films of today resort to violence, raw humor or sentimental sentiment ... except, of course, to the people of Pixar. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: An incredible and unforgettable adventure for all ages.
