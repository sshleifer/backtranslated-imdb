The main criticism of AT THE EARTH'S CORE is that it is cheap, special effects are bad and so on. Yes, some of the special effects are terribly bad, but what many people overlook is that it's actually quite fun, which is very important in my book. <br /> <br /> By comparison, just look at the latest STAR WARS Movies: they have the latest and greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances that are capable of creating amazing visual effects as far as human imagination can imagine and, however, with all the glare, those films were as exciting as a funeral. As Yoda would say, they are not! In other words, who cares if the FX is not the best when the spirit of the film is fast, humorous and clearly put on the side of the action. I love everything related to AT THE EARTH'S CORE: the contrast between heavy Victorian England VS the colorful savage of Pellucidar, the cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, telepathic Pterodactyls, rebellious human slaves, Jubal the ugly (Hehe!), The inspired team of Peter Cushing (how cool!) And Doug McClure, the excellent music (it's really good), the cinematography of the incredible Alan Hume and last but not least, Caroline Munro. She is sexy in this movie. One of the most attractive B-movie girls ever captured on screen. <br /> <br /> Seriously, anyone who does not like this movie does not know what fun is. Give me at the CENTER OF THE EARTH on any turgor of STAR WARS at any time! At least it has Caroline Munro, which no CGI fx can recreate.
