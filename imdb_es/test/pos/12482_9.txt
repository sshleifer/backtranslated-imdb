First, the obvious, like a police drama crossed with a funny melodrama, QUAY ?? It is disconcerting, directly independent and a threat to banality. Jouvet's poise is put to good use in a tough police action that is immediately noticed by his vigor and exuberant strength; his Antoine is not so much a man of intellect, but a man of vast experience of life and earthly instinct. QUAY ?? it is not subversive in the sense that the philistines of today (and already yesterday) enjoy using the word. It's Clouzot's most playful hour. Tends to adapt Steeman's books in a satirical note. (It is said that Clouzot was a great reader of detective novels). As a director, Clouzot's firm hand is successful. <br /> <br /> It is not a mystery or a thriller, but a satirical look at a Parisian couple and the police process. Those who are used to Clouzot's masterpiece, LES DIABOLIQUES, may find it a bit disconcerting in the multiplicity of things, styles, elements of QUAY ??. Here, Clouzot speaks of many things, of a couple, and of a hidden love story (Simone Renant for Blier), about entertainment. The world and about the old spinsters, about police techniques and a bitter old policeman with a child to raise, etc. There is a note of exuberance not only in the performance of Jouvet, but also in the conception of the film. <br /> <br /> Quay is a realistic criminal drama done as a satire. It offers an excellent performance by Jouvet as a tough police inspector. Antoine is an old policeman with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa, but did not climb the ladder of the ranks due to his independent behavior); he lives with his son, a schoolboy; At work, Antoine is tough and ruthless, a capable, bitter, intelligent and hard inspector. It is a paper of great taste, very picturesque. Jouvet composed his character with several defining characteristics: his clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality and that mocking air. Antoine is not made to look smarter than plausible; When he interrogates Blier, Antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented as the talent we find in real life, mixed with errors, gaps and shortcomings. Antoine's talent also comes from experience, from daily observation, it is not the almost supernatural divinitarian genius of almost all famous detectives. <br /> <br /> QUAY ?? It is multifaceted, it is a realistic criminal drama, and also a satire and a melodrama. One can consider it among the first film incursions in the legendary harshness of the French police. A long time ago, the tough cops of Eastwood and Wayne, there was Antoine. <br /> <br /> The title is interesting, suggesting that it is a film about the police, not about a case or a mystery. <br /> <br /> As craftsmanship, Clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in France (as was Welles). QUAY ?? It is very true to the nature of Clouzot: a sardonic comic, acute observations, a lot of psychology, a sharp and ruthless irony. The man was first class when he filmed something that knew what to film, what to choose, to see the introductory scenes of this film, with the great theatrical success of Jenny Lamour. Each scene is memorably, shot exorbitantly. The technical and stylistic abilities of Clouzot were incredible. His style is inventive, satirical, sharp, extremely clear, witty. <br /> <br /> Jouvet's style was exuberant, powerful, vehement. (Some did not like it precisely because of these characteristics, as he had been a great theater actor, his style of film was considered too theatrical, etc.). His Antoine is a good example of what it means to compose a paper, for a composition. <br /> <br /> Jouvet had a very peculiar physiognomy, very similar to a threatening bird of prey, something like Van Cleef, but much more subtle, nobler and more intelligent and distinguished. Jouvet had this predatory and fierce air, and it's useful here, as he performs an old tough policeman. One of the aspects of QUAY ?? is that it is a recital by Jouvet. He is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his game (I see that many, watching this movie, do not know that it is a Jouvet film, which is an amazing quality in itself). <br /> <br /> Fresnay and Jouvet are the two French actors that I most admire; the first was revealed to me by a drama by Renoir (the famous one), while Jouvet by a comedy by Carn√©. I loved seeing that Clouzot gave leading roles to both. <br /> <br /> Finally, a few words about Steeman; he wrote the novel used by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another Steeman novel, as a comedy by Fresnay). Steeman was a mystery writer of the old school, in the vein of Wallace. It quickly became obsolete with the new hard fashions. When I was 11 years old, I read one of his thrillers and I liked it a lot.
