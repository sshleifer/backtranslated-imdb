I recently rented this video after seeing "Final Ascent" by the same writer. I was not prepared for how intense this movie would be. I found it attractive from beginning to end, and I was encouraging teenagers to get away with it. The ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence, but well done. I highly recommend this photo.
