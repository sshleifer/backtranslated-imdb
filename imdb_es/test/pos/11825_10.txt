The Cure is an outstanding real life drama that deals with a very sensitive topic. It is the story of the deep and dear friendship between two children, Eric and Dexter. The latter has acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion. Therefore, he and his mother (Annabella Sciorra) have become pariahs, rejected by the public and labeled a dangerous company, basically due to a common lack of public knowledge of the disease. <br /> <br /> When Eric (Brad Renfro, known for 'The Client' and 'Apt Pupil') and his mother move into the house next to them, he has to deal with public insults and the fear of contracting AIDS himself. However, Eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. At first he starts talking to Dexter, but finally climbs over the fence and joins the witty boy (played by Joseph Mazzello of Jurassic Park) and his games. Very quickly he develops a true friendship with Dexter, who is delicately built and fragile due to his condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the movie? The theme that makes it omnipresently authentic and tragic at the same time? This is how Eric and Dexter try to find the definitive cure. At first they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves. which is very naive, but also genuine at the same time, since it shows how young children face such atrocious illnesses and how firmly they still believe in the magic of the world. When they hear about a supposed cure that has developed in the South, they do not hesitate and leave for an adventure that will bring them closer and symbolizes the maximum search for hope. <br /> <br /> So get on a raft and head south on the Mississippi River. What begins as a true adventure becomes a dangerous enterprise, which is emotionally intriguing and instructive at the same time. The scene in which Dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, Eric gives him his sneaker, a symbol that wherever the child should go, Eric is and always will be with the; You will never have to be alone. This sequence, which is one of the most convincing of the film, presents a very convincing interaction between the two actors, who manage to avoid cutesy and uncomfortable dialogues and offer a very genuine interpretation that finally breaks in tenderness and honesty. <br /> <br /> I will not go any further when outlining the plot, since I do not intend to give too much information. However, the end is emotionally difficult and makes the audience part of the tragedy, so that everyone who sees the film will feel personally affected. This aspect makes this film so strong, so outstanding and so compelling. The emotional charge of each character is so real and so hectic that even the toughest members of the audience may need some handkerchiefs. <br /> <br /> A 10 does justice to this movie and it is not a rating too high. There is almost no other movie I have seen in my life that manages such an emotional problem with such wit and sensitivity. It is the story of how two children enrich each other's lives and how lessons of life are taught. Thus, Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and Eric learns what really counts in life; and both realize how great the gift of real friendship is when it comes to the most difficult moments of life. <br /> <br /> Is this movie tragic? But his message is pure inspiration.
