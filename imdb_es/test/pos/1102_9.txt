I saw this movie through one of the actors' agents, and it surely fits a lot of what comes from Sth. Australia in terms of the * general tone, * which is just dark and in a bad mood. <br /> <br /> I thought the little boy in the movie was excellent. Most children's actors are * harassed * and embarrassing, but not in this case. It was really very good. In terms of * surrealism * mentioned by Jingo, well, I think this movie is just "weird". It's a real weird movie, with strange locations, history, weird things that happen all the time. But "good" is strange instead of "bad". <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of other similar films, but it does not look at all like CARS ATE Paris, maybe more like a REPULSION, but actually I think more like a Hammer movie of the 60s. Certainly He has an interesting mind that works behind her. <br /> <br /> JINGO, My question is also about the title. Why modern love? No one? Also, Jingo, what did you mean by "god abandoned" when you were talking about Australia, mmm? Just curious
