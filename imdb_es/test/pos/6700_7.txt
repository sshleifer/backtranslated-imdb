Lifeforce is undoubtedly one of the best films of Tobe Hooper. It has some great special effects and a lot of nudity, so it seems like a typical horror fan's dream. However, the film is quite creative and I think that is due to the script of Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. A good photograph and a good chilling atmosphere make it a solid film.
