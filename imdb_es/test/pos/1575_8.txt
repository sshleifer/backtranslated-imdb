"What Alice found" was a pleasant discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, this is a combination of a road movie with a warning story, as well as a voyage of discovery. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, maybe you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Alice is a case study of a young woman who wants to break up with the unhappy life she leads in a New England city. Her pretext for leaving is to join her best friend, who is studying at a university in Miami. Alice is the product of the house of a single mother, who struggles to survive, in stark contrast to the ease with which her friend seems to live. In flashbacks, we can see Alice's life before hitting the road. <br /> <br /> Like her namesake in "Alice in Wonderland," she embarks on a journey into the unknown for which life has not prepared her. The roads of America are full of predators in search of the weak and innocent. Alice encounters disaster when her car breaks down on the road and a friendly couple from the south help her when a strange man approaches the darkness with the excuse that he wants to help her. Sandra and Bill convince her to come with her luxurious R.V. on its way to the south. <br /> <br /> Nothing has prepared Alice for what this couple turns out to be. After all, in her protected life, she has not taken care of what Sandra and Bill, her new benefactors do during overnight stays at rest stops on American roads. It is a shock for her to realize that the kind Sandra is nothing more than a prostitute who handles her trade among the population of trucks found in those places. <br /> <br /> Alice, played brilliantly by Emily Grace, is a study of how the young girl awakens to the new reality from which she can not escape. In fact, Sandra makes it seem so easy for Alice to try her luck in the oldest profession in the world to raise money that is urgently needed. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey has a tremendous performance as Sandra. Ms. Ivey is perfect as a seemingly normal woman, one she would not suspect is making the unpleasant with the clients that she and Bill find along the traveling route. Mrs. Ivey is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an accusing Alice. Like the husband, Bill Raymond is good at representing him as the husband, who is actually a solicitor. <br /> <br /> Under the excellent direction of Mr. Dean Bell, the film is not afraid to go to the main places. Movies do not dare to go. Congratulations to this director who has written a plausible story and has assembled the perfect cast to interpret it to our benefit.
