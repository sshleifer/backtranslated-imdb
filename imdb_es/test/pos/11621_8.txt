The film "... And the Earth did not swallow it", based on the book by Tomas Rivera, is a revealing film for most people. It speaks of the exploitation that migrant farm workers go through in order to survive. <br /> <br /> Sergio PÃ©rez uses impressionist techniques to represent Rivera's story. Use sienna and grayscale effects to represent some of the scenes, and use specific photographic techniques to make them look as they did in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Perez also brings the movie to life by using appropriate music for the time, including ballads and playing the guitar. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie to watch because it shows in detail how migrant farm workers live, what they do for fun and their beliefs.
