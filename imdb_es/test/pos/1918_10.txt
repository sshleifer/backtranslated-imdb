Well done documentary about a sailing career, sanity and the loss of both. <br /> <br /> I remembered reading Sir Francis Chichester's story about his trip around the world when he was in high school while watching this movie. What adventure was that. <br /> <br /> Deep water tells an equally fascinating story. <br /> <br /> You need a special person and an excellent navigator to make a nonstop trip around the world ... alone. <br /> <br /> this movie does a great job to prove it. <br /> <br /> I love surfing, and my brother competes in J-30. <br /> <br /> but I could never achieve such a feat.
