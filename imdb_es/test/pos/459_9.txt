"The trip" is a romantic version of the Cold War. This is an English woman (Deborah Kerr) who tries to smuggle her old love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.), from Hungary during the Hungarian revolt in 1956. She is on board a bus with other thirteen international people who are trying to leave Hungary through the border with Austria. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Russians stop the bus for a security check. The Russian officer in charge (Yul Brynner) is attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr) and delays the trip. Of course, the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist posing as a British citizen, but decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the English scientist to come to him. Of course, all this sounds absurd, but it's a fun movie to watch. Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr. Brynner and Mrs. Kerr, which seems inappropriate in the situation in which they find themselves, the film becomes suspenseful and interesting. Good acting nullifies part of silly dialogue. Maybe some people involved in the Hungarian revolt would not appreciate this movie; They would consider it a piece of fluff. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite role of Yul Brynner. He speaks with his own male voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is the second time that Deborah Kerr has worked with Yul Brynner since they created "The King and I" in 1956. They are a very attractive couple. Too bad they never worked again. This was the second sexy role that Ms. Kerr took from "From Here to Eternity". Even though Ms. Kerr wore heavy winter clothes throughout the film, she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast was led by Jason Robards, Jr., in his first film role. Part of the international cast was recognizable, such as Robert Morley of England. However, the rest of the actors, which I have never seen before or since, were great in the movie. In the background, it was fun to see Senta Berger, as one of the maids, speak some lines of Hungarian. A few years later, in 1966, she was in a movie, "Cast a Giant Shadow," with Yul Brynner as her protagonist. She is still working today.
