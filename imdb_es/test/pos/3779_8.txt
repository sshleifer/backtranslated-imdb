Chaplin is a doughboy in his last film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the straight down gear. Spend time "there" in the trenches of the First World War. Several gags stand out: the Limburger cheese as an improvised pomegranate for one. They emphasize the reduced quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his companions are dragged from their bunks by floods. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers with one hand, and lashes the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them. Chaplin hides behind the enemy lines like a tree of all things, and those scenes are very funny. He escapes to a bombed house where he meets a French girl played by Edna Purviance. He is tracked down by German soldiers, escapes from them again, and Purviance is arrested for assisting him. Chaplin is able to throw a quick one by striking a soldier and wearing the soldier's uniform. He ends up saving Purviance of course and capturing the Kaiser in the process. Along the way, Chaplin employs visual gags and slapstick to push back the German soldiers. With this film, Chaplin explored the possibilities of location in the film and at the same time kept the attention of the audience for a longer time, something that his contract with Mutual Film Corporation rejected him. The film also allowed him to make fun of the enemy, something that he would do with greater effect in The Great Dictator. *** of 4 stars.
