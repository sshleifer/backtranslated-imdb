I entered a screening of "SISTER HELEN" at the Sundance Film Festival and did not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> The people in this documentary captivated me. Sister Helen is an amazing character !!! The filmmakers captured the essence of Sister Helen's incredible soul and took me to an unknown world. I was completely satisfied with the trip and I was surprised by the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie speaks to those who want a second chance in life.
