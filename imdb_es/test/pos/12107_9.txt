This film offers you a fascinating journey through one of the most exciting cities of today, Istanbul, and its musicians. Do not expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or something like that. Alexander Hacke, a German musician and member of the cult band "Einst√ºrzende Neubauten" travels to Istanbul to learn about the music scene. His scant voice about what he experiences is a guiding line through the film. But the mainly German-Turkish director Faith Akin allows several artists from Istanbul to speak, and of course their music. <br /> <br /> You come across a variety of personalities, big stars and street musicians, young and old, people who play many different musical styles. But this movie not only presents you with the sound of Istanbul. It also presents a compelling picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has advanced in the last decade. The film characterizes its protagonists with subtle humor, but never without respect. They all share a passion for music and a belief in their power. <br /> <br /> Akin again shows his talent for portraying diversity with joy when he brings you to completely different musical scenes. After her award-winning feature film "Gegen die Wand" (Head on), Faith Akin tries out "Crossing the Bridge" that can play, entertain and guide her audience in a documentary. If you have never been to Istanbul, you will want to go there after having seen the movie.
