Who does not love the muppets? It is impossible to see them without having some kind of warm and diffuse feeling inside them. So, I guess the important thing is that this movie seems to capture with great success what makes the muppets so special. I do not remember much about the details of the plot, but I remember fondly the various moments and characters of the film. In fact, there was a rather nostalgic atmosphere throughout the film, but without being shy in any way. Refreshing for someone who is possibly too obsessed with details and technique; The "magic" transcends all those other things. 'That's what the movies are made of. <br /> <br /> So, how does the movie achieve these things? Hmmm, good question! I am perplexed? Let's see. Actually, I feel that it is quite simple. The filmmakers believe in their material and do not take themselves too seriously in the process. Probably I would not say that the film has many truly inspired moments, but it has a certain life (of what, curiously, many "real people" films lack). An enthusiasm You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence about them, which makes them even more attractive. <br /> <br /> In general, I have the impression that the people who made the film were simply not afraid to try what they thought was right in the Time that gives it all quite a loose feeling. Something like a extended jazz session really accessible and enjoyable. A lot of talent, little predictability and a lot of warm personalities that come through. Cameos were, of course, a lot of pleasant surprises, for example. Maybe I do not have much to say about it because I was half asleep when I saw it (and / or while writing this review). Anyway, here I am almost repeated, but I really liked the feeling of family that had the movie. Full of love, I suppose you could say. Once again, a sense of nostalgia comes to mind that many films do not achieve with such efficiency or effort. <br /> <br /> And to repeat one more time, one of the best charms of the film is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like Nathaniel Hawthorne's quote that happiness is (like) a butterfly, the Muppet movie is very successful in part apparently not trying to do it. The same thing is that beauty is better without discovering or intact or without forcing or something like that. Anyway, if that sounds boring, I also think it was pretty hilarious. <br /> <br /> So, in general, this movie was very funny, touching and difficult to not smile. In addition, it has a lot of good music! Highly recommended for all humans, both young and young at heart.
