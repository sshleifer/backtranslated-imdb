Sometimes it is difficult to see those self-proclaimed "message films" from a previous era, apparently simpler, without a certain degree of cynicism. The issue of racism and religious tolerance has been introduced to us from an early age and, as we grow up, teachers and authority figures have sought less obvious but equally effective means to convey the message. 'The House I Live In (1945)' is as subtle as "message films," and Frank Sinatra seems to be treating his audience like a child. in fact, perhaps this was the point, since the short film was undoubtedly intended primarily to influence young viewers. Even so, I found myself curiously affected when Sinatra launched into that sincere patriotic speech about what it really means to be an American. And I'm not even American! Launched two months after the end of World War II, director Mervyn LeRoy greeted the weary audiences of the war with a message of tolerance, unity and, above all, hope. Music is not bad either. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra with a fresh face? Already a star, but not yet the superstar he would become? opens the film in a recording studio, releasing "If you're a dream" with a full orchestral accompaniment. When, between songs, Frank goes out to smoke a cigarette, he observes a large group of children harassing a young Jewish man, provoking his teasing solely because of their different religion. Ol 'Blue Eyes quickly stops this childish behavior, delicately marking the thugs "Nazi werewolves" and scolding their irrational prejudices. Then, with seriousness and good will, he lectured the group about the simple stupidity of racial and religious discrimination, assuring them that each American culture, however, differs from ours, is it still American at heart? Unless, of course, you're one of those damn "Japanese." There is a hint of hypocrisy in begging for racial tolerance when presenting a nation as the collective enemy, although I could hardly blame Hollywood for being less enthusiastic about the plight of the Japanese in 1945. <br /> <br / > Sinatra drives home with a wonderful and comforting interpretation of "The House I Live In", which was written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. When the composer heard the song for the first time in the film, he was furious that the filmmakers had completely excluded three of his verses, which he considered crucial to the message. Most likely, these omissions were due to time constraints, but Meeropol, understandably, did not take them very kindly and, apparently, had to be expelled from the cinema. When it was first released, 'The House I Live In' was considered such an important short film that it won a Golden Globe for "Best Film for Promoting International Goodwill" and an Honorary Oscar for all involved. In 2007, it was considered "culturally, historically or aesthetically important" and was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, which is how I got to know it. While his approach may seem a bit hokey sixty years later, this film remains quite visible thanks to a young man named Frank Sinatra.
