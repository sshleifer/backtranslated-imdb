Now, I have seen many B-grade movies in my 15 years of life, and I must say that this was one of the best. Personally I enjoyed the real estate and the history, but suffered the performance of amateurs (although Adrienne Barbeau gave a decent performance as Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms could not keep his part well enough to be considered good. The other performance that really adjusted to the movie was that of Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). Start with an anxious real estate agent leading an Asian couple through a house, only to discover that there is a dead girl in the shower in the showcase. Progress with the speculation of the detective and introduce the key characters with reasonable grace. I think that for anyone who laughs ravenously at the exaggerated drama that real estate agents give victims during the bloody exaggerated scenes, this really is a gem ... XD Who am I cheating? It's not so good, but it's worth seeing if you're bored.
