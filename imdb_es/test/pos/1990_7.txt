An absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. This film takes it deliberately through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about what layer of virtual reality it is in, which creates an ontological confusion for the viewer to reflect on. <br /> <br /> It can also be seen as a satire of video games, although the whole movie can fall into the fallacy of the imitative form here. He seems unable to escape from the genre of video games he imitates; thus satire becomes problematic. <br /> <br /> However, a series of interesting ideas intersect: the biological mutant is one; the interface of technology and biology, the cyborg's drive to transcend reality and philosophical allusions such as Heidegger's title, along with existential questions: that is, the characters in the game are partially written or determined and yet, in Free part to change their destiny, and wonder how strange it feels in the game. A character then notices that this existential confusion is like real life, erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real. Similarly, with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble in a world where you do not know what will happen next and you are not sure how to play, since you have to stumble only to discover the objective and the unknown rules. A virtual game within the game is titled "TranscendenZ". Also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. Even heroes at all levels of ontological existence are confused about violence. They do not like it, but it's exciting and part of the "game", which they fear is real. <br /> <br /> The creator of the game, the god of the system, is killed at the end; however, that same scenario is presented in direct parallel to a video game that we have just witnessed, and viewers believe that it is still only a part of virtual reality. In the end, the film does not solve the doubt about whether this is "real" or not, but the point is clear (for me anyway). Existenz means Da-sein: You are there. You are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries in each level. Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. And their common motives of play express, as a real road to the unconscious, our own fascination with violence. <br /> <br /> However, while Cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he claims that it is very much against the "Reality ... {underground name of the terrorist group} portrayed in the film so much in the game as in the 'real' level ". It seems that Cronenberg himself did not think much about the film, despite his impressive education. The interview in Cineaste gives the impression of an intellectual of medium brows who is trying to be avant-garde by inclination. Cronenberg is simply on the side of the free imagination, the clich√© bourgeois modernist creed, despite the ambivalence recognized there. (My impression here could be due to a limited interview). However, Cronenburg seems to ignore the fact that his film betrays the fallacy of the imitative form (here he imitates computer games while making a satirical critique of them, but a critique that can not "transcend" the same way) probably because he really does he thinks he is "imaginative" and radical. However, the imaginative world of the film is less bearable, and more jejune, than our own real world. It is caught in the world view of the computer game.
