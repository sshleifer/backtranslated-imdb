This is a jewel of a movie, Slapstick violent a-plenty, Simon Pegg and Green Spew. <br /> <br /> A suspicious-looking power plant and an uncontrollable motorcycle are added to this stoning. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, I recommend it, maybe it's not as good as the background but not too short. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks, then what are you waiting to buy this movie? <br /> <br /> I did not even see the turn at the end when it turned out that Ritchie and Eddie are both ghosts. <br /> <br /> Feeb - 1 boiled egg.
