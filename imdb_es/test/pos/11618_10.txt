I finally saw this shocking movie last night, and what a disturbing mind is ker, and incredibly bloody and some unforgettable scenes, and a total assault on the senses. It looks like a movie from Lynch's mind (specifically ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit, and even a little "Begotten." What this guy does to his pregnant sister is out of what you can believe, but again, did it really happen or is the left and right side of his brain struggling? That is the main theme of this work of art, to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality, and what would happen if the right side of the dreaming and fantasizing brain overcomes reasoning and the left logical side. And the music in this movie is amazing, a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Even though this movie is totally shocking and quite disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard sex) that you will see in any movie, I saw it as a work of art and I loved it. And that music still surprises me, I have to try to find the soundtrack if it's available. See "Subliminal cruelty" is a real event, and it is not something that the viewer can easily forget. And a note for the gorehounds, this is something you should have. <br /> <br /> Warning ... Be careful when buying this movie, as some prints have a fogging in the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore, especially copies of the Japanese release.
