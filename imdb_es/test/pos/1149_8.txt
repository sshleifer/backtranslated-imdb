In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, at the beginning of the 20th century, the Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), his son and his daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as a ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In times of election, US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him out of prison with the American soldiers. I do not like movies about explicit colonialism and lack of respect for the sovereignty of other countries, but 'The Lion and the Wind' is a great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress of the 70s, is wonderful, playing a woman kidnapped as in the extraordinary movie "Soldier Blue". Sean Connery is perfect, as always, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. Brian Keith is great as the American president. I do not know much about the history of Morocco to analyze if there is any truth in this story, but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment. In Brazil, it is only available on VHS. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `O Vento e o Le√£o '(` The lion and the wind') <br /> <br />
