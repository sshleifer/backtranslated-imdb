This film is a brilliant account of Shakespeare's classic love story, complete with "perverted sex, body piercing and dismemberment." Follow the same spirit as all the other Troma movies [except Combat Shock ... That fool was depressing] but it's not just for Troma fans. Anyone who appreciates low-profile visuals and a hilarious script will surely fall in love with this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect pretentious shit, with artistic aspirations like the R & J version with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio; she knows that it is a silly movie and extracts her humor from that. The performance is also surprisingly good, and you can feel the pain of Sammy Capulet when he tries to put his brain back into his head. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, which contains many original and high-energy bands like The Wesley Willis Fiasco, Supernova and The Meatmen also has four stars. This film must be seen by all, since it remains true to the original story and, at the same time, is full of the gore / sex humor of Troma's trademark.
