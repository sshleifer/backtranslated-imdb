As much as I hated to disagree with the original poster, I found Asterix and the Vikings quite well, and a BIG step over previous attempts to cheer everyone's favorite Gaul. The series would be difficult to follow, but for those of us who know it, it is a pleasure to watch it. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is far superior to the previous adaptations of comics. It can be said that they took the time and effort to really recover the appearance of the comics on this occasion. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the movie and I can see how the fans Some of those titles may feel confused or a little disappointed, but I was so caught up in really seeing one of those my favorite childhood comics faithfully represented on the screen, any doubt I had was minor in comparison. The smaller spoilers continue ... <br /> <br /> Asterix and his faithful friend Obelix travel north to rescue the nephew of the chief of his village, who has been captured by the Vikings. The Vikings think that, if the child teaches them about fear, they can fly, thanks to a poorly written advice from the druid of their village. In the process, the boy meets the daughter of Viking Chief, Abba, and they fall in love, etc., etc. So, if my explanation seems complicated, do not worry ... The plot is easy to follow! It is definitely a good purchase. You can buy this DVD through Amazon France, but be careful. Probably your DVD player will not be able to play it. I had to change the locale on my computer to see it.
