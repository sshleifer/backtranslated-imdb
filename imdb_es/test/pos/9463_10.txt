OK, now at first I thought it was going to be another corny romantic comedy, which was contained in the comedy but this was not the case. I mean, how could it have been with the fabulous Amanda Bynes watching her? She was amazing, very funny and still awesome! The boys were also in very good shape, one of the main reasons to be girls! The plot is based largely on Shakespeare's play 'Twelfth Night', since it was extremely similar, there was even a spider called malvolio, which belonged to the character Malvolio type. The script was very well written and put together and it was very clever. The soccer skills were also incredible, they even made me think about playing soccer myself! Anyway, to summarize, this is a happy movie about young romance, which becomes very confusing! Go and see it!
