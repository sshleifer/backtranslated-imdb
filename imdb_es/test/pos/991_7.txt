Since Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry, I expected a film that was prone to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary, the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a liar and hypocrite and maybe a coward. Of course, it could be argued that all those things are an advantage when someone is an artist and especially a poet, since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality, but I do not think that a positive model can cut back. above such a set of personality traits. Either way, I found the other male hero in the story, Captain Cillic, a more endearing character. The two female roles were played by actresses Knigtley and Miller, and they were truly delightful, especially when she performed songs with a thin outfit to inspire Londoners bombed during World War II. Another positive point is the role played by sexual jealousy even in relatively progressive environments that think that the old conventions can easily be overcome. The atmosphere of the Blitz was also convincing, as well as the portrayal of the different perspectives among people who have experienced war, unlike those who talk about it, theorize about possible political outcomes. I think one would recommend a movie like this.
