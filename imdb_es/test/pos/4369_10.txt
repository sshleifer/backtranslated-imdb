I just saw this delicious classic again after many years, the next to the last film directed by Henry Cornelius, who died three years later at the age of only 45 years old (the same age as the male protagonist of the film, Larry Harvey, he was also going to die in 1973). Three future directors were part of the team: Jack Clayton (Associate Producer), Guy Green (director of photography) and Clive Donner (editor). This film is based on the autobiographical story "Goodbye to Berlin" by well-known British author Christopher Isherwood, which first became a work by John van Druten, then became this film and then became a musical, 'Cabaret'. , and finally filmed as 'Cabaret', which brought the incredible Liza Minelli to world attention, with her voice that can break a glass at a distance of one mile. Isherwood appears as a character in the film under his own name. He was gay, but in those days that was illegal and could take him to prison, so he disguises his inclinations under the description of what he calls "a confirmed bachelor." This is the key to his platonic relationship with the tremendously eccentric, crazy, promiscuous, always cheerful and completely unique character whom he calls Sally Bowles. The portrait of Sally Bowles in this film is a tour of the young Julie Harris, who drags each scene in a magical and captivating network of brilliant personal charm. What a vehicle for an actress with a lot of charm! It is one of the great cinematographic performances of the fifties. Isherwood is played to perfection by the young Lawrence Harvey, in a well-judged performance that never allows comedy to go beyond the limit, and even the moments of farce that border the slapstick are still "almost credible." Larry is very funny when portraying a weak hypochondriac. What irony, considering the total lack of hypochondria demonstrated by his bravery and stoicism in the last year of his life, since he died of terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaint. I knew him well in the last three years, and he was a generous, warm and modest person. He adored his daughter Domino, who is now tragically dead as well. This film was his best early acting, followed by his spectacular work in 'Room at the Top' (1959), 'Summer and Smoke' (1961) and 'The Candidate of Manchuria' (1962). Larry was often undervalued in his life because he was too handsome, he was often chosen as a cad, and glamor guys are not always accepted as good actors, but many of the best actresses played in front of him, and they had no doubt of your abilities. , and was a strong leader in many of the most important films of his time. If he had lived beyond middle age, he would have grown stronger and become the "great old man" on the screen. One day, sitting in his house in Hampstead, he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel he had brought from a foreign warehouse. I told him that he always gave me such delicious wine, what was it? He answered with pride that it was a Sancerre that he himself had chosen in the vineyard in France and had sent specially. Then he added with extreme longing: "You know, I've been waiting for four years for someone to comment on it and ask me what it is, and you're the first person who has done it." What mattered was being recognized for tasting wine, and his most glamorous friends had denied him that satisfaction. In this film, Anton Diffring offers a touching early performance as a serious young man (later he had to play with Nazi officers too, poor), and the young Shelley Winters plays a rich German Jewish girl, in her usual loud but effective way , but it was not too difficult, since she was also a noisy Jewish girl. This film has such an air of joie de vivre, which is pure delight.
