I really think that this movie deserves some Oscars! I really do not care what people may say badly about this movie ... because it's a very well-played part of Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci! I'm a big fan of her, since I saw her in the Addams Family ... I've been trying to see all the things she does, and this is one of the best parts she played! I love her appearance (even though people say she is not pretty ... I think she is ... and I love her eyes) !! The film is about many things ... people say it's religious ... people say it's about racism ... people say it's about drugs ... people say it's about nymphomania .. Well ... maybe it's A bit of all that! But what I really feel is that this film has a high level of eye opening for what the blues is ... what it means ... and mainly where it comes from: life ... the heart ... the pain ... pain ... and above all ... spontaneous feelings !! I hope you can see it ... if you are that kind of person who likes a movie, not only because of the images or the story that counts ... this is a good movie to watch ... if you are not ... Well ... see it anyway ... I can not hurt myself so much, and you can see Christina Ricci acting so horny! She is a fox!
