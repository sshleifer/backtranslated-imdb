I came across this movie by chance. I was traveling a few years ago and a movie was on a cable channel at the hotel one night. Not much more and I thought I looked at it for about 20 to 30 minutes until I decided to go to bed. Needless to say, I stayed awake and saw the whole movie. The plot was very interesting and makes you wonder if there were no SS that did this or at least thought of doing it. I've been looking everywhere for this movie. I even sent an email to the production company, but I was not sure I would ever get to DVD, but I said there was always hope. If someone finds this movie, drop a note here where you found it, since I would like to get a copy someday.
