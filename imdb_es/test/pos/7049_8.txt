I know it was a silly movie, but I enjoyed it immensely. It is one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says "Bill Murray". I almost always like movies that involve the weakest, and this movie has more losers than you can count on. In general, it's a kind movie: some of the adults are not tightly wrapped, but the laugh is accepting instead of being brutal like so many movies for teenagers these days. The rich children on the other side of the lake are beaten, but nobody I know cares. I never went to the camp, but I did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the "bits" and tricks were true. They were even underestimated at times, but I'm sure it was an accident. The cast performed well, with Bill Murray showing signs of what he would become. It's not Groundhog Day or Broken Flowers, but, hey, a good silly laugh should be appreciated these days, but then ... it just does not matter ............... .. ..............
