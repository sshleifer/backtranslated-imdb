Yes, let's get this out of the way before we start: * This is what Sean Connery came back to in 1983 after the season we had with Roger Moore. * It's the latest Connery movie. * AND YES it is a (type) remake of Thunderball, but more of a film inspired by it. If all Bond purists think I'm going to be controversial, they're right. Bond is one of the best series of films in history, but that does not mean that a series should continue forever. I think this is one of the two movies in which they could have done themselves a great favor and finished the Bond saga. Not offended yet? Then I'll continue ... Hey, if you're thinking I'm indifferent about Bond movies, you're wrong. I grew up with my mother being OBLIGED with them. At any time free, Bond and his antics would be on television. The rules of Bond and 'Never Say Never Again' (directed by Irvin 'Empire Strikes Back' Kershner) is one of the best. It may not be 'Goldfinger' or 'From Russia ...' and it may not have been done by the same production house as all the others (what I hear is why they refuse to accept that it has ever been done !? ), but still head and shoulders above the recent departures of Brosnan ... (if you have not spit on the screen, read on). CHARACTERIZATION!!!!! Something like this is forgotten by many box office successes, but something that is essential to tell a good story. 'Never' played a superb hand in treating 007 as if he had been aging since 'Dr. Do not'. He's "getting a little" and that's why he has to do things like go to a health farm, a direct order of 'M' (!). Yes, if you have not seen this movie, I will not give too much to the plot because A) Loads happen and B) Obviously, I want you to see it for yourself. Do not be discouraged by the revelation of my 'old Bond', Connery still has a lot of great pieces to load, swim, hit, accelerate, crush and break through. Man is a legend, and this movie is one of his nicest outings as Bond. High-tech gizmos in abundance, some great villains and an excellent cast of support (including a fantastic cameo by Rowan Atkinson) elevate this film above the expectations of the audience. <br /> <br /> This could have been the last Bond movie in history, and it would have been a party to remember. Playing the secret agent as someone close to retirement was a refreshing blow of genius: the last scene holds things perfectly for the series ... ... but we still had more, and then more, and more, and a more Moore . However, if you like to discover what "Fatima Blush" is all about, get this movie. Then, at least you can pretend that 007 spent his last moments as a secret joke agent, in the arms of Kim Basinger, and smiling at Mr. Bean. (P.S. * That other movie that I think could have finished everything? The license 'Kill to kill'
