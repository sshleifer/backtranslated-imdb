If you like horror or action, watch this movie as soon as possible. If the opening scene does not make the adrenaline pumping, then someone should check your pulse. Great action, excellent casting and top-liners. This is the only movie I've seen in a movie theater where the crowd applauded every blow, kick and blow. Not perfection, but who cares when movies can be so fun. It is a pure race of dark comics. 9/10
