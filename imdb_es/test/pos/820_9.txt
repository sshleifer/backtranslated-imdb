When I first heard about this image, it was only called "Shepherd" and it was supposed to be the movie that would put JCVD ​​back into the possibilities of theater theater. I was very excited about the whole article. <br /> <br /> At the time it was titled "The Shepherd: Border Patrol", I was excited about this movie. With Isaac Fluorentine at the head of the management, and JJ Perry managing the coordination, I almost peed my pants in advance. JCVD photos were posted kicking 8 different types of ass, as well as Scott Adkins playing what I thought was the villain, and he was full of emotion. I thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuade. <br /> <br /> Then it came out. I ordered it from Blockbuster online for $ 20 and was ready for anything. The reviews of vandammefan.net altered my ideas a bit, but I prepared myself. The mail arrived on day 4 and I opened the package. My initial plan was to run upstairs, tear off the face of the cardboard packaging and then break the case with the proper dynamics so that the disc would fall on my DVD player. However, I watched the case for 10 minutes, then placed the disc in my player and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> By the time he finished, he was great as a fool in the pool. The Shepherd is undoubtedly one of my favorite direct-video movies of all time and makes Derailed look even more like the toilet mess it is. Sure, some of the fights were a bit short, but they were still VERY impressive. The shootings were excellent, as was Scott Adkins, who SHOULD have been the villain, unlike the forgetful Steven Lord. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. Seriously.
