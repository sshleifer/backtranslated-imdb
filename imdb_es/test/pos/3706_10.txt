The mother really should be given a different title to distinguish her from all the other movies called mom or with the word mom in the title. <br /> <br /> This is a zombie movie far superior to much of the garbage. that is shaken again and again and they all end in the same way as all the other zombie movies that exist. <br /> <br /> It's so different and refreshing that it almost defies categorization. <br /> <br /> The kind old woman who takes a spooky tenant, who turns out to be a person who eats meat, who then infects the old woman who also becomes a zombie who eats meat, or ghoul, who is not defined exactly. <br /> <br /> There is a pathos in the story when her son realizes what he has become and, although at first he is horrified, tries to help her by supplying "food". (I will not say anything else about that, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) It's one of those "quiet" movies instead of gunshots, furious explosions, car chases, etc. boring, etc. that make many movies the same. , but still with enough bloody moments to satisfy the fans of horror, while sadness is inserted into the story, along with nice touches of humor instead of the simple stupidity of some of the so-called "horror" movies. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly pleasant atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree in company and she looks so "innocent", but, in that transforms! Oh my! <br /> <br /> A jewel of a movie and even if it's not your thing, at least it should only be seen once by any true horror fan.
