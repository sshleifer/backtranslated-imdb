This show is amazing! I love all the actors! It has great lines of history and characters. It is the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have a great dialogue. Both can be very funny. I miss Vanessa Marcil in the General Hospital, but she's great here. James Lesure is great! He can be hilarious. Molly Sims plays a fool very well. The writing is awesome! They maintain an excellent rhythm. The program can really leave you hanging, which is one of my favorite elements of a program. I can not wait until the new season starts. This show reaches the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show stays for a long time. If people know what is good, they will do it. I never want the show to end. Forever.
