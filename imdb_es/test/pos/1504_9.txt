This is an interesting movie. I think it's very funny, although the humor is very black. Fulci is good and funny acting himself, it's a really funny and really crazy "self-portrait" of an artist ("I make horror movies, if I made love movies, nobody would buy tickets ..."). And it is also a VERY ATTRACTIVE film: almost all the time there is some "action" or tension; and many attractive girls / women ... Maybe it's the essence of why someone starts making movies / art in the first place ... It's a true psychedelic trip, maybe better seen a little drunk or a similar mood. There are also some really nasty gore scenes, of course, because it's Lucio Fulci. In fact, some of those scenes are quite unpleasant. Anyway, it's one of the three best Fulci movies I've seen (the others are House By The Cemetery & Zombie, I have not seen The Beyond). Actually, the script is above all, in my opinion, quite ingenious. I could see this film as a portrait of an extreme neurotic, or a person suffering from an obsessive-compulsive disorder (buzzwords): the character has a compulsive need to confess "crimes" or bad thoughts; Especially the crimes he has not even done. And he asks himself all the time: What if I DO IT? And if I want to do it? I have done? I want to do it? He overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts. I'm sure Fulci has been interested in psychology, and maybe even read something in the area; In his movie "House By The Cemetery", for example, there is a character called Freudstein. This is perhaps the most concentrated and frankly personal film that Fulci made. I also like the simplicity of photography / images in this movie. The only thing that bothers me a little is sadism, especially towards women; I do not understand very well why? Is it entertainment? It's art? Is it horror? Anyway and in general, this is a really interesting and well made movie, definitely recommended classic movie at least for fans or anyone interested in this genre. For others it may be too much.
