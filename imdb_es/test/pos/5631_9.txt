I rented this movie for two reasons. The first was all the good things I read about it. It definitely impressed me, and I could not agree more with all the reviews I read. The second reason is because I know these guys. I do not know Mark as well as I do Mike. It has not changed much since the years we met. I know him as "the harvester" of a local radio station in Milwaukee (WMSE). The way he is in this movie is really Mike 100%. He once gave me a table he made. It was a small one, about 15 "tall, the one that Metallica said, the strange thing was that he only had two legs, sometimes what counts is the thought, and Mike has always thought of the others first.
