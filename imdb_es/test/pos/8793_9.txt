Well, I should say, "the only movie related to the club / dj / electronic music and compliments ... that devours the respect". <br /> <br /> Seriously now. It's a gloriously funny, fast-paced and fairly accurate representation of a raver's night. Although he's in a club, he's in Wales and it's kind of outdated. The film omits some of the most sketched elements of club life, but does not disassociate itself from them completely. It presents an idyllic but serious description of the ups and downs of the lives of the characters. <br /> <br /> At the core of the film, and the best element of Justin Kerrigan's script, are the characters, eccentric, unique but completely complete. understandable and accessible. This simple movie would not work and would be infinitely less entertaining if it were not for Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Spectators can deny the political and social implications of Human Traffic's subtext as a drug film, Trainspotting wannabe, an important link in British youth culture around the 1990s, BUT ... they can not deny that these are attractive characters. <Br /> <br /> He's frantic, brutally honest, sober, exaggerated, but it's a great comedy. <br /> <br /> Praise is a complex thing, so are the drugs that are taken in these events, as well as the people you will meet. But from someone who has gone to parties, he has gotten tired and is still leaving ... Human Traffic is the best snapshot that can be taken of the subculture. Just do what you do, avoid "Groove" because it is the antithesis of everything that is good about human trafficking.
