When a saboteur exploits a controversial government research laboratory, two experimental animals are released in a small community in Washington state. One is a dog with unusual intelligence. The other is an "external eXperimental COmbat Mammal", or "OXCOM". Due to reasons disclosed in the film, oxcom hates the dog and therefore tries to kill him. Observers refer to the accidental participation of Travis Cornell (Corey Haim), his mother Nora (Barbara Williams) and his girlfriend Tracey (Lala Sloatman) with the dog and oxcom, as two agents of the National Security Organization, Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and Cliff (Blu Mankuma), locate them. <br /> <br /> Many comments are made that Observers are very different from Dean Koontz's book that serves as the launch pad for the film. This is true. But it should not affect your rating. If you want the book, read the book. Judge the film by its own merits, not by the precision with which it agrees with the book. Bill Freed and Damian Lee, who wrote the script, are as artists as Koontz (that's not a comparison of quality, just a statement that they're all artists). This is the director Jon Hess. His job as a filmmaker is not to slavishly follow the book as if it were a script. They are adapting the book, as artists, to make a unique work of art. It is based on the book. It is not identical to that. You have to loosen your preconceived ideas / expectations when you watch the movie, because you are going to experience a work of art that you are not yet familiar with, even if you have read Koontz's novel. <br /> <br /> So, is Watchers a good movie? It's pretty good, not excellent. Good enough to win a "B" or a 8. Hess starts things off on the right foot with one of the most beautifully filmed explosions I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, he stumbles a bit immediately when we hear a very thick and hierarchical exposition. After that scene, the observers threaten to become a cliché of the movie of the 80s when we meet Travis and Tracey for the first time. <br /> <br /> The tendency to cliché is a continually threatened trend. But it's just a bias. Most of the time, Hess is able to transcend a well-traveled territory with a series of interesting turns: both Travis and Tracey are from single-parent households, with their genres inverted. Both have unique and mature relationships with their parents. While this is a horror movie, an important focus is an intelligent and intelligent canine, and it often feels as much like an adventure movie as horror, a thriller or science fiction, which are all genres that it plays. Hess presents a large number of characters, some do not enter until the end of the game, however, the film is never confusing and no character feels as if he stays in the dust; all the threads are well tied at the end. The structure is also complex, since there are two main villains, the second becomes obviously malicious as the film progresses, until a turn accompanied by brutal violence makes an antagonist clearer. Soon after, Hess gives us a good moment of doubt with the other antagonist. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in my eyes is a dreaded one, common with horror movies since at least the 1980s: the "attack". the scenes are taken too dark, too close, too unfocused, and are edited too easily. This makes it extremely difficult to know what is going on, which destroys most of the tension of the scenes that should be a highlight. Surely, part of Hess's motivation for the style, and this is the typical justification for this problem, was the concern that the creature would be shown as humorous and / or false instead of terrifying and suspicious. From my point of view, presenting the audience with a blurred image is not a satisfactory solution. We can only see the costume / makeup of the creature clearly towards the end of the film. It was well enough done so that the improved and edited attack scenes would have taken the film to at least a 9. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film, Watchers presents a story exciting using intelligent and seductive characters. It is often a game of biting the nails and the horror scenes are wilder than you would expect, if not exactly bloody (although there is a good amount of blood in a couple of scenes). Observers tend to be underestimated due to misconceptions about the film's role when it comes to adapting the literature; do not let it pass or dismiss it summarily based on a misconception.
