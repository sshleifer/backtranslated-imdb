I just finished watching this (last weekend) and I found it absolutely fun, some of the scenes I could not stop laughing! Dennis is incredibly thick at times, and he just says the stupidest things ... but at the same time he's great at impressing his girlfriend (who's arrested anyway). The landscape of the beach is very calm ... until Robbie Coltrane arrives ...! It is not the best movie ever made, but there is certainly something to think about renting a Saturday night when you do not have much else to do (as I did). However, I may have to look for it: I was lucky, since my local video store stores it.
