Like many other commentators here, I went in hoping for some music that would satisfy my curiosity, and I got more than I asked for. I listened and I saw a mixture of music and musicians absolutely powerful, exquisite, sometimes disturbing, sometimes moving, lyrical, sentimental (in the most authentic way) and absolutely surprising. It reminded me of many forms of Indian music (Eastern India), but at the same time it was very different. <br /> <br /> Starting from the first song of Baba Zula to the Kurdish singer Aynur (what a voice!) to Siyasiyabend to the jam session (or 'Jugalbandhi' as we call it in India) in the small Turkish bar Selim Seslar (Great fan now :)), I enjoyed every minute and wished it would not end. <br /> <br /> One of the best music comments I've seen and heard in a long time. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to a CD of the soundtrack and I hope to be able to find it online soon and also for the old and newest albums of Baba Zula. <br /> <br /> A day later, the music is still recorded in my brain and I do not want it to go away. Turkey and specifically Istanbul now seem like such beautiful and exciting places, and I'm going to start saving today to go see it. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin: this is a jewel.
