I see this movie every time it is played on television. A simply brilliant movie. Three men return home from the war and try to return to civil life with great difficulty. The three led opposite lives during the war (the executive banker became an army corporal, a batter became an Air Force captain and the high school soccer hero loses both his arms in battle) and now each one must rebuild his life and connect with a new reality. . The households to which they return, with adult children and independent women workers together with a depressed economy, only contribute to the struggle. However, it is the scenes that are outside the camera and the tacit dialogue that resonates louder. The uncomfortable intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and their struggle to return to their place as leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is fascinated as the beautiful and decorated Captain who fights to keep her life together without the uniform. <br /> <br /> The film is full of honest characters and each one is played by a talented actor. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, was developed in its entirety Another level after watching, "Saving Private Ryan". The reality and the magnitude of what these men lived for love and country ... and obviously did not end in the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is essential for any collection. <Br /> <br />
