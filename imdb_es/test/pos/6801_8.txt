"National Velvet" tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young Englishwoman who dreams of entering to compete with her beloved horse in the prestigious Grand National horse race. The film follows her as she trains her horse with the help of a former rider and the support of her parents. <br /> <br /> While "National Velvet" is a family movie, this fact should not deter anyone who normally sees. Such movies with mockery. The film is, in fact, one that will attract the whole family, not just attentive young people. He even managed to get five Oscar nominations, just a sign of loosening up for a general audience. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere, on the part of Velvet's mother, actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was really excellent on paper, but it's Elizabeth Taylor, 12, who steals the show. She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. Also on board are Oscar winner Donald Crisp as Velvet's father, Mickey Rooney as former jockey My Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of his first film roles) as Velvet's older sister. <br /> <br /> The brilliant technology of Technicolor for an attractive viewing experience while the edition secured the second of the two Oscars of the film. In addition, the film was nominated for its direction (by Clarence Brown), cinematography and art direction. The ten-time Oscar nominee Herbert Stothart is also worthy of mention, although he was not nominated. <br /> <br /> In general, "National Velvet" is a wonderful family movie that deserves a higher rating. I realize that the prospect of watching a movie about a girl and her horse is not going to excite some people, but it is worth taking a risk.
