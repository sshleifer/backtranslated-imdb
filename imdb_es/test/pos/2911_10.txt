The philosophical and meditative tone of this film makes it unique in its class. I would give it 10 stars just for that. That said, however, what struck me with particular force was what I consider, possibly incorrectly, as his Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich mix of color mixtures seemingly based on progressions of highly underestimated Munsell color models and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the film unrealistic for contemporary eyes, but, for me, it is very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself. I think that this film is really unique for this quality, and if not for another reason, a complete and careful digital restoration is gained. Fox, are you listening?
