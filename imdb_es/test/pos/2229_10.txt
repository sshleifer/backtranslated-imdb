Although it is often considered the worst Peter Sellers movie, it is actually an excellent send of corporate medical corruption and abuse of power. Often misunderstood, the film is actually a deviation from the type of film for which Sellers is best known; Satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (from Happy Days and the Karate Kid), but it was marked by the radical, irreverent and total demolition of the medical industry of the time. He was ahead of his time (1972) to take the scandalous path that the team of Monty Python would take at the movies some time later. As such, it was unacceptable to the traditional fan of Peter Sellers, who discovered that the pointy beards in this mood were something they were not used to. Currently, Peter Sellers films are requested by fans, but this effort, Where it hurts ?, has become almost impossible to find by its nature.
