Excellent special effects make this disaster very plausible. One can see that the producers took some trouble to place the screens on the screens of the computers correctly, everything makes it very convincing. The sets are also very authentic. A good selection of music completes the movie very well. <br /> <br /> Acting is good and the presence of David Suchet adds some weight to the cast, of course. Compared to other films of this genre, Flood lives up to the best. Fortunately, the aspect of "human drama" has not been exaggerated, as often happens with this type of film. Human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the real flood scenes. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the film confirms what many of us suspect anyway: meteorologists often do not do it right! :)
