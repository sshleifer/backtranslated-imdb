"The love letter" is a romantic comedy something pleasant, very, very discreet, in which the use of a few correct words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and the longings of the inhabitants of a sleepy city of the sea . <Br /> <br /> It is not for everyone. "The love letter", I feel, benefits from its simple and calm tone. Never intentionally crazy and fake like most romantic comedies is quaint and comfortable. However, for these same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested. <br /> <br /> The cast is good. It's great to see Tom Selleck again, and it's such a little played role. And it's hard to believe that this is the same Kate Capshaw we met 15 years ago in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom." She is quite good here naturally; improving in all the roles I've seen since Indy's nerves got mad. And is it possible that Capshaw is becoming more and more beautiful with age? (What's that for Spielberg ?!) <br /> <br /> It's not much; But after another noisy summer movie season, I'll probably look back with a brief affection for this romance as light as a feather.
