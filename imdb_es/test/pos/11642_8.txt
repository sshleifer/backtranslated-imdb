I just watched this broadcast on Channel 4. Having seen some of the previous comments here, I think I would like to state first of all that I am not in favor of the death penalty. With that out of the way, I expected great things from this movie, but it just did not work. Dead Man Walking is very well done, with good performances throughout the year and a good script. In fact it is difficult to criticize it artistically. However, I felt that even though I tried to face the problems related to capital punishment, the religious / moral position seemed to deviate (not surprising, given that the main character is a nun). Although I am not a person without a heart, I do not really empathize with any of the characters in the story. If you do not take religion seriously, you probably do not see much in this movie. I think Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" was a much more powerful and moving film, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who considers seeing this to go see it.
