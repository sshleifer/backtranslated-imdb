So many great talents were used in "The best years of our life", the result has to be somewhat miraculous. Think about what its director, William Wyler, faced; after a military victory over the statist powers that had committed abominable crimes and enveloped the world in their battles, I was making a film that held that the leaders of the United States were deeply antipersonal, that they had "wasted the best years of" lives of those recruited or tricked into fighting the war, who since then ignored the rights of individuals, were not at all, except the argument about the degree of slavery in which men should exist. "There are beautiful sets by Julia Heron, the cinematography by Gregg Toland and a script by Robert E. Sherwood, author of "The Road to Rome" and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas.The ironic title was used to attract the talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright , Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael in a large-scale but thematic drama. His "partners" after the soldiers (three of whom were prominent) tried to return home in a "culture of victory". His bitter experiences and his realization of his own need to fight back against what was happening in the Homefront poses a solid and serious counterpoint to the conventional idea that "everything was going well with" America. "March and his wife had a great time. Badly adjusting, and he's drinking, O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can be worth it, and worst of all is that Andrews' wife throws him for a man with mass and has lost years, which makes employers ignore or deny their rights to a job, to be considered, their individual merits, even having what they had before they had been ripped from their life and pushed to the risk arena, for nothing and for the loss of everything I had ever had.The climax of the film comes when each of the three has to face the n Eed to fight again, each for his own happiness; and the three manage to find the courage to keep fighting, each for his own happiness, which is now being threatened by a curiously anti-self, indifferent anti-reality in the non-US United States. Wyler's direction, especially from the scene where Andrews sits in the cockpit of a B-17, alone and the scene of Russell's wedding is really wonderful. This is a very powerful and excellent film on its own terms, a woman and a man can agree for once. The music of Hugo Friedhofer and the costumes of Irene Sharaff add to its luster. One of the best and most unexpected movies of all time, in B / W awesome.
