I've lost count of the times I've seen this movie, but I love it and I find it very funny every time I see it. The facial expressions, the slapstick humor and the timing of the jokes makes it great. The characters, especially "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik" are fun. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. In fact, I think this movie was perfectly projected. I think it is necessary to release it on DVD before exhausting my VHS version.
