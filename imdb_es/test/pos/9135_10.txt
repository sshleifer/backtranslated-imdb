Jean-Pierre Melville is a director with whom I've recently become familiar (I need to see Bob le Flambeur and Le Samourai again to understand them), but seeing Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle, supposedly based on a saying in Buddhism) I realized that I was watching a crime movie as skilful and absorbing as I had seen it in a long time. Even though your movie has a dialogue, it is mainly to keep the scenes of the movie moving, adhering to the plot. What kept me alert, even in apparently mundane scenes / sequences, was the emphasis on the movements of the characters or behavior patterns. Melville has his story exposed, and he is careful to take the time to tell it (this may seem boring to some, but it seems to work since it puts a bit more emphasis on the weight of the characters / environments on the plot). <br /> <br /> However, look at each of the four main players: Alain Deleon as Corey (just released from prison, planning a new robbery), Gian Maria Volonte as Vogel (escaping and escaping from custody) hand in hand, he knows Corey luckily), Yves Montand as Jansen (an old professional with many years of experience in weapons, a friend of Vogel), and Andre Bourvil as Mattei (an experienced researcher, who is in search of Vogel, and on his toes with internal affairs). Each of these actors plays its role with precision, detachment, and each has its own kind of moments that indicate to the audience what their personalities may be as well as criminals and policemen. The sequence of robberies gives small hints, for example, how Vogel is made with a female statue while passing through the corridors, or how Jansen pulls out a jar and simply has a mouthful of content (and what a dream this guy has created). Even Corey's movements involving a photograph of a woman arouse interest. <br /> <br /> As the story is absorbed and cooled, and the skills were very good at making it come true (through director of photography Henri Decae, Eric Demarsan's edition and musical score), they are the people on the screen who gain fascination, in how they stay true to their natures and ideals. It is not a film that is lost by enthusiasts of the new French wave, and today's crime-movie fans might want to take 140 minutes to soak up the atmosphere of Melville's work. A soft cinematographic piece that still stands as one of my favorites of all time.
