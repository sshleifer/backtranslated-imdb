With the quite recent release of 'Fados' by Carlos Saura in the United States (an exclusive release of Art House Limited), it is time to re-launch this excellent documentary about Amalia Rodrigues. This movie is a treasure chest of Amalia's vintage movie clips on Portuguese and American television, as well as several other movie clips, including one of her and her mother that could easily reduce the most macho man to tears. The first time I saw this excellent documentary was a few years ago, when he received the unjustified release of "art house" (he deserved much better). Fortunately, there are several recordings of Amalia's best recordings in several "budget line" recordings (which are usually available in places like K-Mart or Best Buy), or if you do a little search, you can find some of the original versions . , either in E-Bay, or in one of those distribution services that specialize in expensive CDs imported into Europe. There are at least two versions of this documentary in circulation (the original Portuguese version, without subtitles in English, and the American version in Portuguese with English subtitles, except the European version that can not be played on most of the USDVD players, due to the PAL color line system). Not rated by the MPAA, but contains nothing to offend.
