The strengths of the film were clear for the initial and middle part of the film. He showed how a very violent and reactive authority could react to resistance. Filmed in the manner of a documentary, the director captures what would have happened if the United States enacted martial law. Volunteering in the "punishment park", a training camp for police officers who harass you and harass you, will offer you a way out of this serious scenario. It alternates between the judicial trials for those who face accusations, those who are in the park escaping from police attention, the training of the officers who are preparing to handle these prisoners, the judges in their free time, among many other things. It was a very strong and moving film. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I had with this was its realism. Officers are often seen holding their guns as if they were seven years old with a plastic toy (ie, an elbow bent at 90 degrees when pointing a gun at someone's face, or the way a policeman just makes it look like it is difficult to kick someone when 'low', etc., etc.). It begins as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs. At the end of the film, the viewer is slowly reminded again and again of the prejudices of the director and the producers. The antagonist characters of the story begin as authentic, real human beings, and then progress slowly towards "stereotyped and objective evil forces" until the end. The mistakes they make are stupid, the force they demonstrate is unreal and, unlike the way the police act, the judges during this court hearing are making stupid and unrealistic mistakes, among many other things. <br /> <br /> The reality The movie began to fall apart when it became clear that this was just another attempt to make the government look bad. And that comes from an anarchist. The scenes at the end began to become hokey, unreal and a thousand times more dramatic. Still, for the previous part, it promises a very moving story.
