I loved this film because of the dialogue and the excellent performance of Candace and Jacqueline. However, I never knew until now, watching a Bette David marathon on TNT, that this movie is a new version of a 1943 Bette Davis classic called Old Man. Bette co-stars with Miriam Hopkins with whom she was in a terrible fight during the making of the film because Bette had had an affair with Miriam's husband, who directed her in a movie before they met. <br /> <br /> Anyway, both are worth every minute they spend watching. I recommend this movie if you like dialogue and drama a lot. It's a study in women's psychology and their relationships to each other, in my opinion.
