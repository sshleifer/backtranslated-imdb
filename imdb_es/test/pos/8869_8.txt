"Throw Momma From the Train" is a dark and simple comedy with lots of laughs. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse; Danny DeVito plays a man in one of Crystal's writing classes. Crystal's ex-wife is a * hag * to say it right, and Crystal hates it. DeVito, feeling this, offers Crystal a deal one night: DeVito will kill Crystal's wife, if Crystal kills DeVito's mother. Crystal, of course, refuses, but later, the deep corruption of her heart makes her say yes. And so, as things develop, we see what happens when you try to kick someone's mom from a moving train. <br /> <br /> This story is an interesting study of characters; a story of evil, greed, revenge, ego, trust, doing the right thing, but above all, corruption. We see that the white-collar writer of Crystal is increasingly stressed with the events that collide around him, and due to the constant annoyances of DeVito, he says "yes". But we know that deep down in his subconscious he wanted to say "yes", and he's glad that he told DeVito. <br /> <br /> This film is a dark parody in Hitchcock's immortal film "Strangers in a Train", and plays a tribute to the film from the beginning, when there is a theater that plays "Strangers in a train" " We see DeVito watching the movie, and a light bulb in his head lights up. An idea occurs to him. Throw the train mom! <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal offers another compelling and strangely comical performance as a writer harassed on the verge of collapse. He has been so beaten by everything that surrounds him that he gets out of his inner emotions and agrees to throw DeVito's mother off the train. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito directed this movie in an excellent way. Use the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and disease. Everything is insane, but not to an extreme as in other dark comedies. It has the right touch of darkness that shone in "The War of the Roses." <br /> <br /> Not only is "Launching the Train Mom" ​​a simple tale of corruption and morality, it is also an interesting study of the character. Definitely worth watching on TV. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
