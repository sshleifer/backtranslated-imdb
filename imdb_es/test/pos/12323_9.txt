So many literary adaptations are disappointments. There are many reasons for that, but generally it is the need to reduce a complex novel to the size of a script. The Dead is unusual: it had to be "quilted", since the story itself is a small and relatively short gem. In fact, it may be the best short story in the English language. In beautifully sparse language, he narrates that Gabriel Conroy has realized that his life and the lives of many around him are controlled by the memories of the dead. Even his own wife for many years loved a man now dead more than him. <br /> <br /> Bringing such a short story to the movies was always going to be difficult. John Huston did a great job. He never gave in to the temptation to play or use a sophisticated technique to expand the story. It's simple and true, with an outstanding performance. The only false step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy. <br /> <br /> It is rare that a film version of a literary masterpiece is in itself a masterpiece, but I think it is fair to use it. This term for this movie. It's not a piece of bravery to make movies, but it's simple and pure: I always think of Ozu's films when I think of The Dead, it's in that level of purity, simplicity and profound wisdom.
