After watching NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more than excited to see his "Masterpiece" (Criteria O-Word) RIFIFI. <br /> <br /> Now I am a little disappointed by the story. <br /> <br /> So I have at least these five questions in my mind: <br /> <br /> 1. In the last countdown, Louis Grutter shot from the inside of a house the main character Tony Stéphanois. I could not tell if he was still alive or not, but he did not care and ran directly behind the house (with the money) to get to his car. So, of course, Tony was not dead and he shot him. GREAT QUESTION OF QUESTIONS. <br /> <br /> 2. In another important scene, the boxing specialist César gave directly after the theft as a gift a diamond ring (which was part of the theft) to a Woman who worked for Louis Grutter in a bar night. Stupid, because before this character was not SO stupid. And, of course, Louis knew directly that Tony planned the jewelry theft. SMALL QUESTIONMARK. <br /> <br /> 3.After the gangsters behind Louis Grutter murdered Mario Ferrati and his wife, Tony and his best friend Joe planned a revenge against the Louis gang. At the same time, they do not care about the safety of Joe's wife and five-year-old son. Of course the Louis gang kidnapped the son. CHEAP and SIMPLE. <br /> <br /> 4. The Perfect Robbery: Of course, this is the best 30min. Long scene in the whole plot, without any spoken word in all the time, but was this a perfect robbery? Comparing with other films that handle this subject, I could only smile when, for example, Tony took a fire extinguisher to ban the alarm. Also also SIMPLE. <br /> <br /> 5. Grutter's gang went to Mario's house, because they knew (however ...) that the jewels will be there. Then they kill Mario and his wife. And so? They are not looking for it! DO NOT. They ran straight out of the apartment. And more. They do not observe the apartment after that, so Tony can go after a while (that was the same day) in to take the jewelry. BIG QUESTIONMARK. <br /> <br /> Above all: it's a good movie. Because of the bright silent 30min scene of theft. Due to the very good cut (the final scene in the car through Paris is impressive). For a very good actor called Jean Servais. Because of this black / white fever that you will get while you look at it. Due to other reasons why other users wrote, but do not tell me that this is an amazing story.
