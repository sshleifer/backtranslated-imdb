I saw this magnificent documentary at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. It is extremely absorbent and very well designed, which leads to the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the sixties and seventies. While familiar with his best known compositions ("One is the Loneliest Number", "Without You"), I learned about the brilliant writing and the beautiful song of this man. If you like music, you will find much to attract your world, which unfortunately went out of control as its success increased and its past pursued it. Sad as he was, he was completely devoted to his family and you will be so glad to have met this man. The profile is effectively said through Nilsson's own words and those of his friends and colleagues (a Who's Who of Virtual Rock) who loved him and respected him. Do not miss it!
