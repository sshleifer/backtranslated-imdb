Woohoo! In my opinion, THE NET is an excellent techno thriller on the edge of your seat that will make you feel good and make you feel good everywhere. When I first saw it, I felt good for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought: "This is a very nice place to vacation." From the moment that Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) started chasing her, I thought: "Do not let anything bad happen to you! Please!" I also took a few deep breaths to avoid screaming more than I had already done. On the positive side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I give this excellent techno thriller to the edge of your seat four stars.
