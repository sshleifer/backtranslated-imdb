The scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) is exploited by something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. He has his brain transplanted into the body of an almost indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues who are led by the perverse obsessive scientist Alex Whyte (a perfectly odious portrait of Richard Cox). Lehman embarks on a great wave of murders. It depends on the unpleasant mercenary Hunter (a wonderfully disgusting turn of the divine Pam Grier) to stop him. Director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously directed the unappreciated suspense psychologist "Visiting Hours", organizes the abundant action scenes with considerable enthusiasm and maintains a dizzying pace, ensuring that this film is as big as a science Incredibly trashy fiction / horror action tour. Maury Chaykin, the most pompous character, easily manages for the best acting honors such as the disgusting fat Burt, who in the most insipid sequence of the film has a brutal fight with Lehman's pregnant wife, Lauren (a winning performance by lovely Teri Austin). Stan Winston's witty makeup f / x and Paul Zaza's exciting score add to the general fun of poor quality.
