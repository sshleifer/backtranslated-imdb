In the era of DVD, you'd think you could find almost any piece of trash committed to celluloid and, for the most part, it's true. So, WHY, WHY is it so difficult to find this great and small movie, clearly made by people who love the noir as a loving tribute (buit that never descends to the parody of the earth) of that more cinematic genre? Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are a HOOT in this and the superstar in the process, Carla Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY) makes her mark now as a good acting routine. <br /> <br /> This movie really has everything for movie fans. A b noir on steroids, the intelligent and full of steam JUDAS KISS succeeds in every account. <br /> <br /> Please, Columbia TriStar FOLLOW it on DVD soon!
