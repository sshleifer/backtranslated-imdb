The roguish charm of Errol Flynn really shines in this entertaining and exciting, but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous (and some would say infamous) General Custer, who pursues his career from his first day at West Point, through the Civil War and the West of the battle in The Little Big Horn, all the time hitting heads with his rival Arthur Kennedy and the beautiful romantic Olivia de Havilland. <br /> <br /> Some might say that Flynn, who offers an outstanding performance as a general, is basically playing himself playing Custer! <br /> <br /> A luxurious production (which should have been in Technicolor) well directed by Raoul Walsh, They Died With They Boots On presents some really well organized battle sequences. Also, it is a real pleasure to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse. <br /> <br /> The previous year, Flynn played Jeb Stuart in front of George Custer of Ronald Reagan on Santa Fe Trail (also with De Havilland), another action-packed action. The Warner Brothers production is designed to make you fail in history class!
