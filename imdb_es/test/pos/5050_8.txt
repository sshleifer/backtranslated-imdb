This is a lovely movie to say the least. The main character, Fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the undead for whom he is surrounded. He and his accomplice make jokes and get into trouble throughout the city. Meanwhile, his family is in arms about what to do with him. From there you can see Fanda's relationships with his wife, his best friend and his son. Finally, it leads to one of the best movie endings I've seen. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are rich and deep. They develop well throughout the film. The movie has a great variety of moods. It goes from light and fun to dark and dark Any slow part for you in this movie will recover in the end. <br /> <br /> Autumn Spring carries a message similar to what many other European films do: do not lose sight of the small pleasures. in the life. If you enjoyed Amelie, The eighth day or Life is Beautiful (all great movies, by the way), you probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
