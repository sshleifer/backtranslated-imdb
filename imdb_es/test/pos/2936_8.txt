This is ten times better than "Who wants to be a super model" in Bravo. I think it's more true to the business. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and can make the most of each aspiring model. The photos look for depth in each of the models, in personality and beauty, strength and demure attributes, and the ability to support and work for what they want. I like to see Tyra's personal experience in the photo sessions and the track. I do not always agree with the decision of the judges or the comments of Tyra and at least one of the winners, I think it did not deserve to win. But this is just a show and all the girls there are very lucky to have this opportunity.
