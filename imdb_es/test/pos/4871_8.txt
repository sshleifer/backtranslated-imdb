I think I'm kind of a Road Runner fan. I do not care how predictable it is, I laugh anyway. 'Beep, Beep' is predictable most of the time, although it is also quite ingenious at the same time. Of course, the Road Runner is chased by the Coyote and, of course, the Coyote fails to catch the Road Runner with each new attempt. The plans that come to Coyote are very funny. You see exactly where you will go wrong and you will not be disappointed. Well, once you're a little disappointed, what you think will happen does not, but it makes the joke even funnier. <br /> <br /> If you like Road Runner shorts, you'll love this one. The predictable gags work and the animation is great and quite original at times.
