As John Grierson pointed out: "The documentary genre can be defined as: the creative interpretation of reality" <br /> <br /> This fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time that a computer-generated project on dinosaurs respects intelligence . of the spectator. <br /> <br /> When I saw Jurassic Park, which I was waiting with great emotion, I was very disappointed. Of course the dinosaurs were great, but the narration was unnecessary. I thought: "What would happen if they made a documentary about dinosaurs, without weeping children or bad word games, only dinosaurs made as realistic as possible, to let us marvel at what was once a reality?" <br /> <br /> My dream came true The BBC has produced an exciting documentary that explores the different eras of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This part is for all people who seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess many points related to behavior, the skin. patterns etc: Of course they have to do it. Nobody was there. I think it's great that they could present something as realistic as that. All the assumptions are based on the knowledge of many paleontologists, and allow the viewer to have a fairly clear idea of ​​what it was like. If you want to keep what we know for sure, visit a museum of dinosaur bones. That's why I incorporated Grierson's quote at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> Anyway, congratulations to the creators of it.
