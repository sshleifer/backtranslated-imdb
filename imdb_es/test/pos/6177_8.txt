I am Czech and soldiers (not just pilots) who escaped from Czechoslovakia after the invasion of Nazi in 1939 and fought against them abroad, they are true heroes and bravest men of our history for me. This film by the director of the winner of the Academy Award "Kolya" (1996) is a tribute to these men. It is the first big-screen film about Czechoslovak soldiers of the Second World War from "Nebesti jezdci" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie: good acting, good special effects, good music, etc. The film is almost in English and some actors are British. But the best thing about this movie is its pure existence. It is a great opportunity to show people from all over the world (and many people in the Czech Republic too ...) that the role of Czechoslovakia in World War II was not only an occupied country but an active member of the Allied campaign . <br /> <br /> The main characters are older and more wise, Frantisek and the young Karel. They escaped together from Czechoslovakia, are flying in the same squadron and fell in love with the same woman ... Maybe it's a clich√©, but fortunately this story is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including big dog fights) . I do not want to compare "Dark Blue World" with "Pearl Harbor", someone will like more PH and someone will like DBW. But if you like happy ends, DBW is not for you. So, I think it's a very good movie for all those who like this kind of stories and a very good movie that wants to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovak history. <br /> <br /> By the way, main theme "Dark Blue World" is by the Czech composer of the 30s and 40s, Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this subject when he lost his eyes ...
