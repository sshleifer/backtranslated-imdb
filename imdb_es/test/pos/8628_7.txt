For us, a film by Abbott and Costello is something you have to be in the mood for. I am very happy to have recorded it. My wife remembered him from when he was young, but he had never seen him. The family wanted to see something that was not too serious before going to bed and this was selected. <br /> <br /> Our daughter has seen many of the old movies with us, always complaining at the beginning, but more often. At first, he mostly ignored this, preferring to check his email, but he began to have fun, often laughing out loud. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful to think you can have a fun night with a 55 year old. The introduction of a single color that mixes with the fairy tale in full color. It's a funny twist on a story everyone is familiar with, which includes a little song and a little dance, along with everything you expect to be sent to Lou and Bud. <br /> <br /> Look at it with your children and enjoy a very fun night!
