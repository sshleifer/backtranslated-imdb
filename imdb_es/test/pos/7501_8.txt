This movie has some of the best dialogues ever written. George C. Scott, a man who knew what to do with a juicy piece of dialogue, gives all the really good lines. I just watched this movie again, for the first time in over 20 years, and the dialogue is as good as ever. The strange events in the hospital are so imaginative that they dazzle you. They often involve a poetic justice as wonderful as being close to a genius. I love this movie!!
