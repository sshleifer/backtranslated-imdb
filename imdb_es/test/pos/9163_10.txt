Filmed less than a year after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the subject was fresh in the minds of the cast, director and audience. The majority of the cast are soldiers and royal officers who have just returned from the war. The Soviet army cooperated a lot during filming, which is strange. <br /> <br /> The Afghan intervention was a bloody and senseless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed. This film shows the tension and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that convulsed a small nation torn by war and civil war. <br /> <br /> There are no missing powerful scenes. . One of the first is the filming of steel coffins that are loaded onto a transport destined for the USSR. The soldiers carry out their work while an officer calmly marks the destinations: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, the Baltic. <br /> <br /> A previous comment describes the last scene with Maj. Bandura as illogical. It is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship that Bandura maintained was with the Afghan family that accidentally killed in the assault. Having lost his only buffer against the foolishness of war, Bandura turns his back on the boy (and his weapon) in resignation to his fate. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the last scene: a flock of Mi-28 rises over the mountains while the voice of a pilot shouts: "Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata! (We're leaving! We're leaving!) In a tone of sincere relief. <br /> <br /> Afhanskii Izlom is an excellent movie, brutally honest and as unhappy as they come.
