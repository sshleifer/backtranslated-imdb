I did it too. When I first saw the band, I immediately dismissed them without even listening to the music. Then, one day, out of sheer curiosity, I bought the CD and fell in love with it. So I bought the video. wait for your children for lunch, this is not going to be nice! The video was excellent: a great opportunity to listen to the music, watch some of the promotional videos and meet the band ... although I do not know how they can cope with the use of those masks all the time! A must for all fans of the band and fans of alternative music in general.
