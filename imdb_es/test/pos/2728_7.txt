As you all know, 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half sister. <br /> <br /> The manifestation of schizophrenia is still considered a disease that people often feel could disappear if ignored. There are also those who, however extravagant they may seem when shown in the film, think that the disease manifests itself as a result of some kind of supernatural influence. I think Ms. Sen deserves a lot of praise for "15 Park Avenue." It has made a good turn, not only for the general public, but also for those who deal with schizophrenics ... family members, social workers, psychoanalysts. The film really helps dispel many myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I have been told that the movie is based largely on their personal experiences with a person very close to her, who suffers from this mental affliction. To that effect, I am sure that nothing that has been shown is out of proportion ... on the contrary, it is a true representation of the facts. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, in the whole, as can be expected. Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and, of course, Rahul Bose, are very good. They emerge as very "real" characters ... credible enough that you can identify with them sometimes. People can think me terribly queer, but I think there are times when you can identify with Meethi too! I guess we all have a streak of "madness" inside us ... maybe some more than others. These are the people who are marked. After all, do not we all have our secret dreams and fantasies? Impossible, sometimes? Would we be nicknamed "outside of our rocking chairs" if people could glimpse these areas of our mind? A person with low self-esteem, would be considered schizophrenic because he eludes the company ... preferring, instead, to live in a world of his own because that is the only place where there is a sense of security? <Br /> <br /> Konkona, like Meethi, is outstanding! Her acting is so easy ... she lives her part. She has demonstrated the ability to encourage the audience to forget the division between reality and acting! An example of this is the part in which she is distressed by the scene, shown on television, of the arrest of Saddam Hussein. His reaction seems so uninhibited and intense ... as if he was really shattered by this tragedy! His brand of Indian English is also very spontaneous and natural. <br /> <br /> However, the same can not be said for at least a couple of the other actors. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, both splendid actors, seem to be uncomfortable when they speak in English. His diction is less than perfect ... forced and affected, the fact that they are making a supreme effort, becomes more than apparent. His delivery of dialogues is discordant and tends to break the smooth flow of story development. <br /> <br /> The brutal violation of Meethi (Konkona), seems unnecessary. Any other incident would have been just as good, I think. The point here is that something triggers the extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, one can not, with a minimum of conviction or certainty, say that the incident of rape was fundamental to highlight the hitherto latent propensity towards schizophrenia. So why are we subjected to the scene where Meethi lies bleeding and unconscious? Was Ms. Sen trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who resort to violence to stay in power? If so, then the rape scene is justified but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film. <br /> <br /> The end seems somewhat abrupt. Is the audience expected to find a solution? Where does Meethi disappear? Does Ms. Sen want us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and therefore credible, is it true? In other words, are you trying to say that we are not without prejudice in judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity? I'm not so sure. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that makes you think and it's worth seeing. However, IF you are the kind of person who likes things to be clean and tidy ... all cut and dried, with an airtight solution for every problem that arises ... this movie is clearly not made for you !
