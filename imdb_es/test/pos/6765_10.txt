This is actually a brilliant movie. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially the performance of Mads Mikkelsen as Svend, is magnificent. It is a simple story about two guys want to do on your own, but takes place in a strange and absurd story, with lots of people die accidentally and served as chicken fillets. If only more people understood Danish ... This could be a great candidate for an English version. It is also worth mentioning Ole Thestrup, who always delivers that extra touch to the plot, with his character a bit crazy Holger. I can only recommend this film to the Danish audience. Also check out Adams Ã†bler (2005), an Anders Thomas Jensen movie, also with Mads Mikkelsen accompanied by a pit that plays Ulrich Thomsen.
