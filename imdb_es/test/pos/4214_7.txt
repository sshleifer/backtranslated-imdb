Jimmy Wang Yu, an authentic Asian superstar, directed and wrote this movie that I have only seen in a video dubbed version. The widescreen form (Shaw Scope!) Was lost and the voices of the original actor were absent, but it is still good to see them. The story is the usual school of martial arts that fights against the villains of Japan conspiring with our young hero winning at the end hitting a bunch of different thugs. <br /> <br /> The combat improves as the film develops. At the beginning of the film, it seems stiff and boring, but then there is a big scene in which Wang Yu fights against the hordes in a game place, then goes into a snowy scene and takes some more villains with knives, sword and fists . That part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Pretty good then, but it would be interesting to see an unfolded widescreen version if there is one.
