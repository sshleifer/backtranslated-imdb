I love master I love this show. Whether you say it is because I am crazy in the brain or not. I think this show is very funny and entertaining, although sometimes Uncle Vito de Bam scares me ... so, in general, I give a perfect review. And I really think that if you like the humor "omg .. that idiot", this show is for you. It's really fun to see the faces of the people in the joke and there are many musical guests who come to Bam's house. Buy this because it's cool! You should buy it. yes. And Bam's brother is in the CKY band and they are really good and, sometimes, they participate in the program. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is ... look at the program.
