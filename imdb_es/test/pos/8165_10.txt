The first time I heard about the Days of the Last Days was when I was renting DVDs and I became interested because I am a member of the LDS Church. I found this film very sincere and in several areas it made me cry. The reason for this is that many years ago I met a young man who went through what Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) does in recent days, but unlike Aaron, this dear young man did not survive the test. He ended up living after his church, his friends and his family repudiated him because he was gay. There have been many people who do not believe that the things shown in the film really happen in these times, but the sad and sad thing is that they do. For those of you who are gay and young, you need to see this movie and if you are gay mormons, you really need to watch this movie. Also, if you get the DVD, you will find help for you on the DVD. The suicide of teenagers in the gay world is very disturbing and this film touches it, but that part is hidden to a certain extent. The acting and music is excellent. This film sold out all the movie theaters that it showed, but it was only shown in the main cities and had a very limited release, so those who would like to see this movie would recommend the DVD release. The only people I know who did not like the movie are members of my own church and did not see the film because of the theme of gays and the LDS Church. Watch the movie, experience the story and feel the emotions that are shown in this film that I feel you will not be disappointed.
