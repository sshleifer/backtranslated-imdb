This film exemplifies a certain brand of horror comedy of a strictly adult type but quite different from the films of Troma (with which it shares certain qualities). The humor is rough and ready but fast and furious. If the idea of ​​awful dolls with wicked powers and twisted minds does not make you shrug with boredom, look for the six-pack of beers and enjoy the best "Chucky" movie so far.
