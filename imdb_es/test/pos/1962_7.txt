Less Than Zero could have been the movie of the 80s that reveals the apathy of teenagers in their most extreme form if they had adhered to the damn book. But, where they did not, this film does the job and leaves you with the most spooky feeling when everything ends in a way that was not done until the late nineties with Larry Clark's films 'Kids' and 'Bully'. <br /> <br /> Adolescents who are marginalized from society face a rather curious dilemma (they do not treat it as if it were only one) when their separated friend (Daniel Roebuck) tells them that he killed a teenager near the edge of the river in your suburban city. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized character in the group, the only one who is willing to exhibit any kind of conscience, anyway, while the others do nothing for the death of the girl or want to help her friend hide the body . <br /> <br /> I do not know who is sicker in this movie, Crispin Glover, who is almost obsessed and paternal enough to try to protect the friend and hide the crime by smuggling it out of the state. Dennis Hopper, a cutting-edge drug dealer (who clings to an inflatable doll) who befriends teenagers (as a merchant, of course) and suddenly gets involved in events. Or, Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's little brother, Tim. He seems to be the most apathetic of them all, at least until his emotional end. Definitely not a meal for teenagers of the 80s, obviously. And, undoubtedly, it makes clear the point about the serious detachment with which these children face (despite a series of strange events) thanks to the great performances in everything (even Reeves showed some acting capacity). <br /> <br /> Help yourself to A comedy to recover if you rock too hard.
