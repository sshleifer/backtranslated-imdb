Brian Foster (a sympathetic electronic host) (a nice performance by Wesley Eure of TV's "Land of the Lost") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss, Mr. Ralph Norton (very well played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is failing. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their hands dirty at C.H.O.M.P.S .; This task turns out to be easier to say than to do. The director Don Chaffey tells the charming story at a fast and steady pace, keeps a friendly and silly tone casual at all times, and presents the jokes of fools with a considerable touch. On the other hand, the game presents him with an infectious aplomb: the adorable Valerie Bertinelli as Brian's sweet fiancee, Casey Norton, Chuck McCann as a fool Crook Brooks, Red Buttons as the equally clumsy McCann Bracken, Jim Backus as an evil CEO , Gibbs, Hermoine Baddeley as the good old Biddy, Mrs. Foster, and the AIP holding of the 60s, presents Larry Bishop as an elegant and duplicate suit, Ken Sharp. The best thing of all is that the titular pooch is a delight: C.H.O.M.P.S. He jumps through fences, walls and windows with amazing agility, performs acts of exceptional strength, runs faster than a deer and even makes some ingenious movements of martial arts. A subplot about a huge neighborhood dog called Monster provides a few extra laughs (Monster is voiced by an uncredited guy with a deep and appropriate voice). The brilliant and animated sequence of opening credits, the brilliant cinematography of Charles F. Wheeler and the modern and vibrant album of Hoyt Curtin are also solid. A nice little movie for children.
