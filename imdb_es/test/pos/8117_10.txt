Last night I saw this film at the International Women's Film Festival in Boston, and I was sad to hear Mrs. Troche tell us (in her questions and answers after the screening) that she does not expect to see much distribution in the US. UU., Because of your insistence. about the inclusion of all so-called "gay content". It was a FANTASTICALLY entertaining comedy, and it seems to me that the American public could enjoy it in the same way they enjoyed "The Full Monty", so it's really unfortunate and a little ridiculous that some photos of two kissing guys remain. It is far from the conventional theaters. The wonderful cast, the fabulous script and, of course, the direction of Rose Troche make this one of the funniest movies I've seen.
