Gilmore Girls is my favorite television show of all time. Only the first 2 seasons were broadcast in India, but I've seen the rest on DVD or I've read it online. It is very refreshing to find a show where the protagonist does not slip through her mother's back but has an open relationship with her. The chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel who plays Lorelai and her daughter Rory is really great. The whole performance is excellent and the characters, although extremely extravagant, are still credible. The residents of Stars Hollow show all the funny curiosity of the life of a small town, which contrasts with the snobbery and social norms that make up the high society life of Lorelai's parents. On the one hand, there are dance festivals and parties of the firelight, while in the hand there are committees, DAR meetings and cocktails. All the characters develop a lot and there is a happy ending for more or less everyone. There are dramatic elements but also a lot of very witty humor. Rory's boyfriends are incredibly hot, as are his friend Lane's. Basically, it is a fun, fun and very satisfying program that covers all aspects of life and gives you a feeling that if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you will get what you want, even if it was not what you intended.
