The film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, was brilliant. It begins with a family of three people, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day), who is a former theater singer, and his young son. I guess he's about 10 years old and that they travel to Morocco for pleasure. On the bus, he runs into a French government agent, and they are too kind to him. He is murdered in the market after discovering the information he was looking for. He wants to take this information to someone, so he goes to the only person who, even a little, knows: James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap your child and tell him that if he tells him something about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. Stewart has to travel to London, because that's where his son is, and where would be the murder that the agent told him. The movie is very suspense. There are many twists and turns (typical Hitchcock movie). Also, it has the right amount of comic relief. In addition to all that, he won an Oscar for the performance of Doris Day in "Que sara, sara". This movie is very good. It is difficult to find a problem about it. I would definitely recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and all the fans of suspense. I give this movie an "A-" just because it's a bit predictable.
