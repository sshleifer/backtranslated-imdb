Um, hi ... Rainbow Brite ... just the name is hard to take seriously, as if it were the cousin of Strawberry Shortcake ... but when you're a child, this is definitely something serious. <br /> <br /> Then, there is a spoiled and spoiled girl, and she wants the Rainbow Brites belt, among other things, that is, the light of the whole universe, and Rainbow Brite and her friend Cris are tied and determined to stop her. As I recall, Murky and Lurky played a minor role in this production. Maybe they wanted too much money? <br /> <br /> So anyway, the evil girl has a powerful jewel and she channels her power to take Rainbow's belt ... imagine? But somehow, Rainbow regains her belt and revitalizes it with "star sprinkles" and kicks the butt of the bad girls with the help of Cris and her prism bracelet, and they also save the entire universe in the process. <br /> <br /> So good triumphs over evil, kindness triumphs over rudeness, and Rainbow Brite and The Color Kids are once again sure to spread color and joy for all humanity.
