This has to be one of the best Doctor Who episodes I've seen since he returned last year. There is a brilliant mix of fun, fear and tenderness, all mixed up that amounts to an incredible episode. The oods were brilliantly designed and I'm pretty sure there will be lots of jokes in the coming weeks. I am already guilty of that. I especially liked the way we saw a different perspective of the relationship between Rose and the Doctor and the ending; Well, it's the first time I hide behind a cushion! I can not WAIT until the next episode of the week to discover how they come out of this mess.
