Uzak (2002), a Turkish film shown in the United States as "Distant", was directed, produced, written and filmed by Nuri Bilge. <br /> <br /> Ceylan. <Br /> <br /> This film is a harsh and grim version of the clash between a "city mouse", Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir, and a "field mouse", Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are excellent actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their ability to act. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in a car accident shortly after the film was completed). <br /> <br /> In most of the stories of country cousins ​​/ city cousins, the contrast between rural and urban lifestyles is presented in a humorous way. In this movie, there is little humor or even heat. Both men have lost contact with human society. Mahmut's work as a commercial photographer for a tile company does not give him any satisfaction. He has divorced a woman he clearly still loves, and does not have satisfying human relationships. <br /> <br /> Mahmut lost his job due to a factory that is closing in his small town, and he does not. You do not have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. Their human interactions are limited mainly to silent observations of the other people who cross their path. He is clearly a warm and caring person, but he can not express these qualities in an urban environment. <br /> <br /> Cousins ​​do not relate well to the world, and they do not relate well to each other. Neither of you makes an effort to act in a way that provides an opportunity for union or closeness. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this movie represents a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> Possibly, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was missing in the other's life. Instead, they run parallel unhappy courses. The two men are distant at all times, which is a situation suggested by the title of the film. <br /> <br /> One of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which Ceylan constructs the details about the details. These details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we could have learned by simple exposition. <br /> <br /> Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. It is not a "work film" in the traditional sense of that genre. It is a work film because it shows the harmful effects of unsatisfactory work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> This is a dark, absorbing and dark film. Even though he does not look happy, I left the theater <br /> <br /> realizing that I had seen a truly creative and important film. This movie is worth finding and seeing!
