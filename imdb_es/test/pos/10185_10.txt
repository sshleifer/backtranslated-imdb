The three-part series ended last night on PBS, which I think was his first broad exposure to a US audience. The richness of its text and the unique quality of its filming are important points. It seems very novel to see and hear a play that uses the vernacular of Georgian England, and Jane Austen's filmed drawing rooms are the main example of that form of speech. However, it is the scope of the drama that overwhelms the senses that makes the picturesque language adapt perfectly to each scene. Such bold exposure to an old reality is reminiscent of literary giants like Tolstoy or Shakespeare, while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a saga by C. S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian. The universality of the basic human condition is at its center. <br /> <br /> Narrator Talbot played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of Benedict Cumberbatch (surely even Dickens could not beat that!) Alternates between heavy jingoism and extreme vulnerability, an active tour de force. In fact, I can not remember any interpretation error between this great song. That is a tribute not only to the actors themselves, but also to the director. <br /> <br /> However, the most impressive element is how life aboard a warship en route to Australia in the early 1800s is presented. This is especially true of how the movement of the ship becomes almost a character in itself, something that marine stories rarely take into account, except as a backdrop. Anyone who has experienced bad de mer in person will recognize it instantly, and will appreciate even more how difficult it must have been to recreate it in the context of filming. <br /> <br /> This is not a Pirates of the Caribbean fantasy. Some effort must be made to achieve an understanding of its nuances.
