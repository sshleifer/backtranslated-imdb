** HERE ARE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Summary: Macleane (Miller) is witness to a robbery by Plunkett (Carlyle) that goes wrong. The companion of Plunkett receives a shot (and dies), but not until he swallows a large ruby. Plunkett and Macleane meet in the cemetery when they both try to get the ruby. Unfortunately, they are captured as grave robbers and sent to jail, but not until Plunkett has swallowed the ruby. The ruby ​​is their key to freedom, and once they are free, they form an association in the robbery. Macleane pretends to be a gentleman and discovers who is worth stealing, and then they just steal it (and steal them with style). But Macleane falls in love with the niece / daughter (?) Of his first victim, Mrs. Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And a Mr Chance (Stott) is out to catch them, and their methods are not very good ... <br /> <br /> Comments: A good action with a taste of comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller form a good team, with a lot of friction and friendship. And then there's the relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The scene with the ball is very good, especially the (anachronistic) use of music. In addition to these interesting characters, Cumming is the best of all, Lord Rochester. Both the character and the performance are stellar and are among the best in the film. In total, the film works very well, a good balance between history and special effects, action and comedy. Very entertaining. <br /> <br /> 8/10
