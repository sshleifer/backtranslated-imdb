Although I like this Western, I have to say it is not one of my favorite John Ford Western. For me, I just need something that most of his other movies (the ones I've seen anyway) have. I am not sure what that something is. It is not something tangible. Anyway, the essence of the story is about a Mormon wagon train that is being used by a band of outlaws as a hideout of a persecuting group. Ford employs a lot of its regulars here. There are some interesting characters, some beautiful landscapes, some action and emotion. Everything adds up to an observable experience. It's certainly not boring. It just does not live up to John Ford's usual standard. For me, Wagon Master is a 7/10
