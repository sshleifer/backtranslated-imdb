After having seen The Lost Child several times since its launch in 1995, and having read the reader's comments (mainly on the background of Jane Tennison and the excellent role of Helen Mirren), I am more surprised than ever that there are no comments. about the brilliant role that Robert Glenister plays as Chris Hughes. Even after 10 years, it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of an abuser child, carrying the weight of his own past. Watching the episode for a full hour and a half makes it constantly change between feelings of love. and I hate for this guy, in which hatred prevails due to the gravity of his actions. I've seen the brightest roles of my favorite actor, but it never fails to make the biggest impression possible. Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her. Praise Robert Glenister!
