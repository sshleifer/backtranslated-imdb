"Tourist Trap" is a really scary low-budget horror movie that will surely satisfy fans of horror. It contains an extremely strange atmosphere and there are some baffling moments of fear and total fear. Some scenes are frankly strange, for example, there is a scene in which Chuck Connors sits down to dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and starts talking to him before his head falls off. There is very little blood, but the violence is quite strong for a horror movie rated by PG. The mannequins look very sinister and The climax is awful. David Schmoeller returned to make several other genre films such as "Crawlspace", "Puppet Master" and "Netherworld". Even "Tourist Trap" is definitely your best horror movie, so if you want to be scared, give this little gem a look. <br /> <br /> PG rated for short nudity, violence and obscene language.
