Ice the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A virus removed from the ice <br /> <br /> I just did not know how to play well. <br /> <br /> If you are infected, kill <br /> <br /> because you are sick. <br /> <br /> The cure is to be infected twice. <br /> <br /> Ice is a great episode; one of the big ones of season 1 that began to shape the program and, if you ask me, you really could not ask for anything better in the whole series. Start with an amazing teaser that, in my opinion, is really one of the best teasers in the series as well. A group of scientists in Alaska has drilled something out of the ice core that, for some reason, has caused them to kill each other. Now Mulder and Scully are sent along with three other scientists to investigate what happened. As Mulder says, this is because they are brilliant or dispensable. I understand that it is better to be brilliant or if not ... The group soon discovers that the cause of the chaos is a small parasite removed from the ice core. A small worm that enters the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. Since the pilot is infected, the rest of the program becomes a kind of suspenseful game of paranoid suspense, while others begin to suspect that they are infected. A doctor too paranoid Hodge does not help anyone, which can not be trusted in anything we learn from the beginning for what he asks: see the credentials of all to "make sure we are who we say we are". Events lead to discovering who is infected and learning how to cure them. <br /> <br /> There are several things that I like about the episode and, of course, certain characters that I want to hit in the face of this episode, as well as a couple of gaps, but most can be attributed to greater caution and do not think clearly. I like Bear from the moment I meet him for the first time. It is a pity that I have to die. I also like the scene shown from the other scientist's point of view when Mulder and Scully argue in the other room. It gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a spectator and, to me, it seems to say that maybe we should not assume that just because someone is a government means that they know all sorts of conspiracy secrets. As much as Hodges frustrates me in this episode, I do believe that Mulder was as guilty of some of the reckless actions as any other. I really like Scully in this episode. First of all, she can cope like a damn linebacker! Second, I really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them there and how she tries not to let Mulder's trust and friendship prevent her from skewing her judgment. I love the scene when she goes into the room to sleep and looks first like the image of the previous group, all hugging and the birthday presents of them who used to sleep in that room and then how it suddenly scares and pushes the toilet In front of the door and with a final touch of subtlety, while sitting on the floor with knees resting on the chest, we see the bottom of a sign on the wall that says "Friends of the cheekbones." This is a great script. A way of saying without words that Scully is worried that she can not trust her best friend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this increased suspicion makes the group believe that Mulder is infected since he discovers that Murphy's body is dead even though he has not been inspected at all to find out for sure. That was my main problem with the behavior of the characters, since they could easily have solved all the suspicions simply by donating blood. But I suppose he probably would have acted too hastily in that situation. But then the stupid Hodges decides he has to assume that Mulder is infected, although Mulder voluntarily surrenders and then goes on to be voluntarily inspected and almost infects Mulder in the process. Luckily, he sees that it is really Dasilva who is infected and we finally reach a resolution. At least everything you can expect from an X-File. The "government" does not waste time in setting fire to the evidence as always happens in these cases and Mulder is left with another frustrating "unsolved" case. To finish, I give "Ice" and easy 10/10 and I leave you with a haiku. <br /> <br /> "We are not who we are, it does not go beyond this, it ends right here, right now."
