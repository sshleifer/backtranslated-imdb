The plot of this film is facing the most terrible war in the history of mankind: the violent clash between the Germany of Adolf Hitler and Soviet Russia, from 1941 to 45. <br /> <br /> With the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated, and between 20 and 30 million Russians killed, the vibrations of this conflict can be felt in Russia to this day. Let's not say in 1957, when the memories were still very fresh and painful. <br /> <br /> This very black setting contrasts sharply with the fine and consistent style of the beautiful 'Letjat zhuravli' shots. Its simple story is about human behavior in times of war: courage, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. All beautifully united by a toy squirrel. <br /> <br /> Add to this the truly magnificent performance, and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous. Really, one of the best that has ever been made. <br /> <br />
