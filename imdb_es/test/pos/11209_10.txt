It's probably been a year since I saw Uzak, but he has left strong memories of the two main characters, the jaded Mahmut photographer and his naive cousin Yusuf. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie with very little dialogue and a fairly limited plot. This evidently has bothered a few spectators. But the film builds such a painfully believable portrait of Mahmut and Yusuf that there is as much emotional tension as in the more peaceful thriller. <br /> <br /> To be clear, there is no filler in this movie, in the long term. he pauses where no one speaks there, as much as it happens in the emotions of the characters (and yours, looking at them) as you could bear. Go see him awake and alert, and you will feel trapped instead of anesthetized. <br /> <br /> Uzak sounds in many ways, and that sincerity is probably his greatest achievement. People do not deal with events and problems, as well as with others. In fact, throughout the film, there is probably no point at which the main characters (Mahmut, Yusuf and the ex-wife of Mahmut Nazan) are not opposites. <br /> <br /> Much of this is true all over the world: country's perhaps naive cousin Yusuf's naive expectation that a job on a ship will fall on her lap; The urbanized cynicism of Mahmut and his unwillingness to sympathize with Yusuf. <br /> <br /> Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf's incomprehension that Mahmut might be tolerating his stay with clenched teeth; Yusuf is between macho ambition and the awkwardness of his eyes when he tries to meet a woman. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, Uzak is a pretty grim movie, and one of Ceylan's strengths is not to defeat us in the head with the themes he explores. At least for me, I completely believed in the behavior of his characters. All the small unsuccessful attempts at connection and the small cruelties sound so true. And yet, I did not leave with the message that "the world is like that", but I received: "This is how we treat each other sometimes".
