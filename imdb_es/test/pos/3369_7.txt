Even for science fiction, this movie is a movie is a bit out there. Very well, more than a little ... My first thought after seeing it was that I had just lost my mind. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie waiting for another Darko. Darko fans will never like another Richard Kelly movie because of their strange cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it. <br /> <br /> Richard Kelly loves to make movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the "deeper meaning" the first time you see them. To be honest, I had to watch La Caja twice before I liked it. <br /> <br /> The deeper meaning (to save you a handful of sociological psychopaths) Human beings are self-sufficient, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and we do not open the mail without a return address. <br /> <br /> Summary: The creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz that if you press the button, I'll kill someone you do not know and give you a million dollars. Of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old man she gets a box of money. Then the film is immersed in the unusual. To save my fingers from writing ... To press the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural extraterrestrial beings, in an experiment designed to evaluate the morality of the human race. <br /> <br /> I liked: layout of the film to ignore the generic guidelines of the film. Is different. It is intense. It has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy is material 101). It lets you guess. IT'S NOT A Hollywood END! <br /> <br /> I did not like it: Why would any being with the technology to inhibit another way of life devise such a ridiculous scheme? What god as an extraterrestrial has patience for that? Diaz was good, but was the accent of the country necessary? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I give him a 7 because Kelly did not pay as much attention to detail as in his other films. In general, good movie.
