No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese level direction, but seriously, did you really expect anything from this? The only thing that matters is that this movie is absolutely hilarious, almost at the same level as Borat. Of course, the end is a bit longer, but if Borat's cameo did not make you angry, you must be the worst nut in the history of the kids. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the best LIVE comedian, and here he laughs more than Jude Law on a nude beach. I encourage you not to laugh. <br /> <br /> If you can get the pole ten feet behind for an hour and a half and just enjoy some jokes on time and extremely stupid in a stupid story about a stupid character, look at this stupid movie. You'll be glad you did it. Keep it real!
