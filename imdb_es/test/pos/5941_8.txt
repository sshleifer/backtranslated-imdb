It is true that there are some scenes in this movie that seem a bit unrealistic. The lovely woman first panics and then, just a few minutes later, begins to kiss the young man while the old man is right next to her. But as the movie progresses, we learn that she is a volatile little girl (and whore) and that partly explains her behavior. The cinematography of this movie is well done. We can see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of those images and scenes really increase the tension. GÃ¶tz George plays his character well, an aspiring hot-shot aging and being dominated by young men like the character of Jaennicke. Wolfgang Kieling, whom I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN, offers a great performance that, although it does not say much, is by far the best actor in this work. One critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that, in a real emergency, nothing would really happen. But, again, how realistic are films like Mission Impossible or Telephone Booth? Since we are talking about a movie here, and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that probably do not happen in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. It's much better than a lot of the things I see on German television these days and I think the 80s vintage style added something to this movie.
