I saw this interesting film with the Chinese / French film "2046" at the recent Dubai Film Festival. Both were intelligent works made the same year (2004/2005). Both had the main characters living in a "hotel". In both films, the hotel is more a metaphor for exile than a place. Both treated the love between a man and a woman. Both had wonderful music and fascinating performances. What a coincidence and how the two films differ in the treatment of the subject! Somewhere at the beginning of the film, a man walking on a sidewalk turns to look at a woman and in doing so hits a lamppost. The audience explodes in a volcano of laughter innocently. But is not that brief take the synopsis of the movie, which entertains you for 2 hours? While the film is a wonderful combination of black comedy (eg, Using a stethoscope to listen to a neighbor's conversation), the film is based on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati had introduced to the movies before: stoic faces that they lead to comedy in contrast to the equally intelligent world of Robin Williams or the comforting Danny Kaye. A sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character, while moving money from the hotel to the bank reminds Tati's works. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not a mere comedy. The antiautomatic statement (cash count and the reaction of the bank's staff to statements related to it, the manikin acting as an ineffective warning for the accelerating woman, the reference to "Moulimix" as the fictitious "company" for the one that works, etc.) are several signs that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the spectator. Laugh, yes, but reflect and enjoy more. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film lies in its brief script in staccato (by director Paul Sorrentino) that offers a comedy mixed with philosophy ("The truth is boring," "Dad is dead, but nobody told him "," Bad luck does not exist, it's the invention of the losers and the poor. "Then, the director continues to give him a fascinating lecture from the main character of insomniacs.You will not sleep in this conference. <br /> <br /> Sorrentino It offers entertainment related to the theme that Italians know best: the mafia, it is an existential mafia movie. <br /> <br /> From "The truth is boring", the director offers a dessert as part of the excellent food of the excellent performance (Toni Servillo), the good music, the ingenious camera work (Luca Bigazzi), a beautiful and enigmatic actress (Magnani, Anna's granddaughter and a powerful script.) The dessert is for the viewer to find out if what preceded in the movie was the truth. It's been boring, if it was, right?
