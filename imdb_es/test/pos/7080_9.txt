"One True Thing" is a very quiet film, which premiered in the fall of 1998 with enthusiastic reviews but with a slight box office. Tells the crippled story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to return home to take care of her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep), so that her distant father (William Hurt) can direct her academic department. These terms are only general. The strength of "One True Thing" lies in the way the actors elevate their characters over the territory of the Hollywood clich√©. <br /> <br /> Streep is Kate, the perfect housekeeper whose ability to illuminate a room with her charm is evident in Her first scenes at a costume party celebrating Hurt's birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother, and since graduating from Harvard University, she has a certain disdain for her: Ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic airhead. While on the other hand, she admires her father, who shares a special passion: writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York firm, and is almost disconsolate when Hurt breaks his last piece, which seems to be a very lonely figure. <br /> <br /> To get to the point, Kate gets sick. Ellen's outlook changes and she grows closer to her mother and more distant from her father. Hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and Ellen assumes that she is having an affair. Meanwhile, she has left her desk at work to devote time to manual activities with the "cult" group of her mother, The Minnies, and also learning that her mother is not as weak as she supposed. <br /> <br /> Without giving too much away, "One True Thing" is a masterpiece in the study of characters. Streep once again becomes a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the marriage vows. Streep earned his eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. Hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that is not revealed until the final moments. But it's Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget about "Chicago," "Cold Mountain," "Bridget Jones's Diary" or anything else you've seen her do and rent this movie. She is remarkable in that. Working within her character's bitter resentment for understanding her parents, Zellweger achieves a realistic portrayal of a young woman struggling to stay in shape while screaming inside.
