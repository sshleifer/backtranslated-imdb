The first time I saw this movie was a boy. I was ten years old when it was released, but since my family never went to the movies, I saw it on Network TV. I remember seeing him alone and crying afterwards. It was only the second movie that made that response illegal (Rocky was the first) and there have not been many since. I can not say exactly why; Larry "Rain" Murphy did not deserve to win more than Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time. Stoic. I did not need a stopwatch or the freedom to find dignity. He ran because he could. I did not need another reason. I have a rule today, that when I see this movie late at night on cable TV (the only time most will find it) I should see it, no matter what I have to do the next morning. Fortunately, it is not often played as Shawshank Redemption or other favorites, so I still get enough sleep and I never get tired of the story of a man's unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory.
