A great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from his student days in 1960 to his meeting 10 years later: a Yugoslavian immigrant in love with the American dream and struggling to face reality, often violent; the son of a prematurely bald businessman; A soldier; and the crazy hippie that everyone loves. A good direction and a strong cast do justice to Steve Tesich's brilliant script; the dialogue is not as fast as in "Breaking Away," but the issues of growing up and the father-son conflict are treated just as well, and there are still some wonderfully comical moments between the blows and the drama.
