I can not understand the need to jump back and forth to set the scene and fill in the plot. Show that someone has a skill just before using it, I think, is offending our intelligence. It is beginning to feel a little artificial, and as if they were making amends for being so lazy for the first three series. A bit disappointing about this episode. <br /> <br /> Also, using past quirks, like Locke's ability to know when a storm is ending, is downright insulting ... are we supposed to ooh and arr, or laugh at the softer ones? Locke's side? <br /> <br /> This episode was all over the place.
