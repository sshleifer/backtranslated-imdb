I agree with the guy above, it's so fun that I understand everything, but my friends just do not understand it. Go to Japan and you will see a different movie after being there. When I met my girlfriend's father, at his home in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same as Jack,. scared, but at the end of the day everything was fine, so I give this movie a 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I've seen it at least 30 times, taking it with me to see it on the plane Flying to Japan on next month. One thing that is really good are the scenes of ball games. It makes me feel like I'm there again. This is something you should see if you have any interest in Japan and baseball. Too bad they do not make a sequel. Does anyone know where the scenes of the temple were filmed and the discussion with hirko on the catwalk with a roof over it? I need to know in order to win an argument with my Japanese ex-wife. Thank you
