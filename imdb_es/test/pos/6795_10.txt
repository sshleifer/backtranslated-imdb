After my 6 year old daughter started taking riding lessons, I started looking for horse movies for her. I had always heard of National Velvet, but I had never seen it. Boy, I'm glad I bought it! It has become one of my favorites, my 6 year old son and my 2 year old son. It's a shame that movies like this one are not made.
