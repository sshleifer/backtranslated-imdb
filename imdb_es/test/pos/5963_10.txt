Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian-born animator who lived in France and who did amazing things using the stop motion. I have seen a couple of these movies before and present their favorite themes: insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and realistic, and even today they are incredible to see, the quality is simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> This one has many stars and many frogs. They call on their god, Jupiter, to give them a king. Why do they need a king? Asks Jupiter: their lives are perfectly fine now. Then, to teach them an unpleasant lesson, he makes an Egret the king and one by one start eating his subjects. Then, the frogs once more appeal to Jupiter, who affirms the obvious moral that it is better to be happy with what you have. <br /> <br /> While the quality of the animation is incredible, this is a very spooky movie for children. I would think that this would terrify them both because of the real appearance of the animals and because of the history itself, which is not for the faint of heart!
