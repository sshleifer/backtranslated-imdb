Silent historical drama based on the story of Anne Boleyn, maid of honor newly arrived to the Queen who catches the attention of Henry VIII, moody king of England who loves to feast, drink, hunt, be entertained by his court. jester, look at the jousts and chase young beauties who jump from the cakes and a variety of attractive females around the castle. Well, he soon quashed his marriage, married Anne and told her that it is his sacred duty to produce a male heir. She fails in that regard and he will soon notice another maid of honor. Meanwhile, Anne spends almost all the film hesitant, disturbed or frankly ready to burst into tears. She just does not appear like a happy camper (or is it just a bad act ?!). <br /> <br /> This movie is a solid piece of entertainment, with an absorbing story that kept my interest for two hours. Also, I liked seeing the luxurious medieval costumes that are shown here in a beautiful sepia print. Emil Jannings is quite striking and memorable in his well done representation of King Henry VIII: it really looked like it was Henry VIII. I'm not so sure of the performance given by the actress who plays Anne, it seemed a little exaggerated. The DVD of this film presents an appropriate and well-made piano score that fits perfectly into this story. Quite a good movie.
