This movie is amazing because the fact that real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do a good job is as if they were almost living the past again. Jia Hongsheng interprets himself as an actor who abandons everything, except music and drugs that fight against depression and seek the meaning of life while getting angry with everyone, especially with the people who care most. There are moments in the movie that will make you want to cry because the family, especially the father, did a good job. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people suffering from depression will understand Hongsheng's problem and why he does the things he does, for example, he stays locked in a dark room or goes for a walk or bike ride alone. Others may see the film as boring because it is so real that it is almost like a documentary. In general, this movie is great and Hongsheng deserved an Oscar for this movie, just like his dad.
