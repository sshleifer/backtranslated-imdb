This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our superficial and commercially oriented values ​​is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the cliché of "war is hell", underlined by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with an extreme prejudice) a rebellious colonel, who has left behind the concepts of justice of the army to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a very defective masterpiece. In particular, I found that the final segment of the trip with Brando, which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness, is quite boring. Finally I was able to see Apocalypse Now Redux and the defects have been resolved. Redux makes the film a masterpiece, without a doubt, among the 100 best films ever made. Brando's performance now seems complete and complete, perhaps a little less mysterious, but much deeper. Martin Sheen is brilliant in the heart of one of the best ensembles of actors that have come together. It's great to see a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. in the first screen presentations that suggest which good actors will eventually be recognized. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional images. If you have never seen this movie, skip the original and head directly to Redux. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece.
