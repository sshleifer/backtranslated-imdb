These movies just do not get the credit they deserve. This is my second favorite movie of all time (Stand by Me is the first.) The reason I saw this movie was because Wil Wheaton was in it and he is my favorite person in the whole world and I think he did an incredible job in This movie and so did Sean Astin. I actually saw it last night and it surprised me. Everything in the movie is very exceptional. The script, the acting, the script. I was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mother was not in the room, I would have been absolutely insane every time Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I did not expect that! Absolutely!! I was very surprised when I found out that it was not very popular in the 90s. I was born a few years after it came out, so, of course, I did not go to see it in theaters, but I'm sure I would have if I had been alive. If any of my friends saw this, I would say, "uhh, okay?" but that only makes them not cool enough to appreciate a job like this. If you have not seen this movie or want to see something that is the bomb, this is the movie for you to see.
