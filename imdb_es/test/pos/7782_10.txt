It very rarely happens that I sit down to write a comment for a movie ... but this movie !!!!!! Oh my God! There was never a better Hindi movie than this one. ...... and a movie never got better than this ...... is the king of all the comedies ..... <br /> <br /> aamir khan is possibly the best comic actor in The Indian film industry ... although it's funny to say it because it's a class act, not a comedian ... but what he's done in this movie is perhaps the most hilarious performance of any Indian actor in a comedy. .. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan has never been a good actor in my eyes ... but this movie brought out the best in him ... it was innocently funny ... if there was ever a Term like that. .. just what the doctor ordered in regards to his role in the film ... <br /> <br /> rajkumar santoshi, I do not know why, I never tried the comedy again. ... he directed great adventures like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Khakee, but he could not recreate the magic of Andaz Apna Apna ... <br /> <br /> I do not care why this movie was bombed at the box office .. Although I feel sad because a film like "hum aapke hain kaun" was the reason for its failure ... from now on I hope that the rumors come true ... there will be "andaz apna apna-2", they say .. We, as a public, can only say AMEN!
