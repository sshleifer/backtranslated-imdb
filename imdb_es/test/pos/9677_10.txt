When I saw this program for the first time, I was 9 years old and it caught my attention immediately when Stewie tried to call Lois by phone at the hotel. I laughed and kept looking. When the episode ended, I wrote the name of the cartoon and saw it regularly. This is separated from the Simpsons and other programs in, for example, Cartoon Network because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it's TV-14 for a reason. The film is cut quickly after each line of stroke and the funny and funny movements and the behavior of the characters make it special. The talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and the voice of many characters in the show. A good song, and a crazy family that always has something funny, makes this my favorite caricature in Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Check it out, it's kind of funny.
