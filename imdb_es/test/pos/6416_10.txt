In the last days of the year 1999, almost everyone in Taiwan has died. A strange plague has devastated the island. Supposedly spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims to a psychosis in which they act like insects. With time, they die. The Hole takes place in a dilapidated apartment building (which is especially well-made - congratulations to the designer of scenography!). Its two protagonists live right above and below the other. The woman is on the lower floor, and the pipes over her apartment are leaking fiercely, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her sanity. She calls a plumber to check it, and he accidentally makes a hole in the floor of the man's apartment. The two have never met before, and come into contact through the hole. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty bright. Few films are simultaneously so funny while remaining completely human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially the feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai's address is simply beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese directors, he uses many long shots. But unlike, say, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai does not overuse them. In fact, I do not know if I've ever seen them use them better. They are always effective and never tedious. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to review this movie without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes, The Hole is also a musical, and a great one, in that. In the best scenes of the film, which is to say something, considering how good the other scenes are, the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are totally choreographed, often with backup dancers and singers. In a stroke of genius, Tsai caused these elaborate numbers to occur in the crumbling building, the signs of apocalypse and decadence not hidden. This provides both a sense of pathos and absurdity. <br /> <br /> The Hole is a movie that begs to be seen. It should be a cult classic, if nothing else. Before going to see this, they told me it was a decent movie, but probably the least good of Tsai Ming-liang. Well, if that's true, I can not wait to see someone else! 10/10.
