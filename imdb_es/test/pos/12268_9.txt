This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialogue is clear, the rhythm is fast. Not only is it an intelligent comedy, it is also an interesting look at what happens behind the scenes in the television news business. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun lines ... a couple of my favorites: <Br /> <br /> Ernie Merriman: (sarcastically) It must be good to believe whenever you know more, always think you're the person smarter in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's horrible !! <br /> <br /> Aaron: He must be handsome Jane: How do you know? Aaron: Nobody invites a bad-looking idiot to his room! <br /> <br /> The performances of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack! I love the scene where the newsroom staff rushes to meet a deadline. There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to choose a favorite. I highly recommend this movie.
