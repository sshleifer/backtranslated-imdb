Sit down and let the Bharatbala Director take us on a visual and sensual journey of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say that you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has rhythm and keeps us moving in directions that can only exist in India. If you did not want to visit India before this movie, you will surely want to visit it now. This movie has dancers, a chase scene and the gangster involved. But it has much more. Thank you, Bharatbala, for taking us to such an energetic and wonderful story. I loved the end. Women do not want illusions in life, we want reality. PS I was Carolyn's friend at the Sonoma Film Festival and I met you briefly. Good luck with your distribution efforts and I'm talking about the movie a storm.
