Some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons, one to eat, one to breathe and another to s ** ting ... This is not a movie for them ... <br /> <br /> But for those who they enjoy using the brain ... the whole movie is a metaphor, everything is there with a purpose, every detail, the coffee cup, the red sofa, everything ... it is an underestimated masterpiece ... <br /> < It's hilarious, it's raw and totally realistic, that's how we really interact ... it's a real comedy ... total causality ... <br /> <br /> Just wait, do not do it. Do not let the first scene surprise you ... wait ... and enjoy the show ...
