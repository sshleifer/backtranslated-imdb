This is the movie is probably one of the best I've seen so far. I would put it in second place after All About Lily Chou-chou because it gives me the same wave ... '9 souls' are approximately 9 prisoners who have just escaped from jail to go look for some fake money saved in a capsule moment in the fuji primary school. Later they discover that there was not much there and they set out on their own paths. The first half of the film is just a moment for the characters to introduce themselves and for the main points to be established. It's a funny but serious part of the trip. The second half, it made me cry. As the film progresses, each character tries to fulfill his dreams, but unfortunately ends up a little bad. at the end there are only 2 of the 9 fugitives left. The way each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes. A beautiful film directed fantastically. This is a movie for people who have enjoyed other Toshiaki Toyoda movies, such as 'Blue Spring'.
