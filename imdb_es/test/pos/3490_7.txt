If you like his show, you may be a little disappointed. This movie has some very funny moments and the laughs are pretty constant, but none is as memorable or as fun as the things on the show. The start sequence is really silly and fun, and a great start. Yes! Borat makes a cameo. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan, look at it! If you do not know or do not like it, then do not bother. 6.5 / 10
