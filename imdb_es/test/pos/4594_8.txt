"Idiocracy" is the latest film that comes from Mike "Office Space" Judge, and certainly follows a similar theme from that movie in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity ... in relative terms . It's a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is literally the most common type in existence. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), become test subjects for a military project of a hibernation camera. They must remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of supervision, Joe and Rita forget and accidentally rise 500 years in the future. <br /> <br /> Here is the terrifying part: This movie explains: in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 became quite retarded. Without natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the fastest, smartest and strongest people for the progression of genes ... only people who reproduce more. Unfortunately, those people are idiots who suck well-being and who are raised like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of stupid people has caused an adverse effect on the growth of society and now Joe and Rita are the two most intelligent human beings on the face of the planet. If it helps you, imagine the whole population as a hybrid of southern peasants, sportsmen, cholos and fanatics. Seeing this nightmarish dystopia, Joe finds out and tries to track down a time machine to see if he and Rita can come back when they came, and that's basically the whole plot. <br /> <br /> But despite how -dimensional I can make it sound, this movie is higher than you can imagine. The nuances are everywhere and anyone can see flashes (warning signs, so to speak) of the modern facets of everyday life and turn it into a train crash on display in "Idiocracy". The movie has some really impressive examples of realistic delay placed on a pedestal. I do not want to reveal anything and ruin jokes for you, but let's say it's quite exhaustive. I can see how some would say that it is just a lot of toilet humor, but, oddly enough, it has a purpose; to show how silly and rude these people are. <br /> <br /> This movie, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "Office Space"; No one will see it in theaters, but everyone will boast of discovering this incredible and funny movie when it comes out on video. My only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative is sometimes broken so that they can make a Hitchhiker's-Guide-to-the-Galaxy exhibition about how things got to where they are, but it is a necessary evil. It is better implemented here. Apart from that, good characters, funny jokes and better than average social commentaries wrapped in a funny bow. <br /> <br /> Final note: If seeing our youth become the desire of gang members, we act like Redneck / ghetto trash and be proud of it ... if you are educated and cultured in some way and you can see how our country is out of control and becomes an abyss of stupidity, for the love of God, watch this movie.
