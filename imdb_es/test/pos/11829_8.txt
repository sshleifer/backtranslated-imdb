Interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination, Son of the Gods is too long and contains a bit of hammy acting, but overall it's still a fascinating movie. <br /> <br /> Story about a Chinese who passes as a target (Rchard Barthelmess) begins when Barthelmess leaves the university after being insulted by a trio of brainless fellow students. He embarks on a world tour to discover himself and ends up as the secretary of a British playwright (Claude King). In Monte Carlo he meets the beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and they fall in love. But when he discovers that he is Chinese, he goes crazy in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Affected by guilt and love, Alanna goes into a mental spiral and makes some attempts to get in touch with Barthelmess. After his father dies, he takes over the business (banking?) And puts on a Chinese outfit as a symbol of his hatred of the white race that has rejected him. After a San Francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth, Barthelmess makes the decision to honor his Chinese father and mother. <br /> <br /> And I accept that a critic here never saw this movie. Alanna declares her love for Sam BEFORE she tells her about her recent discovery. And that makes all the difference in this movie. <br /> <br /> Barthelmess and Bennett have some scenes where they chew the stage, but in general this is a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is good like the good friend of the university, Claude King is solid like the dramatist Bathurst, Bess Flowers has a scene like an Indian of Oklahoma, and E. Alyn Warren is the Chinese father, Dorothy Mathews is the nasty Alice. Not so good are Anders Randolf as Bennett's father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen. Also note the beautiful blonde to the right of Barthelmess at the roulette table. What a wonder, whoever it was!
