Bridges' drama about a reporter who discovers some flaws in the safety precautions taken in a nuclear engine is well directed and is a very interesting movie from the late 70s. It's not surprising, but it's solid, the acting is pretty good, Especially Jack Lemmon, but Douglas and Fonda were good too. It was a good script and the direction of Bridges was solid and adequate. This is definitely not one of the best movies of the 70s, but it is one of the best. A good early movie by Michael Douglas and Lemmon at its best .--- IMDb rating: 7.2, my rating:, so in simple words, solid but not surprising ... that's what this movie is, solid but not surprising 8/10
