Let me start by saying that I was VERY surprised with the production value of this film. I managed to see an early presentation and I have to say that this is the BEST (if not only) Christian film to reach the cinemas from La Pasi√≥n. <br /> <br /> Do not let the PG-13 rating frighten you. , the rating is adequate due to the serious problems that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teenage pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but nothing in the film is free. This is definitely a movie that a junior high school group could see without bothering most parents, and the message is wonderful. Best of all, it's not a movie FOR Christians, it's a family movie without the cheesy feeling of 7th Heaven. <br /> <br /> The laughter is there, and several times in the theater everyone laughed, the fragments of the humor was natural and it did not seem to be written or forced, and that contributed to a good rhythm in a film so serious . Teenagers and young adults, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many, if not all, of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see these problems addressed in this type of film. The plot is not in any way predictable, and in the end it comes closer to home than many admit. Christians, fortunately, do not show themselves as all the powerful know that everything is in "The Word", but that people simply try to understand life. Human beings make mistakes and nobody is perfect, not even in this movie ... far from it. <br /> <br /> The performance is top notch, the place where it is written, and you are not hit by the Head with all the Christian rhetoric preacher. This is a great movie that will make you and your teenagers think, talk, and perhaps question your own morality (or lack of it). If you want to watch a quality family movie in January, check your local listings for this movie and you might learn something about yourself. <br /> <br /> And I'm a 25-year-old man who just wanted to watch a free video. movie.
