I totally agree with the other poster. NEMESIS is one of the best adaptations of Christie with an excellent plot and cast. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Liz Fraser participates as the mother of the murder victim is a study on how to act at the best level. This underestimated woman was a favorite in British films in the 1960s that never had great success in American films. Watch her as Julie Andrews' friend in 1964 THE AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY. <br /> <br /> All the perfs in this product have the opportunity to shine with and without the incomparable Ms. Hickson who was never chosen for an Emmy for her work Marple. I am ashamed of them! And dig the lesbian agents of the CID! :)
