A heartbreaking masterpiece about the sheer madness and despair of war, Fires on the Plain (Nobi) will not be to everyone's taste: this is a war movie in the true sense of the term, one that does not appeal to the wave flags. Patriotism or sacral sentimentality. Nobi cuts deeply, is ugly, dark and gloomy as few things ever committed on the celluloid. This is the war behind the cannons, without triumphs or heroes, neither victories nor moral defeats, only a handful of emaciated and terrible-looking men scattered across a land devastated by war like the penitents fleeing a great disaster. The characters challenge moral judgment because they are creatures harassed by great pain, a woe that does not allow questions of a moral nature. War and survival. Facing the will of one against the other in a battlefield. The loser is simply removed from existence. <br /> <br /> Tamura, a soldier in the Japanese imperial army, is discharged from his platoon and ordered to report to a nearby hospital because he coughed up blood and the rest did not like it. of the peloton. He is told never to return and instead commits suicide with a hand grenade in case the hospital rejects him. What it does The hospital is nothing more than a shack made of wooden boards and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he is able to walk, it is fine. It is in that lamentable excuse of a hospital where one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place. As the area is bombarded by American planes, doctors and those who can walk and hold off flee the hospital and into the forest. Moments before the hospital is destroyed, the demacro and crippled figures of the sick and wounded crawl out of it in all positions, dressed in their sickly white clothes, as if the building were a kind of beast throwing viscera and trash. on the earth <br /> <br /> That's Nobi's biggest success; The crude and melancholic description of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images, without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. Soldiers cross a swamp, wade to their knees in the mud, move across the opposite bank and enter a field only to discover the enemy tanks hidden in the forest, their lights shining like evil eyes as they explore the darkness. A procession of wounded soldiers, dirty and half crazy, crossing a road, falling to the ground in the sound of enemy planes. Hawks that feed on a bunch of corpses. An abandoned town. A mad soldier who is believed to be a Buddha sitting under a tree, covered in flies and his own excrement, offering his arm to be eaten by Tamura when he is dead. These are the images that Kon Ichikawa evokes for our eyes, ruthless and unwavering in their aim, but honest and raw. <br /> <br /> Nobi does not rush to get anywhere. He is content to follow Tamura's travels across the war-torn land as he tries to reach the Palomat regroupment center, and observe the madness and obscenities of the war. The film wanders through the mud of the horror of war, slow and melancholy, like the characters that follow. The last thirty minutes with Tamura taking refuge with two deserters who feed on "monkey meat" are as close as Nobi adheres to conventional narratives and, for that matter, they are no less powerful. Surprisingly photographed in black and white, with excellent performances by the cast and the safe direction of Ichikawa, Nobi is not only among the best war movies ever made, but also among the best in Japanese cinema.
