When THE CHINA SYNDROME was published, many right-wing critics and pro-nuke supporters ruined this film, particularly because its three main stars were known for their liberal politics and their manifest distrust of nuclear power. But it only took two weeks and an almost catastrophic accident on Three Mile Island to silence those critics. <br /> <br /> Fonda and Douglas are the Los Angeles news team that witnesses a potentially unpleasant accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant. Douglas films the event through the soundproof glass of the plant; but the television station will not transmit the images, for fear of a massive demand. Therefore, it is up to Fonda and Douglas to get to the truth, despite a massive attempt by the owners of the plant to cover up the accident. <br /> <br /> But a conscientious change supervisor (Jack Lemmon) has discovered certain flaws in the support structure of the plant's pump. He believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that, although it would be extremely costly and long, if repairs are not made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. But he can not get anyone who works with him to create his story. The result is a nightmarish climax that brings together several stories of political, technological and human interest in a disturbing package. <br /> <br /> Although obviously of a very political nature, THE SYNDROME OF CHINA, well directed and co-written by James Bridges (THE PAPER CHASE), is also, fundamentally, a film of messages about the dangers inherent in uniting the technology and nuclear energy. Fundamentally, nuclear energy can NEVER be made safe because people can NEVER be perfect. That's what the movie says; and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way, he says it brilliantly.
