Eisenstein created the Russian theory of montage, and this film is his best example. Years passed before someone could use their ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). Nonetheless, the baby stroller scene really demonstrates the discombobulated nature of RMT. Of course, like most movies, it gets long in some parts, the beauty of the movie is incredible. One of the best silent movies I've seen.
