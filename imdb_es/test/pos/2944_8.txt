This movie was entertaining and stimulating. I would recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, direction, and it's Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The places in Ontario evoked such nostalgia for the time. With so much garbage and superficial exaggerations selling these days, it's great to see that someone could endorse an independent film. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or obstacle, be it financial or due to illness, this movie plays a resonant chord! It approaches the idea of ​​future life in a contemporary way, without cheaply capitalizing on all the "supernatural" and supernatural themes that have become basic elements in Hollywood and television networks.
