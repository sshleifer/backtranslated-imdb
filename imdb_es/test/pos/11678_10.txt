THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! The decadence of Western civilization ...... what a great title, huh? And thick a great movie. This is the best concert movie I've seen in my life. A closer second is the Talking Heads movie "Stop Making Sense". The first time I heard of this movie was when Waynes World came to light in 1992. I looked at the name of the director Penelope Spheeris and I thought it was a great name, what else has she directed? I thought that the first name was pronounced as envelope. After a while looking for movie guides, I found the critically acclaimed Declined and realized that Penelope was a woman ... my mom corrected me. I spent 8 years of my life trying to locate this. I finally saw it on VHS in Vancouver, where I currently live. The wait was worth it. This captures very well the punk movement of Los Angeles. This is teenage angst in its best people. My favorite is the band of germs that need subtitles for the lyrics because Darby Crash sings so crazy you can not understand it. I laughed when I saw this. The Black Flag band lives in an abandoned church and the X band is a very intelligent group. He also laughed at the letter that an idiot writes to Slash Magazine about how we do not need to save the whales, there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins! I became a big fan of Penelope Spheeris after this, and I saw all his punk movies: Dudes was fine, and Suburbia is a cult classic. I own these two on VHS. She is a true underground filmmaker and I love her things. I would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular. I was a big Nirvana fan then, but unfortunately I saw it in 2002 and at that time I had already grown out of grunge and now I listen to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim. A whole change of pace, I know, but what can you do? But if you want a true representation of the punk movement, this captures it better than anything. Much better than 1991: The Year Punk Broke. It's a difficult movie to track, but if you get it, rent it, even if you do not like music, it's an excellent piece of work. Nowadays, it could be easier to find them with the popular DVDs. By the way, Penelope produced a little known film by Albert Brooks called "Real Life", which I also own. Very funny things in today's reality show craptacular! Rent Decline ...... Highly recommended! Thank you!
