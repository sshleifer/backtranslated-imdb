If you expect this movie to be full of action and catch you from the beginning, then do not see it. But if you like that kind of meditative movies that stay in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you'll love it. Now, do not get me wrong, there is action and there are things that happen, not in the usual way. <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone struggles on his (or her) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak ... I do not want to write anymore so as not to spoil the film for you, but trust me if you like SF authors like Lem or Capec or even some of Orson Scott Card. I love this movie.
