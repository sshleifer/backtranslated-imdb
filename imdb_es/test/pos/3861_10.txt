<br /> <br /> As cats have nine lives, I'll give you nine reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> * The Berlioz and Toulouse kittens play the piano together (incredibly cute!) * The dogs that chase Napoleon and Lafayette * Toulouse jump like electrified every time he wants to be like a tough stray cat * Marie sighing romantically while street cat O'Malley seduces his mother * Scat Cat and his jazz band, singing "ev 'rybody wants to be a cat' * Stupid but proper and nice English gals Amelia and Abigail that make cats walk like geese * O'Malley getting the "magic carpet" that embarrasses the Cheshire cat * Roquefort is the courageous journey of the mouse to ask help from street cats * Edgar, the butler, chases the scenes and the transition from a good guy to a madman who hates cats because the cats evacuation plan has been spoiled.
