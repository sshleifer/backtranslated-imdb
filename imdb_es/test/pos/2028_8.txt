WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I've seen in my life. The original idea of ​​the script focuses on a young singer of the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the time. Not only is he playing his music to the note, but he is also living the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, fate plays a good turn, and he is hired to replace the main singer of the idol band. A dream come true? Well almost. By starting to live the life of the famous, including the excesses of drugs and sex from the rock scene of the 80s, he will also have to face the problems in the relationship with his supportive girlfriend, and finally he will have to answer questions about creativity and I have a said in the music of the band. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, one of the reasons is that it is one of the first times the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic way. The fans of the musical genre will be satisfied with the soundtrack. The general idea is original, and the themes of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are presented in a sensible and balanced way. The acting is pretty good, with Mark Wahlberg better than in most of the other action films I saw him lately, and Jennifer Aniston in tune with the role of the pretty girl who knows a lot about life. More problematic is the ending, which is quite conventional and may disappoint. It seems that the main character after giving up the great and famous band has found its own creative path. However, in an ironic twist, the music that plays in the club at the end is the worst of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale. It is worth seeing, however, expect to be exposed to a high dose of metal. If you do not like this kind of music, you can choose to avoid this movie.
