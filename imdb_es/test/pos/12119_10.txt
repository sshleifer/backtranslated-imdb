Samuel Fuller knows the war, and is one of the only directors in the history of American cinema who could accurately portray the horrific experiences of it in a way like the movie. His pessimism and idealism, if that sounds a bit strange to mix, works for him as a storyteller, and at the same time he is always willing to tell the truth, however brutal it may be (or put into melodramatic constructions) that he can get . However, Verboten deals with the postwar experience, since we only get in the initial scenes the great boom of WAR, in bold for a point. The first shot is like a big exclamation point that seems to continue in the rest of the scenes: a soldier killed on the ground, the camera shrinks, we see another soldier shot down in a field devastated by the war. Simple, direct language. Then Fuller punctuates the intensity with something interesting: the title song played the opening credits as irony and sincerity, and then the music of Beethoven during a gun battle between the Americans and the Nazis. Sergeant David Brent (James Best) is shot, the battle continues, and then he is treated for his injuries. <br /> <br /> It may lead one to believe that this will be a somewhat conventional WW2 movie. (Somehow in that, one does not usually find Beethoven and, later, to a certain extent, Wagner puts it in these images), but this is not the case. Instead, Fuller makes this a kind of film "back home", but not at all in the sense that "this soldier comes home hurt and so on." Instead of actually going home, Brent stays in Germany, as he has fallen madly for the woman, Helga (Susan Cummings, good enough to remove the German accent), and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the army, so who can marry her What she does not realize is that a) she wants him more for money so she can get food for herself and her brother, however, this gets emotionally complicated at the time of the revelation for Brent, a little naive but sincere, and b) there is a Hitler youth sect called the werewolves, who want to start where Hitler ended, starting little by little, despite the discussions within the group, attacking the same government that is now embedded in Germany to give them, as Brent describes it, a "blood transfusion". "With this, in addition to the images of the Nuremberg trials, and (as narrated, I think, by Fuller himself) a quick and uncomplicated story of Nazi war crimes piece by piece, we get a multifaceted vision of a society In the difficult situation of an immediate postwar environment, while Rossellini handled it in his own way with Germany Year Zero, Fuller tackles it with layers: first is the love story, or what is the tragic fall of a man who can not see nothing beyond what he thinks should be reasonable, which is his thing.Wife and a son on the road he can not leave, until the revelation that he (in part) has been swindled Baker and Cummings, along with Harold Daye as the young and confused brother of Helga, they act with the maximum detail of the emotions, these are not parts of the B movie very easy, although they could have been that.Then, another layer is the politics, the struggle of a society by face the c and a mentality that becomes sensational, no doubt, by Fuller, with respect to making the Nazis a thing without gray areas. : they are evil, particularly when they cancel the reason to achieve their ends. <br /> <br /> And finally there is the style layer, which is strangely absorbent. Probably, this is one of Fuller's 'talkiest' movies, which is not bad, since it is one of his best written scripts, since the characters do not speak in a simple way or in too many places (with the exception of a small scene where two characters speak of Hitler's youth as juvenile delinquents, which is actually, according to Fuller's autobiography, probably another layer to consider in the subtext and the 50s period of the movies). And Fuller shoots this almost in a true European style, when he does not go for battle scenes or battles, since editing is not always very fast and, sometimes, a cut does not happen for a full minute or more. There is a strange tension that arises from this, especially when there is something that says a character that causes another to go crazy or suspicious; Fuller could easily get a great close-up, but there is a colder and sinister quality to not get away from two people in a conversation without a simple over-the-shoulder deal. But when he needs it, like the big fight outside the US military office, or the Nuremburg recording together with Franz's memories of werewolves, Fuller can be as impressive a stylist as ever. <br /> <br /> Very hard to find, but it's worth it if you're a fan of the movies of the director or of the Second World War in Germany, or even a history buff, Verboten! it is a very strong intellectual and emotional experience, with a cast that is better than expected in a B film, and an attitude towards the "other" that is equally condemnatory and stimulating.
