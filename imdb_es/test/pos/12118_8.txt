I enjoyed this for a couple of reasons. The emotional entanglement was sometimes confusing and resolved imperfectly, but the combination of news images with the narrative of the film was often convincing. The other element that I appreciated was the representation of the werewolves, the fanatical Nazis who continued the fight after the formal surrender. I do not know of another movie that deals with them. They murdered Burgomaster Oppenhoff of Aachen on Palm Sunday of 1945, for example, and created problems for the occupation. The film, then, challenges the disinfected version of victory and occupation with some gritty realities. The "human problems" are presented not so much through the characters here, but through the historical reality that was affecting those who had survived Hitler, both conquered and victorious.
