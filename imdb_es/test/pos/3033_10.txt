Excellent story of a dedicated young teacher who teaches children belonging to minorities in an area near South Carolina. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight is simply tremendous as the idealistic, dedicated and idealistic teacher who faces this challenge in spite of a director, who believes in severe discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques, as well as a superintendent of the old school who plays with pleasure for the late Hume Cronyn. Madge Sinclair is the director who loves her babies. <br /> <br /> As I am a retired teacher, I could somehow relate to this excellent film. The ignorance shown here, as well as the lack of cooperation with officials, is also quite evident in urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voight realizes that these children need much more than traditional classroom teachings. He makes them go out and experience life for themselves by learning outdoors. <br /> <br /> The ending is a definite disappointment but so faithful to life. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that such backward students had enthusiasm. For learning and they were well disciplined. I guess that answers my question. The behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their surroundings. <br /> <br /> The end will only pull your heart. It was memorable and very moving.
