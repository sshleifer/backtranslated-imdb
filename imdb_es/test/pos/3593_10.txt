David Attenborough brings his fascination with wildlife, this time creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary journey of 8 episodes to all animals under the sea! <br /> <br /> The cinematography is amazing, bringing to the screen really impressive images of those whales! But the best thing about this, besides watching each episode, is how they did it! Whether it's creatures models or those impressive shots of whales, they explain in about 10 minutes how they did it! <br /> <br /> 2001 had some great TV shows on our screen. But, in contrast to this documentary gem, they make them quite lame! But not even boast of this documentary series as the best television series of 2001 does not summarize the absolute brightness that this series offers in quality entertainment! <br /> <br /> In general, this is the best television series of 2001, with No competition, and, perhaps, the best TV series of the 2000s!
