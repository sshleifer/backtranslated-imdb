One of Alfred Hitchcock's three best films, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps", "Strangers On A Train" is as brilliantly out of control as a merry-go-round in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. It's the kind of movie where you have so much fun that you can not even feel guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath. <br /> <br /> The best amateur tennis contestant, Guy Haines (Farley Granger), finds a strange weird stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the pages of gossip, Bruno knows everything about Guy's problems with his not good wife, Miriam, and happily suggests that they do themselves a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father, who wants to put Bruno in an institution. . Guy laughs, but Bruno is not kidding, since Guy finds out about his risk. <br /> <br /> It's a great premise for a murder story, and Hitchcock gives "Strangers On A Train" a career worthwhile for everyone, with the help of Walker in perhaps the best performance in any movie of Hitchcock, including Anthony Perkins in "Psycho". While Perkins leaves his mark playing against the grain, Walker, like Anthony, is perfectly at home, either with the butter of the old ladies in an elegant dinner or strangles a young woman in an amusement park. <br /> <br /> What drives Bruno? ? Many commentators suggest that his apparent homosexuality finds a coincidence in nice Guy. Yes, Bruno turns on the old gay-dar, but Guy seems quite happy with the bounce of love with the socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest in Guy could easily be enviable, for someone who is making a mark in the world while living at home, letting Mom pick her nails. <br /> <br /> "Oh, I certainly admire people who do things," Bruno purrs, like a cat looking at a mouse. "You know, it must be very exciting to be so important." <br /> <br /> Later, Bruno calls himself a "lazy", accurate enough, except for our great interest in him, even when he destroys Guy's life. With his homicidal meddling. It is the last story of the evil perverse. There is a sense of integrity about Bruno, in his tenacious dedication, which demands our respect and that Hitchcock plays with such brilliance. When Bruno moves away from the scene of his great crime, am I the only sick person in this world who is really happy for him? I do not think so, but Hitchcock keeps the story in a correct enough way for us to realize how low we have fallen. We do not want Bruno to win, exactly, but we enjoy his momentum as he tries. <br /> <br /> Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. Hitchcock always achieved at least 2-3 good sequences of pieces per film; Here you have a score of them in the amusement park alone. ("20 Big Shows," says the neon side at the entrance, and they're not kidding). Screenplay, camera work, an exciting tennis match, the figure of Ruth Roman that leaves her speechless, is too big for a movie. . Even Granger does his crazy young thing here with a more credible possibility than Gregory Peck has ever achieved. <br /> <br /> You can call this a clinic in the making of movies, but "clinic" sounds too boring. "Strangers On A Train" is fun and nasty, and it leaves you with an ingenious sting in the tail when you realize that you were always encouraging the wrong stranger. Heck, I'm going to take that trip again in a second!
