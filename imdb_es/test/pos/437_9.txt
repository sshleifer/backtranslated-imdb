The homage of Jean Renoir to Paris at the end of the 19th century is beautiful in many ways. Not only does it seem to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, but it portrays the geographical Paris; the streets accessible only by stairs, the unpleasant end of the fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell, in an intransigent image of the world of spectacle that contrasts with the image painted by Hollywood. An obvious comparison can be made with Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street," which was made about 20 years earlier, featuring Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation, a cool-faced child from the clubs who had come to New York to enter. show business, which saves the show when the star fails: "You'll go out there a choir boy, but you have to return a STAR!" The "Julian Marsh" by Warner Baxter is a director who suffers for his art and is not appreciated. Jean Gabin's "Danglard" remains in conflict with genital politics, but when he talks about the program, he is more like Knute Rockne than Julian Marsh. He is all about the game, except for his pointy point. He has a new and profitable business sewn until his lover becomes jealous of the woman she recognizes as his next lover. Your prospects go up and down with each coital trip you take. <br /> <br /> Danglard takes Ama 1 (Lola de Castro, played by Maria Felix) to a dive, where she sees "Nini" (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover, Paulo the baker, and Discover that she is a spirit dancer. He uses his charm and the prospect of money to attract Nini to study dance so that she can take the stage. The prospect of money and fame delights Nini, and she becomes Danglard's next lover, as well as a fit Cancan student, whom Danglard has dubbed "French Cancan" to cater to the current Anglophile trend in dance. <br /> <br /> Both "42nd St" and "French Cancan" are homages to the show, to modern entertainment, which has its own iconography and its own concept. "42 St. focuses on Julian Marsh, a great director of Broadway shows, who organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual participation.The male juvenile is a middle-aged imbecile with lumbago, replaced by Dick Powell, the beautiful tenor with a secret wealth to hide.Danglard, on the other hand, goes from woman to woman, seducing them with the promise of fame, hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment.There is no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active. Postcoital scenes abound. <br /> <br /> Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo, he discovered Esther, a Piaf type, and started preparing her for his work of singing the theme song of the movie while playing it in His violin ... That, of course, arouses Nini's jealousy, just as she has aroused Lola's jealousy (and, of course, Nini had already given up the privilege of being a Zarina!) The whole movie is about how the concupiscenc Danglard's has cost him money, but how his problematic tenderness is subordinated to his love for the show, how the public demands devotion. and it is this powerful combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero, while claiming that a true show lover will never benefit as much as the men of money. At the conclusion of the film, Danglard, having outdone creditors and jealous babies, approaches a new attraction by watching the incredible (and believe me, it IS amazing) Cancan's performance. "Have you ever thought about being on stage?" he asks, and the curtain descends. Meanwhile, poor Julian is sitting on the fire escape of the theater listening to the new fans of Peggy Sawyer despise his contribution to the success of the show. (I'm not even going to enter the center line of "42nd Street", "Oh, Guy, it was BIG to come!") <br /> <br /> Also, I will not get into the glimpse one gets from the legendary artists Parisians, including a brief vision of Piaf, and the vision of an urban and rural Paris. There is certainly a sample of the styles that spawned Trenet and Aznavour. But it is the memory of an assertive and welcome masculinity, something invisible in any Hollywood musical with which it can be compared, it is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of the Hollywood musicals of the 30s (including my dear Fred Astaire, not to mention Dick Powell). and much less the barf promulgated by MGM in films like the repulsive "American in Paris". All those sources! We will keep our comparison of that turkey with "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and its deconstruction of the American male for another day. <br /> <br /> That Danglard may have been a hopeful vision, in postwar France, of some kind of hyper-masculine mec that may or may not have ever existed, makes virtually no sense. That he is a man of man, neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton, is perhaps more successful. That he is a man who likes ladies is never questioned. I, for my part, would not mind living his life at all. I wonder if Gabin was so lucky. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this comment, I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and about what Sinclair Lewis called "boloney". I never got that far. Moulin Rouge de Baz ... well, Paris does not put that kind of stuff on the Seine anymore.
