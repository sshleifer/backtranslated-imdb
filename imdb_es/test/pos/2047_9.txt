Rent this, I have the DVD, I have it for $ 9.99. A robbery being so underestimated. Sure, there are better movies. Movies with less or no hole in the plot or action. But I do not have that problem with this movie. For me, if a film stays true to itself, honest and exploiting its flaws (and virtues, obviously!) In the name of entertainment, then it has served its purpose. I have to worry, because its creators did not care. The whole movie is absurd from beginning to end, but its creators took the entire company seriously, and I did not feel manipulated to take the film seriously. And that is very true, because I want to take every movie seriously, but many, oh, so many, disappoint me. For all the absurdity, this movie is almost perfect and completely entertaining. What a fun script! It has also become disturbingly relevant in light of the events of 9/11. In no way do I seek to minimize the loss. But this film incorporates the tradition of the WTC collapse before it happened in a way we would never see if the film had been made after those events. <br /> <br /> "... it's gone forever, or here to stay." "you do not agree?"
