Is it full moon tonight? OH! It does not matter that they can change when they wish because of that drug! What was I thinking if it's a full moon tonight? Geez <br /> <br /> I really like this movie, there's romance, suspense, horror and hot things;) I like the first half of the movie when the boy saves the girl from committing suicide by jumping and trapping her. . That was really great. The scene of this film is in the city of love that is Paris in France. The cemetery scenes are nice, it gives you chills without knowing what will happen there or who is behind the walls. The scenes that make you jump out of your seat are really great. They even put me in those scenes. His friend who died and the girl he killed in the cemetery, but they still show up to the main character (sorry, I forgot his name), it was really funny. The actors did a good job more than the makeup teams. The part where everyone is partying in an abandoned church, I can not believe that people would do it because even though it is an abandoned church, it is still the house of God. I bought this movie a long time ago, and I do not regret having bought it. I am a lover of horror movies. I give this movie 5 stars out of 6. For people who are open and who love movies like this, try them, you may like them.
