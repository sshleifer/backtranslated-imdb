I saw this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved to be a great actor. In fact, when Law and Order began, I was disappointed in him because he was not such a powerful role. Unfortunately, good papers do not pay bills. I would like to be able to find a copy of this rare series and review it. It is both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so excited that I bought and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds". And he saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight. If you have the opportunity, be sure to watch this movie and see what performance Mr. Waterston really can provide an audience. Enjoy the movies!
