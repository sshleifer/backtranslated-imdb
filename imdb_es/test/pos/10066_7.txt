Madonna goes into action, again and fails again! Who's That Girl was released just one year after the massive failure of Shanghai Surprise and two after the cult movie desperately looking for Susan. She chose to act on him to forget the failure of the previous film, without suspecting that the latter could also be a failure. The film received a bad acceptance on the part of the critic and the American public, whereas in Europe it was a success. Madonna says that "some people do not want me to succeed as a pop star and as a movie star." The soundtrack album, in which he sings four songs, sells well and the single of the main song was a great success around the world, as in the World Tour. The truth is that Madonna failed as an actress because the script was quite weak. But it's not so bad, especially for those who like the 1980s: it's such a ramshackle, trashy, colorful and lively action movie! In the end, it is very fun to watch it.
