The Reader is an exceptionally well made and very sweet short. Each element of the piece helps to provoke a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before filming, not even a complete reading. The performances are a testament to a good instinctive performance in response to a well written script. The work of the actresses was excellent and there was never an indication that their work slipped into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case. This film is an excellent example of how these low-budget contracts benefit both actors and filmmakers.
