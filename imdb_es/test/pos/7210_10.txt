If you have never been "Tromatized", this is the Troma movie to watch first. The incredible performance, the supercharged soundtrack and the humor of Bust-a-Gut combine perfectly with the exclusive Troma brand of narrations and special effects. Despite deviating from a word by word repetition of Romeo and Juliet, the fact that it remains in an iambic pentameter gives you the strange feeling that it is closer to Shakespeare than that exaggerated music video with DiCaprio and Danes. I supposed I had seen the best comedy of Shakespeare when the cast of Moonlighting reviewed The Taming of the Shrew, but nothing compares to Tromeo and Juliet. I recommend the DVD version, which contains a second audio track with director Lloyd Kaufman, which is as entertaining as the main track.
