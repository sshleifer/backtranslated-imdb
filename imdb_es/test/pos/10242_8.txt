This is a story of a long and clumsy love. It describes the daily life of a 50-year-old woman and some people around her. His daily life is so ordinary and routine that I doubted who the real main character was at the beginning. Then the audience knows that the woman and a man who was her high school classmate had a very small connection. The woman has been doing the same job, a milkmaid and a cashier in a supermarket, for a long time. There are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job. The man had married another woman, who is now dying of cancer. He works at the City Council and takes care of it with devotion in his house. They never look directly or talk to each other, but they never forget. <br /> <br /> The original title in Japanese means "At some point the days you read books". But, of course, when the man said, "Now I want to do what I've always wanted to do," was to hug her and make love to her. She writes to a radio disc jockey that "if God gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day." Dreaming that day, she has been sublimating the desire in hard work and reading books. I personally know a woman who has loved a man for many years, even after she married another woman and died of an accident. Therefore, the configuration of the story is not so special. Rather, this film well portrays tacit romances in many ordinary men and women. Through this movie, you will remember your romance that was lost a long time ago. This is a movie with lasting effect.
