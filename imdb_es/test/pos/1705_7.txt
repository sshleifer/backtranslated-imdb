I have mixed emotions about this film, especially in comparison with its predecessor, <br /> <br /> "An American werewolf in London". That movie had its funny moments, it was more a horror story than anything else. This updated version, now established in Paris, does not have that "advantage" and is simply not in the same class ... but it has some good things that the first movie did not have and in general it's still fun to watch <br /> <br /> So, apart from the "werewolf purists," most of whom think that this movie is pure crap compared to the London version, I will still give it good grades since I do not care what they think. the rest. I liked it although I agree that "London" is better and I prefer that version too. <br /> <br /> The first 30-40 minutes of this film are reproduced strictly to laugh, including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. It also features the main female character, played by Julie Delpy. I do not see enough of this actress. She does not seem to make as many films, or less than I heard here in the United States. This French actress has a face that is a classic beauty, so the movie got points for having it and it looks great. <br /> <br /> When the horror starts, you may be frightened and the special effects are good. . I also liked the lack of blasphemy in this film, unlike the first: without false words or the name of the Lord in vain, incredible! <br /> <br /> However, there are many sexual comments and there is a scene with a guy who is running out of bars tied to a cross that was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal, which is not attractive to a middle-aged guy like me either. This film is oriented much more towards the twenties, if that helps someone. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining ... just do not expect it to live up to the first movie.
