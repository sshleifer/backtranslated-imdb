I've been watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I really did not start loving the show until Season 4 began. This episode of "Hush" was seen only by me in the dark, just after midnight, with the windows open and the wind Blowing furious for a later storm. The writers of this episode did an excellent job scaring me. I was amazed by the whole episode, which I just finished 2 minutes ago. The amazing thing does not touch the surface of what this episode achieves almost without dialogue. If you have never thought much about this show, at least watch this episode. If this does not impress you, then probably no episode will. <br /> <br /> By the way, my heart is still running ...
