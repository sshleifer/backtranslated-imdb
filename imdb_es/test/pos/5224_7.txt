If we consider three films with a similar theme, such as this, which was made in 1930, 'The Covered Wagon', made in 1923 and 'Wagon Master' in 1950, the distance between 'The Big Trail' and 'The Covered Wagon' only He is 7 years old, while the distance between 'The Big Trail' and 'Wagon Master' is 20 years. This is amazing because it shows how much the movies evolved in those 7 years and how in the next 20 years the changes were slow to arrive. 'The Big Trail is technically close to' Wagon Master ', but it's old for' The Covered Wagon '. The story is about the pioneers who traveled from Missouri to the west in Oregon. Tyrone Power Sr. is the man who leads the caravan, he is a rude and bad guy. John Wayne is the good guy and the film gives too much importance to his good looks, without giving him the opportunity to be the Wayne we are used to. Marguerite Churchill is such a proud lady that you wonder why Wayne simply does not forget her. Raoul Walsh was a master in showing caravans and cattle moving in the west, he directed "The Tall Men" in 1955, which has much in common with "The Big Trail".
