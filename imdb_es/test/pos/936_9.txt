This is the latest film by Krzysztof Kieslowski, one of the best directors in the history of cinema. He intended to retire after this movie, so it is somehow his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after making the film, and although it is said that he intended to re-direct, Destiny decided that this was his last. And what a movie! <br /> <br /> 'Rouge' the last film in the three colors of the French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Located in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a retired Swiss judge, and Durenmatt comes immediately to mind. But there is more Switzerland in the fresh environment, in the lack of communication of the characters, in the courtesy that surrounds the cruelty of life. Several characters that begin with little relationship will meet at the end in a moving and human final, that only a great artist could have organized. <br /> <br /> Little more can be said that hundreds of people have not been said or written. times. Yes, the movie starts slowly, and fans of the American-style action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and lose themselves as spectators. They deserve it. The film gets quality as it progresses, and one of the not-so-hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than cartoons and action and Hollywood's plastic characters. The quality of the cinema is very original, the image is a "Study in red", as the title shows. Acting is fabulous, with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant, which will later be the best role of their old age. <br /> <br /> A great movie. Seeing it again probably adds, and I'm happy to have it recorded on a tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.
