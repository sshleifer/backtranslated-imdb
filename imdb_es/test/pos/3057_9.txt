Unfortunately, I have never seen the full version of this movie. I saw the 87-minute version twice, in the 1950s. Even with a more flowery orientation than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out of the ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through the magnificent atmospheric ensembles of Andrejew. Beautifully illuminated by the photographer Andr√© Thomas, Black Jack is nothing more than a delight for connoisseurs. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, it is a script that allows a list of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly extravagant and thoroughbred characterizations. George Sanders gives a polished performance, while an eccentric millionaire (who happens to be a rival swindler) is played admirably by Agnes Moorehead. Also making the most of her role, Patricia Roc. The film was made, in locations in Spain, in 1949.
