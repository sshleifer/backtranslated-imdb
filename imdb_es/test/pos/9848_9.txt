I mention that there may be a spoiler here to be cautious about what I say, although I really do not think I'm giving away anything important. Any "surprise" is not really important for the success of this movie or the ability of a viewer to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Although not without some very small flaws, this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship, time, uncertainty and the decisions that people make about their lives. However, at the same time, it is also a very humorous film, with small fragments of comedy mostly sober. For much of the film, it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace, but it does not seem to be slow at all, since the film attracts one to it and the lives of the characters, and at first it is quite cheerful. Some have commented that much of the film seems slow, but it is such a wonderful portrait of the life of such nice characters that one could see it almost infinitely. As it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moves to the end and the progression is handled wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Eventually, some of the characters decide to rob a bank and, although it may be hard to believe, that is irrelevant. It's a wonderful addition to emphasize the love these friends have for each other while, at the same time, accentuating the humor and adding a little more irony to the movie. And, although it is not original for a group of old people to rob a bank, the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully, which also makes it quite funny, like when Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to "disguise" "The fact that he is old. <br /> <br /> Like I said, most of the other comedies are pretty discreet, but they're still very funny, so I chuckled constantly. <br /> <br /> The actors are probably the real key to this movie. Imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and represent them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or small details of the personalities of the characters that are carried out smoothly and beautifully. Of course, the film is about the personalities of these characters and how they take care of and interact with each other. It is very successful thanks to them and if the smaller actors had the roles that the film could have failed. <br /> <br /> Gule Gule is not without sorrow, but simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful power. experience. In fact, the film is so moving and full of so much love of characters so rich that in the end it is a very moving, satisfying and even happy film despite its sadness. I could see it again and again.
