Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: his wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left him, has a new romance with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist), does not know how to start his book. , and their students in their screen writing class are stranger than most. However, a student (Danny DeVito) is extra weird. He lives with his evil Momma (Anne Ramsey) and can not muster the courage to kill her. So, he goes to Larry for help, making his life go from being a normal madman to being an extra crazy man! <br /> <br /> Stu Silver should have done more! The dialogue, the characters, the whole script is almost perfect! And Danny DeVito has shown me that he is more than a great actor: he is a great director! Your son's movie, Matilda, is among my favorite family movies and now it's one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> It's a black comedy, most of the jokes are about murders, but it's very funny! All the actors are doing their full potential, whether they are main characters (Billy Crystal) or just less than one bit characters (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like comedy (Who does not?)) of what you like this! 8/10 stars.
