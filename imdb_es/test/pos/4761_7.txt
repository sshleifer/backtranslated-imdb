**** SPOILERS **** He was buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business could not get him out from under the lender Vito Lucia, Tony Lo Bianco, devised a plan to make a cash load with the help of his two crooked friends Moon and Bo, Richard Lynch and Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> Vito is approaching his childhood friend Buddy Manucci, Roy Scheider, as a mafia informant to gain Buddy's trust and tell Vito what is happening on the streets of New York with regarding the activities of the mafia. Buddy is a policeman who works in a united sub-rose of the NYPD, the Seven Ups, who does things "his way" to clean the streets of New York criminals. <br /> <br /> Vito receives information from Buddy and makes Buddy see that he is really giving him advice about the mafia and what is happening, and uses that information to advise his associates, Moon and Bo, to tear The gangsters withdraw from their weekly take and also kidnap the best mafia loan sharks and hold them for a ransom. <br /> <br /> Everything is going well for Vito & Co. until the mafia decides to retaliate and mistakenly takes the beating and kidnapping a member of the Seven Ansps Ansel, Ken Kercheval, who was working in a covert way, thinking that he was one of the drug lords who was kidnapping and swindling them. Later, Ansel was accidentally killed by Moon when he hit the trunk of the car, and Ansel was locked up thinking there was a suitcase full or in cash, with ransom, inside. <br /> <br /> Fast pace and an exciting movie with that gritty, gritty picture of New York City that was so effective in the movie "The French Connection" that also stars Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco as well They are in this movie. Incredible car chase that started in downtown Brooklyn and ended up in the wilds of New Jersey about 15 or 20 miles away with Buddy almost ending up beheaded by his heroic efforts. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider, who is not a big man, is as strong and effective as any big-action actor he can think of as if Clint Eastwood had been in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot, he even looks a bit like him, the former welterweight champion and middleweight Gene Fullmer, who beat the great Sugar Ray Robinson for the middleweight championship in 1957 and acts like him in the film: tough, durable and destructive. <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is very good as Vito, the entrepreneur, the heel of the low life that plays with Buddy and the Mafia to the point that leads to Buddy's partner, Ansel, being killed. Even though it's garbage, you can not help but feel sorry for Vito, since he only wants the money he gets from the shattered mobsters to pay Rose's medical and hospital bills from his sick wife. Even for the fact that Ansel was killed because of his actions, Vito never wanted anyone to get hurt, but as they say, when you play with fire, you end up burning yourself. In the end, Vito has a lot to explain to the not so sympathetic and affectionate mobsters. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Seven Ups" has the late Bill Hickman doing the dangerous stunts with car chases, as well as acting in the film. Hickman was also the specialist in the two great films that led him to drive on the streets and highways of New York City and San Francisco "The French Connection" and "Bullitt."
