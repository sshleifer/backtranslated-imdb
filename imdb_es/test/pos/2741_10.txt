If there's one cartoon that helped put UPA on the map more than any other, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This story of a young child who speaks only in sound effects has maintained its charm for the past 57 years. In addition to the effects, I loved music, abstract animation and backgrounds, Marvin Miller's narrative, almost everything. And he won the Oscar for best animated short film of 1950. I'm glad I saw it on YouTube after reading about this story of Dr. Seuss for so many years. And the creator of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Bill Scott, also contributed, how amazing! I hope to see the subsequent short films made in the series, if not on YouTube, then maybe in a DVD collection. Now I think I'll see another short UPA there ...
