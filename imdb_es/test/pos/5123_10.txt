Hoot is the best movie. Go see it if you do not have these 3 children who oppose the right and the wrong. A perfect family movie. the characters Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley) Beatrice Leep (Brie Larson) and Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) are the three main characters. great movie the best !!!!!!!!!!! I love this movie and you should too, it's a great movie, I mean it's a great movie. Go see it if you have not done it. I like it because they are right and wrong, and it has cut the owls and the hot Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> Cody Linley is so HOT !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!!!!
