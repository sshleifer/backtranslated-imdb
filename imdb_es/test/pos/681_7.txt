Intense domestic suspense with the owner of the house (Lupino, excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant housing cleaner (Ryan). The two masters of the genre are at their best, erotic, as they combine wit, emotions and wills in a strange hostage situation right after the Saturday Evening Post. Richly photographed in black and white with an unusual amount of head shots in the foreground. The young woman who makes fun of Ryan is very well directed here. Unlikely, but satisfying suburban melodrama.
