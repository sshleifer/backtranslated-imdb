This is probably one of my favorites so far, although I have the first one and I've seen Curse, Legacy and Vs. Demonic Toys. The only better than this is PM vs. DT. The curse is the worst of the series, the first, and then its legacy. I recommend that people see this and vs. DT. Those who say that this sucks are so bad, the story is well written and it's a sweet movie. This is a classic movie that even the youngest children can see and not be so afraid to see others. Well, this is my comment, you can call me Gipdac, (it's easy to know where it came from: 101 Dalmatians series, you can see it in Toon Disney at 4:00 a.m.). Oh, and do not laugh, I'm a boy, you'll see more of my comments on time. If you want to know why I see it? I am 12! A tip: Eat mentally, arrrrroooooooooo! I also agree with you, motter-1, but because people like others is because they are more exciting than horror and because puppets are made to look more terrifying. Also, you can call me Gipdac.
