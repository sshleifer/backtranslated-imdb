I really loved this movie. I thought it was very well done. The character's interaction was marvelously done as was the characterization. The actors were definitely credible. The plot was very deep and intriguing. Although some parts are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring, it's definitely worth seeing them several times. The chemistry between the three main actors was great. If you do not want to see it for that, at least look at it for the drama between the characters. I mean, it was just "Whoa!" It was as if I could not look away. The whole movie caught my attention and kept my interest, even through the slow parts. I loved this movie and almost everything about it. I loved the ending because it was very interesting and, if you watch the movie for the second time, it makes a lot of sense. But I'm not spoiling anything.
