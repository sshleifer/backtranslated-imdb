Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as a patchwork of senseless violence. And while there is a fair amount of chaos, DEATH WISH 3 is not such a big effort, especially for the fans of the series and its star. <br /> <br /> This time, Paul Kersey, old Charlie, was unleashed by a police chief desperate to clean a rough part of New York City. The happy trigger vigilante moves to the heart of gang territory, where it once again becomes a one man army in an urban war of good versus evil. Bronson, at least the "oldest" version, is really at its best. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that DEATH WISH 3 is a classic. In fact, for the discriminating eye it has a lot of imperfections. The characters are usually cardboard. The violence is exaggerated. A man well into the sixties overcomes and dismisses dozens of young punks. But in the original DEATH WISH tradition and in later films such as FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas, it has a definite charm for the audience. Who does not want to see gang members get what is theirs? There are also some great corny and single-line moments so common in the movies of the eighties. When a tenant in his apartment building sees Kersey setting an explosive trap, for example, the caretaker cheerfully says he is "thinning the pack." A line that only Bronson can really make work. <br /> <br /> For you to see, the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is. It's not Spielberg and it's not art. So throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with them.
