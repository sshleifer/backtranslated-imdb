A proof that it is not necessary for a film to have a deep story of many levels and other sophisticated elements to make it a good movie. Even if history could expand in many directions, especially in a more sociological way (people crave money), it seems to be perfect as it is. Through many sudden changes, it takes the viewer to the end without unnecessary complications and without allowing the viewer to take the eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> But the performance for me is not so good. With the exception of Lindsey McKeon, the others were average or even worse. In some scenes they simply stared in front of them. By Lindsey's exception that was more convincing. It is a very simple movie to simply rest and enjoy. <br /> <br /> 7/10
