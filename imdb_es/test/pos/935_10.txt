See Three colors: Blue and Three colors: White. Both are wonderful movies and will give an additional dimension to the end Three Colors: Red. Red is a fantastic movie. It can be enjoyed in a single visualization, and in fact, the climax of the movie is very powerful in that first visualization. But, look at it again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and the character parallels in this movie, you will see new things with each visualization. With the first time you see them, you understand that the movie is the work of a brilliant mind. With each additional visualization, you find yourself discovering that it is, in fact, a work of genius. Red means symbolizing fraternity in the French flag. The story changes the theme of fraternity to be seen in angles one would never suspect. The facets of the fraternity shared by the different characters are as deep as you care to look. If you are used to the flagrant "symbolism" in most mass movies, Red may find it a bit slow. You may find yourself looking at a screen full of intensity that you do not understand ... and yawning, ask yourself what all the emotion is about. This is not an indirect experience, without meaning. Everything is not explained to you. You must think how you look. You must see ... not just look. Wonderful movie ... one to enjoy a wonderful spectator.
