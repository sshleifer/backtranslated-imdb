'Opera' (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) Screenplay: Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (The Church, Sleepless, Demons) Photography: Ronnie Taylor (A Chorus Line, Sleepless) Music: Claudio Simonetti (Phenomena, 'Goblin') <br /> <br /> History: Betty (Cristina Marsillach) is the substitute for Lady Macbeth for a highly stylized staging of Verdi's Macbeth opera. Betty's shining hour comes when the diva star breaks her leg before the opening night when she is hit by a car that escapes in a tantrum. The famous curse of Macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turn when, immediately, the body count begins to increase. It seems that Betty gets her first fan through a stalker who ties her and puts needles in her eyes to force her to witness the horrible murders of the people around her. Story: 3 of 5 <br /> <br /> Act: Acting in many of these Italian films can sometimes be difficult to judge. English, Italian, French, German and Spanish can sometimes be in the same film, since they usually speak their native languages, which makes the golden rule of dubbing difficult to judge. Usually, as a result, I cut them a little slack in the area. Performance: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Address: Giallo maestro Argento enters the pioneer genre again. 'Opera' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite mixture of blood, tension and beauty. Direction: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: This must be one of the best films of Argento. Shot superbly by Taylor, 'Opera' features an impressive and ingenious camera work that makes the film fast and hard, and the eyes are not lost. The camera always seems to be in the notion of whether it is a wonderful photo of the camera climbing up a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird's eye view of that bird that revolves around the crowd at the opera house. Visual: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Audio: Frequent collaborator of Argento Simonetti (through his diverse bands Goblin, Demonian and solo) complements the action of the screen with zeal while his score plays from the classic (Verdi ) until the metal reflections. (with a little help from Brian and Roger Eno and Bill Wyman) and lends music to the bloody cartilage. The sound design gives you everything you need, from stabbing to shooting, shooting and screaming, and masterfully remastering the Anchor Bay disc in glorious 6.1 for every crack and squawk. Audio: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Technician: the editing keeps the film flowing and moving beautifully. Combined with camera work, the editing aid keeps the surreal dreamlike images flowing. The exquisite opera house is an incredible and perfect place to organize the Macbeth horror version. One can not finish a review of an Argento movie without having to comment on the murders. Argento sends the characters with joy this time with a brilliant sequence of stabs, crows and the film's highlight from a gunshot through a keyhole in the eye and from the back of the head shot that once again he sends Argento's ex-wife, Daria Nicolodi. to the morgue of the movie. Priceless! Technician: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Summary: an almost perfect giallo who suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland that offers all the visual emotion that Argento fans crave. <br /> <br /> In general: 4 out of 5
