There were at least half a dozen silent film versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," and there have been several television productions. But nobody has been accustomed to make a theatrical function of large budget of the work. . . until now. Given the nature of the most memorable character in the play, Shylock, the unpleasant Jew, it is good to assume that the little displeasure that occurred in Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s could have held back the enthusiasm of the filmmakers. Of course, the main motivation for Michael Radford's new movie is to give Al Pacino the chance to scream, cry, raise, mutter and be tormented, all of which is very good. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is the dream of a landscape chewer. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare anti-Semitic, since he never met a Jew. Jews were expelled from England 300 years before their time until a few decades after their death; and it is unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. On some level, the Jews may well have been a mythological career for him. But while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his game certainly is. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that probably pretends to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a sixteenth-century lender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a review of the unfortunate treatment of the Jews and then discovers Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spitting free Shylock (Pacino), who really stands, thinking about their own affairs. It will buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge Booker
