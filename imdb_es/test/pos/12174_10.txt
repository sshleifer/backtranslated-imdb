Those two main characters Erkan and Stefan are a comedy act from Munich. I was wondering if this is one of these typical slapstick movies where the story is not important or just does not exist. But when I saw this movie, I was very happy that there is a great story and the main characters really fit into it. <br /> <br /> In general, very funny and not a common German movie.
