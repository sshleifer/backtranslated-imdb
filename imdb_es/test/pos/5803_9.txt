This show was so exhausting to watch and there are only two numbers in the Drowned World (Substitute For Love) and Paradise (Not For Me) where you can sit and watch everything. The opening of this show will go down in history as the most exciting sight, as Madonna enters the stage through a giant Swarovski crystal ball that falls from the ceiling and giant screens behind show images of horses galloping. Horses play a role in this show because Madonna falls out of one. The infamous scene of Madonna on the crucifix is ​​in this show, since a large screen has 12 million, the number of African children who were orphaned due to AIDS. At the end, a website address appears for anyone interested in donating. Then we go into the topic of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown. There is an interlude and then the show starts again with the music of I Love New York and Ray of Light, this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers who make funny movements with their hands. Towards the end is the number of Music with the song Disco Inferno mixed with the song and the dancers make the presence more known. The ending again is full of energy when the program ends with the melodies of Lucky Star and Hung Up and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end of the message "Have you confessed?" arises. It is worth buying the DVD and when it came out the soundtrack of the show was added as a bonus. Jonas Akerlund did a great job with the images of this program, keeping it consistent with the style of the tour.
