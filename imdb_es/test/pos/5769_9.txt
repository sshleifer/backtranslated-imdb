A sign of what to expect in this film came when I discovered that this was the first (and probably the last) movie that had in its credits a "Vomito Technician". <br /> <br /> In what is a couple of hours of silly jokes, hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humor. <br /> <br /> This movie was exactly what I would expect from the Bottom Boys, and it's great to see them in their best shape after Rik Mayall's life threat of an accident. <br /> <br /> Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are too similar to their Bottom characters, if we can have any criticism, and Edmondson does a surprisingly good job of directing the film as well. <br /> <br /> This film has already generated predictable comparisons with Fawlty Towers that simply are not there, and the Guest House Paradiso itself is not Torquay! <br /> <br /> Beware of some excellent quality dialogue between all the violence and chaos. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Bottom you will probably hate this, but I loved it.
