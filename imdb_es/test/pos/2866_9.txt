This movie was great! I saw him on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While they were shooting the first credits, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They're the ones who made that stupid Wolf Creek movie, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we moaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were very wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which is not really that hard), it's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time! They really redeemed themselves with this movie. It was bloody, smart and terrifying, which are the combinations of an incredible horror movie. Kane is amazing as Jacob Goodnight, and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble and Luke Pegler did very good jobs as part of a group of criminals who clean an old motel. I had some disgusting scenes, and actually you feel sad for some of the people who die. In short, a great horror movie to watch on Friday or Saturday nights with the lights off and with friends. Just do not see it in a hotel.
