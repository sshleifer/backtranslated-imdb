I had never heard of this movie when it was given to me to translate it, so I did not know what to expect. I checked it in IMDb and I became curious. It did not take long to realize that this was a gem. Outstanding performances, great story, and well directed and well written. It's hard to compare it to other movies, but "Stand by me" comes to mind, although it has as many "The cure" differences as similarities. The story of an extraordinary friendship among young boys, plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this film and "Stand by me". Apart from that, "The cure" is a good movie in itself, well worth a wider recognition. It is dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. I can not think of one thing that bothers me about it. That said, I do not want to give the impression that it is a "perfect movie", whatever that means, but I really liked it, it moved me a lot and I would not change anything in it. I will not go into a detailed description of the story / plot, partly because it would be too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site. To finish, I can only say: Wonderful movie, look at it if you have the opportunity.
