I have seen this show when I was younger. It's a very good show to watch. It is very educational for children from 1 to 8 years old. Barney is definitely super Duper. B.J. It's pretty funny Babie Bop is very cute. The children are also great. This program is about learning about numbers, like Sesame Street, but different types of programs and characters like Barney, the purple dinosaur, BJ, the yellow dinosaur with a baseball cap on his head and Baby Bop, the cute green dinosaur with a pink ribbon. The first one that started was the very old Barney and Friends show. But then the second one was different to be new episodes. Also the last one in 2000 was a new scene from Barney Park. They also have a Barney show at Universal Studios in Florida, where you see Barney, B.J. and Baby Bop and then, when the show ends, you can go play, shop and meet Barney. It is a very good program. Watch this program when you learn about many things that you will like, the movie and the live show at Universal Studios Florida.
