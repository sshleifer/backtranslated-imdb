The third entry in the "Stepford" franchise, but apparently the three dark sequels made for television are incredibly dark and hard to track, while the original 70s, as well as the highly successful remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular. I have not seen either in the early '80s "Stepford's wives revenge" or in the mid-90s "The Stepford Husbands", but "The Stepford Children" is a very charming and entertaining little movie. It's basically the same movie as the original; Obviously, less mysterious but much more corny and incredibly 80 in degree n. The main difference here, as the title indicates, is that not only liberated wives, but also rebellious and adolescent punk children in the city undergo the typical and highly effective "Stepford treatment" licensed by the Men's Association local. For some reason, the scenario tries to defend the Stepford mystery until the end of the movie, although it is likely that no one will see this sequel before reviewing the original and, presumably, everyone knows the outcome. The Harding family is full and ready to move from the spooky city of New York to the small, quiet community of Stepford. Particularly Father Steven is excited about his new life because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to return since his first wife, of whom his new wife Laura and his teenage children, Mary and David know very little, died in mysterious circumstances. The city is almost too perfect, with picturesque neighbors and model students, and especially modern teenagers face enormous difficulties to adapt. Their efforts to modernize the place and take local Stanford youth in tow cause clashes with eminent citizens, particularly members of the Men's Association, and put family relationships under a lot of stress. David meets and falls in love with the last "normal" girl at the Lois school, but when even she becomes a domestic doll overnight, David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister Stanford secret . The first hour of "The Stanford Children" is slow and fairly quiet, but the ending is trashy and corny as the cover of VHS promises and as a thriller of the late 80s should be, in fact. The modus operandi behind Stanford's secrets is illustrated in more detail, and I think horror fans and fans of the original movie will appreciate it. At least, I did it. The general plot does not make much sense and the script is full of irrational aspects, but it is still an attractive formula and, without a doubt, one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear. Acting performances are well above average. Especially the arrogant and unpleasant members of the Men's Association represent plausible characters and even the teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff give away impressive performances. Recommended without hesitation!
