A good animation, a nice character design and a happy story make it nice to see Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing, I thought that this anime was pretty good, but that it was much better in for a second watch. <br /> <br /> This is because it is done out of chronological order, and once you look at it in the correct order, you notice connections that you did not see before. (Or you might see a second meaning for some events you did not notice before) You may want to read the original novels (not the manga) of Tanigawa Nagaru before / after seeing this. The anime is very good to visualize all the details in the stories it shows. <br /> <br /> However, there are some short stories from the book that are not animated, but are referenced. in episode 14) In general, this anime is really very good once after a brief analysis of the plot (the reading of the book also improves it). It's a good break from the shounen-jump anime that seems to be taking control.
