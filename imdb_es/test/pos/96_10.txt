Having been raised in Canada, I saw this short many times mainly at the CBC. I have seen it many times, in many ages in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. It's a cheery bittersweet movie, beautifully animated that pulls your heart. I'm sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere I'm investigating. <br /> <br /> All the children who grow up can relate to the situation and want to fit in with their favorite idols. The scene and the look of the children's faces when their mother is filling the Eatons catalog and her jumping around the room is priceless. I have not seen someone capture the carefree atmosphere of youth in the film, as well as this short film. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I'm a Montreal fan, and that makes my appreciation more special. But in the end, it's the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey and the memories of his family that tell him he should be grateful for what he gets, even if it's not exactly what he wanted. And, oh yes, the animation is also beautiful;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10
