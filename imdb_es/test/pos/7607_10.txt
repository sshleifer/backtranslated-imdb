I love this movie. It focuses on both themes: reality and fantasy. Reality because, hey, we all wanted a date like that popular Billy guy. and some of us have not been kissed yet, right? Be honest! <br /> <br /> Another real problem is the pain that people make with teasing. and whoa, the life of high school. remember it? Fantasy is finding your true love, when you are 25 years old and you are still in high school. It's not really a fantasy, but close enough! <br /> <br /> although some parts are incredible, it was a great movie. There are no other words to describe such an incredible work. And the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a lovely and wonderful job, as did the hilarious David Arquette. The people who worked on the film are wonderful. Did not I just repeat that? <br /> <br /> I have never been kissed is one of the films that future generations should see. It shows reality and some problems for people like you and me.
