Woohoo! The French are really learning. If you look at his first Asterix movie, we see a good story with good actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu) but with a very unconvincing special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix, special effects are really important. Well ... they did well this time! Looks great. Personally, I think the Cleopatra Mission is the best Asterix story ever written. In the movie there is not a moment when you're bored. Go and look at this! One thing! They did not exactly follow the script, which I think is a bit pitiful. For example, in the Obelix comic breaks the nose of the Sphinx, immediately all the small merchants begin to break the nose of their miniature Sphinx. (very fun to watch) .. Well, they did not put it in the movie, instead they stuck their nose under the Sphinx. Asterix: "They will never look for him here" (guess again). It was fun but not as good as the original. Another thing that I did not like about the movie was his choice for music. He made the movie for children. But never less ... It's a must C! <br /> <br /> Grz Da Jean Holland
