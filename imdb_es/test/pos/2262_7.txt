Everything is illuminated A young Jewish American seeks the woman who helped his grandfather escape the Nazi persecution while embarking on a tour of Europe with some unlikely partners. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful anguish usually associated with his acting ethic. When the successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical view of the souls below the mask in action. Usually, we get a mix of genres- Check. But what we normally do not get is an original, insightful, credible, intelligent and moving film. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, an inquisitive young man who picks up pieces of life as he goes. He is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph. The sepia picture has his grandfather (a strange resemblance to him) and the woman. To help him on his trip, he has the help of tour guides who are part of a hip hop hop breakdancer, Alex (Eugene Hutz), his apathetic and distressed grandfather (Boris Leskin) and his dog, Sammy Davis Junior Jr. What follows is essentially a comedy. There is a simple and merciless introduction with voice-overs. Alex's is especially fun, as he educates his younger brother in 1969, demonstrating how popular it is with girls and break dance, which makes it the antithesis of Jonathan. <br /> <br /> Schreiber begins to divide the characters as they advance and the comedy acts as an intentional veil to what is a story about three people linked to the holocaust who do not really know themselves. The three hold the film with tenderness and authenticity, something Schreiber probably is not wrong and, however charming and fantastic the film, the horrors that can be broken, that is, the past are presented in an almost acceptable tone (music incidental, cinematography). ) which makes them even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> As the unlikely group finally finds the city they are looking for, they learn from the real atrocities that occurred and discover a lot about who they really are. <br /> <br /> Elijah wood is as authentic as usual, bringing his usual innocence and strength to the screen. Formally a good resident of The Lord of the Rings and a bad resident in Sin City, Jonathan plays with aplomb while being bombarded with cultural clashes and a search for the truth. Boris Leskin as a grandfather also expresses his anguish and frustration towards young people with great humor and conviction as he unravels his own past. However, it is Eugene Hutz as Alex who makes the show. The director uses that old exchange of translation misunderstandings to create and maintain a humor that is really fun and not tricky. <br /> <br /> Schreiber has made a charming debut that has heart and soul. The continuous score and beautiful photography create a fairy tale haze around a story about identity, truth and family. If there was a complaint, it would be the speed at which the film changes direction; Although this may have been intentional, it may not feel right for everyone. However, this is an excellent effort that offers a great comedy and a union between an unlikely group and at the same time dissects another aspect of the horrors of World War II in a completely new way. <br /> <br /> -Chi and Eye
