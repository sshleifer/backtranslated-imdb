I love Ernesto goes to jail. It's one of my 3 favorite Ernest movies. The others are Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest Goes to Camp. In this film, Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a janitor for a bank, but wants to be a bank clerk. Soon he is assigned jury service but soon ends up in trouble when the evil assassin Felix Nash (Varney too) knocks him out and changes places with him! Soon Ernest is in jail and is forced to act as Nash or Nash will kill the love interest of Charlotte Ernest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair thinking it's Nash, he electrocuted himself so much that he ended up breaking up and left and saved Charlotte from the evil Nash. Full of funny scenes and comics, Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that will make you laugh a lot. It still makes me! Jim Varney was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both the good guys and the bad guys! Varney was like his Toy Story Co star, Tom Hanks. No matter what role they played, their roles were memories and that is one of the things that Varney will be remembered for forever. D.E.P. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thanks for making Ernest and other fantastic characters come alive! 10 out of 10!
