The soft and brilliant film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality ... and to be fair, the narrative is a bit tenuous and light as drama ... but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes that represent the first impact of a The new art in an alien and skeptical society has a radiance and naturalness that captures the romance between the cinema and the public for a century better than any movie in years. An immensely sympathetic performance by Jared Harriss (who seems to have inherited all the charisma of his parents ... hopefully without Richards' poor penchant for hell and cruelty) ... and the enchanting, extravagant charm of the star Yu Xia They combine to make this a true stimulant. The photo of radiant location (which includes resplendent scenes on the great wall) and the sensitive direction of Ann Hu give an added impact to the film. In short, a must for anyone who has been enchanted by a shadow that vibrates to life ... and makes magic in the dark.
