I just saw this in SIFF, and I loved it. There were parts in which I laughed so much that I could not catch my breath. The script and the direction of Glenn McQuaid are fantastic. I can not wait to see more of this talented young man. The performances make the movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are simply charming as the graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman turns into a fantastic performance (as always) as an under-understanding prison priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, it perfectly balances the threat and the humor. <br /> <br /> This is a horror comedy style that has not really been seen since Vincent Price made "Comedy of Terrors", "The Raven" and "Theater of Blood." The film is genuinely frightening in some places, then it will suddenly change to hilarious mode, keeping you totally unbalanced. Some parts are frightening and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> I can only watch three films in SIFF this year, but even if the other two are horrible, "I Sell The Dead" was worth it. price of the three. I'll be looking for more Glass Eye Pix movies by Larry Fessenden. It's giving the horror genre a much-needed kick in the ass.
