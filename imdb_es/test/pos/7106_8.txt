Dracula (John Carradine) visits Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) who believes that science can cure everything. He wants Edelamn to cure his vampirism, Edelman agrees. Then, Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) appears looking for a cure for him to become a werewolf. The monster of Thr Frankenstein is also discovered, but in reality it does not do anything. <br /> <br /> Very ambitious plot for a universal horror movie from the forties. Trying to cure monsters by science is really an interesting idea. In addition, this film has beautiful scenarios (LOVE the castle to doctor lives), tons of atmosphere, is very well directed (great use of shadows) and has quite good special effects. <br /> <br /> The acting is all good, except for Carradine, he tries, but I could never accept him as Dracula. Also Lionel Atwill appears playing (as always) the police chief. This is pretty much forgotten and ridiculed as a stupid movie, but I think it's very good. It is also the last time that the universal monsters became serious: the next film was in 1948 in "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". It's a great movie, but the accent is more in comedy. <br /> <br /> The only real flaw here is that there is A LOT of plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic: Why does Dracula try to bite the lovely Miliza (Martha O'Driscoll) when he is being healed? And why (and how) does the doctor get Frankenstin to enter his castle? Still, these are small complaints. Recommended.
