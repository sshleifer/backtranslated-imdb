You need a rare movie to improve every time you see it. Or brother does that and then some. The first time I saw it, I must admit that I had never seen anything like it before. Then I wanted to see it again, and now I have two digits with this great movie, the best film of the Coen brothers they have made, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy in second and third place for me. <br /> <br /> George Clooney offers the performance of his career playing Ulysses Everett McGee, an escaped convict who knows everything and who really does not know anything. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect companions for Clooney, particularly Nelson and his interpretation of Delmar, a loyal but uneducated partner. John Goodman is my favorite character as Big Dan, perfect. He reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona, he is a perfect actor for this role. The favorites of the Coen brothers, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning, also provide memorable performances. <br /> <br /> Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their craft. It's not like they try to win Academy awards every time they make a movie, they just try to tell a story they want to tell, and it's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean the Homer fans. It's great. <br /> <br /> The most surprising part of this movie is the coloring. I've seen how the movie felt dusty and I'm still amazed just to think about it. Coloring becomes an important part of the film. Great big movie
