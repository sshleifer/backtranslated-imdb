I've seen this movie fairly regularly for most of my life, and it never gets old. Despite all the sarcastic comments and insults (mostly from David Spade), "Tommy Boy" has a giant heart. And that's what makes this movie funny after all these years. <br /> <br /> Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), dealer of auto parts, and has been based on that throughout his life. lifetime. But after his death dies on his wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt and that Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a huge auto parts company, will buy it. So, to save the company, Tommy has to hit the road to sell the company's new brake pads. Along with the trip, though not by choice, is Richard Hayden (David Spade), a former partner of Tommy who was Big Tom's right-hand man. <br /> <br /> The film works on the chemistry between the two stars of SNL (and best friends in real life) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy between them to power the world. He's the big, dumb guy against the smart little guy. It works, and some of its scenes are unforgettably fun. Farley and Spade are also decent dramatic actors. Although the film is mainly a comedy, it has a good deal of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are as good there as when they make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Forgive me, but I have To talk about Chris Farley a little more. I read his biography ("The Chris Farley Show: a biography in three acts" for anyone who cares) and to understand who Chris was in real life made this film more special to me. Chris Farley was a really good person who fought, and finally he did not manage to conquer his addictions. Although this was the first film in which he played an important role, it is his best film. He really showed who he was, and how much talent he had. Knowing Chris's story adds another layer to this movie, although it does not make it any less fun. <br /> <br /> Farley and Spade combine with a good screen cast. Rob Lowe is suitably slimy as Tommy's "new brother" and Bo Derek is solid as his stepmother. Brian Dennehy is great as Big Tom. Dennehy makes it easy to believe that they are father to son. Big Tom is as crazy as his son, although he is more intelligent and mature. Dan Akroyd offers one of his best performances as Zalinsky, and gives Tommy the hard truth behind the publicity. Julie Warner is also good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Segal is one of the great comedy directors. It keeps the pace fast and energetic, but more importantly, it knows how to make comedy fun. He does not treat jokes, and understands that funny actors know what they are doing and allows them to do so. But Segal goes a step further. It gives "Tommy Boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that both pulls the heart's cord (genuinely) and tickles the quote. <br /> <br /> The critics did not like "Tommy Boy". I am ashamed of them. A film does not have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be fun (God forbid that Farley and Spade should be forced to do a silent comedy in the style of "The Office"). This is a great movie and one of my favorites of all time.
