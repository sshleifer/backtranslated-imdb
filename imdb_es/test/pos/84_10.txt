A very good movie, focused on a very important topic. The syndrome of fetal alcoholism is a very serious congenital defect that can be prevented completely. If more families saw this movie, perhaps more children would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles. This is an excellent film that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is not different from the thousands of families that exist today in the United States. There are children struggling with this world. The really important point here is that everything could have been avoided. More people should watch this movie and take what it has to say seriously. It is well done, with important messages, handled in an elegant manner.
