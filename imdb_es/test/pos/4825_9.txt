From the performance to the direction of Cardone, this new twist on the theme of the familiar familiar ghost will keep you glued to your seat. Slow sometimes because it increases the tension of 'what is going to happen'. Medium-good in blood, but what is very unpleasant. Spoiler: the death of the shell and the subsequent party is a highlight for the gore hounds. <br /> <br /> The writers created an old story, but they added twists and they re-imagined the typical spell. Cardone gives it life. . . er. . uh death. <br /> <br /> Lori Heuring, Taylor-Compton Scout and the always fabulous Ben Cross are real, there are no signs of acting here. Everyone in the cast is engaged and that is not really what any director struggles with. The actors believe, so we believe. <br /> <br /> Along with the traditional ghost story that surprises, the film is loaded with tons of atmosphere, from the mine, the house of Hank and the house of Tunny, there is a growing fear from the beginning. latest. <br /> <br /> Fans of terror, do yourself a favor and enjoy what amounts to being one of the true horror movies that exists today. <br /> <br /> I end up with a big kudo For Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nedivi (script) because without inventive writers, Hollywood would be nothing more than an ugly television party.
