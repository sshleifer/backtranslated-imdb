This interesting lost movie (written by Terence Malick) stars Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two crazy Southern brothers in a quest to open a seafood restaurant. Margot Kidder was never prettier and Forrest should have been nominated. Originally titled The Dion Brothers, this joyful film with a violent ending is pure joy! <br /> <br /> Where is this movie? I've been looking for 30 years. Keach was still great back then and I'm surprised he has no more cult followers (maybe yes). These guys are nuts with more ambition than brains, but totally adorable guys! A 7 out of 10. If you can dig it up somewhere, you'll have fun.
