It seems that we should recognize Scandinavian cinema for more than just the 1995 Dogma movement, as the Danish invented many years ago. Den Brysomme Mannen, or The Bothersome Man in English, is a surrealist film that is deeply thought-out while entertaining and rich in content, both on the surface and under it. Just as a movie, it is a scathing comedy about society and attitudes in the postmodern world in which we live; a world that judging by The Bothersome Man has reached the regions of Norway and the like. But, along with this black comedy, it seems that the film deepens a little more and raises problems, at least for me, of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct of wanting to discover the truth between so much material in our world that we may find it strange . <br /> <br /> This was, in truth, a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema for me. The film is very much in that category of European art cannon, with its deep themes and ambiguity wrapped in an atmosphere that maintains an open ending and not so much a narrative as a procession of events that can mean one thing or another. Many times we have seen films that use the configuration adopted by The Bothersome Man and so many times it has become a predictable routine that revolves around a detective story or a history of persecution or something similar, but this film allows its adjustment and situation to act as a mere backdrop for his protagonist, named Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag), to explore who he is; where is it and what are the possible mysteries behind this location? <br /> <br /> The configuration I am talking about involves the hero who arrives at a location with no previous memory or what happened before this. I will enter immediately and say that, in my opinion, he is dead and that he has been sent to some kind of purgatory, like all the inhabitants of the city. Everyone in the city with whom Andreas mixes is of the same age; The same mentality and the same attitude suggest to me that most of them are victims of their own suicide and that they have been sent to a purgatory without emotions, feelings, color or, what is more important, pain. <br /> <br /> When we see Andreas for the first time, he gets off a bus that later discovers he has strange skills and approaches a gas station in the middle of nowhere. He is disheveled and has a huge beard, but soon it will be the opposite, wearing a suit and tie; Face shaved and a house of his own with a new job in which the film makes one of the best transformational changes between rural and urban that I've seen. But the new job, as well as the new city, is uncomfortable; you can take breaks whenever you want; Bosses are unusually friendly and there seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything. These ideas are best expressed in a cinema when Andreas, still a rookie in the city, cries and is clearly affected by a movie on display, but everyone else looks with a stone style. There is also the initial example when a man jumped out of a window and is impaled on some peaks, but they all walk without problems. <br /> <br /> To support my idea that all are already dead and the city acting as a kind of purgatory, death and damage in general is impossible. There is a particularly unpleasant scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and someone's thumb, but everyone's reaction to the event is stone and grows back in an hour. Similarly, a suicide attempt involving trains later is useless and, instead, we have a view of what it feels like to be dragged along the tube tracks with the invulnerability of their side. The city acts as a barrier, a painless society in which the masochistic need to self-harm is impossible; a place where sexual intercourse can occur and ruptures as well, but in circumstances without emotion as well as without passion; a place where people can try to kill themselves but it is impossible to really die. The city adopts these powers because the damage was already done in "real life" and, therefore, the movie says that you can not kill yourself twice, in fact, you can not feel pain or emotion in a life after the death of the purgatory. <br /> <br /> But the best part of the movie is the one that stalks you. Judging by the last five minutes of the film and the parallel story that begins with music from another man's house, it would seem that there is a thin line between the spaces that the film dictates as "heaven" and "hell". Can we see these spaces only very, very briefly? so briefly that they consist of a single shot. The 'sky' is a colorful kitchen with music and children: it offers life, hope, emotion and happiness, while hell is not a snowy place anywhere that pursues it thanks to its desperate construction and its mysterious cutting point. The introduction of these two spaces at the end of the film suddenly informs you of the reality Andreas and company. Faced: the purgatory and everything that came with it, the future life was not ready for Andreas and his free thought, an adventurous mind? And look where the thinkers end.
