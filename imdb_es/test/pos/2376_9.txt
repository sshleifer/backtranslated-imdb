The third part of Miike's Dead or Alive trilogy is as little related to the first two parts as to the other, more or less. Show that Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are back again for the main roles, but this time the film pushes us to advance 300 years or so in the future ... after the apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Riki plays a tough cop, an executor for the extreme police policies of the corrupt city, and Show plays a vagabond who hooks up with a group of oppressed rebels in the city. The film must have been shot in Hong Kong, since most of the rest of the cast are Cantonese speakers, with Terence Yin and Josie Ho as the most recognizable faces. There is also a team of HK specialists on hand for the action sequences of the movies, which are great in a HK-via-Miike style. <br /> <br /> This could be the fodder for a low budget B movie, but in Miike's hands of course they become something more interesting. It is a rather slow and reflective film that snakes and does not try to force anything in the spectator's throat. The characters are round and interesting and the plot is an interesting framework but quite loose for the story. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a fairly low key effort up to the action scenes, which show Miike's growing skill to direct and choreograph very good action. Watching the short of Show & Riki on cable platforms is really fun, it can be said that they had a great time <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is about uniting the 3 Dead Or Alive films, which is quite unnecessary because each one is really self contained. However, Miike's explanation of the connection is very funny, and limits the series quite well. <br /> <br /> It's not as deep or well developed as DOA2, it's not as outrageous and intense as DOA1 ... another good Miike movie though.
