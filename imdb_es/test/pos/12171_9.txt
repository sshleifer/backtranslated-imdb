Say 9 out of 10 points. I was crying almost the whole movie, because I had to laugh. <br /> <br /> The story, of course, was not excellent, but it was not boring either. Erkan and Stefan are assigned to become bodyguards of the beautiful Nina. While doing this work, they are among the "front lines" of BND and CIA. Of course, the two are neither bodyguards nor knights, so they go from one disaster to another; And they do it in such a funny way that when you look at some scenes you can not stop the tears! As actors, these two characters who "smile" are doing quite well, better than some of the so-called professionals. <br /> <br /> Do you think the discourse of the two heroes is curious or "pseudo-foreign"? Well, if you listen to a lot of Turkish-German people in Munich talking exactly like them, you'll remember Erkan and Stefan. And maybe, in 10 years, it has become the common discourse of young people. (God forbid!) <br /> <br /> So, if you like to laugh, watch this movie!
