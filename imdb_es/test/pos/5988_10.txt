This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! The director did a wonderful job showing the contrasts between social classes, a situation that is very pertinent in France today. All the characters are adorable, especially Juliette and her family. The development of romance is, although not entirely realistic, at least plausible, and it does a wonderful job of showing how much people will change for love. I discovered that this is a moving story for Cinderella, but one in which Cinderella is a powerful woman in herself. I laughed through this whole movie, and I loved it. I recommend Romuald et Juliette to anyone who enjoys unique characters, comedy and non-traditional romance.
