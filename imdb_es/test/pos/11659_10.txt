I really enjoy this movie. He challenged my emotions and beliefs, turning it into a true work of art in my book. The performance was second to none. I would never see this movie with anyone with whom I could not cry, I do not think I cry more than any movie, maybe because it makes me look at myself, I do not know. It is a must.
