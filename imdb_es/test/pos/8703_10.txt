The first time I saw this movie years ago with my daughter, who is now 13 years old, she fell in love with the vampire. we both thought it was a first level movie, then we looked at the sub 11 and then the sub 111 now that there is a sub 1v that I can not wait to put my fangs, and there is also a fifth in the line of the pipe. If nobody has seen the movies. These are the best of the best. I think he deserves thousands of Oscar. I could see this from morning to night. I would love to have a nail game like him, taking care of the girls. I love how all the lines of the story continue from movie to movie. These ants typical of vampire movies are better. I would love to live in the life that excels in movies. It would make all my dreams come true.
