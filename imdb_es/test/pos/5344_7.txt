There was something about the three original films that made them so special and charming, probably the length of them. Unfortunately, this lacks charm, but it still ends up being a fun movie. <br /> <br /> The bright and shiny side is that our favorite plasticine figures are still doing a great job of cracking, a good plasticine animation is used, there is a silly plot, but well structured and entertaining, an exciting one, A fun adventure, a good idea of ​​the plot (a "were-rabbit" and "giant vedgetable" contest) and good new characters! <br /> <br /> Besides lacking the original charm, the only other slightly somber side of the film is that The humor, while good, is overly exaggerated, especially compared to the original movies. <br /> <br /> The popular Giant Vedgetable Competition is approaching and Wallace and Gromit are helping to control the rabbits so they do not eat vedgetables, now they are Anti Pesto. They are doing a good job, but soon, there is danger in progress. A rabbit-rabbit is nearby ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for all Wallace and Gromit fans and for people who like plasticine films, enjoy "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Wererabbit" . :-)
