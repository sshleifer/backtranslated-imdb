It is the story of three brothers who come together in the midst of difficulties and loss, and learn that the really important things in life are family, love, trust and forgiveness. The entire cast manages to achieve a powerful performance despite a few low-quality phrases. A great movie for fans of real-life problems from credible families. It is also worth watching fans of Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin. They both do an incredible job, they often make you cry. Take my word and rent this today!
