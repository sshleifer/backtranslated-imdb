My children, DD 7 and DS 10, enjoyed the movie so much that they writhed in their seats. It was good, old, rated G, family fun. This movie was made for children ... someone really understands them. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see Julia Roberts, Brice Willis, Garth Brooks and the other stars making their appearances. <br /> <br /> As someone who lives in the city, the fictional "Big Texas" was inspired by the model, I can say that they made an honest and accurate portrait. The children looked like children, not superstars. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to Hollywood that we need more movies like this one. Go see it, then spread the word!
