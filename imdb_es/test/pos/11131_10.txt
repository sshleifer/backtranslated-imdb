I really hate musicals because the music numbers just start suddenly and usually spoil the scenes, but this one is completely different, it's just brilliant. The plot may not be a challenge for the viewers, but the simplicity of the people's life stories makes this film excellent. <br /> <br /> I've seen it at least a dozen times and I'm not tired of the plot yet. , characters or music (I love the soundtrack, it's the only soundtrack that I've really wanted to have and, probably, will continue to be the only one I owe). <br /> <br /> For me it is an obligation. I watched movie type, great characters compiled with entertaining songs and many things to think about after the end of the movie.
