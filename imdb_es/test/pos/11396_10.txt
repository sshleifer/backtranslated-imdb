The brilliance of this story delivers at least one message skilfully designed for each viewer in the audience. This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the decisions you make in life and the decisions others make for you. The story is about self-realization and determination on such a large scale that no camera angle could cover it. Within the scope of each scene there is a marked element to be represented within your imagination. Keep this in mind when watching the movie; It is more than a sweet eye. The sexually suggestive scenes, which are rarely explicit, only serve to distract and entertain him during the tedious process of character development.
