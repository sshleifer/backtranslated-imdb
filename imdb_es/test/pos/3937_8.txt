I never realized how fabulous the dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and she was beautiful. What a pleasure to see her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for his day, but the dance was really special. I never get tired of seeing Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner in this movie was just as great. I always thought of Lana as a regular actress who tended to act excessively. I should have danced more and less the roles of Maddam X and Peyton Place. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dance. Pity that the "Academy" does not offer an "Oscar" for dancing.
