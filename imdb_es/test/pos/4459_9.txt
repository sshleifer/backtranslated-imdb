Being an experienced fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hacker. I had seen The Beyond, which I think is totally overrated, I found The New York Ripper was just awful and I did not especially like The House By the Cemetery. These three films left me to conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my obstinacy prevailed and I had to see more of his films. City of the living dead was a film that I found very interesting, but not torturing a duckling is almost a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Located in a small town in the Italian countryside, in a repressive religious community where young men are being killed. Authorities have no idea who is behind these crimes, especially after their main suspect has been acquitted. An enthusiastic young reporter along with a pretty dirty girl (who seduces young children) investigates and eventually gets to the bottom of it. <br /> <br /> Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast (not always the case) with the Italian thrillers of the 70s) make Do not Torture a good thriller for Duckling. The plot is well constructed, it is not easy to understand and the final conclusion is very satisfactory. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very implacable and ignorant community and creates very strong images, especially in a scene in which a woman is beaten to death by some inhabitants of the city. Fulci's social comments about religion and innocence are quite restless and all aspects are well managed. When thinking about his zombie movies and his ultra violent giallo New York Ripper, it's amazing how well he balances his criticism with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. So far I have not seen any Fulci movie made as professionally as this one. <br /> <br /> While it is not a traditional giallo movie, Duckling has many of the commercial brands of the genre. Fulci shows complete control over the format, only once he goes overboard with an unconvincing moment of gore, but in general he seems to be even better at making mysteries than gore epics. The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really hit. <br /> <br /> So far, Do not Torture a Duckling is Fulci's best film, by far, in my opinion. The avant-garde social commentaries were combined with explicit scenes of violence and a good mystery to start.
