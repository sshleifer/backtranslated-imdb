This film is one of those that can not be considered by its exteriority. In fact, at first glance, it seems that the story simply focuses on the desire to have more money. But ... let's look at the other side ... What do you see? You see that money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings that the human being has: Should I do the right thing or not? And ... what is "right"? I'll do a deeper analysis ... - What does a small city on the border mean? - It means that sometimes we can get too close to the edge of doing something that we think we could not ... - What does the arid soil that is shown in this image mean? - It means the dryness that sometimes takes possession of our offended hearts ... - What does the phrase of the character (KRISTEN) mean: "Now I belong to him"? - It means the loss of our free will, due to our unpremeditated acts. In MY OPINION, that is the writer of the story and the director tried to "tell us". By the way ... do you remember what another character said (JACK BARNES): "Nothing is so simple ..."
