However, it is a surprisingly good and intelligent adventure that presents Kelsey Grammer (supposedly in her first leading role in a movie) as an unconventional Navy subcommander who wants to run a nuclear submarine of her own, however; he has won it by competing against the United States Navy in a series of war games with a team of unproven, questionable and adorable men (and also a woman). <br /> <br /> Director David S. Ward ("Major League") and his writers have created a hysterically intelligent and optimistic comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do quite well. Second, in addition to the Grammer character, most team members provide part or much of the humor of the film, which is treated as a double-edged sword. Three cast members: Harland Williams, Toby Huss and Rob Schneider provide the funniest scenes, which include strange gestures, personifications and, well, their personalities. <br /> <br /> "Down Periscope" is more than a naval version of "Police Academy" or "The Dirty Dozen". What the film does is to do the job in the right way and I liked it.
