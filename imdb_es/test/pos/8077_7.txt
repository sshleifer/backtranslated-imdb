So forgive the real game scene, the cardboard background and the studio as the stadium. For this part I should have given the movie 5 instead of 7, but keep reading ... <br /> <br /> From the premise of the plot there are many similarities with "The Replacements". Some say that this movie scams "The replacements", while others say that this script wrote it before. <br /> <br /> Both films require some kind of "suspension of disbelief on the basic premise, and this is especially difficult for" Second String "as it has an NFL licensing team and the whole story behind it. Dietary poison excuse may sound too lame for some people, and not to mention that in "Second String", Bills has to beat big scores over and over again, with the budget limit to photograph the scene of the game, this makes it look even bad. <br /> <br /> In "Replacements", the premise and the league are fictitious, but you know they happen in real life, I think it's easier to accept a fictional story and a scenario with a real event (" Oh, yes, this happened before! ", Instead of Real Environment / Background with a fictional scenario (" There's no way that Bill can win a Superbowl! "; Part of the scene was actually filmed in the preseason game of the Raven games, the real stadium, the real audience and some NFL shooting angles alike. <br /> <br /> But let's say that both movies came out the same day, and we deleted the budget factor (hence, In the game action scene): In general, I like "Second String" over "Replacements" "Not much, but I like this more. <br /> <br /> Has "relatively better" character development. In "Replacements," Keanu's character is too "synchronized with the world," and all he cares about is getting a girl? In Second String you see the QB's struggle to get back to work and deal with his past with the coach. Or the fumble boy's problem. This "keep the ball all day" solution, of course, is not new, but we see a progression in its solution. <br /> <br /> What about that trick game? I think it's "relatively realistic" that "Replacements." The "Dan Marino", as a fake knee pass, blinking, panting wild cat, all real, except that sometimes this seems a bit too easy. But for me it's better than the "Replacement" center and the 50-yard run, or how a 60-yard field goal seems too easy. By the way, I'm glad you did not force the kicker TE to make your shot ... <br /> <br /> Of course, if you review this movie objectively about other soccer movies, all this could easily Be a 5 out of 10 movies. But some say that this is the worst soccer movie? Try "The Comebacks".
