I saw this movie in the early 70's when I was about 10 years old. old on TV It was after school, and as I watched, I was so attracted to the idea that the two astronauts were on a mission to another undiscovered planet, that I asked my mother if she could get the recorder. She left me So I wrapped the microphone cable around the channel knob, so that the microphone was hanging in front of the speaker. This movie is the first one I paid enough attention to and it mattered enough to record it. (Only the audio: there were no VCRs at that time). The plot will keep you aware of every word ... every minute of this movie ... The ending will leave you breathless. After seeing the Journey to the other side of the Sun ... You will have flash-backs in your mind for a long time. I repeated the audio recording for many years ... and I "saw" it again and again in my mind. Then, maybe 15 years later ... when video recorders were common and they sold tapes in stores ... I always looked for them ... but I never found them. But when the Internet appeared one day, I looked for it and bought it in a second. So ... after about 30 years of having seen it for the first time, I've seen it again. WOW! ~~ It was spectacular! Just for reference .. I must have seen it 50 times since then.
