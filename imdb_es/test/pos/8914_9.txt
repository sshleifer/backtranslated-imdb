And a difficult place in another place. I have not seen this movie since I was very young, maybe 12 or 13, who knows. But what I do know is that this is the movie that taught me to masturbate. It is not a joke. I have no idea if it's good for today's real standards, but for me, back then, it was everything. <br /> <br /> The only reason I feel comfortable writing this is because I'm sure that not one will ever read it. I mean, really, who's going to look for this movie these days? <br /> <br /> I just discovered that I have not yet used the minimum of ten lines for the amount of length that I work most in a review. . I had no idea that there was such a minimum length, but here I go, like a student trying to fill a page in a diary, my ten lines. thank you.
