I'm really fed up with comedies; You feel like you always know what's coming, so stop being fun. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what's coming and laughs out loud. I just bought the second game of the series, (series 3 -4) and I'm surprised how much I'm enjoying it all over again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many members of the team that are not seen) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait. The gems that have emerged from this series and the respect that the actors achieved through it speak for themselves. Croft and Perry created some pure gold, some of which shine through Hi De Hi.
