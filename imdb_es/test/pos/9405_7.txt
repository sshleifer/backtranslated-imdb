Too bad they showed palm trees that could not be more inaccurate for Connecticut in October ... this was filmed in New Zealand ... This case of Martha Moxley had been "cold" for 20-25 years ... her family worked hard to keep it I live and when Mark Fuhrman decided he did not want to be remembered just for his part in the Nicole Simpson case ... which could have been detrimental to his reputation (if he had not already done so) ... Anyway, he continued while the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships that Martha formed ... Unattended children reach the age of majority without a mother nearby to help and a father who was always connected ... <br /> <br /> Plus the fact that they portray the real Martha as if she were a movie star ... it was a cute and sweet girl next door. Apart from that, the other characters were really great, especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore, who played Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel respectively. They were also good, customers had to keep everything in the 70's and go back to the 90's ... <br /> <br /> I kept my interest even when I heard about the Skakel guy ... ..
