Finally, I was surprised to see my Christmas VHS in Connecticut what another movie reminded me of this one. If it were not for the fact that the other was made 20 years later, I would say it was a remake. <br /> <br /> Just as Rock Hudson was a fake fishing expert for Abercrombie & Fitch, who had to get some in training work in a fishing tournament, Barbara Stanwyck plays a version of Martha Stewart's Forties <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a kitchen columnist who built this whole picture of living on a small Connecticut farm with her husband and baby cooking all these wonderful treats. The problem is that she is not married, she has no children, she writes her column from her apartment in New York and she does not know how to boil the water. But his writing is a success among the public. <br /> <br /> The problem arises when she is kidnapped to prepare a Christmas dinner at home for a sailor war hero played by Dennis Morgan who also sings a couple of songs. I have to maintain the image at any cost. And its editor, Sidney Greenstreet, likes the idea so much that he is invited to dinner. <br /> <br /> So with the borrowed farm, the baby and Reginald Gardiner, who would like to make it happen with Stanwyck, she tries to be cheeky. through <br /> <br /> Christmas in Connecticut is now a Yuletide classic and deservedly. The drivers are warm and human and receive great support from the players gathered. S.Z. Sakall as the owner / friend of a Hungarian restaurant in Stanwyck, from whom she obtains the information of her kitchen and Una O'Connor as a housekeeper has a good chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck do not have any chemistry, which is obvious to everyone except Reggie, and he's funny with his stuffed shirt. <br /> <br /> Most people remember this movie as one of the few adventures of Sidney Greenstreet in comedy. If he is not an absolute villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet is some other things on the screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him a unique opportunity to make fun of his own image and he took full advantage of it. <br /> <br /> In a biography of Barbara Stanwyck, she mentions that she enjoyed making Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from some evil parts such as the double compensation she had been doing recently. One of the things that made the filming so enjoyable was that between shots, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet would make an impromptu entertainment of the cast and crew with the English Music Hall numbers. Made for a relaxed and warm game, and the cast responded accordingly. <br /> <br /> Now, if someone had been filming those numbers.
