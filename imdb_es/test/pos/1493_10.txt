This is a wonderful family comedy. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in other excellent comedies, The Thin Blue Line (Better than this) and Blackadder (No better than this). <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a human disaster that says nothing. He goes to places and gets into absolute chaos, the chaos includes: Climb onto the upper trampoline and is too scared to jump, taking about 20 minutes, until some children finally throw him out, ending up inside a washing machine and driving his car while I was sitting on a roof. Bean drives a Mini and has a stuffed animal. <br /> <br /> This was quite similar to The Baldy Man, a series starring Gregor Fisher that says very little, but gets into madness. Best episode: Do it yourself, Mr Bean. Episode 9: Bean organizes an end-of-year party, then receives some things to decorate his apartment, but he has too many things and he has to drive his car on the roof.
