About the discussion about the South, the southern peasants and the mountaineers ... Well, I am from the South: Argentina, near the South Pole, to be exact. Is this enough south? Seriously, some stories are universal. We have never been to Greece, nor have we lived through Homer's classic period, but he speaks to us today. The same goes for Shakespeare and Dante. And we also get stories from unknown places when we tell them about sensitivity, intelligence and humor, like "O hermano". In addition, all of us (the rest of the world) also have our own locals! And our own era of depression (did you ever hear about Argentina during 2001?), Our politicians and racism, our gentle souls like Delmar and Tommy ... I just loved this movie, folks. Despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world. (And, please, forgive my mistakes in English, I did my best) <br /> <br /> PS: I think no one quoted this favorite phrase: when Delmar asks George Nelson what he does, while driving the machine. gun...
