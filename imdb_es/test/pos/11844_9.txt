I took this movie the other night in one of the movie channels and I have not laughed so much in a long time. This movie was so fun that I went out and bought it the next day. I love this kind of comedy. It just seemed so real in the way the actors react to different situations here. I was Rollin. I had never heard of that and just started seeing it under the title "See other people". The title made me give it a try and I'm glad I did it. I laughed so hard that it hurt. Now it is part of my collection. I definitely recommend it to all those who enjoy the kind of intelligent comedy. I will be seeing this again and again.
