Once a year in America, Saturday morning would give way to new cartoons, usually at some point in America. Just about the time the school started. <br /> <br /> I suppose this was so that not having classes on Saturdays is more bearable. <br /> <br /> One Friday night before the premiere of the new Saturday morning cartoons, a movie went on. <br /> <br /> "At the core of the Earth" I had no idea who Cushing or McClure was. They were clearly not from the same country, so I could not understand why they were traveling together. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the mechanism in the mouth of the monster that spits fire. <br /> <br /> What connects this film to me is the opening with the molten metal and then, suddenly, we make the band touch as we see the factory. <br /> <br /> How do you end a movie like this? Music again, and two policemen baffled as the drill appears behind them. <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason, I remember seeing this movie more on Friday night than any other caricature that arrived the next morning. <Br /> <br /> That was definitely in the late seventies. <br /> <br /> It would be during the mania of Jurassic Park, cicra '93, I think, before I saw this movie again. <br /> <br /> Yes, people in suits. He breathed again. <br /> <br /> I still loved the ending with the two cops. <br /> <br /> Finally, it would be almost another decade before I sent the film to the DVD. <br /> <br /> Now I would only see the beginning and the introduction. <br /> <br /> Oh, I love the movie a lot. Of all these science fiction movies, Jules Verne, HG Wells, ERB, this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> What I see now is that one of the cops starts turning a little too soon, then turns around. back, then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward to look back at the drill. <br /> <br /> Maybe for me, this movie is the best of the shows on Saturday morning, which is why I enjoy it so much.
