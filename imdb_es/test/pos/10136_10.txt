This is one of the best movies I've seen! How someone can hit this movie simply confuses my imagination! First, the performances of Gooding and Harris were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. That's the only way I can describe the performance: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play such a character and achieve it; Then you see Gooding, and his performance was magical. As for the plot, since it was based on a real person, it goes where the lives of the characters go. For all action fans, it can be a bit slow, but it's not an action movie. I definitely give this movie a 10. It deserves nothing less!
