Soul Calibur is more solid than it ever was ... with the creation of the new character and the chronicle of the sword mode in the domestic version. <br /> <br /> The arcade version is more complete, although the list of characters is smaller than the domestic version, this version is definitely the prettiest of the two, eliminating all "ridiculous / unreal" fighting styles. that are in the domestic version. If somehow you were disappointed by the house version, or maybe you thought it was "too much", you could find a much more pleasant and direct game of Soul Calibur in the arcade. Do you think you have what it takes to become a legend?
