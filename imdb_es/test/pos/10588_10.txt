The movie was fantastic. If you are a fan of the cky videos of Bams, Jackass or your Viva la Bam program, you can not help but like it. I have some friends who are not fans who enjoyed it, and others who thought it was not so good. Those who did not like it were mostly friends, they did not really appreciate the raw humor, which I personally think made the movie so fun. I'm pretty sure the whole movie was filmed in Bams's hometown, which includes many of his regularly visited places. The cast is made up of all your friends and cky friends, and also includes some renowned professional skaters as well. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with music by HIM. In my opinion, Haggard has it all. A great plot, characters that you will never see anywhere else. Lots of humor, good music and a cast dedicated to the project.
