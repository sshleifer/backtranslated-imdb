When I entered the theater, I thought it was going to be a great movie. And it did not disappoint me a bit. WOOHOO! This movie is brilliant! The emotions that are felt throughout the film are extraordinary! Great performance of Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman This is probably the best Tamil movie I've seen in a long time. Mani Ratnam has shown once again that he is the best at making meaningful and sincere films. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically about a girl (PS Keerthana) who is looking for her biological mother (Nandita Das) who left her in a refugee camp to fight for her country as well as her husband (JD Chakravathy ). A young novelist (Madhavan) learns the story of this young woman and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this little girl, but one day she discovers that they are not her real parents and decides to look for her biological mother. <br /> <br /> This movie really screams EXCELLENT. The way Mani Ratnam presented the film is magnificent. <br /> <br /> My rating - 10/10
