I saw this movie when it was released in the smaller cinemas in the United Kingdom about 50 years ago; and there is the memory of a great musical score, and the tragedy of history. I saw it again on video recently. The soundtrack was poor and the image grainy; but it's one of the two movies that I saw again the next day, the other one is Gladiator. The musical theme is intensely tragic, and from the beginning it is known that it announces failure or death. Without doubt one of the best results of George Sanders; like a man who works in the black market to recover what he lost in the war, but nemesis waits; Patricia Roc plays a refugee from Eastern Europe who eats with despair. He is attracted to her, wants to help her selflessly and then falls in love with her, but she is too proud and hurt to accept help. His love destroys him, and inevitably the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall), who brought the nemesis. The plot is of complex interrelated destinies, where the subsidiary characters are not who they seem to be. This is like a movie, which marked the critics and fought at the box office; but for the teenager who saw it, and for the retired gentleman who saw him again, it is one of the best films (considering his age) whose story is more like an opera.
