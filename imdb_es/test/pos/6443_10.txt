An orphan boy named Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for a pair of shaded curtains, is falsely accused of stealing from the mansion where Mr. Grimes (James Mason) works, the real thief, and continues to run. Tom's only alibi is the niece of the owners of the mansion (Samantha Gates, a slender, blue-eyed blonde with long wavy hair, which I'm sure was the main reason why I saw him repeatedly as a child) . He and his dog jump into a river and a witch turns them into cartoon characters who breathe water! While underwater, he makes friends with a shark and rescues a group of children who breathe in the water known as water babies. <br /> <br /> A very interesting and always fascinating fable, set in 1850, that should attract all children. The animation (42 minutes of the HBO VHS 85 minute impression) is quite normal, but it is preferable to the most modern animation, even to computer animation! My only real complaint is a hole in the plot caused by a deleted scene. At 42:06, after the first verse of "High Cockalorum", the film cuts to a scene with octopuses swimming, followed by Tom and Jacque's encounter with Terence. This leads to a scene in which the killer shark (with Mason's voice) leads our heroes into a trap. Then the shark greets Tom with "Young Tom, it's good to see your ugly mug again", but this is the first time in the HBO print that Tom meets the shark! Most reference books indicate run time as 92 or 93 minutes, and previously it was available in Sultan Entertainment and Nelson, so it is very likely that the HBO print is edited and / or compressed in time. Adding insults to injuries, MGM released a full-screen print in 76 minutes on DVD in 2002! Hopefully a restored version will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> The film is copyrighted by Ariadne Films 1978. "Ariadne" is the aquatic baby with the voice of Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who plays Mason's partner in the crime, also expresses the electric eel. A.K.A. Slip Slide Adventures.
