When it comes to ANY movie that was made in or on the South, the characters are labeled as racist or Hillbillies or even worse, that horrible term of RACIST "Rednecks".

The same kind of observations made by actors of black characters towards whites in today's movies. Before watching this movie, one must obtain the chip of "MISSISSIPPI BURNS" from the shoulder of Ones and enjoy the plot, the wonderful performance and the reminiscent scenes of simpler times that, while they leave, will not be forgotten. Mr. Faulkner made his hometown of OXFORD, miss. Justice for having this movie filmed there. The producer noticed that while filming the film there, his stereotypical perception of whites was wrong and he observed black and white people and locals who got along in the same way.
