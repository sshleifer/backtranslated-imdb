Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman in her twenties, is on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) just had the tragedy of losing his wife in a car accident. One can guess the result. Gracie receives the heart of Bob's wife, even if they do not know each other ... yet! A year later, Gracie feels like a new person, while Bob is starting to think about his social life. When a friend puts him on a blind date, Bob finds himself interested in the waitress, Gracie, at the restaurant where the appointment occurs. You begin to see. How much time will pass before the truth materializes and what will be the consequences? This charming, funny and moving film is one of the best romantic comedies ever built. The two stars dazzle because the couple that only the sky could gather and the cast of support, Bonnie Hunt, Jim Belushi and Carroll O'Connor, are also wonderful. Taking place near Chicago, the neighborhood environment is equally charming and beautiful. We are going to make those Ã­dems for the costumes and the script. If you know someone who is gaga through cheerful love stories, you will be in good condition forever if you present this excellent movie.
