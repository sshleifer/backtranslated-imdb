When I was in the United States, I was about 7 or 8 years old, I always woke up early, just to see this, along with a lot of other cartoons like HootKloot, The Road Runner Show, The Pink Panther. But this was perhaps one of the most memorable and fun animated works that exist, and even today I find it very funny, will I never forget the episodes, like that of two aardvarks fighting over the can of chocolate pudding and ants? or the one in which the aardvark is trying to reach the island where all the ants are, and my personal favorite, in which the ant, the aardvark and a dog end up in an animal hospital, which would later become the basis of a Cartoon similar of Looney Toon with Sylvester, Tweety and the bulldog. This is one of the most unforgettable cartoons out there in which anyone would love to revisit, I would. An excellent series.
