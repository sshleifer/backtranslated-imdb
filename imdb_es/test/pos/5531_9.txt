It's not always safe to mix laughs with the comedians. The comics involved have to like or admire each other, or be willing to endure the irritability of others. GO TO THE WEST with the Marx Brothers where Buster Keaton wrote the script as a joke man. Groucho did not think too much about Keaton's ideas, and embarrassed him in a meeting of scripts. And although some of Keaton's gems still appear in the finished movie (like the weapon that turns into a brush that turns into a gun), the film was one of the weakest that the Marx Brothers did. <br /> <br /> A Better movie, but also affected by comic dgos egos, was WC. Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, who discarded the script of a series of duels of a line between the drivers. But the phrases were just as fun, so the movie is still a success. <br /> <br /> But SIX OF A KIND is an example of six cinematic comics that worked well together. The reason is simple: there are actually three comic teams that work together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan, and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were matched in half a dozen comedies during the 1930s, usually with Boland as a somewhat bossy wife, and Ruggles as a nervous wreck of a husband. Fields (usually a single act) was paired three times with Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS and IF I HAVE MILLION were the other two times). Skippy always discovered how to control or counteract his man's larcenas activities: in the current movie, she takes action in her own hands with the stolen money that she is looking for (she knows that the local sheriff, Fields, is not the one chosen). trust this). As for Burns and Allan, they manage to get involved effortlessly with Ruggles and Boland on their journey across the country by car. <br /> <br /> Ruggles quickly realizes the mistake he made when he accepted to travel. Gracie: in a moment she makes him fall off a cliff and hang on a branch. He is relatively helpless when she insists on 1) photographing him in his position, and 2) correcting his grammar. The presence of the gigantic dog of George and Gracie ("Ran Tang Tang" is his name) does not facilitate the travel arrangements for Charlie and Mary. <br /> <br /> Fields has some moments to choose from. When he insists on yelling at the quartet, he says he has permission to do it, he's the sheriff! He also explains, during a game of pool, the unlikely story of how he got his undeserved nickname "Honest John". You have to listen carefully to the story, as it interrupts your attempts to play pool a few times (once a billiard ball has accidentally hit you), but it shows that there were elements that even Fields would not have been right to steal. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the "Summary Line", I mentioned a forgotten actor named Bradley Page; he was the man responsible for the problems Charley Ruggles is suspicious of. Bradley has to have a reason to leave the city to catch up with the unsuspecting Ruggles and Boland, so he calls his girlfriend. He tells her to return the call to his job and tells him that he has to leave the city because someone has died. There is a pause, as he apparently hears a question returned by the bride. "ANYTHING!", He says, clearly annoyed. Although most of the humor in the film is carried by the sextet of the performers, Mr.Page had the most gracefully unexpected line of the film.
