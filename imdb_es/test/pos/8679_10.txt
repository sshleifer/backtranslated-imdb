I must say that this is the best movie I've seen. I know that on this website I have only received negative reviews, but for once I would like to be the good person who gives the best movie in the world a good review. I find that the film is extremely funny, and has the perfect mix of everything. It makes me feel all kinds of emotions when I see it, and I can not have enough. The soundtracks are brilliant. I LOVE it, I understand why people do not love him as much as I do, but I do not understand how people could hate him. The film is 100% bright. Fuzzy is amazing I never realized that Australian films could be so good, and I never realized that I could watch a movie, so many times in a single day without getting tired of it. I think everyone should see it, either to have an idea of ​​what life was like in the younger days, or to see what it is like when the end of year 12 comes around.
