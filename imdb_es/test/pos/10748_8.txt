Honestly, I do not know why so many people hate this movie, I always thought it was one of my favorites. the fight with the tiger and his men were shaken, the fight with the pirates with the axes, the whole sketch with everyone trying to avoid each other in the house is a pure genius ... well, so he did not have the confrontation kick final necessary. The manchus were pretty good. I give it an 8/10.
