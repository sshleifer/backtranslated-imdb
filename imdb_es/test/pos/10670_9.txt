However, if you can look beyond the "2001: Space Odyssey" post, you want to make a science fiction movie with a "far" storyline, and if you enjoy a special imagination. , then you will enjoy this gem of a to a time when man had just walked on the moon and people kept looking at the stars with awe and hope for the future instead of looking down. in the banal traps of the current 21st century.
