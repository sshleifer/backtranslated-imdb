Very good movie! I was browsing the channels on my TV and I generally ignore the channels that broadcast drama movies, but then I saw this channel that broadcasts old school movies and that's where I saw this movie. At first, when I saw the title "The Cure", I thought it would be boring, but then I got hooked when I saw that Brad Renfro was in this movie (because one of my favorite movies of all time is "The Client" , where Brad also stars). Then the scenes were improving and improving. The story is so beautiful and very moving! I cried a lot in this movie that I do not usually do. Great casting! And there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this movie that is very surprising and made me cry a lot! Now, I bought my own copy on DVD and I always recommend it to everyone!
