In the light of the recent typhoon that hit the country with force (that is, Typhoon Ondoy), I thought of seeing again "Black Rain" (1988, Japan), the black and white masterpiece of Shohei Imamura in the Destruction and Aftermath of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in the final period of World War II. The destruction and impact of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) may differ in degree and quality, but the trauma and the scar (physical and psychological), however, are still there. <br /> <br /> It is a testament to the power of a film that your images remain as powerful and indelible as when you first saw them. It's just that the difference now, in my case, is that seeing these images has acquired a greater sense of intensity and power due to the first-hand experience of a monumental climatic calamity. There is a sense of kinship, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always a pleasure to watch because of his anarchy, sensuality and earthiness: "The Pornographers: Introduction to Anthropology" (1966), "Eijanaika" (1981), "Warm Water Under a Red Bridge" (2001), his two Palme d'Or-winners "Ballad of Narayama" (1983) and "The Eel" (1997), to name a few. Considering the mood of his films, who would have thought that he was once the assistant director of Yasujiro Ozu, the most austere and minimalist filmmaker in Japanese cinema? But then, it is the rigorous formality and domesticity of Ozu against which Imamura rebelled. <br /> <br /> But again, with "Black Rain" one can unequivocally feel the traces of Ozu. The father (or the father figure) is trying to see his daughter marry before the time runs out with both of them, and the stillness and calm of the scenes that show all the family members together (in particular, the scenes of dinner or at Ozu's house). The film lexicon, the tatami, is something that the revered film master would always explore in his works ("Tokyo Story", "Late Spring"). Essentially, the total and deliberate quality of "Black Rain" is a remarkable contrast to the bacchanal chaos and the instinctive impulse of the entire Imamura filmography. <br /> <br /> However, this does not mean that watching the movie would not be a totally disturbing experience. "Black Rain," as the American film critic Leonard Maltin aptly described it, is "full of disquieting black and white images." In the first 15 minutes of the film, Imamura makes no effort to show the immediate and graphic horrors of the nuclear bombardment, one after the other (bodies with stiff burns, hanging flesh, undead, fires and debris everywhere, madness by all sides). An assault on the senses of the spectators, it definitely is, along with the grim photograph of Takashi Kawamata in black and white (he made the glasses in the criminal drama of Yoshitaru Nomura "The Incident") and the chilling score of Toru Takemitsu (made music in classics such as "Ran" by Akira Kurosawa and "Double Suicide" by Masahiro Shinoda). <br /> <br /> Even during the supposed "quiet" phase of the film (ie, five years after the atomic bombing), one can never have a sense of satisfaction and order, and the restlessness and pain is still feel strongly by the survivors, not only in terms of poor physical health, but rather in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma. The human race, now seems unquestionably, has been destined to support the legacy of the Bomb, as long as it lives. <br /> <br /> I already wrote an article on "Black Rain" some years before (published on IMDb.com), but only in comparison with the magnificent "Tin Drum" by Volker Schlondorff, another film about madness monumental human and global catastrophe. Also, it has never been my practice to write twice about a film about which I wrote something before. It was in light of the recent climate calamity that devastated our country that I was asked to revisit and write something about this extraordinary Imamura film, as there are a lot of lessons to learn from both the film and the recent event. As for the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action, and the long-term scars and wounds caused by large-scale destruction (whether induced by man or by nature). <br /> <br /> There have been a number of films dealing with the holocaust and nuclear destruction ("Testament", "Themes", "The game of war", each located within their respective countries), and "Black Rain" is among them, if not more, for their lack of apology. and the bleak portrait of individual and community disintegration caused by atomic devastation and the fact that it is based on a historical event. <br /> <br /> Within a few weeks, another Hollywood disaster film, the "2012" by Roland Emmerich, will finally hit (no pun intended) the big screen. As we all know, this American director's "disaster / apocalypse" movie group - "Independence Day", "Godzilla", "The day after tomorrow" - has no other purpose than to be of mere entertainment value, without a real reality. knowledge of the nature and wisdom of the apocalyptic disaster and the human condition affected. I wonder how this "gigantic" film would exploit the trauma, the disorientation and the apprehensions that our people still experience due to the recent calamity of the climate. To say that this movie is a cautionary tale would probably be nothing more than an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> But yes, I will still see "2012".
