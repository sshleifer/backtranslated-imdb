It is a pity that the author wants to deny the reality of the purpose of Faulkner and Clarence Brown in the creation of the story and the movie "Intruder In The Dust". I guess the burden of a racist story is hard to bear for any Southerner and I can understand it. But to say that this movie was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (to borrow its capitalization) iamensante, there are many many places where blacks and whites in the South get along quite well. But to deny the way in which blacks were forced to live, the conditions and injustices that have had to endure are not imaginary. Sometimes white and black people got along because of genuine affection and understanding. Sometimes it was only while the blacks "knew their place". The goal of making the character of Juano Hern√°ndez (in film and print) a somewhat thorny, not warm and diffuse, was to highlight the fact that fanaticism is wrong in itself and human rights are just that for everyone, regardless of whether we like it or not. Individual or not. <br /> <br /> It would be good to stop denying the existence of racism and the great damage it has done to Americans of all kinds. The fact is that blacks (among others) did not receive, as a general rule, not as an exception, the benefits of the justice system with the same impartiality as whites. Segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical facts. People like the enthusiast could say that these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. It would be wonderful if the southern ancestors of iameracing (if any) would ever participate in any of the horrible racist actions that ruin the history of this country and I hope they have not. If so, congratulations to them, but that fact, if true, does not erase the fact that others did. And even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the South (and other areas, let's not forget the Civil War Era Riot Project) were only half as many, only a third, that makes them less horrible? The murder of ten children, the hanging of ten men, the sexual assault of ten women, is less horrible than the same things that happen to a hundred? <br /> <br /> Iameracing asks us to take out the "Mississippi Burning" chip before we see "Intruder In The Dust", well, I ask you: did the murders of civil rights activists happen or not? Why should I forget that? Forgiven? Perhaps. But to prevent them from happening again, they can not be forgotten or revised in minor events. The racism shown in "Intruder In The Dust" is shown there on purpose. It is there to make a point. <br /> <br /> At a cinematic historical level, it is also ridiculous that threats do not take into account the racial angle. Any viewer of films that were filmed before the 1960s knows that black actors / characters / extras were generally deliberately chosen. Judging by our history of cinema; wars were always fought by middle-aged white men; There were no black people in the Old West; It was possible to walk down a street in a major city and never find a black person; there were no hospital managers, taxi drivers, clerks, salespeople, etc. Blacks were almost never chosen for a role unless race was a factor. If Falukner (and Brown) had wanted to tell a simple murder story, it probably would not have made the character of Hernandez black. <br /> <br /> Racism exists Probably for different reasons, I'm sure, we both wish it were not like that, but that's the way it is. Wanting things to be the way we would like them to be is probably not avoidable, but still does not make them that way.
