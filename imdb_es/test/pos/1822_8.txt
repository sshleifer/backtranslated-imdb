This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time and it is what made me a lifelong fan of Nicolas Cage. In the middle of the 80s I recorded this movie (when it was impossible to do this with VCR) and I saw it again and again. Nicolas Cage is simply brilliant here. And, it looks wonderful and does not have "acting actors" (see "Peggy Sue Got Married" to know what I mean by that). I measure all your actions against this one. He was as perfectly chosen as the great punk boy with nervous friends. The music was great. Plimsouls Psychedelic skins! Modern English! Men working! Every time I hear "Melt With You" I come back to the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> What happened to your cute co-star, Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? It certainly took a different turn from that of Nicol√°s! Interestingly, the fucking friend (Elizabeth Daily) ended up being the voice of Tommy of the Rugrats (he is considered as E.G. Daily for that horrible show). Strange! <br /> <br /> If you want to make a great trip back to the 80s, watch this movie. It is definitely a classic. Like Totally!
