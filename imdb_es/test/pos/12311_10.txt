Naturally, in a film whose main themes are mortality, nostalgia and the loss of innocence, it is perhaps not surprising that older viewers rate it more than young people. However, there is a craft and complete ability of the movie that anyone can enjoy. The rhythm is constant and constant, the characters are full and attractive, the relationships and interactions show naturally that floods of tears are not needed to show emotion, screams to show fear, screams to show dispute or violence to show anger. Naturally, Joyce's story gives the film a ready-made structure, as perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes that Huston makes, like the inclusion of the poem, fit perfectly. It is truly a masterpiece of touch, subtlety and overwhelming beauty.
