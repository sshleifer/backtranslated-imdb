What makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies? I was not kidding, I was seeing it about 10 times and I did not get tired. Is the tender melancholy throughout the whole affair? Is the similarity with the classics like "Niagara"? I was thinking a lot about that. And I discovered it: I suppose so: there is no hero, there are only people. Some try to be good. Some stopped trying to be good. Some are cases without hope, but still carry the cunning of being human inside. It's the story of a catastrophic night in a motel at the end of the world. In a way, catastrophe is only the end of a chain of coincidences. Otherwise, tonight reveals the logical consequences of the life of this people because they are in a certain constellation isolated from the rest of the world. It has something of a Dostoevsky tale.
