This is one of the best films of the French Revolution ever produced. Being a person well versed in the period, I was surprised at the level of detail. The costumes are perfect. Even the small items detailed from day to day, such as ink wells, serving dishes, etc. they are perfect. As an American who lives in France and has access to the sites of the film through his membership in various historical associations such as the Napoleonic Alliance, I can not help but express how impressed he was with the visual precision of the film. <br /> <br /> The dialogue where it is known is virtual appointments and where it is not registered is in character. I was extremely pleased with this movie and I am disappointed that it is not yet on DVD. This is how historical drama should be made. You should see....
