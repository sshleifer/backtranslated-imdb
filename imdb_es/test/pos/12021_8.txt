Even though I saw this movie when I was very young, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd, who escaped from Newgate prison. <br /> <br /> Apart from the freedom taken at the end, the film follows the true story more or less faithfully. The temptation to double the facts, which is the hallmark of many of the so-called historical films, resists in this film and the filmmakers must be praised for that. <br /> <br /> From the performances, There's hardly a poor performance, and Tommy Steele is the ideal cast. It is also good that Stanley Baker as Thief-Taker and Alan Badel is good as always. <br /> <br /> Because the film adheres to the facts, it makes it suitable for the whole family to see.
