The main achievement of this film is that, although racially unipolar, the film still manages to create a series of war representations that leave a lasting identification with whoever can see it, and who was present at this moment. Although good films may have the ability to universalize their themes, it is often difficult to do; The great films have the ability to universalize their unipolar themes, which is what this film does. <br /> <br /> Instead of creating a context of unity, the film shows the Japanese in the unhealthy final of the Philippine war front in February 1945, signaling for pacifism or war, but rather to make signs of feelings, death, destruction, victory and dizziness of war with the bloody hands of the vanquished. Different and superior to films like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, which needed a satirical methodology to trivialize and depersonalize American companies, and use all races as a fight, which is fine, but not as big as a movie that use a race and sight, which would look fascist if created in America, to convey the horror of war and show what it really is like. <br /> <br /> The only way in which the main character manages to finish this movie until the end, is by being sick, so you can not eat; Hence, through this character, through his illness, his saving face, we see the end of the Second World War in the Philippines in February 1945 and the way in which the Americans, the Japanese and the Filipinos united in bloody acts of war where you live to die. . <br /> <br /> The film is evidently influenced by a neo-realist form of cinematographic representation, which is original and beneficial to the viewer, either then or now, since the neo-realist techniques it employs convey all the horrors of war in pictures. Form, either a showcase for pacifism or 'militarist responsibility'. Like Germania Anno Zero, by Roberto Rossellini, a history of the environment and the conditions associated with it emerges. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film, with the two-way discussion between the two Japanese soldiers, prefigures and gives the impression of events. Through this opening, we feel that the struggle is human against human, and human with human; it shows that they entrusted each other to face the enemy in the past battles, but now, in this opening, or 'pivot' of the experiences of the Japanese in the Philippines, new information is transmitted to the main character, Tamura, giving a foreboding of a cannibal dependence on one another if they wish to survive. <br /> <br /> The jungle is sandy, humid and thick, and the sky is not infrequently cloudy and is pouring. We walk with the stragglers through puddles and marshes, as sick as the land that surrounds them. Unnamed corpses are scattered everywhere. Occasionally you can not tell if they are bodies, rocks or corn. Apparently there is no difference here, everything is dead and sick. Everything is dying. All they have to feed themselves are rare monkeys and corpses of fallen comrades and / or unnamed enemies. <br /> <br /> Often, Tamura meets another dead person near death. Although crushed in spirit and crushing their own, some offer their bodies to eat, but he refuses; he still, as Hiroshi Kawaguchi as Nishi in Giants and Toys, will not fall to the death of Japanese dignity and morality; because this is all he really has to endure to survive, a dignity of himself. Therefore, when Nagamatsu is dissecting a soldier for consumption, he shoots him for that. Tamura may be used to killing, but she can not decipher the disease of killing and looting. He is neither a good man nor a bad man. He wants to survive, but he will not go beyond the simple killing of direct war. His self belonged dead on the battlefield, he is not happy here to wade and clean the weak for his survival. <br /> <br /> The disease that leads is everywhere, in all; and, unfortunately, he lacks the ethical logic of thinking or thinking completely about others, since he can not give his body for them because of his contagious disease, or think completely about himself, since he sees the disease in everyone, although he still killing them. even if they do not hurt. Seen in his attack on the two Philippians in the hut. He can not see anyone. Nobody can see anyone. The only ones see an aversion to disease and an adversity to health, the heart of survival instincts. <br /> <br /> Often, there is an arm that points to the left of the screen, towards what should be hope, because there, in what far Thule is free. However, it is blocked by the American soldiers, leaving the Japanese stragglers to die slowly in this disconsolate land. Even a church tower appears, reflecting the light of an invisible sun. But on closer inspection the crows flit wildly about it; Religion is also an air of poison. <br /> <br /> Nobi, the Japanese title of the film, gives more evidence of the themes or feelings of the film: the servitude to fate, the heaviness of existence under the leaders and Lives controlled by others. His own translation into English has a subject of great debate among historians, since non-Koreans translate it as "slave" and "slavery", while many Koreans argue that nobi was not a slave system, but a class system of servants who do not meet the requirements. Criteria for slavery. A way to escape typically from heartbreaking poverty. This improves the theme of the war and the symbolism of the soldiers. <br /> <br /> Is it not important in the period of time to ask ourselves what is the purpose of what our story will be won? Should we feel comfortable letting it unwind without a conscious effort for change? Is it not against whom we fight that old story, but why do we fight? Fires on the Plain is with Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa and Mickey Curtis; Based on a novel by Shohei Ooka. In Japanese with subtitles.
