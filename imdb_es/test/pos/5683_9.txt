One of the best horror / suspense movies I've seen in a long time. Wow, it was a big surprise and I was surprised how good this movie was, sometimes a gem like this will surface but it's weird. I expected a movie of popcorn monsters and a slightly entertaining way to spend the night, but instead it was a very well made and directed movie with a great performance and made with passion and heart. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them, it was filmed as if you were there and it's really happening. I know that some people in other reviews compare it with "Open Water", but I do not agree because I thought that Open Water was quite boring and mediocre, whereas this film was the opposite, although superficially they are recorded in the same "realistic" style . br /> <br /> The actors are unknown, at least to me, but they are all very effective and transmit the terrible situation with terrifying intensity and realism. The story is well made and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and seems to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are exactly what a person would do and think. Very believable and this makes the movie more real because of that. <br /> <br /> I had tears in my eyes at the end. I must say that a film rarely has this effect on me, this is how powerful and emotional this film was and I am impressed by the director and the actors of this great movie.
