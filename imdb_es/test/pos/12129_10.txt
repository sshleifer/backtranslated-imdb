"Let me ask you one more question" Ha! how great soon ... this movie was brilliant fantastic acting, great script. The only reason why nobody noticed was that, due to the low budget, everyone will agree with me that it is a cult like "Donnie Brasco", which shows a young Joe Pesci once again as a mobster, this movie is on your list with the cults. he has some sopranos and some good chases had his idea of ​​the sopranos when he saw this and Scorsese found Joe Pesci while watching him, that proves that it must be great, am I right or am I wrong? I must admit they showed a brilliant scene in which they threw peanuts at a field pianist "Stop with the friggen peanuts".
