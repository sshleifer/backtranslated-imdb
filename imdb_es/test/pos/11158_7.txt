Jacques Audiard's directorial debut, See How They Fall, also known as Regarde les Hommes Tomber, is our old friend, the film with two different stories that gradually converge and become the same story after all, just told from different sides. It is a story of furry dogs, with the genius of Matthieu Kassovitz following Jean Louis Trintignant, the unlucky of the cards, with a devotion similar to a stray dog ​​that extends to kill for him when he is asked to pay his gambling debts in species. Meanwhile, in a slightly different time frame, Jean Yanne's street vendor becomes increasingly obsessed with finding the hit man who put his police friend in a brain-dead coma, his life, his income and his relationships. They disappeared gradually as they got closer to their prey. However, while it may offer the perfect configuration for a modern neo noir, the film is often more surprisingly funny, more interested in the quirks of the character and in a slightly biased sense of humor (guessed right by the occasional ironic titles and half by Alexandre Desplat). cheerful, discordant medium) than the traditional suspense series and the mechanical plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is abused by one of the worst Region 1 DVDs released in recent years: the image quality in Synkronized. The album is so poor at times that it expects to see the heads of the audience in front of the image like a pirate disk.
