This movie is like "The Breakfast Club" meets "Mad City". It has a plot twist after another with Justin Walker, Corey Feldman and James Remar offering really cool performances. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you do not like movies that "go to the end" with respect to violence, then do not look at the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I could not take my eyes off the screen. This is a really rough and realistic teen drama. I can not believe it came from the king of the B film, Roger Corman. This movie is a must see for those who are not weak of heart. Highly recommended
