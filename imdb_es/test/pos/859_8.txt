Yesterday I saw the movie and I really enjoyed it. Although there were several clues that I could tell after seeing them a second time, I could not wake up the Dow-Dawn case. Maybe this was my carelessness. The subconsciousness of a woman became concrete with personalization. "Let me out", the key sentence of the film. Let me out from the depths of your brain and we will both be free. A discrete film that forces the limits of human consciousness and the brain. Anyone who has seen the 'machinist' would notice the similarities with the sunrise. A man who could not escape his consciousness (again a psychological and abstract concept) finds him in a human body. And he will simply be free to accept and realize that there is no way to escape. I also want to mention about the performances of 'creaking things of the dawn. Despite not having many experiences, from actors and actresses to director, all are exhibited separately Reasonable performance that has created a synergy that would increase the quality of the film.
