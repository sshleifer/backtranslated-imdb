This is a lovely jewel of a movie, unfortunately embedded as "just for kids". The plot revolves around a young man, Roy Eberhardt, recently arrived in southwest Florida from the mountains of Montana. While trying to fit in with the other children at his high school, Roy discovers that a team of brothers and sisters is trying to protect the endangered owls at an illegal construction site. Look for Carl Hiassen, the author of the book on which this film is based, as the male secretary of the evil head of corporate headquarters. Writer / director Wil Shriner is also employed by the Office of Public Records where intrepid teenage detectives discover that the incriminating Environmental Impact Report is missing. Luke Wilson almost steals all the crucial scenes of the charming teenage actors who have the most of the best lines. Wilson is the clumsy police officer, in his three-wheeled electric police car complete with blue light and funky siren. As Officer Dave, he tries very hard to get it right, but usually ends up falling into the mud, literally! Several times! Jimmy Buffet is quite discreet as the unsupported science teacher of support. But, the young actors Logan Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrice the Bear) and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers) are excellent as teenagers who finally put Officer Dave on the right track, following the trail of paper left by the villain corporate boss I hope you come out of this movie feeling as good as I do. Simply fun! A small complaint, however. I hope all non-Floridians realize that not everyone in Florida is as rude to newcomers as shown in this movie. We are really a friendly group! Just ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet !!
