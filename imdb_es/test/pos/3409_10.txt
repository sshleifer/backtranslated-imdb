"North & South", the television miniseries is for the 80s what "Rich Man, Poor Man" (the first TV miniseries) was for the 70s. <br /> <br /> It's a fabulous adaptation of The First classic novel in the trilogy of author John Jakes. The story itself covers the two decades leading up to the years of the election of President Abraham Lincoln and the imminent proclamation of the Civil War: North against South. The interwoven stories evolve around the families of the Hazards (the 'North' in the title) and the Mains and their two central figures of George and Orry who form a friendship as they embark on their training at West Point in 1842. <br /> "North & South" is a wonderful historical timeline and, as I grew (and wiser!) I am very interested in knowing the contrasting attitudes of such controversial aspects as 'Slavery' and 'Abolitionists' , and how these attitudes originated. <br /> <br /> The series also features a great characterization development as we meet the friends and enemies in the lives of George and Orry, and also the women who stole their hearts as young men. This aspect of the story also reveals a romantic story set in the turbulent scenery of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "North and South", along with "Rich Man, Poor Man" is overshadowed by 1977 "Roots" as the best miniseries of all time. However, the second / third approaches and also shares the same type of timeline and topics as "Roots." But, do not let it slip away, even if it's just to see the magnificent scenery, the costumes and the brilliant cast of stars like Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, Lesley-Anne Down et al. <br /> <br /> The series is beautifully designed and firmly linked to real historical events and it's a shame that the Emmys and the Golden Globes have not honored many more actors and actresses for their portraits. Patrick Swayze and James Read, the two virtual actors unknown at the time, present compelling performances like Orry Main and George Hazard, respectively. However, it is the fascinating performance of Kirstie Alley as George's "Abolitionist" sister, Virgilia, who steals the show many times. In addition, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff as Elkanah Bent are the delicious villains of the piece you love to hate. <br /> <br /> The "North and South" books 1 and 2 are now available in two sets of DVDs.
