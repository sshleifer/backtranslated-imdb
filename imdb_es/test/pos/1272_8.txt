The great British director Christopher Nolan (Moment, Insomnia), directs this strange film about a writer with difficulties obsessed with following people. This is harmless at first, but it soon becomes dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a like-minded man who shows him the ins and outs of breaking and entering. The two men soon get fully into a strange world related to the mafia and prostitution. Jeremy Theobald plays the writer and Alex Haw, the like-minded friend. Both are great performances. This low budget movie was filmed in full guerrilla style, without permission for any location and without big stars, but it has what many big budget movies do not have, which is an intelligent script and a creative direction. An impressive debut of one of the best directors of today. Good material!
