In Fassbinder's previous films, his ideas sometimes exceeded his ability to execute them. He was always a great writer, but it took him some time to get his camera style and storytelling developed. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Four Seasons is one of the first Fassbinder films to make great use of color. from the bright green pears in the merchant's cart to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder movie? who would have thought). <br /> <br /> His work with the camera was also coming, but it was still quite minimalist. Occasional zooms sometimes seem a bit uncomfortable and unnatural, but, again, Fassbinder was still emerging from his purely avant-garde phase. This could be because Michael Ballhaus is not behind the camera, but slightly lower Dietrich Lohmann. <br /> <br /> However, this is Fassbinder, and you get your solution here. Broken dreams are displayed so vividly and unshakeably as to drive the audience away and lead them into a depressed stupor. Just what the doctor prescribed. An early classic that shows a remarkable progression compared to his first movies released only 2 years earlier.
