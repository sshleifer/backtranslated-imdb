Forget about all those people who tell you that it is not as good as the book. And that? This is a movie after all. It is a real pleasure to see it, made entirely in Cephallonia, with a magnificent picture but also with dark and disturbing moments. The only problem I have is with the obvious mixture of Nicolas Cage as Captain Corelli. Apart from that the movie was a pleasant surprise.
