I think this is one of the five best Burts movies, along with Deliverance, Smokey and the Bandit, Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also directed this, so he also had talent for that, like his friend Clint Eastwood. I'd like him to make more movies like this or even a sequel to Sharkys Machine that Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. This is a tough and rough cops thriller with Reynolds at the top of his game. Having the beautiful Rachel Ward on the fame of Thorn Birds also helped. Henry Silva is the bad guy and he always does a good job in that. The movie is also a great soundtrack too. I highly recommend it, I would like it to be on a DVD in the UK, an audio commentary by Reynolds would also be great. *** 7/10 ***
