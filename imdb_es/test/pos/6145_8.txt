I, like many of the IMDB clients seem to have stumbled upon this little movie when it appeared on the Canadian "Showcase Network". I, like many of you, was also absorbed and watched the whole movie. I was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and the sense of humor with which the film is rich. I was moving comfortably in a kind of "Kevin Smith Meet Killer Films" wave halfway through when the film really folded and explored its subjects in more detail ... with a decidedly darker and poignant edge. Far from having taken me out of the experience, they took me further. This is not the best movie of its kind and, of course, it will not have universal appeal ... so I understand some of the most negative reactions. But I bought in ... and I enjoyed it immensely. The movement "flash back" in the chronology was effective, the characters were well made and the issues raised were human, accessible (according to my experience) and interesting. I was very impressed by the ability of the film to remain sweet, fun and entertaining, without getting away from the controversial issue and the emotional language, the dynamics and the situations. This movie is a great antidote for many of the stupid who have penetrated the witty / intelligent romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect. Remove 2 hours from your busy schedule and jump into Wirey's world ... or you could go renting "You have an email", because if that appeals to you, you will not like this anyway! Those of us who like us will be fine without you on our side ...
