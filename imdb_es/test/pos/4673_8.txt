I find it sad that just because Edward Norton did not want to be in the movie or have anything to do with it, people automatically think that the movie sucks without even seeing it or giving it a chance. I really hope that Norton has not done this. He's a good actor and everyone, but he scared people for a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it entertaining. It was not amazing or anything with crazy special effects, but it was not a bad one. It was fun to watch it. But yes, it's definitely not a bad / horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
