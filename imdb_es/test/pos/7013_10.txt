As for most women, this movie is the best movie for girls. With its hot chemistry, sexy dance rounds and beautiful songs, I mean timeless classics like (I've had) The time of my life and the wonderful She's Like The Wind makes this movie. I adore Patrick Swayze in this film and he shows that he can sing and dance that is very hot. He sings "She's like the wind" in the movie. The chemistry between Swayze and her co-star Jennifer Gray is amazing. I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. But to say this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great, but the scenes of Patrick Swayze do this. I love songs, dancing and everything, but it's not Dirty Dancing. Like I said, it's an amazing girl movie. Let there be a third because I love to see what happens with Patrick's character, Johnny. Jennifer's character could have been sexier, but hey Patrick makes up for it if you know what I mean. Great movie and I am very happy that Billy Zane did not win the role of the movie. I heard whispers that he was destined for the role, but they discovered that he could not dance.
