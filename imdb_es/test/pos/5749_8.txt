I just want to say that the movie was good and moving. The film explains the true meaning of being saved or born again and is very well established. The performance was quite good but it could make some improvements. The story board is catchy and when my church had youth service and we saw it, 8 people gave life to Christ. I would also like to say to anyone who is reading this, to give your life to Christ and repent of your sin.
