Okay, "pretty good" does not scream at me, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Campfire Tales. While it is not a classic, the directors involved have an idea of ​​what suspense is. Fears not only jump towards you, but the directors constantly build in the climatic moments. The film is based on popular urban legends and ghost stories. The writers have updated the stories quite well and twisted them enough so that the family endings still have a big impact. The best of the shorts are "The Honeymoon" and "People Can Lick Too", I enjoyed both since they have a good suspense in each story. "The Locket" was a good ghost story and the wrap around "The Campfire" is also pretty good, except that they give too many twists at the end. The only disappointing segment is "The Hook", which is fine because it's pretty short anyway. In general, I give this a 7 out of 10. It has suspense, which is lacking in most of today's horror films, and good performance by the cast. It may not be up to Halloween and The Exorcist, but it's a good little movie worth the price of a rental.
