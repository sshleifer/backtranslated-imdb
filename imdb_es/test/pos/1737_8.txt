It was in September 2003 when I heard that the BBC would resurrect the WHO DOCTOR and make it "Bigger and better", but before I had heard these rumors in the press and I thought that was all they were: the rumors. But then it was mentioned that Russell T Davies was going to produce and write the program in an executive way and that on a Saturday afternoon, in March of 2004, the news of Channel 4 interviewed the actor in the main role: Christopher Eccleston. Yes, Christopher Eccleston, an actor who has always impressed me since I saw his film debut IN THEY HAVE IT, and if he was interviewed on television, it must have been true. As the months passed, more and more information leaked out, Billie Piper was being chosen, the Daleks would return and The Mill, the Hollywood effects company that had made the effects for GLADIATOR, were hired to make special effects for the Program. For several weeks before the first broadcast trailers announced the return of the new series, advertising posters in London informed the public about the return of the show, the newspapers of the tabloid press published a large number of photos of the extraterrestrials that appeared and Christopher Eccleston appeared in programs as diverse as BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND (which had a special edition of the DOCTOR WHO night), THIS MORNING and Friday NIGHT WITH JOHNATHAN ROSS. In fact, this new series of DOCTOR WHO should have been the most publicized program in the history of British television, it better be very good <br /> <br /> So it was very good? Without a doubt, it has been a great success with almost all the episodes that reach the first ten programs on television lists. To give you a clue to his rating success, only one episode (The Ark In Space, episode two, February 1975) of the previous series hit the five TV charts. The first episode of the series became the number three with two more episodes, either surpassing or equaling the previous record and this is in an era where there is much more competition in terms of TV stations and options. Let's laugh and applaud the fact that the DOC OF THE HIT COMPANY DRINKED ME AGAIN, CELEBRITY WRESTLING and mutilated ANT AND DEC'S Saturday NIGHT TAKEAWAY. Of course, much of the success is due to the impressive visual effects and the casting of a recognized and prestigious actor on paper. For the most part, everything you see on the screen here is equal to everything you'll see in a Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is an invasion force of Dalek that has tens of thousands, exotic aliens, a nineteenth-century Cardiff that looks like a nineteenth-century Cardiff and a nocturnal filming that is actually night-time filming and is not done by sticking a dark filter on the screen. I promise you'll hear a lot more from the directors who worked on this series, Joe Ahearne, especially, one day will be on the Hollywood list. <br /> <br /> There are some flaws in the new DOCTOR WHO series and they all must be put at the door of Russell T Davies. It may be debatable whether the telenovela and the postmodernist elements succeed or not (in my opinion, they are not), but what is not in dispute is that the weaker scripts are written by RTD. As I mentioned in my CASANOVA review, he deceives the public and does the same here: when the armed soldiers confront him, they point him with their weapons. The Doctor screams "plan delta attack", which makes no sense to anyone in the audience, but allows him to escape from a narrow place, a naked Captain Jack suddenly pulls out a laser he has been hiding and the RTD scripts are full of This type of traps and terminations type deus ex machina. In fact, the final episode is greatly affected by the ridiculous concept of what the "bad wolf" is that seems to have taken RTD from a more difficult place than The Doctor. And the endings I'm trying to remember if any of them was really The Doctor? More often than it is a secondary character or the companion of the Doctor who saves the day. The program is called DOCTOR WHO DID NOT RISE, so can we see the title character saving the day, please, as he did in the classic series? A final point about the representation of the Doctor is the way it is written as a smiling muon. Eccleston is best known for his serious and somber roles and is absolutely impressive in the scenes in which he shows pain, like the tear that runs down his face at the End of the World, but most of the time it is written as a "Tom Baker in speed "character. It's obvious why Eccleston has not done much comedy in his career. He is not very good at that. <br /> <br /> Am I starting to sound like I hate this program? Sorry, it was not my intention, but it's just that while some anticipations have been met or exceeded, others have not been, and almost all are due to Russell T Davies, who fortunately contributes less in the scripts in the next series of MEDICAL WHO. Let's look at more traditional stories of a human outpost threatened by monsters like the ones we saw in the 60s and 70s, imagine a story like The Sea Devils with a massive budget led by Joe Ahearne! Oh, and one last request: can we see these "NEXT TIME" trailers thrown away? They reveal all the best fragments of the episode next week.
