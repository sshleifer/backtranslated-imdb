This is a funny movie, there are not many of those. OK, the plot is a bit disturbing, but very original. A teenager who tries to match up with dad, because she has not been around and almost sent him to jail because she lies to impress an older child, how can that not be funny? Also, it's not the typical movie with teenagers. The first remake I've seen is better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor, this would be a perfect 10, because he plays all the rolls in the same way, he sucks. Another problem is that all women melt on him, that is not even remotely credible, it is not attractive! And he had a rubber troll that looked better than him, come on!
