I was 19 years old when I first saw this movie, in the theater. I have a vivid memory of a different ending. Not completely different but significantly. I just watched the movie last night and I was wrong, so I guess the following can not be called a spoiler, since it never happened. The ending I remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked, Frances Austen found it quite easily and, after facing him, dropped to his knees and hit him with the camera. Only his face was in the frame and it was quite obvious that he was letting it happen, though against his will. But none of this appeared in the movie. Sandy Dennis was 32 years old when she made this movie, Michael Burns was 22 years old. In the movie, he complains to his sister that Frances is doing too much sex. Yes? Well, then, go to bed with your friend, and finish with this. WTF?
