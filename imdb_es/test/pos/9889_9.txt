This movie is hilarious, bright and insightful. Although perhaps the story would work well with almost any ethnic group, the inherent Jewish character of the characters gives additional meaning to the generosity of the wonderful dialogue. There were so many social problems covered in the plot that only for that reason would it have been worth seeing them; -but the real treasure was in the warm laugh that spread throughout the grateful audience. The mix of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses play their roles with all the pathos and humor one would expect from Shakespeare's drama that their lives seem to parody. This is a film about the family; - about the often fragile, sometimes invisible union of different personalities and lifestyles, first between brothers and fathers, and inevitably between the largest family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the film a rhythm and a development that keeps the viewer intrigued until the final scene. Peter Falk is amazing, as always, in his role as patriarch of the Morris Applebaum family. The strong performances of a fine cast include a surprise guest. Do not miss this movie!
