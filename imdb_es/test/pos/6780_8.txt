I play this game exactly after watching the trailer on an old magazine advertising CD ... <br /> <br /> It's very interesting and atmospheric dark (missing in today's games / movies). The game takes place somewhere in the mid-'90s in the mysterious spooky mansion. You play as Adam Randell and your quest is to free the soul of your father trapped by death. <br /> <br /> The aspect of the game is similar to that of death, but it is a very different type of game. A lot of action, several puzzles, missions, mazes and many more interesting places and characters are presented in this ancient classic game. <br /> <br /> The game will only run on Windows 98 and there is no patch for Windows XP.
