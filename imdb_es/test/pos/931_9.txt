And there are not many in the history of cinema. "Rouge" seems to be a bit of hope. Hope in humanity and in life. But just say that you can be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that bitter judge and the twenty but wise model. Maybe that old and disappointing love story will not be repeated - there is a new couple with the young judge after the accident. But what about this master of the camera? You can not miss a second of the movie because you have to look at each and every one of those faces. Kieslowski loved human beings and that is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors. Mrs. Jacob and Mr. Tringtignant are perfect. It is not just this movie, but the heartbeat "You will not kill" and "A story about love" what you can think about contemporary cinema as a way of expressing an artist's point of view. Too bad that the American public, the average, could not see these movies. At least they are not in Maltin's dictionary. And even the Baseline does not know what to say about this unique man. abel inns
