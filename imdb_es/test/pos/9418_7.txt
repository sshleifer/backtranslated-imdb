I observed two very different adventures of Holmes this morning, but you would be surprised by the similarities. <br /> <br /> It was probably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (If I were King, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce. and director Roy William Neill. It was not his first adventure in Sherlock Holmes, as they did a couple of years before this. <br /> <br /> The equipment was excellent, but I prefer the Hammer version, which I will talk about later. <Br /> <br /> Holmes relies on many costumes to do his work, and I am constantly amused by the gestures that are shown when they discover something. It seems that they always throw themselves when they find a new clue. <br /> <br /> The story itself about how to maintain a bomb site for the Germans in World War II was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery.
