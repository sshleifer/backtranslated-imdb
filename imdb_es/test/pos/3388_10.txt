This is a great movie, the 3 were. The last one was not as good as the first 2, but it was made over time and I was pulling straws. But you want to see it because it says the end of the story. Just not how we might think it should end. <br /> <br /> These films made me want to be there to be in all the difficulties, the love, the tears and the laughter that the people in this movie throws. It is one of the few movies that is good every time you watch it, no matter how many times it is. <br /> <br /> There are some parts in the movie that little children do not understand and the older ones can not be. old enough to see. But it's a great movie, spanning more than 20 years.
