I think this short TV series was absolutely wonderful, and gave a detailed and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at any given time. This was, by far, David Attenborough at his best. Personally I thought that this was one of the best documentaries in the last decade. Definitely worth the people's money! <br /> <br /> I also found that the most fascinating and interesting part of the abyss and the deep waters. It was incredible to discover that the 'Blue Planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life! <br /> <br /> In this documentary, Attemborough almost certainly lived up to its high reputation. <br /> <br /> This was a masterpiece and will always be considered one of the best modern documentaries. <br /> <br /> Many congratulations to the 'Blue Planet' team.
