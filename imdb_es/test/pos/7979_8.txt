For a long time, this was my favorite of the Batman movies. He had the best photography and an avant-garde touch with two wild characters, Catwomen and The Penguin, along with the always interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last viewing, it finally slipped into my ratings and, frankly, I now prefer the last Batman: Batman Begins, with Christian Bale. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD: however, this is the most intriguing of all. The five Batman movies of the last days. The elegant picture here is the best of any of the Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films that present stunning images, as this is a great example. The three characters mentioned above are very different and very interesting, almost fascinating. Of the villains, he preferred Catwomen, because he saw her more fun before and after she changed. Violence is not exaggerated here as it was in several of Batman's other stories, but one never gets bored seeing this. As he did in the first movie, Michael Keaton does a good job playing Batman / Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> THE BAD: for a movie based on a comic strip that most children read, I still believe that these first two Batman movies, both made by Burton, were too dark and desecration definitely It was not appropriate. Although, unlike the first movie, the name of the Lord was not used here in vain, blasphemies still existed and both villains made too many sexual comments. That would have been fine if they had not commercialized this film for children and adults. The "penguin" of Danny DeVito is downright rude in points. "Grotesque" I can drive, but who wants "disgusting". Few, meanwhile, complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer playing Catwoman. In general, too much darkness and some cheap shots in the attack on Christian also made me reconsider my previous high rating of this movie. <br /> <br /> GENERAL - Fabulous images and memorable characters make this the most interesting one in the Batman series, but with too dark a border, too coarse and too anti-religious bias, it finally turned me off after half Dozen looks in this movie. I'm sorry, but I prefer a friendlier Batman movie. After all, it's just a caricature. Most will not agree, but I was glad to see that the series lights up after this one.
