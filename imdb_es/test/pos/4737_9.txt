Waco: Rules of Engagement does a very good job of not drawing conclusions for its viewers. It simply presents interviews, images of the confrontation, images of the Congress hearings, telephone conversations, testimonies of experts, etc. and allows you to draw your own conclusion. <br /> <br /> I do not pretend to imply that the data presented here was done with 100% objectivity but it is very convincing. He will not like Koresh more after seeing this than before, but I tend to think that he will come to believe, as I do now, there are many things that they did not tell us about what happened before and during the confrontation. .
