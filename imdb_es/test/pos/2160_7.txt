Night Hunter begins in '1968' when a young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) unexpectedly receives the family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when a vampire hunting partner Sid O'Mack (Sid Haim) betrays his family and delivers them to the vampires. , to help Jack in his search, he is given a book that contains the names of all vampires alive or dead, no matter how you look at it ... Jump to 'June 1995' and Los Angeles, where he now adult Cutter (Don 'The A Dragon' Wilson, also credited like coproducer, only it has four names in the book, among them, Argento (Vince Murdocco) and Carmella (Sophia Crawford), together, are the last of the American vampires. While everyone dines in a restaurant, Cutter breaks the party and kills them, is it well done? Bad as the King of Vampires Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest) calls the last four Vampires around the world, the French Tournier (Maria Ford ), the Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmer (David 'Shark Fralick) and Sangster (Vincent Klyn) to track down Cutter and kill him.Meanwhile, Detective Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no idea and an intrusive reporter named Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith) gets involved in the battle between Cutter and The Vampire, on which lies the fate of the Earth! br /> <br /> Directed by Rick Jacobson, I thought that Night Hunter was a fun way to spend 85 odd minutes. The script by William C. Martell mixes martial arts and horror with a considerable degree of success, progresses at a good pace and, at least, is never boring and, fortunately, does not seem to take itself too seriously. However, the names of characters that make reference to other directors / actors of horror films are a bit crappy. Some may be surprised at how similar it looks to Night Hunter to Blade (1998), and yet, it was a couple of years ago, the grumpy loner wearing a vampire hunter who is an expert in martial arts, the scene set in a nightclub and the innocent Woman drawn in the world of vampires. Night Hunter does not really adhere to the traditional law of vampire movies, for example, sunlight only irritates your eyes, can only reproduce in a solar eclipse (why?), Stakes through the heart and garlic do not It's a good way to kill a vampire. In Night Hunter is breaking his neck. I could have done it with a little more horror and a little more blood, as it leans more towards the side of martial arts. The dialogue is suitably cheesy and the characters are quite nice in a silly way. <br /> <br /> Director Jacobson does his best to ruin the movie, the action scenes are fine, but they lack something and are strange. Whenever an action sequence occurs, shake your camera constantly, it's as if the camera were placed in a full cycle washer! Hey Rick, buddy, he's not smart or smart, he's annoying and annoying. The gore is disappointing with a few bullet wounds and a bit of blood, breaking Vampire's neck does not involve much blood, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> With a budget that probably is not much Night Hunter. done competently in everything. The acting was bad most of the time and what about the 'The Dragon' thing in the name of Don 'The Dragon' Wilson? Have you changed your name legally? Do you sign checks for 'The Dragon' Wilson? Do you receive the email addressed to him in that name? I think I could do something like this, from now on I want to be known as Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews ... <br /> <br /> Night Hunter is one of those bad movies that transcends its limitations and its horror. to become pure golden entertainment. If you like funny movies, then Night Hunter could be for you, if you are looking for big budget emotions in a similar vein (Vampire, veins and blood?) Then Blade and its sequels are probably a better option. What the hell, I liked it so they sue me.
