Recently I was lucky enough to see Ingrid Bergman's name attached to a movie I had never seen (not even heard) at AMC. What a stroke of luck. <br /> <br /> Marveling at your impeccable and perfect performance is not the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie. The writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent. <br /> <br /> Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was almost perfect and Goldie Hawn (surprisingly) was fabulous. Tender sometimes, demanding, then simply ridiculous. There are moments in the film that even the most hardened movie viewer will be trapped in history and forget that it is a movie. <br /> <br /> That Bergman can steal a dance scene from a crowd of 20 years. It was amazing to see the old ones. She is effortless in her return to the screen (at age 54). The cast was great and the lines ... the lines are exquisite. <br /> <br /> One of the 5 best romantic comedies of all time.
