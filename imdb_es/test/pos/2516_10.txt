Good action, yes, the premise is already done, but not in this way, that's the trick. Hello people: SHOCK: it's an X file. <br /> <br /> For me, it's great that Scully / Mulder have almost no scenes together. They have to adapt, they trust in the intrinsic sense of others about what is really happening. in - and the adaptation skills of each one. They read the movements of others and do the work ... (more or less). <br /> <br /> Oh yes, very good performance: are these people paid to do this? Or, a slow day when the convenience store does not call them to work. (hey - Duchovny - where are the donuts of a day? Malcolm - go to school ...)
