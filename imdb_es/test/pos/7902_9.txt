This is not your typical Indian movie. There is a great sense of humanity, and the characters are quite realistic. There is a great dynamism in interpersonal relationships, and there is a feeling of guilt, grief, passion, passivity among the many characters. Seeing this, one feels the heavy burden of the 5000 years of layers and layers of the history of the social existence of one of the oldest civilizations. The final scene of an elephant that was moving away in the rural area was a great footnote of such an ancient civilization, and even then, human relationships are still preserved and nourished. I saw it on DVD, the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting. I was surprised to learn that the film did not do well (or was not shown) in India (... but maybe not very surprised). The artistic heritage of rural societies is slowly being lost and their heritage is not recovered by younger generations, as some of the older musicians in the film no longer live today. Great movie.
