After 2 years of using this site for movie reviews, I finally registered with IMDB just to be able to give Farscape a "10". The writers, cast and crew of the series have proven to be the unmistakable masters of the science fiction genre. Even those who do not usually appreciate science fiction should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a try! <br /> <br /> The virtues of Farscape are simply too numerous to list, but one of them stands out above all; The quality of the writing is incredible. I have not heard such a good dialogue since "Blake's 7." In fact, Farscape looks a lot like a "Blake's 7" with good special effects and a little more romance. <br /> <br /> Everyone, enjoy!
