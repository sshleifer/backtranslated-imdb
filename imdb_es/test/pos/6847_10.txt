I thought the Judas Kiss movie was excellent. Carla Gugino's performance was extraordinary, probably the best in her career. His facial expressions in many scenes, were incredibly faithful to the character, and were exploited to the fullest by Director Guti√©rrez. All the actors and actresses were very good in their performances. Emma Thompsom was, as always, wonderful. His acting abilities are far above what would be required for this character, so he actually improves it in the movie. <br /> <br /> The story, although sometimes too intricate, remains entertaining and points towards the end. Very very good. A movie that should not be missed. A story well woven and brilliantly directed. Film quality, excellent.
