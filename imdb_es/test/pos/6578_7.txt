Paha maa is another Finnish film. But the things that make it different are copied abroad. Some storytelling techniques are from Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. The scenes are shot from different angles again. Paha maa is a good movie, but it is not as good as the hype says: "Realistic film, without a happy ending and without commercial admissions". Some actors did a great job. Sulevi Peltola was as good as a peddler of vacuum cleaners. Also Jasper Pääkkönen shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so lame. He is a very overrated actor, he is handsome and a good guy, but he is not the best actor in Finland. But if you like Finnish movies, it's worth seeing Paha maa.
