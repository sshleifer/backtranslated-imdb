First of all, I would like to say that before seeing this film I considered myself a person who accepts. Someone who cared for others, appreciated others, did not find / almost no judgment against other people, and this movie (I think) has changed my life or my point of view dramatically. When I saw it, I did not particularly know what it was about, I knew it was some kind of forbidden relationship, but other than that I had no idea, and when I started to see what was going on between these two beautifully described Characters, I was in shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. The first time I saw him, he was blind. Blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their connection, to their purity as human beings, to their relationship. I saw it a second time, because I finally realized how hypocritical I was being, telling myself and others, "Oh, I accept all kinds of people, and I try not to judge them" as I continue to judge this story wonderfully and incredibly perceptive. Because of my fear, I suppose. The second time I saw this movie, I opened those eyes of mine that had been closed the first time, and I really looked, not at the kind of part of the taboo relationship that I had heard all my life, but simply at two human beings. in love. And I loved it, I loved the story, I loved the individual people slightly broken but strong in the film, I loved sharing feelings, and I loved the strong bonds created. It's a very revealing and beautifully made movie that made me cry sometimes, and I hope that people who read this and go see the movie eventually, remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what form or how it is presented. ....
