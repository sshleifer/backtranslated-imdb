Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this amazingly personal story of a married woman's flight with respect to her husband, and the reality that perhaps the youthful joy and excitement of her youthful years are behind her. We learn little about this woman's marriage, except that she has been feeling that her independence is fading lately; she also recently learned that she is pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she does not want to be a complacent woman, in spite of the maternal way in which she talks to her husband by phone). He meets two men on his journey: a former college football hero who, after an accident during a game, has suffered permanent brain damage, and a sexy and strutting motorcycle cop who has many problems in his own life. Clear and clean landscapes (photographed by the talented Wilmer Butler) are performed in a clever way, just like the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan and Robert Duvall deliver a strong and exciting performance, especially because these are not very nice people in conventional terms. Some scenes (like Knight's first call home from a pay phone, or his first night alone with Caan, where they play 'Simon Says') are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola plays with reality, turning the irregular memories of his characters into scrapbooks that we have had in secret. He allows the scenes to be reproduced, however, the editing is quite agile and the film is never allowed to be too heavy (there are at least two or three very playful moments). It is a risky endeavor, so much so that the image was still shown at festivals almost five years later. Some can avoid Coppola's unrepentant twisting of events to underscore the ending with a bitter irony, yet the forcefulness and unity behind the image almost erase its flaws. *** since ****
