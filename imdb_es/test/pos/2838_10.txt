After a summer full of retreats and disappointments, Nurse Betty breathes fresh air. The movie is like no other I've seen. Director Neil LaBute shows that he can direct more than the disturbing images of men and women and the way they approach sex (his two previous films were the brilliant In The Company of Men and the almost brilliant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger offers the best interpretation of her career as Betty, a waitress who, witnessing the brutal death of her imbecile husband (the pillar of LaBute, Aaron Eckhart), gets lost in a fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the killers who killed her husband and are now at their trial. The trick of the movie is that Freeman and Zellweger are really parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and educated Dr. Dave Ravell in a soap opera, Freeman idealizes Betty. Nurse Betty is a brilliant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My rating: 10/10.
