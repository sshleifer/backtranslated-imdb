This movie is not the most terrifying of all times, but it is a great example of a horror movie of the eighties: low budget, no stars, many inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep teens in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil children play their role well. A good starting point for "Just Say" Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career. This movie will not be seen by many, but for fans of the horror of the 80s is a must.
