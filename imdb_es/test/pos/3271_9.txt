"Two Hands" is a good addition to the Australian film catalog. <br /> <br /> It's that curious combination of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love that Australians have developed for themselves. <Br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is basically a good guy if he is naive. Wanting to keep going, he falls with a "Big" local Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the precise moment he sets a first finger on the dark road to crime, he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error of changing your life in an unexpected way. After accidentally getting on the wrong side of Pando, things get really bad and very fast, and if it were not for a little help from another world, this would have been a short and sad film. Yes, Jimmy learns some lessons in life and nobody escapes unharmed one way or another, but in the end it feels good. Although there is a lawless issue throughout history, it is not glorified and it helps to show how destructive crime can be in normal life. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is excellent as Jimmy, innocent and expert at the same time, Rose is hypnotic since Alex and Bryan are wonderful as always. This is a small set of characters that are credible and I found myself worrying about the good guys and disliking the bad guys. <br /> <br /> This DVD is usually in the cheap lobby, so I would recommend adding it too to your DVD collection would be money well spent. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
