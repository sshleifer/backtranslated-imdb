All I can say is that I really miss this show! My wife and I just got married at the time this show started. Why did CBS take it out of the air? I think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy !! He made me laugh!! It also made me cry. But when CBS took it off the air, my wife and I thought CBS made a big mistake. Do you know what would be so cool? Have a reunion show !! That would be great! Does anyone know if it is already on DVD? In the last season of Promised Land, did CBS show all of last season? I think CBS got him off the air mid-season. My wife and I will never forget it. The opening with that song was fantastic! This show only comes once in a lifetime! May we never forget the Promised Land!
