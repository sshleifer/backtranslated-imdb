A very intelligent and exciting thriller that is not based on action but in the situation, which is very rare these days. I would compare this movie with El dia del jackal, another film about the search for a dangerous international criminal. The performance in all areas is superlative: Aidan Quinn has a difficult double role as the vicious terrorist Carlos and as the man of the Navy who personifies it. Donald Sutherland plays the amoral agent of the CIA who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli official who attends the plan. This is a very tense and effective film, and it is remarkable considering the little action that there is in it. The first half of the film is ready, while the Navy man prepares to pose as Carlos. The second half is a breathless action, the action that arises from the characters and their situations, making it even more exciting. A really tight movie that should not be overlooked.
