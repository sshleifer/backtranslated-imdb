It was a long time ago (1960), but I have never forgotten this series and many times I have wanted it to reappear. Taken this way, I corresponded with Mr. Rathbun, then president of Standard Oil, who sponsored the presentation on PBS. He sent me a picture of the tapestry (actually, a reproduction of coal) that is used behind the credits. <br /> <br /> For Bayco's "Elizabethan Masque" opening theme music, my family and I gathered around our black and white television to take into account the words of Shakespeare as pronounced by group of excellent but relatively unknown players (at least for the American audiences of the time). <br /> <br /> We were introduced to actors like Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have continued to enjoy his achievements since then. One of the most interesting things was the way the actors continued to age in their respective roles, since Shakespeare's "King" plays were presented, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell those actors how much that series meant to me. <br /> <br /> If "Age of Kings" could be revived on VHS and / or DVD, it would please all of us who yearn to see it again. and those who missed it the first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS! PBS has just released a DVD of "ONE AGE OF THE KINGS"! SEE YOUR CATALOG OF JULY 2009, PAGE 19, OR CALL IT FREE OF CHARGE. I just ordered MINA!
