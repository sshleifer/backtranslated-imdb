IN AGREEMENT. Is Barney the best children's show of all time? Of course, no. But in some of the comments left by other IMDb members, one would think that it was a multimillion dollar production with high class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. Well guess what? It's Barney for the love of God. It shows children good behavior, good mansions and that it is good to be who you are. For those of you who find it annoying, it's because they are not five years old and the program was not for you. For the IMDb member who wrote the review on the first page, I think it may have gone too far. Did you really describe a Sesame Street character as "down to Earth"? They all grow, this is a great show for preschool children and, in fact, it helps children to learn in a fun and creative way.
