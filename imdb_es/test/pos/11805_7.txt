The story of a child, Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) with AIDS, who befriends a tough guy (played by Brad Renfro), his exact opposite, The Cure is sad, although a little too soapy, pulls his emotions "message "movie With your heart in the right place. Just for that fact, it's a recommended view. The highlight could be simply seeing them find a friendship and spend time together when no one else accepts them. <br /> <br /> However, since the true story centers on the child's AIDS, things take off when one day at the local supermarket, Dexter draws the attention of a tabloid magazine that claims that a doctor from New Orleans discovered the cure. Both, obviously a little naive, make it a plan to leave for New Orleans as soon as possible. What a little attracted me in two ways. I really like the heart and I do not like anything, but I found that the plot wanders in a melodramatic and predictable way, and the procedures have a layer of brilliance on them as only the movies can do. I could not escape the idea of ​​throwing away that I was watching a road trip movie about self-discovery, disease and growth. For example, I know they are young, but I think it's a real task to believe in the things these guys do. Like boiling tree leaves and drinking the hot "tea" or eating an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they believe you will fight the devastating disease. To say nothing of them making a trip across the country, as they do without legal repercussions or frankly terrifying. Leaving aside the doubts, the cinematographic conventions that you expect, it is a story that is worth seeing, particularly with the family.
