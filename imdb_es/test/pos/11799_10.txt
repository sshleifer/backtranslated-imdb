Very happy to have HBO at this time. I did not plan to watch a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was this one, I decided (according to the description) to give at least one chance. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie caught me in a vulnerable moment (I'm a little stressed, I have a huge test for which I'm studying), but it definitely gave me the perspective of friendship, not to mention that it taught me a valuable lesson about empathy. I'm a year away from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and nurse was definitely a learning point for me! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I just wanted to publish for the world to know This is an amazing movie and it can not be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!
