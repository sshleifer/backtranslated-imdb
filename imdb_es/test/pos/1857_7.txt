Last year was the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species," so it is fitting that Jon Amiel's "Creation" has been published. The film focuses on the period of Darwin's life (Paul Bettany) while writing his famous work, and the slight tension he placed on his family life. <br /> <br /> I guess the movie overcame Darwin's tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt for his late daughter Annie, but I still like the idea that Darwin's theory works like a blow of karate in a religious dogma. As it was, EE. UU It was one of the last countries in which "Creation" found a distributor, due to the debate on creationism and evolution (yes, it is still underway). <br /> <br /> In short, this is not a masterpiece, but I recommend it in the same way I recommend "Inherit the wind". I hope that one day, the creationism-evolution debate will not be a problem. If this movie helps calm the debate, then more power for everyone in the movie! Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
