"A minute to pray, a second to die" is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting story. It was filmed to perfection, with a relatively high production value for a film of this genre. <br /> <br /> Alex Cord does an excellent job of portraying Clay McCord, an outlaw who suffers from increasingly debilitating attacks. He is looking for an amnesty before his enemies approach him, but he is being too arrogant for his own good when he asks for it. Robert Ryan offers the best performance in the film as the governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also great here. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good, but it does not stand out as one of the best spaghetti westerns in the world. He lacks too much style to be in the same league as any of the greats. It has some great nuances of spaghetti, but in general it's a bit like an American western. This is especially evident in music, which is fine since movies are generally, but quite boring by Euro-Western standards. The soundtrack reminds me of the music of "The Unforgiven". Although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a way that is a bit too conventional for my taste. If a spaghetti western fan and a Hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together, this would be the perfect compromise. <br /> <br /> All this does not mean that nobody should avoid this movie. I enjoyed watching it. Like I said, it's a very well made movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes western, spaghetti or anything else.
