I thought that this movie was great, if you did not take it very seriously. Just sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all her greatness and laugh when the monks go to Boston, MA. I also believe that this film has a great message about self-control and inner strength. Also, Mr. Myagi was so sweet, I wish he would teach me karate!
