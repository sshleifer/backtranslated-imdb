The musical version of 1973 of LOST HORIZON is the most captivating and attractive musical film of EVERY TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about the mythical SHANGRI-LA! It is a true special jewel. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of direct drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY musical fantasy against war ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This movie was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but it made a lot of money abroad. Only in America did he fail. Highly different and unique in its approach as a musical film, it deserves much more credit than it is given. As a story, LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure, and both the 1937 Frank Capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the James Hilton novel. What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which musical numbers are presented. The film has a prestigious cast and a talented director and director of photography. This is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it is a wonderful place. Songs like THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE, SHARING JOY AND LIVING TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER evoke a happiness that Hilton wrote in her novel. Why should not Shangri-La be a bit ridiculous? The two love songs, I CAN FRIGHTEN HERY AWY and the eliminated I COME TO YOU are the sensitive points of the image. There is a peace and a soft voice quality in both songs that is very much in accordance with the philosophy of the story. Also, THE THINGS I NOT MISS is a good duo with a strong melody. It's a good exchange of different types of perspective and who can criticize Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman stomping, singing and dancing at the tables? They are a wonderful team and the number is well prepared. <br /> <br /> It has always seemed interesting to me in this story how the High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a kind but radical soul in his vision of humanity as a whole. He has no hope for the world outside Shangri-La. If this movie were to be remade today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis placed on the main character, RICHARD ONWAY's conflict with what he left in the outside world instead of what he found in Shangri-La. <br /> <br /> Of course, for the film to be credible, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as an amnesia suffered at the end, as it was in the book. None of the movie versions of LOST HORIZON was true to the novel in that sense. Conway found Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did everyone die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of ​​what his Shangri-La would be like. The conflict with Conway who wants to believe in Shangri-La and return to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy in the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van when they see their friends leave the mystic valley. It's interesting how Conway does not want to leave paradise, but his brother is pushing him. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in exploring James Hilton's ideas about a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So, in a certain sense, it is anti capitalism in its subject where money and materialism are not the motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living in harmony among them is the rule. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. He tries to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly criticize him for not succeeding. It must be remembered that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for the characters to explode into a song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics. The expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. There were two goals to hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH, and critics came out for both. Ross Hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow-up film in his hit 1970 film AIRPORT That movie was the biggest source of money for the universals until then and the success of that film sparked a decade of disaster movies. For years, AIRPORT was the most watched movie on television. He was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. At that time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful composers in the country. The shameless sentimentality of LOST HORIZON had almost no chance after the collapse of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence were a new frontier in the late 60s and early 70s. Audiences flocked to content films they were not used to seeing on the screen. The luxurious musicals were no longer welcome, no matter how well they were done. Today you can enjoy and appreciate the LOST HORIZON on several levels. It's the ultimate escapist movie with a strong story, wonderful music, a costly budget and a little quirky humor. It is unconventional in the sense that music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the movie. Change course halfway when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves to be rediscovered. A lost and legendary treasure that deserves much better than its reputation.
