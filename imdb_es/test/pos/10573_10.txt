This movie was incredible !!!! I did not know the background story, so I had to let it develop on a DVD. It had many twists and turns, but still kept the story fresh and exciting. The performance of Elaine Cassidy was in one brilliant word, as was Sally Hawkins. History is rich in plausible occurrences, as well as new ideas of the present. <br /> <br /> There is really something in Mrs. Cassidy's eyes that leaves "a mark". This film is a refreshing look at the way we see "Victorian times" and how we see that society. A very valuable watch.
