Wolfgang Peterson directs this suspense film in which Clint Eastwood plays Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, who combines intelligence with a smart psychopath (John Malkovich) in a cat-and-mouse game that involves the protection of the President. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) keeps in touch with Horrigan taunting the agent with discouraging comments about his abilities, as well as the protection that the Secret Service has provided to presidents in the past. Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) tries to keep Horrigan on the ground; but he is very strong to prevent Leary from carrying out his murder threats. Very good effects and fast pace sustains the plot. Eastwood and Malkovich are excellent. Russo has a way to get your attention. Rounding out this strong cast are: Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
