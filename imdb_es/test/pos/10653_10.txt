The movie touches the soul of the audience, some scenes of the film are final and the tears come out automatically. I am surprised to see that this film makes any director able to direct this type of film in 1925. As a film student, I can say that this film helps a lot to understand the use of montage. The first time our teacher told us about this movie means that the genre of this movie we thought there would be nothing to understand in this movie, but finally, when the Lord explained it to me, we arrived. To know how good this movie is. Finally, I can say that it helps a lot to understand the movies. And as a film student, viewers can watch this movie.
