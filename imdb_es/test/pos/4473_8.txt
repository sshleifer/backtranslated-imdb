A film about the relationship between a man and a leopard reminiscent of "The English Patient", even in a scene similar to when the character of Ralph Fiennes takes the body of his lover through a cliff of desert rock. In "A Passion in the Desert", the main character takes the body of the leopard through a cliff of desert rock but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very brief history of Balzac, the film is not perfect, but it is not a delight. The final shot will chase me for weeks. (8 out of 10)
