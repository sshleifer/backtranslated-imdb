"The Beguiled" is a strange work among the work of Clint Eastwood. In 1971 he had become famous as the star of action movies, not only Westerns (the genre with which he made a name for the first time) but also war movies (such as "Where Eagles Dare") and suspense police ( like Coogan's Bluff.) However, although "The Beguiled" takes place during the war (the American Civil War), and was created by Don Siegel, who had previously directed Eastwood in "Bluff de Coogan" and later the same year To direct him in "Dirty Harry," it's not an action movie in the traditional sense.In most of his previous films, Eastwood played an active role, but here his role is largely passive: his character, Sergeant John McBurney is a wounded fugitive who is forced to rely on women's charity to survive.Even while serving with his unit, McBurney did not play an active role in the conflict, he is a Quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to carry weapons, Y He was serving with the Union forces as an orderly doctor. <br /> <br /> The film is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and begins when McBurney is wounded and discovered by a young woman named Amy and returned to her boarding school. The school is small, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are fervent supporters of the Confederate cause and want to hand it over to the authorities, the director, Martha Farnsworth, decides to house him and take care of him, fearing that his injuries could be fatal if they are sent to one of the notoriously hard prison camps. of the Confederation. <br /> <br /> Although McBurney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion regarding pacifism, he is not so scrupulous in following his teachings on the sin of fornication, and when he begins to recover, he makes the most of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls, and he wins the affection of many of them, including Miss Farnsworth, his assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the older girls. Even the twelve-year-old girl, Amy, seems to have a kind of childhood crush on him. In the sexually repressed environment of the women's school, their presence arouses jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, rejected in favor of the vixen Carol, plans a terrible revenge. (Interestingly, the only woman who resists the spells of McBurney is Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, although she tries to win her round by pointing out that she is fighting to free people like her.) <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" has been described as an anti-war movie, but this seems like a false idea to me. The film is not really about the rights and injustices of the Civil War or war in general. The only acts of violence that we see are perpetrated by non-combatants, and are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not by zeal for the Confederate cause. It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological tensions that can be caused by the particular circumstances of the war. <br /> <br /> At first, the school, located in a beautiful old mansion before the war, looks like an island of peace in the middle of the war. The building is of classical style, associated with order, harmony and moderation, but the history that develops within its walls is one of disorder, passion and violence, qualities associated with the school of Gothic writing that in the nineteenth century it was often considered the antithesis of classicism. It can be seen that the film falls within what has been called the "southern gothic" tradition in American cinema and literature. <br /> <br /> The movie was not a big success at the box office, possibly because Eastwood was thrown against the guy. It may not be his best movie, but he showed that he could expand his range and play more than action heroes. (In "Play Misty for Me", his first film as a director was filmed the following year, again he played a "passive" character in danger of a vengeful woman). There are some very good performances by female cast members, particularly Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth, a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman with strong passions. (There are indications that she may have had an affair with a man she posed as her brother). There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman such as the shy and repressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of ​​revenge and the young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy. (Amy is an animal lover, a key moment in the film occurs when McBurney kills her pet turtle, so it's interesting that in later life Ferdin became an animal rights activist). The only character that I liked least was Carol by Jo Ann Harris, who seemed too modern, like a girl from the seventies who was transported in time until the 1860s. The film is notable for the emotionally intense atmosphere of " greenhouse "that Siegel offers. This will not be a movie that everyone likes; some will find it too altered and melodramatic, and others will consider it misogynistic. (Judith Crist called it a movie for "women who hate and sadists"). Others, however, may find a compelling psychological drama. 7/10
