With "Batman Returns", Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: to give a sequel to a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful movie of the year, "Batman" (1989), here again the hero of Gotham City arrives for the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor, "Batman Returns" had enormous commercial success. Tim Burton made Batman come back once more because it is to believe that Batman's victory over his enemy, the Joker, did little to improve the image of Gotham City. In fact, violence and corruption still exist and here, the second word is personified by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two thieves who are eager to take control of Gotham City are going to make Batman's life more difficult. His task will be more difficult with the appearance of Catwoman ... <br /> <br /> Tim Burton still worked a lot on stage and it seems that he tried to correct the flaws of the first film. It means that the director gave way to the fight sequences that are better mastered than in the first Batman. But he did not neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that. If in the 1989 film, Burton had focused on the psychology of Bruce Wayne / Batman, here is the penguin that obviously interested him. The director tried to make him, very well acted by De Vito an ambiguous character. On the one hand, it is full of bad intentions (previously mentioned), but on the other hand, it is looking for its past and would like to be considered as a real man. <br /> <br /> "Batman Returns" also appears as Crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. I think of Mich√®le Pfeiffer, who offers a bold and powerful acting as Catwoman. Also, at the time I write this review, it reminds me that there is a new version of Catwoman currently in the movies. But given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 in IMDb!), It is certain that your interpreter Halle Berry must become insignificant with Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie is one of the best sequels of 1992. And it allows you to develop the unique style of Tim Burton. We also find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. As for the other Batman adaptations for the screen, you can skip them. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are not good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was filming the beginning of the Batman story and that it will be released next year. Will it coincide with the works of Tim Burton?
