This version did not move me as much as the later version of Hollywood, starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While it was beautifully filmed and performed excellently, the BBC version was more filled with dialogues that provided information that I found fascinating. He gave me a detailed view of the intellectual, theological and moral considerations that motivated C. S. Lewis. Therefore, it was more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version, but not as visually impressive as viscerally. However, although I did not leave a lot of Kleenex soaked in the theater, I did use it, and at frequent intervals. I enjoyed both this movie and the Hollywood version, and I appreciated the greater understanding I got.
