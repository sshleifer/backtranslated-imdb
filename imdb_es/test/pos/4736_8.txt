The movie that someone had to do. <br /> <br /> Waco: The Rules of Engagement dissect the evidence behind the confrontation in Waco, Texas, which led to the destruction of the Davidian Branch farm and the alleged government cover-up. <br /> <br /> The first thing you should know about this movie: you will see short but disturbing photos of the bodies of the victims. This is not done by impact, but to illustrate points about how they died, as if you were present in the forensic investigation. <br /> <br /> The second thing you should know about this movie: at two o'clock. The quarter of an hour is quite heavy, especially if you already followed closely the events at that moment. If you are not aware of any of the events that were not reported in the media, or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report, this may be an essential observation. If, on the other hand, you want a more concise version (albeit without apology on one side) of the events, you should see "Waco: The Big Lie". <br /> <br /> In summary, this is practically the definitive documentary. about this tragic event, and it is very instructive, but as a film creation job, you could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. And sometimes it's superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearings and the 60-minute reports. <br /> <br /> Maybe someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the strangest aspects of this story, such as the strange chain of events that led to the ATF raid or the psychological warfare tactics, the FBI he used explosive rock music in the sect, and his charismatic leaders (all the rock musicians themselves) picked up their instruments and turned on their massive amplifiers to play their own music back to them.
