This movie was very good, not great but very good. It is based on a one-man work by Ruben Santiago Hudson ... Yes, he played most of the parts. On paper it looks like a trick. Yes, we're going to gather all the blacks in Hollywood and put them in a movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I did not see was Oprah's, thank God because it would probably end up being like a Hallmark movie. On the other hand, this movie was not a sentimental disaster. It was moving but not false, the characters came and went with the exception of her husband, Pauline and the writer in question. The film revolved around Nanny's universe, Mrs. Bill Crosby and how she educated the writer and captured people. Now that I am a tired New Yorker when she said that she had admitted sick and elderly people and then we see that they go to a mental institution to pick up a man, I think it seems that her sister has a Medicare scam. Getting jobs for people and taking medicare / caid checks. But no, she explains to Lou Gosset that she only wants $ 25 a week and did not want the money too soon. I think that part was included in the movie just for us, the tired New Yorkers, so we know that he is not cheating the poor. (G) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal (g). It almost looks angelic. And looking through the eyes of small children I can see why. She is married to someone who does not do well, who is 17 years younger and cheats on her. Terrence Howard was born to play this type of parts. It was good, but I would like to see it play something different. Markerson who plays Nanny is also very good. But for some reason, the person who stood out for me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright. Where is this man Oscar? He has already won an Emmy and a Tony. He was in Shaft and he stole the movie. I did not even know who he was in this movie. It is a chameleon never the same. I never saw him play a bad role yet. This was a 5 minute role and it made me laugh and cry. I went around the scene again and again ... once because I did not know who it was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I've seen it in papers before things mostly mousy. But she is so good here. Actually, I know people who act like her. So it was very real to me, Macy Gray, who had one of the biggest parts, was also very good. I was very happy that Nanny was not killed. I thought I was a goner at the beginning of the movie. BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine of caring for people. There are women like that in most of our lives. People with whom we could meet or even live together. Thank God for them, I do not know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who lost 2 children and went through many things, but every time I feel selfishly sorry for myself I call her and she always puts me in a good mood. This movie is a tribute to all those people. I just wish they would tell us what happened to some of the characters like the armed man, the boyfriend Paulines who is played by one of my favorite actors in The Wire of HBO, Omar, the character of Rosie Perez and Richard the lesbian and Delroy Cute. The man on the arm, was fascinating in another small paper.
