Seeing this movie, or rather a set of films, in my early teenage years irrevocably changed my idea of ​​the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience. This monumental exploration of individuals, and their historical environment, reveals how intense and intense each human existence is. People are portrayed as themselves: their experiences, from the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena, are detailed with the most important art and perception. Edgar Reitz shows a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and longings. <br /> <br /> When these phenomena face the immense time allowed by the duration of work, you can not help but apprehend the strength and vivacity of happiness, defeat. , lust, love, sadness, melancholy, that each person feels. When I saw these films, I perceived my future experiences, how my life would twist and oscillate inevitably due to intentional and accidental events. I acquired a feeling of longevity of being and what it meant to reflect past lives, memories and contexts. A masterpiece and a revelation. I just want the BBC to review it again. <br /> <br /> If someone knows where I can get a copy, can they contact me?
