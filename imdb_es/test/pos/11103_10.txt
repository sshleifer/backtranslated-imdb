There is something about the real stories that makes them much more interesting than fiction. I guess it's the fact that the truth has always been stranger than fiction. The Falcon and the Snowman tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a former alter- native and intellectual who tries to find an occupation that can support and entertain him. His FBI father is able to move some strings and get his idealistic son to work in the defense department. Boyce has few responsibilities and seems to be complacent drinking and doing nonsense with his co-workers. However, as time passes, Boyce begins to learn secret information that makes him doubt the morality of his government. The idealist Boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the CIA is carrying out in all places, Australia. Boyce finally decides that he will filter some of the secret information that he is aware of, to the KGB. Of course, Boyce's error is the assumption that, like EE. UU He is doing bad things, the USSR is the good man. Eventually, Boyce and his friend Lee (Penn), drug dealers, begin selling their secret information to the KGB. What was once idealism becomes capitalism and espionage. The strength of this film are the incredible performances of Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best intentions, they will soon find themselves in an endless downward spiral. Great direction, music, everything. Not just a great movie, but one of my favorites of all time.
