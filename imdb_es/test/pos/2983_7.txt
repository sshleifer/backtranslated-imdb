I was in my teens when I saw this movie, and I was surprised by both the beauty of the young stars and the loving cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story. I am surprised to learn that Alvina has died recently, that Bury has apparently not worked in the film business for almost 30 years, and that both would be over 50 years old. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Elton John is incredibly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence that the characters experience in seclusion. I have seen the poster of the film and I have cataloged it as "Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment", which apparently means something like "Two children who love each other": distributors in English knew how to abbreviate the title! <br /> <br /> Paul, the ignored 15-year-old son of an English businessman who lives in Paris, meets Michelle, an orphan, at the zoo. The two take what they claim to be a one-day vacation in the rural cabin of Michelle's late father, but they end up staying there for a year, cut off from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home. After the baby is born, the police come to Paul's workplace and take him away. <br /> <br /> "Blue Lagoon" comes to mind as another film that almost captures the theme of protected innocence in an isolated paradise. So sad that "Friends" has never been released on DVD.
