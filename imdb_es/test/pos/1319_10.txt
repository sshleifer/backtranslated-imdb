This is my favorite movie and I think it's perfect. Unlike almost any other film I can name, I never see this movie and I think it would have been better if they had changed this or that or whatever. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think so. Each brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and everything flows from the Schrader script. I've always liked the work of Paul Schrader (you can not argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing movie), but although his writing often seems to be on the edge of grandiloquent, his style of direction does not usually exist. This is deliberate, I think, because his films are usually about the search for redemption and are set in the real world; ugly and rough Your style adapts to your themes by presenting your characters in a simple and realistic way, and allows them to show the public the truth of the situation. Imagine if Schrader had directed Taxi Driver or Bringing Out The Dead, instead of Scorsese. But like the protagonists of those two films, while Mishima the man was Schrader's ideal material, the right, the vain and in disagreement with society, his works were subtle and beautiful. In fact, I had a high school career as a writer for a woman, producing what can reasonably be described as romantic potboilers. So you would not necessarily imagine that Schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty in the movie. I think the movie shows that he was. The script that helped fashion divides Mishima into three parts; His life, his death and his mind. His life is represented in black and white, camera, formal compositions. His death, for which he will always be remembered, is a documentary style of hand. And his mind is represented by the dramatized excerpts from his novels, each of which reveals the thought processes of this complex man, who almost never wrote a character that was not a reflection of himself. These dramatisms are beautiful to look at, thanks to the extraordinary production design of Eiko Ishioka and the imaginative staging of Schrader. In all parts, the acting is excellent, especially Ken Ogata as Mishima, who captures the essential charm, arrogance and narcissism of man. Photography is excellent at all times and contains images that the viewer will keep forever. Finally, the music is simply magnificent, it perfectly combines the images, although it is recorded and recorded before the shot, it is adjusted during the editorial process and it is recorded again. I do not know how much the music influenced the recording, but it adheres perfectly to the image. I have seen many ideas of what several people think the subject of the film is, what Schrader is trying to say. You know, the great things in life, death, etc. But I do not think the movie says anything. Mishima has already said it, the movie simply repeats itself.
