Small spoilers follow, but nothing you will not have learned from reading the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Gathered by a wonderful central performance by Ren√©e Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark but deceptively good comedy. <br /> <br /> After suffering an emotional and mental collapse after witnessing the murder of her lazy husband, Betty, who is already worried and desperately unhappy, is convinced that a character with her favorite soap during the day is her promised lost time and part of Kansas to Hollywood to find him. <br /> <br /> Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's state of mind, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as an innocent loser, not totally helpless but tragically, nevertheless, vulnerable. It's crucial that he's never really a victim despite this, and although he certainly suffers horribly from the characters who treat him badly, everyone is understandable, even Greg Kinnear as the object of his illusory illusions can be a selfish arrogant pig, clueless, but genuinely believe. who is simply a quirky aspiring actress with bags of talent instead of a crazy stalker. <br /> <br /> The absurd ending where all the main characters descend in the same place (in this case, Betty's house) at the same time for is as old as the cinema itself, but it works pretty well here , even if the change of tone is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Kinnearer and Morgan Freeman support Zellweger by doing solid work, especially. It's nice to see Chris Rock show restraint in his previous scenes. <br /> <br /> Not as cruel as might be expected, and not at all wicked, Nurse Betty, though far from being a racket of laughter, is a solid entertainment elevated to something Much more by the leading actress.
