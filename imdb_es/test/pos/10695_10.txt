The excellent plot makes this movie one of the classic cult ninja movies of all time. The plot is that the soul of this woman is possessed by an evil ninja spirit. I want to be honest, if I could get the ninja ability through possession, I would. Also, being in the 80's and the fact that the appearance of the ninja was much greater in this decade is evident and, despite all that, Ninja 3 The Domination manages to keep it original from the molds of American Ninja cookies that plagued the 80 for up to the sight. This girl is definitely Michael Dudikoff on steroids ... I mean, the first American ninja was great, but let's be real friends, he has nothing in Ninja 3
