The idea is not original ... If you've seen a story like this before, you would know what the ending will be like after watching the first twenty minutes ... the script, the positioning of the actors and the projection is too obvious .. If you have not seen such a story before, it is definitely a good experience, you will enjoy the turn at the end ... do not forget to see it again after you know the "truth", even more enjoy the plots ... Even though I have an idea Right from the start, I still could not help staying in my seat until the end ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You have to see it! ! This one from Korea is better than any recent film from the Japanese genre ... forget about Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Do not miss it!
