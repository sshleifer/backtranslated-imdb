I saw this portrait very emotionally painful and it was fascinating. The conflict between Williams' public and private faces and the pressure under which he falls under is illuminated in such a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. The cast performed superbly, but Michael Sheen was exceptional. I only realized that it was him when I saw the previous comment. He looks completely different physically in this role, from any other role that has seen him in or as himself. Williams's autobiography differs markedly from his diaries, as depicted in this film. The movie is sometimes distressing to watch, due to the emotional distress that is shown. However, it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be highly recommended.
