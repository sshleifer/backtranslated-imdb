I felt that Rupert Grint has many promises of that role for which everyone knows him. So, although I had never heard of this movie before, when it appeared on my cable TV lists, I immediately switched to that channel. I'm so happy I did it! <br /> <br /> I have read from other critics who generally do not like the coming of age stories; I on the other hand do a lot. I am one of those who is always coming of age; I have been since I was 12 years old, I am 52 years old now, and I will probably continue until I am 92. The age of majority is only to suddenly realize the possibilities offered by another day. The suddenness of the realization, its magnitude, sometimes throws us into disorder. If we try to protect ourselves from that, then yes, I can see how coming of age can end. But if we just dust off and settle into the new direction we've discovered, then suddenly we're on a new path, and we're as alive as yesterday, just stronger, brighter, and I daresay, more interesting. <br /> <br /> So that's what this movie was about. This was a story of coming of age in every way; The young Ben, his father, Father Robert and, certainly, Dame Evie ... they all went through a wonderful transformation. In fact, so did Mr. Fincham, is not it? Everything I did, I suspect, except in reality the mother, despite her enormous opportunity to do so, provided by the events at the end of the film. One is left with the feeling that it will follow exactly the same path it has been, only perhaps with a different cast of support. <br /> <br /> So, an excellent movie, which could not possibly have been made in America that is completely depressing to think about, but thank God we have a constant supply of films made in other places that we can occasionally see. I recommend this film wholeheartedly, as long as you do not mind going through those parts of it that are very familiar to us, and smiling for everything else.
