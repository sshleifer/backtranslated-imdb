I would like to tell you some things before considering seeing this movie. If at one time or another you thought you had seen a good job with the camera, be prepared to be amazed with this movie. For the record, this film was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something that we have seen much later in the Western world ... about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies a lot: happiness, love, war, despair, joy, but in the end you're left with something quite unique: the joy of seeing a masterpiece of cinema. The young directors of our time should study more these kinds of movies and maybe they can create something similar ... although I think films like this are very difficult to get ... If you've seen "I'm Cuba", then this movie would attract you a lot , but if not, get ready for a unique experience. Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets, great actors and the joy of creating art ... and yes, they can create more masterpieces than the whole Western world as a whole. I'm not a big fan of Russia, I really hate everything that is communist, but the movie in that part of the world manages to create feelings that are hard to describe. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it. <br /> <br />
