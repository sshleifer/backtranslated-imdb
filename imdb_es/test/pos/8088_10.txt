This movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It is a film for both children and parents, and it is "timeless". I watched this movie before Ocean's Eleven and I must admit that the OE actors have class in advance, but Klatretøsen's work is much more realistic and moving. Why do I say Ocean's Eleven, it's the fact that these 2 movies have a lot in common and Klatretøsen is THAT good? which can support comparison with OE. The 3 young people play their role in a perfect way not to believe, compared to what we are used to in Denmark. The different cases of impossible acts are handled in a way that you would not believe in many young actors (and, sometimes, not even the "old boys"). The history ? again he has things in common with Ocean's Eleven, except for the reason of stealing the money and in Klatretøsen they need to go up to the fort. The part where young people have to take care of Ida's younger brother gives her a good element in the movie. Try to imagine how to steal a bank with a 2 year old boy with a diaper, on his arm :-). <br /> <br /> This movie can be compared to most "older" movies like MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes, I think it's so good. It is better to see it in a theater, since all the children in the room comment on the film and these comments will remain in their hearts forever :-). <br /> <br /> Regards Klavs.
