02/17/09 "More" (1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a film that most viewers have agreed on is quite normal, I am impressed by the number of different interpretations that have been offered about she. . I've only tracked the network briefly and I've been told that "More" is: a nineteenth-century romance, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a simple movie full of boring people, and of interest only to Pink Floyd completistas. It is fair to say, then, that critical reception is mixed. I would say that these tremendously disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder's directorial debut in 1969 are proof enough that "More" is anything but a fairly average movie. <br /> <br /> Neither is it a masterpiece, of course. I approached "More" like "Easy Rider" and "Blowup" by Antonioni, like a "time capsule" movie, a snapshot of an era, despite the differences in rhythm, style and content between these films. All have similar flaws, whether they are vague or unpleasant characters, that seem to be drifting away from reality, relaxed editions and abrupt endings that have left viewers indignant. These films never try to be persuasive or meet the audience half-heartedly, they are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we have a memory of the experience. Fortunately, "MÃ¡s" offers several images, sounds and suggestions truly memorable for the viewer, and this is what keeps it. <br /> <br /> Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris recently arrived from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls with a group of French hipsters, accompanies them to devastating and distrustful parties and bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters are sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where Icarus comes into play: she is the Sun, he is pursuing her. Now you can guess how all this ends. <br /> <br /> Ibiza is an idyll so far from the hectic urgency of Paris, so crowded, that the naive Stefan knows he must be in a good place. . Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable weak point. So far I had not minded any of these characters and their unfocused search for somewhere to be really free, but once the action is reduced to just these two, the movie becomes very poignant all of a sudden. During a lonely and melancholy exchange of dialogues in the remote village they inhabit, the place where their volatile love crystallizes, I went from observing with an optimism that vanished to being completely captivated. I can not think of many other movies that have done this. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human, as we can see that it goes from the intimacy that defines life to the disappointment and cruel coldness. They take many drugs and throw themselves naked on the terraces, rocks and beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing more than each other and the beautiful Mediterranean surroundings. For a time, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience for its own sake. But Stefan is not in control, and this is the fall of something more than his future in Ibiza. <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd's score is perfect for exoticism, intimacy and the feeling of "More". It is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito net around Estelle's bed and its hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the cover of the soundtrack album). A scene in which they take the acid to escape heroin abstinence is illustrative of the couple's fundamental flaws: they can not "land" without a shock. Maybe they have come too close to what they wanted. <br /> <br /> Stefan never makes contact with any family member or friend since before his arrival in Paris. They let us boast that they have no idea where it is. While other counterculture films of the 1960s focus on debauchery, excess, the media and voyeurism, Schroeder presents a story centered on a man, who rests in a corner of the world and silently disappears. .
