The many other comments about the film say it all, just to add that last week we showed around 30 in our Community Cinema, and got an overall average score of 8.6. We would recommend it 100%, then, for today's audiences, especially if they can see it on a real movie screen, and then they can talk about it with others, as our audience did. <br /> <br /> The power of the interpretive performances of the entire company was incredible and fascinating. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars. But everyone was very well cast. For our afternoon audience, most of whom are "older adults", the fact that the plot could be followed so easily due to the clarity of the speech and the wonderful non-technical use of the camera and the sound was a great influence <br /> <br /> How delicious, many said, to see a really great movie that is British: it is still not dated twenty years later: it is not full of blood and guts: it is not confused due to the outbursts of all the place camera shots, and from one side to another through story lines: there are no sordid sex scenes. Such opinions were even voiced by some who were younger.
