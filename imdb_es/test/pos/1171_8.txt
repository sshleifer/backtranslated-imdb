"Out to Sea" is a funny movie starring that wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This movie is not as fun as his comedies "Grumpy Old Men" (which looks a lot), but there are many laughs throughout. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws who cruise together. Once they get on the boat, what Lemmon does not know is that Matthau has hired them as dance hosts so they do not have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon who is not in the mood to dance. What's worse, Matthau does not even know how to dance. However, they agree with the process and meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members. Here are the crew members: the cruise director, Gil Godwyn, played to the fullest by the veteran of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" Brent Spiner, who acts as an evil dictator. There are two fellow dance hosts, played by "Barney Miller" star Hal Linden and veteran film actor Donald O'Connor. There is the owner of the boat, Mrs. Carruthers, played by the "Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan. As for the passengers: there is Vivian, a widow played by Gloria De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There is Liz, played by one of my favorite actresses of all time, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There's Mavis, Liz's mother, played by veteran stage actress Elaine Stritch. And they meet others too. It is a pleasure to see all these actors while Lemmon and Matthau play with them. It's great to see Cannon here, the view is as beautiful as ever; Stritch is a hoot; Spiner is a funny and comic villain who plays in a very straight way; De Haven is wonderful; Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have a good time or two; and finally, the two main stars, Lemmon and Matthau, are fine as usual. A little jewel of comedy. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
