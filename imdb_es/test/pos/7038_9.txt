Ahhhh, 1984 ... I was young and stupid, and I was developing a taste for those exotic cigarettes, while living crouched on Manchester's Moss Side, with the most incredible case of cockroach infestation. <br /> <br /> After some of those doobies, this show was ROTFLMAO material, it was an avid fanatic. Then I looked towards the ground (or upwards, towards the walls, or almost anywhere) and saw my own collection of "little armadillos" that slunk away. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if it was the chemical improvement, but I remember thinking at the time that the manifest surrealism of the show was fantastic: it was my second favorite thing on TV at the time (number 1 was Luis Bunuel's film season shown on Channel 4). Radical art lives! <br /> <br /> You also have that theme melody! .... I swear, I will never drink again ...
