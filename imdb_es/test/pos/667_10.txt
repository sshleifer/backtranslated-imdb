Whoever put that criticism as "in bad taste" is not quite there ... it's so funny, great and fantastic that you could see it until your eyes are square. Not to mention the rest of the work he has done in the rest of the series ... everything is as good as Morris's standards. If you think it is "horrible", "unpleasant" or "sick", then I can only think of one thing to say to you: "go to hell". Thank you. It had to be said! I think the way so many people complained was a complete joke ... I would like to shout at all the people who really did it: "Do not you have something better to do with your time? Are you trying to try?" Thanks for reading my comment on the subject ... greetings
