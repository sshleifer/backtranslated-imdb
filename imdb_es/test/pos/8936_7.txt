When I see "Plots with a View" (called "Undertaking Betty" in the US), I have the feeling that it is necessary that there be more films recorded in Wales. This portrays a woman (Brenda Blethyn) in a small Welsh town trying to escape from her unfaithful husband. So, she and the funeral director (Alfred Molina) have a plan ... but there are probably some faults along the way. <br /> <br /> Actually, I would say that the character of Christopher Walken is the best of the movie (how could it not be?). But in general, the whole idea is very good, stacked with some moments "uh oh" ... especially the scene of the haunted house. It's the kind of movie I wish I could participate in, just to experience it. <br /> <br /> Also starring Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles.
