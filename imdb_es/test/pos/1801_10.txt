This is a romantic movie, although corny, which is one of my favorites of all time. It is one of the many CLASSICS of the 80's genre like "Pretty in Pink" or "Some kind of Wonderful". <br /> <br /> Nic plays the traditional punk in love with the traditional valley, the girl of very good taste, Julie. It's a touching love story that makes you encourage her to win the girl in the end. <br /> <br /> It's true, most actors act badly, but ... <br /> <br /> I've been in love with Nic since I saw this in theaters and I've seen almost every movie in which he has been since then. He has really grown as an actor, but it is obvious that in his first film he had a LOT of potential. <br /> <br /> If you love 80's movies, you'll LOVE this classic. <br /> <br /> Go rent it!
