A surprisingly good movie considering the circumstances of its production. It presents performances by nameless actors who compete with the best talent on the planet (unfortunately none has pursued a career). <br /> <br /> It also presents the divine ability of Christopher Nolan to write a perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what this story takes, which is about a man who likes to follow people to get material for their books. Well filmed, VERY well edited, even better written and incredibly well interpreted. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything a great movie needs, except for the people who have seen it. 9/10
