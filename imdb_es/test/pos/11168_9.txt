I read the comments on this film before seeing it and I did not expect much, but as a movie B it is a curiosity. I guess you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy this kind of thing, but seriously I thought it was amazing. People should see it only because of the experience, because it is totally unique. Do not expect much of that. The performance is bad, the transitions were obviously made on a PC, etc. Definitely a B movie, but it's still really worth checking out. Very funny. Gore soft, and some questionable subjects, so it's probably not something to show your Gran, but for the more adventurous viewer, I'd say it's a must.
