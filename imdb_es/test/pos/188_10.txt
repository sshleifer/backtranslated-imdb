Sick of the current cinematographic production, particularly of the American cinema, I have been making an effort to see the foreign films winning the Oscar. That's when I came across this gem. Slow to begin, he recovers very well once the war is declared. Basically, an old story of girls-wait-for-the-return-of-the-war, the performances, the cinematography makes this much more. Why Tatyana Samojlova, as a young man, did not become an international star after this exceeds me (although she has succeeded in her own country). Start the journey with her: a young impetuous and defiant young woman, who, through the ravages of war, becomes a sober and somber woman who keeps a glimpse of hope (her final scene is devastating). We love it as much as the camera. And the camera work! Was this the pioneer in working with handheld cameras? It really adds an immediacy to the story. And its beauty (as when Tatyana's character is running upstairs and next to a grid fence). I feel humble and grateful to see this movie.
