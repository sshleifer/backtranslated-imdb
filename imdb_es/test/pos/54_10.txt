This was a great movie. Something not only for the month of Black History, but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the affirmation that it really takes a village to raise a child. The performances of S Eptath were outstanding. Mos Def and his singing were off the hook. I had to do a double take when I saw that it was Rosie Perez there. But the cast of actors and actresses made it worth seeing. All the different stories they had were incredible. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else who was in his presence. I can really understand that she is the matriarch of that period of time and, even more, how tired she was of helping everyone. I can not wait for it to come out on DVD. It would be a welcome addition to any movie library.
