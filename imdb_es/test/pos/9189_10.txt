I was not sure about getting this movie on DVD because I really have something against the people who make black and white films in the 21st century, but in the end I bought it anyway. I still do not understand why it had to be black and white, but that's the only negativity I can see about the film, and it's a perfect example to see the definitive rise of Brazilian cinema. Not everyone can understand a movie like this, but it is quite rewarding for those who do it. Unlike O Homem Que Copiava, surrealism fits quite well with this film, and the acting is at least as good as that, or other successful Brazilian films such as Bicho de Sete CabeÃ§as, Cidade De Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, etc. br /> <br /> My only hope is that this gem is not insulted and raped by a Hollywood remake. It's amazing to see how those guys spend billions of dollars and still can not make a movie that is 1% as good as this possible low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Bravo to the whole crew! 10/10
