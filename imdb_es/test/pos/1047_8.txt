A magazine columnist who writes about life in her country house when, in fact, she lives in a New York apartment, she must come up with a plan when she discovers that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it becomes a small entertaining comedy, thanks to an excellent cast. In a large departure from her previous role as a fatal woman in "Double Indemnity", Stanwyck shows a good comic style. Morgan is mild as the affable war hero, while Greenstreet is well chosen as the editor. However, Sakall steals the film like a chef trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent.
