I can understand why others reacted quite unpleasantly towards the climax, taking a turn that is really hard to take seriously. I think, however, that the accumulation works quite well. The music, quite threatening and vibrant, really provides a creepy aura that combines with the relentless sound of a phone that constantly sounds and that is driving the English actress Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh). She is borrowing a friend's nice apartment while trying to start her career in New York City (the city buildings outside the window look as realistic as David Letterman's) and she's sincere and welcomed by a phone Noisy that sounds pretty, followed by loud knocks against the wall. In search of answers with respect to the one responsible for such indifference towards her sanity, Joan discovers that nobody rents that room and that, in fact, a former tenant had strangled herself. Without the help of the manager, Joan will decide to discover for herself who is causing her such anguish. Joan discovers that the room is empty and the phone with a particular female voice will chase her. <br /> <br /> The episode, I think, is a tour de force for Jean Marsh, which is a one-woman show. She is the only visible actress and we follow her through the crisis that erodes her slowly, the telephone and the blows from that other room cause her a lot of anguish that turns into fear. Instead of leaving, Joan stays, so shocked by the noise and to the breaking point where she just wants the phone (or whoever is ringing) to stop. The episode provides a possible answer about who is harassing Joan and why. A character named Beth enters the story rather late when Joan struggles to find out whose female voice was on the other end of the line that knew her name on the dreaded phone she discovers in the room in front of his. Beth's fate could tell the viewer why Joan is traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in ghosts instead of credibility, some did not especially like it, but I certainly did. I must admit that the phone, as a physical threat that "creeps" towards Joan, is hard to take seriously, not to mention that it is an attack on her, but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes before this was scary enough as to compensate.
