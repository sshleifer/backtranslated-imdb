I have to say that when it comes to Adaptations from book to film, the BBC rarely disappoints me. Now with respect to this miniseries. I love Starling's novel, it's the best murder / mystery I've read. The Mini-series, definitely made my day when I saw it. The main story remained almost intact. The characters match those of the novel very well, the personalities and manners were right for Red and Jez. I thought Duncan had done very well like Kate, Eric was too simplistic, had a little more depth in the book, but also modified his sub-story to have had to deal with that. Of course there are changes, but most are cosmetic, but some disappointed me, the sub-story with Eric's murder charge changed and that changed the overall dynamics between Red and Eric for the film, and eliminated the Triathlon Jez training I was doing. Some of the other events in the book have been changed to be friendly to the viewer. Above all, if you liked the book, you will like it, if you like the miniseries, then you will love the book. I must say that this is the most accurate Book to Movie adaptation I've seen.
