Mild spoilers <br /> <br /> ... and that's 'the top ten of all time'. I tripped over 'Two Hands' by accident (maybe that made it even more special, with no inflated expectations) at IFC one night, and I could not believe I had not heard anything about it. Now that Heath Ledger is becoming more famous in the US UU., I'm sure it's more available. At that time, I was telling my friends about the movie, and nobody could find it anywhere except the occasional IFC presentation. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the black / gangster comedy genre, it fits well with my other favorites, and everyone in the movie really seems to end up with what they deserve. Bryan Brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes origami with his little son and plays scrabble with his henchmen. It is also hilarious the fate of quick editing of a random car thief. Even Heath was pretty good at that. At the time, he vaguely remembered it from a short-lived series about Fox called 'Roar'. Let's hope that Gregor Jordan makes another hit, but as far as I'm concerned, this is his best moment.
