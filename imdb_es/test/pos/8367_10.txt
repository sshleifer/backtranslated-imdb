I could never imagine that I would start loving movies like this. After watching 'Hero' by Yimou Zhang, I decided to check out his other films, maybe looking for something similar. The second Yimou Zhang movie that I saw was "No One Less", after which I realized the kind of cinema I'm in now. No wonder why I got "Keep Cool" right away. It is a piece of simple, moving and brilliant cinema, I respect the director. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that it is not the amount of money that makes the film good. It is about what the director wants to show and how successful he is at doing this. The story is very simple, an extract typical of a typical everyday life, which is also shown in a very simple way, the movements of the camera also reinforce the impression and the feeling of the film. I give a maximum rating to this film and I look forward to seeing other films by Yimou Zhang.
