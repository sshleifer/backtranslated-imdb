I really love this movie !!! I have not played Final Fantasy VII, but I still love the movie, it's very funny and I love the work that voice actors have done. The images are SO fantastic and all the lines are very well done. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a pretty good imagination, so I was able to fill most of the gaps that the film presented, and I suggest I look at it twice because many things "suddenly" make sense. <br /> <br /> Also, (this is pretty funny) you should see it with the subtitles activated because what they say and what the submarines say are sometimes completely different. It's usually quite fun, but sometimes it helps you better understand what they say. <br /> <br /> Look at it! love marnie
