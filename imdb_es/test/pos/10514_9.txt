The Night Gallery never impressed me so much, but this episode stands out. <br /> <br /> An executive of a television network auditions a strange act: a young, nerdy boy who proceeds to make predictions. The executive dismisses all this as a waste of time until the two predictions come true the next morning. <br /> <br /> What first looked like a classroom act becomes a show of success, since the child's predictions are consistently accurate. <Br /> <br /> Then, one day, he refuses to make the show. When facing an impending schedule of shows, everyone gets nervous, even threatening him with a legal action if he does not comply with his contract and makes his daily predictions. <br /> <br /> The young man gives in, and predicts an apparently utopian morning. <br /> <br /> After the show, the confused executive asks for an explanation, only to find out why the full truth is too terrifying to reveal.
