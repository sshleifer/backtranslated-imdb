Having been educated in Phenix City as a child, I recognize many of the local people in the film, so for me it's like a trip down memory lane to see "The Phenix City Story" again. In fact, my grandfather is in one of the first scenes. Uncle Drew is the one in the Hawaiian shirt who moves his chair to see the singer / stripper better. <br /> <br /> Unless I've been there, as Mr. Page and I have, I could not. You may not understand the story that counts. The New York reviewer says that John Patterson is racist, probably never having had an encounter with Mr. Patterson or his father. And what is your point of mentioning Mr. Patterson's job now? It has nothing to do with the movie you are supposedly reviewing. How can you sit and judge them or this movie when it probably has not gone any further than the South Bronx? In my experience, the people who do that simply try to feel morally superior to the people represented in the film. According to most accounts of the time, both Mr. Patterson were basically good and decent men. Their families were respectable people, as were most people who lived in Phenix City. <br /> <br /> By the way, why is it so difficult for those living outside the south to believe that there are good and decent people? People even in small towns in Alabama? And why do they assume that everyone who lives in a small southern city is racist? My parents lived there and, nevertheless, they did not tolerate it in our house. Others did not tolerate it either, but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives through the voluntary ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The film itself is simple and direct. It's not the whole story: Hollywood added some sensationalism when the movie was made. Parts of it were absolutely blank. Other parts of it bordered the fairy tales. And if that is the source that anyone uses to decide what the people of the small southern cities are like, they should understand and understand what most of us do: ONLY a movie.
