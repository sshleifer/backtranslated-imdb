Who said he had to be credible? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before sitting down to watch this movie. You will enjoy much more of the experience. You will find yourself forgiving some of the most extravagant plots of the film and simply accepting it for what it is: a great family movie. I appreciated not having to worry about "questionable elements" in a children's movie for once. That, for me, is worth the price of the ticket. And he manages to maintain his integrity without being obvious, older children will enjoy this movie. Enough good humor to keep adults interested. Very good movie.
