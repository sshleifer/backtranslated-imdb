I just wish I could be eloquent enough to say how GOOD this movie is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> Maybe just say what I can think of. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I really laughed. I could not believe it. I laughed, and, it was not a bitter laugh. It was not a cynical laugh. it was the laughter generated by genuine joy. <br /> <br /> joy. That's a foreign word for me. I do not feel that word often, but I did it while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Will. Maybe it's Will's face. He is a great human being. "Smile on my face and there is a shine in my eyes." That line in one of Will's songs describes it perfectly. He has "joie de vivre". Trey is a lucky guy, lucky to have a father like Will. Jada is a lucky woman, lucky to have a husband like Will. He is someone ... special. <br /> <br /> Happy. Actually I feel happy. It is a strange feeling. I do not feel that way very often. It's so nice to see, see ... other people really happy. I want to say really happy. In this movie, I did it. As Will says in the movie, "Maybe I'm not happy with just 'good', maybe I want 'extraordinary' You know, watching this movie made me think: Me too. <br /> <br /> Fun. We all know that we are supposed to be ourselves, but it seems that they punish us if we do it, maybe it has to be won, maybe it's something we show after not being ourselves for a long time. The end: Will, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta and Julie Ann started dancing at the wedding, dancing without inhibitions, NO, WE'RE DRUNKED, except, actually being happy, I can understand that, at least, I think I can (at least, I liked to see them happy, very happy). <br /> <br /> Women and men, I do not know anything about relationships, but, I feel, watching this movie, I want to connect with someone, make an effort , pushing, wanting to be with someone, seems to make life ... something completely different, I really do not know, I'm just guessing But, I felt something, watching this movie. I felt that connection must be ... it should make life worthwhile. <br /> <br /> That's the kind of movie it is. It is funny. It's clean It's TENDER. Evokes feelings It made me think, maybe, just maybe, life is, in truth, something wonderful. <br /> <br /> Do you want to laugh? He wants to feel really good!
