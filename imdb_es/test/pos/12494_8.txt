And I love it!!! Wonder Showzen will capture a cult audience and once it is canceled, DVD sales will go through the roof. This is a very funny show in its own ways. It is a parody of children's shows, specifically Sesame Street. Our puppets are formed by Chauncy, a yellow furry monster with a hat, whose host is ours. Clarence is a thing like a blue lizard that makes its own segments where it goes out on the street. He is a strange dog that refers to himself in the third person. Wordsworth is the intelligent one whose brain always shows. Then there's the news anchor and the pink puppet. It is a very funny show, not as unpleasant as one might expect, but rather situations. They take the 7-year-olds out on the street, they tell them what to say and they make bad jokes that they do not understand. My favorite segments are Clarence's videos, especially when someone does not want to be filmed. I prefer TV Funhouse, which was a similar program, but it's still a very fun program that I hope will last for many years. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** 1/4 of *** *. 30 minutes. TV MA.
