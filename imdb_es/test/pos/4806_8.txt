Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are superb in the crime thriller directed by Johnny To, which highlights most of the Western efforts. Think of it as the 'Heat' of Hong Kong, but better! All about the kind of movie cries; From the performances to the soundtrack, from the cinematography to the script. The tone is still serious at all times, but the film has a good line of black humor, friendship and romance in his heart. Sure, it gets a bit absurd later, but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who did not find anything to love about this movie. Thank God, Hollywood has not (yet) rebuilt and ruined a classic. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
