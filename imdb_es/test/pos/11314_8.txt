Before seeing this picture, I was quite skeptical, I do not like movies with an agenda or appreciate being afraid to think like the writer. I also feared that this was like the two-part miniseries "10.4", which had an implausible concept, little relation to the real world and a very poor execution. At the beginning it is said: "This movie is a fiction, but the events described and information on emergency planning in the UK are based on extensive research"; and the general feeling is that you are not selling an idea, but that you are being taught a lesson in civil awareness. The message that is transmitted is obvious from the beginning: it is coming and we are not prepared. The use of real places and a scenario that could not only happen (there are plans for when it does), all add to the disturbing effect that the film will have, even on the most cynical spectators. The perspective of the film is that of society and it stays away from the heart-rending personal moments, which do not convey the message, so none of Romeo-Julieta's dramas to which we are accustomed.
