Although his vision of homosexuals is wrong, this film will shed light on the myths and inaccuracies about AIDS for the viewer. Despite the depressing theme, this film shows a warm friendship between two children, and will make you laugh and cry. Very well acted by everyone, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is a bit strong, although appropriate, and is an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family. But remember to have the Kleenex ready!
