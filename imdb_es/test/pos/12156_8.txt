"Más", perhaps, is best remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by Pink Floyd: in 1969 they were not yet superstars. In fact, they made an album with the music of the film, no fan can miss it! <br /> <br /> But this is also the first film of the German-French director Barbet Schroeder: it is a cult film. When it was released, censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs. It is also one of the first films to explicitly deal with the issue of drug slavery. <br /> <br /> A German boy travels to Paris and meets an American girl: they fall in love. Together they seek sun and exoticism. But it is a love of too high a price: she initiates him into drugs. <br /> <br /> In the sixties the anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there was not much information. On the contrary, in many environments the consumption of drugs was a kind of spiritual experience ... So, it is quite surprising to see a movie from that period that describes a nightmarish heroin experience. <br /> <br /> The film is simple, not Vulgar at all and filmed in a "cinema-verité" style. The actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Grünberg are very convincing. "More" is a document from the end of the sixties, and also a document of the end of the illusions of the hippies.
