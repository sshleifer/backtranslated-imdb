I was lucky to see this movie in the pre-release last night and, although I did not expect to do so, I actually enjoyed the movie for the most part. The rescues and the effects of the sea were amazing to see and definitely provided moments of tension in the seat, probably even more knowing that there are guys who do this to make a living. The weakest parts of the film revolve largely around the use of stereotyped scenes. I'm not going to ruin the movie, but this really follows the lines of An Officer and a Gentleman and those moments give it a bit of cheese flavor. <br /> <br /> As I said throughout this movie it's pretty good and it's worth checking out, as long as you can get over the clich√©s.
