The Mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative mario so far; even more than the super Mario 64. the controls are great; Some of the best for the Wii. Beautiful graphic design too. The levels are very large, and the good old bosses are back. There are tons to explore in this game; Definitely a high level of repetition value. I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a bit similar to that of Mario 64. and 2: the difficulty is not very high; although it does require a bit of patience. Mario fans: the game you were waiting for. Casual players: this game is worth more than the purchase. 9.8 out of 10.
