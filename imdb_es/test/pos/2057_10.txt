I am a 49 year old woman, happily married, who loves the movie. I love this movie. <br /> <br /> The character of Geena Davis is strong, intelligent and kicking ............ I thought she did an excellent job (that's a euphemism) in this movie . <br /> <br /> I'm not very big in action movies, but I thought it was so sexy and entertaining. <Br /> <br /> She is my alter-ego ............. when she starts to assemble the assault rifle in the old hotel room ......... ... ......... I have chills ............... she did it as if she knew what she was doing ........... that's one of my MANY favorite parts in that movie ........ <br /> <br /> I think she deserved an Oscar for her acting and physical roles ........ <br /> <Br /> I'm going to have "CHARLY" tattooed on my back .............. I'm one of those girls who WILL NEVER BE A VICTIM ....... ... ............ I'm like her ............... (shhhhhhhhhhhhhh secretly ........ and is not that oh so sexy?)
