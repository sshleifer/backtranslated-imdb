My first contact with Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his production company Studio Ghibli was when an English-language version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago. What a marvelously creative and unique cinematic experience! Then, I managed to get my friend employed in the cinema to see this new Miyazaki movie with me, especially because he loves all things Disney (the American distributor of this movie). Once again, all I can say is "Wow!" What impressive visual effects on the way water is represented as the ocean ... and what happens with the transformation of the character from the title of a goldfish to ... and see how the behavior of the characters changes ... and, well, look at this movie if you want to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices that are being used for this version nicknamed in the United States: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. Good elections to all. Everything makes sense? No, but that's part of the childhood charm that permeates everything. There are many funny scenes about Ponyo and the boy and many other people they meet. Oh, I think I've written too much, so I just recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo.
