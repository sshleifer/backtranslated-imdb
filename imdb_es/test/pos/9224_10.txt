People talk about how horrible the script was and how horrible the animation was, but Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer really is a Japanese Anime aimed at children. If you look at today's anime, it's done in the same style, and it's immensely popular. I do not think that this movie was intended to be seen by adults. Just as I do not think it's ever been the intention to be serious. The same things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things I love. Rainbow Brite is one of the best cartoon characters created in my opinion. She's smart. She is funny. She cares about the environment. She cares for her friends. This movie can teach both young children. My little brothers even liked this movie. I have to say that this movie taught me a lot when I was a kid. When it came out on DVD I was the first to buy it. It is a great movie for children. So, what if it's not perfect, nothing is really perfect when you look at it with enough attention?
