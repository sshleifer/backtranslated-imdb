I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; At first, I was a bit skeptical about the plot of this movie. Follow three children who were born during a solar eclipse and, therefore, have no emotions, and therefore (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot sounds ridiculous at first, but once you realize that a solar eclipse blocks Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the planet of emotions, everything falls into place; It has a complete meaning and that's when you know you're not just seeing another fool of the 80s with a pea brain diagram. Thank God for that! Seriously though, Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but it makes up for it with its originality. It is possible that having a group of children killing people is not the most ingenious masterpiece ever seen in the movies, but when I am given the choice between this and another boring Friday the 13th, I know what I would choose. <br /> <br /> Also helping the film to come out of the hole where some people would think it is an absurd plot, is the fact that it is extremely entertaining. Many slashers become too fast and the audience ends up seeing simply some blood. This movie, however, is maintained with great spooky performances by children (dating back to the creepy children's classics such as Village of the Damned), a steady flow of sickly humor and a small, but impressive for the type of movie . Dose of suspense and tension. One thing that I really liked about this movie was the great variety of weapons. There is nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (cough with Halloween cough), but that is not the case here, as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from jump ropes to bow and arrows . There was no room for a chainsaw, which is a great pity, but I guess not all movies can have a chainsaw.
