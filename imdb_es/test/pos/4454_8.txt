In this early work by Fulci, the director shows his most popular side, as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and a more than reasonable explanation for the genre. Personally I believe that throughout his career he has been unjustly slandered as an esthete of blood. It's a pretty capable procedure and it surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows its distrust for the mentality of the small-minded small towns and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed have been cut. This film is on its knees when it premiered for the first time and could have given the director another direction so soon. The comparative lack of gore in the film shows a more urgent and psychological imperative of this film in its prevailing "mystery", but the gore and puppets it uses are very useful here in the scene where a falsely accused killer makes no sense. Lynxed by a group of men in a cemetery and killed in a show of vile and antiquated vigilantism, she expertly choreographed the modern melodies of a diegetic radio. <br /> <br /> Another example was the final scene (which was indeed amazing) in which an astonishingly beautiful priest falls from a cliff and the used puppet shows up markedly in a middle foreground that accentuates his demonic appearance and obvious ugliness. Curiously, considering his later works, Fulci also invokes the idea of ​​modernity that took over the village clinging to its anachronistic superstitions and ignorance when the idea of ​​black magic is just that, a strange idea of ​​supernatural evil that never ends to manifest itself from the Voodoo dolls while making his witch nothing more than a disturbed woman. Another thing that I liked was that he adds to these layers of characters by turning a bourgeois city girl into an ambiguous figure: is she the corrupt one that the priest fears for his pupils and perhaps more revealing, for himself? This giallo lends itself to become one of the most personal and substantial films of Fulci, since in reality we receive a fair influx of ideas from him.
