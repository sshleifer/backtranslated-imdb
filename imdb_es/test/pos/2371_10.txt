If you loved the 1993 movie (erotic, science fiction) cyborg "Nemesis", then you will love it. I loved it when Elvis Pompadoured's hero pulled out a samurai sword during a shootout. Like "Nemesis", it takes place in a post-apocalyptic neighborhood of the future. Both are thrillers where the well-armed hero must confront well-armed rebels, to solve a conspiracy of the powers that are against the dirty masses. but that's where the similarities end. The ambiguous mayor, dead or alive, tries to keep the masses relaxed with the drugs he sells. The rebels, helped by mercenaries and a cyborg, try to stop their suffocation in their subjects. After several failed attempts to rein in the rebels, he sends his superior police to assassinate the rebels. This movie follows the trail of most action adventures, but is not afraid to color outside the line.
