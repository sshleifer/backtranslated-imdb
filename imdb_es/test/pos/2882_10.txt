I will always think of Mr. Firth as Dorian Gray, if I live to be 100 years old. <br /> <br /> He acted and directed perfectly, bringing to life the perception, wit and humor of Oscar Wilde with an absolute and absolute perfection unusual in television. . <br /> <br /> More evidence that the BBC more than compensates for the talent of what it does not always have in money. <br /> <br /> A must for all Wilde fans, and indeed for all. plus. Inspired and perfected, each of the actors looked exactly right for the role and each shot was well made. <br /> <br /> In the end I discovered that I loved all the characters in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired. Look at it, then try to see another version. It just is not the same, right?
