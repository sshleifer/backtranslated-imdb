Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach, Ian Charleson, Urban Barberini, Daria Nicolodi Review: The only other Argento film I had seen was Suspiria and that impressed me by its style, its colors and its spooky history . . Then I decided to go with Opera, since I had been told it was one of the best. Man, I think I'm discovering what will eventually be one of my favorite horror directors. <br /> <br /> Opera is about a young opera singer who gets his big break when the main star of a modern and spooky opera acquires. Mc Beth is hit by a car. Betty is the substitute, so she does the part herself. Pity for her, there is a psychopath after her that makes her see the brutal murders of her friends and coworkers. <br /> <br /> Wow, I heard good things about this movie here, but I was not prepared for that. The level of greatness that this film would take me. Yes, the film has its flaws that I will reach later. But for the most part, the movie left me impressed. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is not as colorful as Suspiria. I expected it to be a bit like a sigh in that apartment, but no, to my surprise, it had its own appearance. The film is somehow colorless. It has many colors in certain scenes (like the masterful sequence of the kitchen / living room) where Argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues, but for the most part the film has a grayish black tone. I liked that it had its own distinctive look. <br /> <br /> The real stars of this show are the incredibly well orchestrated sequences of death. Wow. Each death scene was like a work of art. The beauty in the destruction. These are not only their typical sequences of cut and death, these deaths were carefully constructed to impact and make the most of their situations. Beloved every second of them, there is a lot of blood and chaos here, but with style. Although I'm not going to spoil them. <br /> <br /> Then there is the address. Man, there are some really original and beautiful photos in this case. I loved the inventive use of the camera in this case. You thought the Tarantinos fired on Kill Bill vol. 1 where we see that the bullet that comes out of the camera of the gun was original? Well, this is the movie from which he took it! I honestly believe that Tarantino was strongly influenced by this specific movie with certain scenes in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Heck in the creation of the feature, mentions that the whole scene with Beatrix in the hospital and Elle Driver coming to kill her was influenced by the Italian Giallos, and here my friends are proof of that. Anyway, apart from the Tarantino references, this movie has some incredible camera shots, like those scenes of crows flying through the crowd at the opera house ... great things. And one of the main reasons why Argentos became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The performance of the majority of the cast was good, but the best by far was Cristina Marsillach as the young and tortured opera singer Betty. The looks in his eyes as the murders were committed were great. The rest of the cast was a bit wooden and stiff, but nothing that stopped their enjoyment of the movie. <br /> <br /> There were very few things that I did not like about this movie. First, logic was thrown out the window in certain scenes. Especially those that involve Betty's reactions after having seen the murders. It seems to me that for a long time, she continued with her business, without telling anyone about the whole thing. Not even the police. I mean, if you see someone brutally murder a loved one in front of your eyes ... do not stay away from the murder scene and continue with your life. Someone would have linked her to the murders. She could even have become a suspect ... but no. Also the end is a bit anti climatic. You'll have to see this to understand it, but it seemed a bit unnecessary the way the movie ended, it looked like it might have ended earlier. It would not have felt so redundant. But that's it, it's not really a big problem for me, as I was enjoying the rest of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I still have a lot of Argento territory to cover ... but I am devouring every step of the way as if I were eating a plate of the most expensive caviar. These really good guys. I think of his films as works of art, and I've only seen two of them! I can not wait to discover the rest of his films. Argento, you are the man! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 out of 5
