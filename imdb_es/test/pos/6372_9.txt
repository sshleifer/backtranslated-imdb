A great show <br /> <br /> First, for people who do not like it. I do not like it, then DO NOT LOOK AT IT ... <br /> <br /> This is (It was) an awesome show. Better than Jim (one of my favorites). It shows a TRUE family home (Unlike 8 simple rules, etc., where everything goes well). <br /> <br /> They are noisy, messy ... I can sympathize with their drag all Trash in the kitchen. It happens in real life ... The novel as the "Portal to hell", and everyone growls like dogs in fast food boxes. <br /> <br /> It's a show "I've been there" ... You know what's coming, but fun to watch, because YOU've been there before. <br /> <br /> A good cast, they work very well together, a show admirable enough to justify the release of a DVD. The "safety videos" of Mel Gibsons were also a highlight of the series. <br /> <br /> Opinion? Good show, REALLY worthy of a DVD release (deserving not to be canceled too).
