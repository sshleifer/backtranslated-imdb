Recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a delicate subject that does not make the main characters feel. David Tennant and Sarah Parish highlight the complex and conflicting emotions of a deeply in love couple who struggle to accept the personality changes they both endure and must also do to survive a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Tennant, like Alan, brings humor and also a dangerous indolence, as an engineer recovering from a memory loss caused by a traffic accident. Alan is not represented simply as a victim, but as a human being with feelings that do the best they can to make sense of their new life. Tricia, by Sarah Parish, is not a man-to-man housewife who will do anything to support her husband. Fight to not fall in love with Alan, since the man who was once new and loved now is a completely different person, a stranger to her. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some opinions, this, in my opinion, makes Perfect Sunday night watching. Very often, we are shown soft family dramas or series of detectives, such as Heartbeat, that rot and rot the brain. The commissioners of the program seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep. A more challenging and stimulating drama like Recovery would seriously change the situation.
