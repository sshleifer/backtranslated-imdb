Thank God there are movies out there that do not follow the same old Hollywood formula. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution actually make it possible for more interesting work to come out, even if you have to dig more to find it. I love it when a movie takes time to draw it more and more deeply into its inner emotional reaches. It was really like taking a trip through the soul of America and that soul is disturbed and confused. What really amazed me was the way they used Martin Luther King's speeches about Vietnam and the references to his murder in a way that hit me hard. I found myself suffocated every time I heard his voice. I've heard him speak before, of course, but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like I understood his message in a way I had never thought of. <br /> <br /> What can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics about war, oppression and a plea for compassion at the end of it, which would normally be a credit trace? In fact, there are no credits at all in the movie. You have to access them by selecting them in the features. Somehow that made me think a lot. In general, I can not say enough about this DVD. Sparkly.
