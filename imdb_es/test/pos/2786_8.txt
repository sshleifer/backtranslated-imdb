Surprising, witty, fun and totally attractive, the film captures a little-known reality: that of the student who studies in an Erasmus program. The beginning is excellent, since the story begins, of course, has some quiet moments in the middle section, and the story sometimes moves away from the main character, but the viewer will not be upset: the film is young, fresh and light . -hearted, although I do not agree with the idea that when you do Erasmus and come back you are no longer part of that universe. But that's just me. The film is deep, and at the same time very light. Fresh and recommendable
