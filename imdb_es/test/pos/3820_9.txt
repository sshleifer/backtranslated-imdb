I picked up this program a few times when I was young and I was playing the tilt, my parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original boundaries and the penumbra area (new and old) could not do. This show used some old ideas and some really original ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe that Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright did this. Those guys were producers in stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience rooted in the story and created a truly frightening environment. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone. The serenity of the rods is added to the feeling of disgust, while the forest lights the mood. <br /> <br /> The ending, whether good or bad made for a moment of fear. You could never predict what was going to happen. I'm still trying to find the stations on DVD.
