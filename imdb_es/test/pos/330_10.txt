To tell the truth, I do not speak Tamil, and I did not understand the movie. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained everything to me. What a great movie !!! After watching this movie, I felt that I should have seen many more Tollywood films (Tamil Film Industry). The scenes of war were amazing, the excellent camera work and the beautiful plot. The actress "Simran", what beauty. Give a prize to the most beautiful person. Ding, Ding, Ding, come on, I smell an OSCAR winner. I did not understand the songs, but they were excellent. Mani Ratnam is a great director, and I hope that his next film is a success.
