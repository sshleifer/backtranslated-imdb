What could happen in the summer in a town in Texas? Well, a group of teenagers discover that some things can happen and they happen. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the Mexican werewolf in this story is nothing less than the chupacabra, and the movie, unlike what the name suggests, is not a remake or resemblance to the American Werewolf films, but something completely different. <br /> <br /> In general, for an obviously low budget movie, it's not bad! Some smart camera work, pretty traditional creatures with decent looks and blood effects, and for once not everyone knows they can make mistakes, like shooting a colleague thinking he is the big bad beast, and that they are baffled by things that they could not know. . <br /> <br /> Sit down to this, waiting for a blockbuster production of millions of dollars, and you'll turn it off with disgust in a short time. Sit in this waiting for some entertainment and a relatively simple story, and it's pretty good! In general, I get an 8/10 on my part for being creative, having a good performance and getting a good job for the budget that this movie had.
