I think all the critics have captured this movie really well. I've seen it many, many times, but I still feel a sense of joy and warmth like the first time. My emotional response to this movie never seems to fade. The final scene certainly makes me cry, but so does the scene between Perks and The Children on his birthday. And as for the gentle gentleman. Something else is happening with that character. The generous provider and problem solver. He knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. A perfect father to run and make us feel safe. I do not know how the film does it, but it's something very English inside, that has long since left our daily experience, but we all recognize instantly and long for it again.
