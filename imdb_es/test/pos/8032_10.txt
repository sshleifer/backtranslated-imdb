2002, Bourne Identity is one of my favorite movies of all time. however, many fans of the book have complained that the film had very little to do with the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Assignment is the real deal. It's strange that nobody in the threads of "Bourne Identity" has mentioned this movie at all. (Well, I did.) <br /> <br /> Besides the excellent plot, I personally found that this movie is as good as any spy movie I've seen, with the possible exception of The Bourne <br /> < br /> Identity in itself. <br /> <br /> The action is completely realistic. I especially liked the training regime of the protagonists, which was very ingenious. <br /> <br /> The sensation is dark and rough. There are some amazing plot twists. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I can not recommend this movie enough.
