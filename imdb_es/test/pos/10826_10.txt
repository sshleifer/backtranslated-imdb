When I went to see Bon Voyage, I expected a good and skillful multidrama of the order of Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better than that. With few exceptions, none of the characters was totally good or totally bad, just like in real life. The performance was wonderful, especially those who played Frédéric, Raoul and Camille. The photography was incredible, because it recreated the period to perfection and managed to shoot in Bordeaux during a time of new public works, but achieved the "look" of June 1940. The costumes and makeup were accurate. There is so much in this movie that it's worth seeing for the second time. It's exciting, fun and, ultimately, moving. N.B .-- Be sure to see it in a theater with a good quality projection. It's on the wide screen, and in the theater where I saw it (the Clairmont in Montclair), the first 30 minutes had the subtitles at the bottom focused, but the faces of the actors are a bit blurry! This was ultimately corrected, but it detracted from the pleasure of the movie.
