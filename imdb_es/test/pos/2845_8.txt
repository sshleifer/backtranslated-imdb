Nurse Betty has that strange but winning combination of a repulsive and uncomfortable plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way that I hated Fargo the first time I saw him, then I realized that I still thought about it a few days later and that I enjoyed it in some way. I liked Nurse Betty much the day after I saw him. Difficult to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it is quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear's fair work, great work by Morgan Freeman (although I'm worried he did it). being stereotyped as the villain of principles). Chris Rock was good, but not a standout. Ren√© Z. is so natural that it is disconcerting, that is, disconcerting to be "natural" to play someone who is not right in the head. I also liked the kind of "abrasive shine" of Allison Janney in a small part. <br /> <br /> Do not expect as much from a "road movie" as you might expect in some synopses. (There is "way", but it is hardly relevant). Rating 8/10.
