A beautiful and sensitive film that brings home the uselessness and cruelty of wars regardless of the supposed reasons. The performance of Cage and Cruz was quite impressive, but it is the older Greek characters who receive the highest praise. Irene Papas is as beautiful as ever! Although some scenes seem a bit long at times, this film will be an Oscar contender.
