One would have expected that Hitchcock's return to the main studio cinema would be mistaken on the side of disciplined caution. Surely few expected their most rampant and unbridled movie, a merry mix of vicious black comedy, thrilling suspense, mocking manipulation and amazing flights of fantasy. But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS IN A TRAIN. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is the way in which Bruno's transgression interrupts the world of the film. Much has been done about the masterly transverse motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress that Guy is making of his life and, therefore, the society he represents or is eager to join. Guy is the American archetype, the working-class boy who became good, moved in influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome. Bruno is his destructive, gay, decadent, "European" opposite (he lives from his father, in a Big House, and simply relaxes dreaming of a murder). Bruno's life is of repetition, circularity, while Guy moves forward. Bruno's achievement is to move Guy to his kingdom (represented by the merry-go-round) and force him to transgress (violating the law, the hope of murder). <br /> <br /> Bruno is literally a struggle patriarchy. All the authority figures in the film are criticized: Bruno's father, a man whose brutality we glimpse, but the real horror that is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings) is that an energy must emerge incredibly intense negative. from somewhere); The incredibly Machiavellian father of Anna; the insensitive judge who does not think about having lunch after an execution; The tennis commentator whose deceptively authoritative comments are always wrong. Far from being the father of legend, Hitch, as Robin Wood perceived, is deeply hostile to parents and patriarchy. <br /> <br /> Bruno's transgression makes the world upside down. This is the most surreal movie of Hitch. Whenever Guy is in his plot, he is filmed directly, with conventionally romantic music. But every time Bruno intrudes, the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque, strange, much more fun. This is Hitch's first truly American film, which delights with the primitive detritus of the Americana. Adult men prick the balloons of young children, or try to pull merry-go-rounds. Distinguished mathematics teachers sing about goats on trains. The matrons of the society of the third age are strangled in elegant evenings. Washington was filmed as a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a disturbing Dali painting. There is one of the best and funniest scenes of all the cinema when we see a Bruno motionless and smiling in a sea of ​​heads in a tennis match, an image worthy of Magritte. Just look at any scene with Bruno in it, and watch it derail the weird. <br /> <br /> Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations: check all those balloons (Hitch had obviously seen THE THIRD MAN), as well as in more serious environments: Washington will never look the same again. STRANGERS is also, in spite of VERTIGO, the most overtly sexual film of Hitch, as well as the phalluses, the sustained homoerotism, the remarkable game with the horses 'mounted'; The prank joke when Hitch's daughter spills powder on the policeman. <br /> <br /> And yet, Hitch does not skimp on the old suspense. In the very appropriate endeavor to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place. Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch makes a great stir in identifying the audience, and wants Bruno to be murdered. There is a hilariously painful sequence in which Bruno loses the lighter with which he tries to knock Guy down. The panting of tension and the sighs of relief from the audience that I was part of in support of a demented killer is intrinsically funny, a little disturbing and very revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success. And Hitch mixes it with insensible joy: listen to the mocking music and the exaggerated compositions, and let yourself be carried away by everything so seriously. <br /> <br /> STRANGERS is one of the five best films of Hitch, and therefore one of the best Things in the cinema. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can not believe that it was not written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful little devil, who defends her brazen father while making fun of Guy. The end of the fairgrounds is an extraordinary and dizzying fusion of exciting and tense piece, black comedy and symbolic site. If Bruno's last words condemn him to hell (in accordance with the Catholic precepts that Hitch must embody: compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to the degradation of Guy's service.
