During World War II, two Belarussian soldiers (Russian soviets) try to avoid being captured by the Nazis, while they cross snowy ground in search of food and security. If you do not like "foreign" films in black and white, you can still enjoy "Voskhozhdeniye" (retiled in English "The Ascent"). Larisa Shepitko, director, takes an extraordinary step to the film, despite being a work largely introspective. His untimely death, in a car accident, made this latest film by Mrs. Shepitko, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> After the opening mission is declared, there does not seem to be much that can happen in the snowy forest, but Shepitko and a changing configuration make it unexpectedly exciting. Leaders Vladimir Gostyukhin (as the spiritually wounded "Rybak") and Boris Plotnikov (as the physically injured "Sotnikov") avoid being crushed by the increasing symbolism. His allegorical representations, under the sharp direction of Shepitko, provide a memorable and thought provoking family history. <br /> <br /> ******** Voskhozhdeniye (4/2/77) Larisa Shepitko ~ Vladimir Gostyukhin, Boris Plotnikov, Lyudmila Polyakova, Anatoli Solonitsyn
