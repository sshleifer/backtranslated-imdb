The film Night Crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of East Germans during the period 1961-89. I lived in West Berlin for most of 1967 and traveled through The Wall to East Berlin weekly. Why? The excitement, crossing a border into a country ruled by the Soviets, experiencing the smells and the sensation of East Germany, which is why Night Crossing is excellent, captures that feeling and is exciting. I was arrested by the Vopos at Checkpoint Charlie and accosted by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses that I think was Stasi. When I see the film I can smell cheap diesel and cooking oil, I can see the obsolete vehicles, the gray clothes that the public wore and the tarnished products in the shop windows. It brings back memories of realizing how lucky I was to live in a free country. In 1988, I traveled the DDR from east to west, from north to south. East Germany had changed little since 1967. The Trabantes, which were constantly breaking, remained the main means of private motorized transport, the stores still did not offer much to tempt me, uniforms remained a common place, but people, people common, he was open and pleasant once he had gained his trust. Watch Night Crossing, it's as close to the truth as any movie you'll see in divided Germany, even closer than two other favorites: The spy who came from the cold and the funeral in Berlin.
