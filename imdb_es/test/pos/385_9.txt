In Strangers On A Train, it's obvious from the start that playboy villain Robert Walker has chosen Farley Granger as an unwitting accomplice to a pair of murders. Granger is a semi-public figure, he's a professional tennis player, but not a particularly high one. However, high enough that he knows that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman. <br /> <br /> Then, when they meet as complete Strangers on a train one afternoon, Walker knows enough. that Granger will be at least sufficiently intrigued with the possibility that if the two, complete strangers, committed homicides at parties, the other would be summoned for his death. Although Granger rejects the idea, one of the beautiful things about this film is that it can be seen in the performance that Granger could submit to temptation. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Walker kills Laura Elliot. Like Granger's wife, who had twice been with him and even got pregnant with another man, he waits for Granger to kill Walker's father in turn so that Walker can inherit his estate. Today, Walker would be called a fiduciary baby and quite malevolent. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role, ironically in his last full movie. Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished. Hitchcock is not that bad for Farley Granger either. <br /> <br /> Of course, when Granger refuses to commit homicides on people who never did anything to him, the tension. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by an excellent edition, first in the tennis match in which Granger has to end the match and stop Walker before he presents evidence condemning Granger at the crime scene. And also in that final climax with a fight in a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger. <br /> <br /> Strangers in a train is the best thing about Hitchcock, you should not miss it and it should be necessary to watch it when the film studio study classes.
