I just watched this movie on TV and it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I had just planned to watch it while working, however, I ended up watching the whole movie without doing the work because it was so good! <br /> <br /> The actors are not very well known, but history makes up for it. The fact that the actors are less well-known only makes it more credible that events can occur. I did not feel an inclination towards a character, since I do not judge the types of characters, since I had never seen any of the actors in a movie before, which made it even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I would recommend seeing it. that.
