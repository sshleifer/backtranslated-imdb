The subject of this film is potentially depressing: a man in his thirties, without work, with little education, three children from a failed relationship, living in his parents' house, but with the dream of directing films. But within half an hour of the film, you realize that Mark Borchardt has an inexhaustible source of unity and ambition; it's just that everything is channeled towards his need to direct films, and nothing else will make him happy. The movie jumps across the emotional spectrum, but in the end you feel happy, because you just met some wonderful people. Go see this, you'll end up wanting it to be longer.
