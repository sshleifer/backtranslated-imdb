A fabulous movie, which I've seen several times since I bought the video just four days ago. Yes, I'm a fan of Colin Firth and Colin was his talented, natural and magnificent habitual self. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Nimi's 7-year-old son) was very special and very natural to watch. They were fun together and also touched the strings of my heart. The scenes that I liked the most were Sammy and Matt sitting on the wall chatting and Matt then fell off the wall in a hilarious way (I will not reveal the content of their discussion so as not to spoil the plot). Also very hilarious was Sammy interrogating Matt about sex. Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene and made what could be an uncomfortable subject between an adult and a child so natural. The words and the face of Colins at the end of that scene were so charming and they said it all! only bright. The credit, of course, must also go to Fissy Roberts for his charming interpretation of Sammy. He played a childish character so adorable and cheeky. The two actors were simply perfect together. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Nimi) was perfectly balanced and I could not agree more that the chemistry between them was wonderful to see, showing love, tension and of course passion. It was exciting to see how their delicate romance blossomed, also showing how their social and cultural divisions affected their relationship and it was good to see how Colin and Nia sensitively portrayed Matt and Nimi discovering, accepting and overcoming these differences. He kept me fixed on the television and I was right until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Colins' portrayal of Matt's vulnerable and youthful side was also perfectly represented, so much so, that I found it hard to see when Matt was so petty and childish with Sammy because he (Matt) felt that Sammy he was intruding on his relationship / romance with Sams Mother Nimi. One could not help but feel very disappointed, angry and frustrated with Matt for treating Sammy in this way and this, in turn, threatened to spoil Matts' special relationship with Sammy and Nimi. The special talent of Colins to "get inside the head of a character" and show the audience the different sides of a character, was very evident here and pure magic to see. I should also mention that Colin also has a good relationship with young actors (see also 'My life so far', a wonderful movie that should not be missed). <br /> <br /> I also loved the relationship between Matthew and his wife Jenny, both were excellent in showing the public the dark side and the tensions within their marriage and that not all "happy marriages" are what they seem from outside. <br /> <br /> I must not forget to mention the reverend that I found very funny, in a serious way! In addition, Nimi's mother and family were very funny while expressing the importance of Nimi's culture and its situation. <br /> <br /> The bad, I really can not find an inconvenience, but being objective about the film and giving credibility to my review, the only negative comment I would make is that the writers did not explain in enough detail why Matt was He collapsed in the car, there was only a vague suggestion, from Nimi, that something was wrong with his heart. However, this did not stop me from enjoying the movie, far from it. I just needed to rewind the tape a little for a second shot. <br /> <br /> I felt that this movie had it all, entertaining, stimulating and I loved the rich colors and the sunny landscape. The movie warmed the cold winters and made me smile :-)) All the essential elements were there, laughter, love, tension, sadness, anger, drama and a warm feeling. good factor, with, yes, a lot of those delicious moments of Colin Firth, including a Colin soaked in a "wet shirt scene", that can not be missed by any fan, what more could a girl want ;-) ) <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie, especially to any Colin Firth Fans ;-)
