Chucky is back, but this time it's not scary (a lot), but it's fun! <br /> <br /> When Chucky comes back to life (on the wrist, of course) for his old trailer girlfriend, Tiffany, he quickly kills her and also transforms her into a doll. Tiffany and Chucky are now in the case of two high school graduates - eekkk! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie, it's very funny. It's scary, funny, weird, crazy and stupid all in one! <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10.
