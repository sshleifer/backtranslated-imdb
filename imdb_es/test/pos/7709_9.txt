Black cinema and anime ... great! This was one of the highlights of Animatrix's surprisingly creative short films. This was one of my favorites, if not my favorite (I also loved World Record). Basically, it is a reference to those detective stories and movies of the classic black cinema of the 1940s, except that it is animated and involves the Matrix. But by being animated, he is able to bring the extreme angles of the camera, the detective lifestyle, the shadows and everything that makes black movies to a whole new level. The fatal woman? Trinity. The detective in this story seems to be living in the 40s in his mind but stuck in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black enters his office. . <br /> <br /> My note: 9/10
