I also saw this film in a film festival, but unlike the previous poster, I found it interesting and original. In a sea of ​​terrible characteristics, the shorts are often twice as bad for small budgets and bad performance, however, A.W.O.L is a small and tense thriller that goes back to "The Outer Limits". The performances are solid, not what you would otherwise expect from Morse or McGinley, and the direction is clear and in the money. Personally, I find it difficult to reconcile the comments of the previous poster with the movie I saw. A. W.O.L is written quite rightly by Shane Black, who, as is often the case, plays with the genre and pays homage to the sensitivity of the stories while winking at the audience and never taking himself too seriously. In general, A.W.O.L proves to be an extremely well executed and fun movie.
