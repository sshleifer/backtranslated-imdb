Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many ruthless CGI movies that are being made. Pastel and pastel pencil backgrounds were a surprise after Sen to Chihiro not Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) and Hauru no Ugoku Shiro (Howl's Moving Castle) were so similar stylistically. The style worked well for the film and it did exceptionally well. The time and effort to animate this are greatly appreciated, as it gives the characters much more life, detail and care that makes the film look much better. There are several great scenes throughout the film that have a lot of movement and action. The best thing for me is to be a scene in which the sisters of Ponyo transform into huge waves like fish while she runs over them. The story is simple but quite well written and represented. The plot remained focused on the relationships of the characters and although it was not played as well as Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro) is still great. I felt that each character had an adequate amount of screen time, unlike Spirited Away, which was so full of distinctive characters that it could have been extended in a complete series (The Radish Spirit.) There was another full movie right there!) My only Real problem with the movie was the end. The way it is written in the English version at least makes it look like there is going to be a big test for S≈çsuke, who turns out to be the only one who promises to mother Ponyos that he will love Ponyo. Although paying more attention to this leads me to think that the translation may not be as accurate as the real meaning in the sense that the test is the promise and that deep down really means it. However, the movie seemed to end abruptly. Apart from that, the movie was great and I highly recommend it.
