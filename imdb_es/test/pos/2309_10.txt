Especially when looking at the amount of garbage that has been made on DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Torn is classic with its quills; Rob Schneider, although hilariously annoying as the overcompensating Ensign; Bruce Dern makes a great "villain". The entire cast seems to be having an explosion, and it is not at the expense of the audience. If you like just a funny comedy and you do not care much about the meaning, you could fall in love with it.
