My partner and I had never heard of this movie and decided to give it a try by choosing the title of a list of movies on cable without knowing a single thing about it. When it opened and revealed the cast, we thought, well, how bad can it be? - Kathy Bates, Jonathan Pryce, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Akroyd and more. As the story unfolds, we were increasingly surprised by our selection, and the movie soon made us laugh out loud. This is not a "great" movie, but it is one of those rare movies that has a great combination of memorable characters taken through "truth is stranger than fiction", surreal events that I could not help loving. I had no problem in "suspending my disbelief" in some of the craziest story elements because the intentions of the filmmakers are so affectionate that they still make fun of everyone involved. As others have said in IMDb, this is a comfort movie and I would not be surprised if it became a cult classic either.
