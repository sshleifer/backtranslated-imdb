If you have ever looked after children in a house you did not know, or if you saw the original and enjoyed it, then this will be a good option. Ignoring the reviews and what was published here, I went ahead and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me when I was a teenager. This movie (of course) has changed part of the original story to relate it to the teenagers of today, as the nanny is in trouble for reading the minutes of her cell phone and has to take on a nanny job to pay her bill. However, it adheres quite well to the original story line. If you can relate to the nanny, do not know the house and it is common for cracks to appear, it is quite suspense. When the murderer is shown, it is very scary and you find yourself yelling at the girl that "EXIT THE HOUSE". If you have never looked after children or been in a situation like this, then you probably will not be able to relate and you will not like it. It's about understanding your fear.
