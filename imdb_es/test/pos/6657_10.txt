I just watched the DVD and I loved it. In particular, I thought the director and Jude and Nicole did an amazing job with the kiss between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I've seen in a movie. I thought it was crucial to set the tone for the rest of the movie; He managed to make it believable that Inman and Ada walked / waited, respectively, for each other during all that time without actually having a relationship. I thought that the film achieved this crucial point of the plot much better than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will be quick to name other movie kisses that are the best, but this is for me! Jude and Nicole had shown incredible chemistry in the few scenes they had together.
