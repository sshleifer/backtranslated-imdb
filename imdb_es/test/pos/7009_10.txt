I am 15 years old, usually not children of my age I usually watch these old classic movies But this is one of my favorites. I was totally addicted after seeing him for the first time. It's really good if you think about technology and movies at that time, the music is great, the story is good, the choreography is great, you have to see it. I do not know why there is a prequel to this movie. Not many people like this movie, but I love classic love movies, they are much better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and make you start dancing. The music is absolutely attractive and beautiful. I have not seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (prequel), the prequel should have starred the original actors, that's what I hate about the prequels, they ruin the original. Nobody wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people will agree that for a movie, the original, the sequel and the third are enough. Beyond that, people will not bother to see it. Who remembers the film about St Benard Beethoven? I think there are 5 movies in total.
