Ghilli is Vijay's best film and one of the greatest hits of his career ... Since he had not seen the Telegu movie, he could enjoy this movie even more. The story is about a girl who wants to escape from the clutches of a local Goon who wants to get married by force. As he is a bully, no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay, who had come to play a Kabaddi match there, sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the film is how Vijay helps her and how the girl finally escapes the clutches of the thug's and thug's political thugs. The film has much of the edge of the suspense moments of the seat and will keep the viewer busy until the end. Vijay is, as always, very good in the role of the kabaddi player. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarthi, the vijay group of friends, have all done their job competently. A special mention must be made about the villain of the movie Prakashraj. The character of the villain has been recorded correctly and prakashraj has portrayed it very well. Surprisingly, for the first time, I felt sympathy for the villain at the end. The dialogue "Hello Chellam" has really reached the masses. The vidyasagar music is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage everywhere. Dharani should be credited with such a nice masala movie that he will enjoy not only from Vijay fans but also from the general audience of Tamil movies. all over the world.
