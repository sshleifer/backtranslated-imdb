For years I have remembered the song "ONLY ONE COUPLE IN A CASTLE" ("No. Twenty square moonbeams, only one couple in the castle in the air"). I could not find the song, but I remembered it had to do with cartoon insects. I located a reference to the movie on the web. I had seen the movie when I was only 9 years old at the Ligonier PA theater. I was pleased to discover that I had Kenny Gardner the singer with Guy Lombaro (I'm a Lombardo fan). And then, to see that it was produced by Fleisher Bros. who made another very good cartoon feature of "The Travels of Gullivar" (also remembered fondly). Also the songs were associated with Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser who are among the best. No wonder he remembered the movie, the song and the colorful animation. As a full-length musical, this is a film that should be remembered as one of the best musicals of the early times. Now that I remember it, it's possible that the plot has not been shaking, but it was very well presented and makes it an easy-to-see and charming film.
