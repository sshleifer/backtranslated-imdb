Very good political thriller about the consequences of terrorism and the use of political torture to achieve the objectives of one of them to expel the terrorists. <br /> <br /> The story is interrelated where two families are affected by terrorist events. <Br /> <br /> This is one of Meryl Streep's best roles in years. She plays a cold, calculating and astute director of the CIA that allows these things to continue. She is out of the George Bush-Dick Cheney school of handling the war against terrorism. If her part had been expanded, Miss Streep would undoubtedly have been chosen for a prize at the time of the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really can not take what is happening. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who really has a heart and costs his life in this well-directed and fine-paced movie. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin appears briefly on the part of an intriguing senator. Mr. Arkin seems to improve with age.
