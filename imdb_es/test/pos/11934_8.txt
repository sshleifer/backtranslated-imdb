The first time I saw this movie was a year and a half ago and I loved it, I decided to get the DVD last year for my birthday. It has the right amount of suspense, action and drama. This film is about the high school called The Regis School and is full of rebellious children, in which a child William Tepper (Sean Astin) has difficulty adapting due to previous rejections from other schools because they could not control his rebellious act and now at the Regis School they commit more acts. of a rebellion there the school is taken by terrorists on any given day and that is the real reason because the father of the leader Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff) has been sent to prison, and the leader will do anything, even kill the students, put bombs and to recover his father. <br /> <br /> Along with William Tepper, are his rebellious friends at the Regis School, one in particular is Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) in which this man has a troubled past of living in a mafia family and being sent o The Regis School for hating their father for who he is and with whom he must now deal with these terrorists who take charge of the school, so that William, Joey and his friends must unite to prevent these terrorists from committing violent acts and dangerous tactics. /> <br /> This movie was really amazing and I think people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say "Die Hard" and although I have to agree with them, they should recognize them. that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller, I'm sure my heart was beating because the students are my age and I would be afraid to face terrorists like these if they took over our school ... But in general, this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and if you had the decision to rent it or buy it ... I WOULD BUY IT! I recommend it with a lot of publicity! 8/10
