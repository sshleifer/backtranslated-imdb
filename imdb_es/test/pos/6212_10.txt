Supercarrier was my favorite movie in the last part of the 80s when it came out. My dad recorded it for me and I watched it all the time until my stepmother recorded Oprah about it and my heart broke. I would love to know if I can get it or from where. I've been looking for it. I think they even came out with a Supercarrier 2. It was not as good as the first, but I would like to have them all if I could find them. I do not think @ that everything was a bad movie. It was a very interesting movie with a lot of action, but it had a love story plot. The actors / actresses in the movie were great. It also helped me to understand that this is not just a world of men, but it is also a world of women and many women can do the same things, if not more than a man can do, and women also deserve a lot of respect. for their duties.
