The plot begins interesting, however, towards the end too many die in a short time, turning the suspense mystery aspect of history into a massacre. <br /> <br /> The only highlights were Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who once again were his excellent self. Good try with a last inappropriate third, although a good ending.
