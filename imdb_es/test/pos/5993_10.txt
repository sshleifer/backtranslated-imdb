One of the two best films of the year. A well filmed film, well written, well organized with an outstanding cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) had great chemistry before the film and its friendship were shown in their performances. Theresa Lee plays her comic role well (although it looks a lot like a female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be a Chinese born abroad surrounded by native HKers), and I found myself cheering for the innovative explosive scenes, something I have not fact. from 1. the fans took over alt.asian-movies and 2. John woo's Hardboiled. Surely the end was expected, but I feel better encouraging the police than a group of young gang members. Very nice.
