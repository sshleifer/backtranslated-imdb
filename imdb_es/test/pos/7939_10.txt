I saw this movie with a live performance by the Buffalo Philharmonic, and the music was one of the two things that definitely made the experience; in particular, the song after the battle in which the woman is looking for her husband was simply devastating. The other thing that caught my attention was the battle on the ice itself, a bit of strategy that the creators of _King Arthur_ started in 2004. Also, the battle continues forever (half an hour?), Painfully long. I can not think of another propaganda movie that makes the war look less glamorous or rewarding. I am surprised that Stalin liked this movie so well; I would not like to go out and fight after seeing him.
