I started watching this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that the main character is in a wheelchair is something that is missing on television, especially for children's programs. My five-year-old nephew (like most children) only looked at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of disability, but after seeing Pelswick, it seemed that this was normal for him. Whenever I saw a wheelchair, it simply said "I like Pelswick" and followed what I was doing originally. And YES, the animation is a bit coarse, but if you can stand watching the first season of the Simpsons, then this is not so bad. The "genius" is actually an angel who is there to help Pelswick learn life lessons. He CAN NOT walk, someone else said he could walk part of the time, I've seen all the episodes and he never remembered, he's a paraplegic who does not feel under his armpits (he mentions it in an episode). As for humor, if you can get a copy of the episode of "Ntalented", in which bands of guys come together, you'll love this show instantly.
