Meatballs make their way into conversations, like no other movie. Especially during the summer. Whether it's the song about the CITs (Counselors In Training) or the cuts, the inspiring Rudy the Rabbit or the speech of Just Just There Matter ... it appears! Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where he'll wake up later? An excellent snapshot of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of people who understand that the non-PC is really fun, no matter who you are! Wheels and Spaz are favorites, as is the hot dog eating contest with the famous "what ... no mustard?" Oh, how many times have I repeated that line and been the only one laughing! Thanks to the writers, actors and directors! Applause, applause!
