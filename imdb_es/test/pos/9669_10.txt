Ignore the comment before mine. The show is a comic genius, the most underrated spectacle in history. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, flashbacks are fun, who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story, they make me laugh so much that it hurts and is not that the idea of ​​a good comedy show? People who think this is not funny have no sense of humor. Who cares if they are random, is a t.v. Show, you can do whatever you want with it and people say it's not realistic, it's not a cartoon either, it's animated. Reason 2, jokes are generally funny, Seth McFarlane and the other writers are incredibly funny, everything from Star Wars references to mocking celebrities, I love them all. And in Reason 3, the story lines are simply bright and fun, set all the jokes with their crazy and extravagant nature, but even more fun. <br /> <br /> I took this one night on BBC2 and I never came back, I have 7 seasons, plus the type of movie (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have several t-shirts, posters and my collection keeps growing. I had never received a collection of any television program before, but this was so much fun that I just had to get it all. <br /> <br /> Just watch season 3 and trust me, you'll be hooked for life, the funniest show ever created and I hope it never ends.
