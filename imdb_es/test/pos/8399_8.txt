I, having read and seen Gone With The Wind, found it very difficult not to compare this film with the original one. Although I thought that Scarlett, the novel, was excellent, the film did not fit. It was a completely different story. Of course, there will never be another Scarlett and Rhett besides Leigh and Gable, but the new actors did a good job, considering. I loved the way the book and film wrapped the story of Gon With the Wind, because after reading it I felt a wave of disappointment because it simply stopped and left the readers wondering what happened. Scarlett finishes the story very well, and Alexandra Ripley did very well in the book. I just want the movie to follow the story more, although it's great in itself.
