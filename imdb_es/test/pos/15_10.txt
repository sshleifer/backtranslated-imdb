Like others who have commented on the web ... I am a pilot of 130 in the Coast Guard. Having said that, and being the skeptic that I am, I went expecting the most exaggerated cheese factors. There was some cheese, but in general, not much ... and the movie was quite accurate. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer again today. After watching the movie yesterday, I realized that the trailer gives the impression that the movie is nothing more than a rescue after the scenes of rescue action. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The movie is really more a character / story than an action. The internal struggles that both Costner and Kutcher are facing ... Kutcher is revealed beyond the movie that Costner. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a little love story ... there are no surprises there. But for the most part, the film tells the story of two lives that come together, and after a while, help each other heal old wounds. <br /> <br /> As feminine as it sounds, Costner and, as much as I try not to like myself, Kutcher really works quite well together and complements very well in the movie. <br /> <br /> As the critics have said, you've seen it all before ... Top Gun, officer and a gentleman, etc. But what movie has not been remade a million times. <br /> <br /> I can remember that only one word was pronounced F ... and I can not remember any other language. <br /> <br /> The film lasts more than 2 hours, and for some, it may take a little longer towards the end. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, you can cry, but I can honestly say, it was worth the $ 4 that I paid. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie.
