One of the best! As a fanatic of the civil war, I was very satisfied with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives an extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. Seeing how this fabulous story unfolds in a moment never forgotten, the themes of love, passion, pain, shame, harmony and cruelty come to life. I was introduced to this series for the first time when I was in eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I would not have been interested in this civil war soap. To be honest, this story stole the hearts of everyone in my class, and this is just the first book. I bought the novel and studied the tastes and differences and it was incredible. Now I am 17 years old and I still enjoy the history, the characters, the theme and I remember the times of the civil war. As a film director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
