If you are looking for an original horror movie, this might be right for you. It's weird and, at times, it remains stupid, but it's such an attractive, good-sounding and original movie that never fails, except perhaps during the long climax. "Nightbreed" is a must-see for horror fans, or fanatics of the make-up of a monster movie. <br /> <br /> Boone (Craig Sheffer) has been dreaming of a city called Midian full of mutant creatures. In therapy, his psychiatrist, Dr. Decker (horror director David Cronenberg) came to the conclusion that Boone is a murderer, gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to turn himself in. After almost being killed, Boone ends up in the hospital. , where he meets a mental patient who also knows Midian and tells Boone where to go. Midian, located in a cemetery, is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that do not let in Boone. After escaping with only one unpleasant bite, Boone is shot to death by the police, who was taken to his location by Dr. Decker. But Boone is not dead. The bite makes him live, and he goes to Midian. Meanwhile, Boone's girlfriend, Lori (Anne Bobby), tries to find Boone and get to the bottom of this. When Dr. Decker also finds out about this place, chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> The plot seems long and complicated, but in reality it is not difficult to understand. The plot, among other things, makes this movie really interesting. The effects of makeup are amazing. The creatures look unique and amazing, and make this a very attractive movie. To add more appeal to the senses, we have a musical score by Danny Elfman, which is both exuberant and full of glitter, and fits the film like a glove. The shots in the movie are also set up very well. The cinematography is charming, and the film creates an atmosphere that never breaks. Even the acting is good, with the biggest surprise that is the director David Cronenberg who offers an excellent and threatening performance as the man who, for one reason or another, wants to see Boone dead. It's strange that a horror movie is so well made. <br /> <br /> The problems with the movie ... well, there are some, but the positive aspects outweigh the negatives. The script presents the occasional jokes to try to add some humor, but almost all fall. The mutant creatures look great and are mostly well acted, but sometimes it feels as if they are presenting their amazing makeup for the camera. The worst part of the movie would have to be the climax. It takes so long, and it's just constant chaos. It is the part of the film that moves from the individual characters and the good shots, to the explosions of fire in each direction and the violence that happens with the characters that we do not know or are interested in. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is amazing to look at. It's a well-made horror movie, but even with that said, it has the occasional failure in the lines of the characters and a messy climax. However, this is one to review. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** of ****. 101 minutes R for strong violence and language.
