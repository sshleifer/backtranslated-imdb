Another great performance by Kiefer Sutherland. I love his films, because he always plays his role very well. For a low budget movie, this was done very well and kept me to the limit all the time. I love these types of movies, and I'm glad I caught them. I'm sure I'll buy the DVD or the tape. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
