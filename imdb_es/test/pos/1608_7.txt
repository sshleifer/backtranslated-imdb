In the film Death in Venice by Luchino Visconti, not only does the beauty of the surrounding world disintegrate, but in the search for beauty, Gustav von Aschenbach breaks down into a mere husk of man. To understand decadence, we must recognize the beauty that we love, it is best described and explained in a quote by Socrates that is found in Thomas Mann's version of Death in Venice, "Beauty alone, is beautiful and visible at the same time " The only aspect of the spiritual that we can perceive through our senses. Otherwise, if the divine, if the reason, virtue and truth speak to us through the senses. Should not we perish and be consumed by love? We see in the film that this same thing happens, the man is surrounded by a longing for beauty, which becomes a yearning for the child, Tadzio. Even though the sensible part of her mind tells her that the adoration of beauty can lead to sensuality and abandonment, it can not be contained. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to describe this as a beautiful movie; At first we see the extravagance of the room, and we give away a perfect summary of the life of the upper class of the turn of the century, all captured in the film to perfection by the director of photography Pasqualino De Santis. But Visconti does not take pleasure in the picturesque aspects of Venice. In contrast, the glorious and sensual artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these things are relegated to the past. The city that we know is incomparably beautiful and unique is nothing more than a place of leisure with a nosy hotel staff. The streets become exhausting labyrinths full of filthy dirt and putrefaction, the city decays to the step of the protagonist. Only through the flashbacks can we see why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man. The death of his daughter, and presumably his wife, along with the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Aschenbach has deep conversations about the meaning of beauty and who can create it; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is the alter ego of Aschenbach, and what Alfred says expresses the composer's own doubts and fears. The scene in which Aschenbach decides to leave Venice is immediately followed by an Alfred clip that tells him that he is weak, alienated and lacks feelings. In the end, we might come to the conclusion that these flashbacks are not reality at all. It is a deterioration of memory, instead of objective representations of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. We can say that these are deteriorated memories because even Aschenbach alludes to it, he declares, "reality distracts us and degrades us". and, following the scene in the office of the travel agency, we see Aschenbach confront Tadzio and his family and warn them: leave Venice, but just after the meeting, we see him again sitting with the employee and we realize that everything It was in his imagination. Scenes without dialogue framed by the moving music of Gustav Mahler. It allows the viewer's mind to wander as we watch Aschenbach's life and respectability decaying with the beauty that surrounds it. <br /> <br /> Slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the city is suffocating in filth. The crumbling city sets the stage for the attraction of the middle-aged man towards Tadzio, it is a romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed, even in fantasy. The beauty of this Polish child ignites a fire in him that, at first, makes him shine and then consumes him. The film concludes with Von Aschenbach sitting weakly in a beach chair watching Tadzio fight with his friend, we see the black tint of his hair that runs down his cheek and looks like blood stained, it is a vision of the moments of expiration of his life, although before his last breath. The final decay has happened, around it the city is dirty, and with it it has become what it detests. When Aschenbach dies, he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film, a man who had annoyed him. It was the search for beauty that began its decline, in the search for artistic beauty it could not feel its own disappearance and that of the city that surrounded it; His sensuality is carried away, while constantly kept under control by the presence of death and decay. It is these three themes that unite the condemned and death in Venice, beauty, death and decadence. These subjects are the art of Visconti, the beauty of his work is in the decadence of beauty itself. <br /> <br /> In this movie we are treated to the deliquescence of a great man. We see the honored composer Gustav von Aschenbach in the search for true and pure beauty, and it is in the search for this trait that it decomposes around him and leads him to a miserable and lonely death that observes the goal of his affection. I think that through these films, Visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful can not last. Decadence is intrinsic in the world around us, and when we are distracted, it can destroy the splendor. In Death in Venice, due to culture and the pursuit of beauty, everything is eliminated. Beauty and deliquescence are intertwined like thorns in the works of Visconti, both beautiful and destructive, it is these themes that define their art.
