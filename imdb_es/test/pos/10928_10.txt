I had the pleasure of watching this short film at the Miami Film Festival last Saturday and let me say that it surprised me. It was the only movie of the entire program that I loved. It is beautifully filmed, composed, edited, acted and written. After the screening, I saw the director at a party and asked him what he was doing next. He said he was working to find funding for the main version of the short film. He described some scenes to me. It sounded like the kind of first film that throws the big ones into the industry. If you ever have the opportunity to see this short film, I recommend you take it. Congratulations to the cross star.
