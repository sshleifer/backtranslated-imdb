Okay, I must admit that I like Peter Liapis and I admit that this is not the best Ghoulies sequel. I mean, yes, it had its flaws, as there are NO GHOULIES. But the two Ghoulies who came to earth were really funny, I think they were called Dark and Lite. I enjoyed the plot of the movie. And even at the end of the film, both Ghoulies hinted that there would be a sequel. Still waiting. hahaha Peter Liapis repeated his role as Jonathan Graves, this time playing a detective, how cute! Ghoulies IV may not be scary or suspense, but it's definitely fun. I thought about commenting on this movie and just saying, it's not that bad. It is worth seeing if the Ghoulies are not in it.
