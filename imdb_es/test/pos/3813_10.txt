Obviously, the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this is well done. <br /> <br /> He's incredibly cute, smart and dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with. <br /> <br /> Also, I want to see some of Nadia's other films, lots of YouTube comments about how hot she is. in this video. <br /> <br /> Of course there is some influence from Burton here, but I would not say that Brad is trying to cheat him. <br /> <br /> He is simply jumping and adding his talent to a Gender that I can appreciate. I like what he does and he does it well, no!
