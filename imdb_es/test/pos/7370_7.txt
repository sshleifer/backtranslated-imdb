This movie dethroned Dr. Giggles as the best horror movie I've seen. The plot was great, the twists of the plot were even better and the cast was great. It's hard to believe that they compiled the most unknown people 8 years ago and today they would be great names! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. 4 teenagers destroy their car in the middle of nowhere. They run into this camp and do what everyone in an accident must do. Light a fire and tell scary stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "The hook." Great starter Anyone in high school has heard variations of this story on graduation night. But they do it very well in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "The honeymoon." OK, this was not the best of the 4. It was pretty good and you can see some tits. Emphasis on the word "some". It's just your basic creature in the history of the forest. <br /> <br /> 3. "People can also lick". This is a warning story of what happens in internet chat rooms across the country. This segment should only be required for parents whose children have access to the Internet. <br /> <br /> 4. "The reliquary." Now this is the best story in the whole movie. A guy on a motorcycle breaks up and goes to this mute girl's house. Very good plot twist. <br /> <br /> The main plot, "The Campfire" has the biggest and best turn of the whole movie. I will not say what it is because I do not want to ruin it. I was never so surprised during a movie in my life! <br /> <br /> Argument: A + <br /> <br /> Acting: A + <br /> <br /> Writing: A + <br /> <Address: A + <br /> < br /> Music: A + <br /> <br /> In general: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone over 13 years of age, with the exception of "People Can Lame as well". Any parent whose child has access to the internet should see it with their child.
