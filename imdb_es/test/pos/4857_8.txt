I do not know if it was the intention of the directors to make sure that the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film. Maybe that's the romantic image that many Americans have of the moment when this film is developed, since it is in the middle of the war, Macy has returned from the war (her neighbor asks "Hey, is it true that you have a Fritz there? ? ") and is trying to continue with his life, but one day he receives a new pair of glasses (hence the name) and sees things clearly as the situation around him is revealed as one of rabid anti-Semitism, and Macy and Dern They could have gotten involved in it. It's funny how he's not Jewish either in this film but the accusation is made. It is also historically accurate, since the democratic unions of this time were wrapped in the flags of the United States and God. Macy is continually bothered to come to the "meeting". His presence brings unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Applying this time frame to today is a study in contrast. In 2005, it has undergone a total change, since the average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as its unifier support the Republican Party and see organized labor as part of leftist "anti-patriotic" America. <br /> <br /> A great photo to see, if you want to see the friendly, shy and docile, Macy (very well played by him) is caught in the carnage of race and hatred in the middle of the 40s in New York. <br /> <br /> loaded movie.
