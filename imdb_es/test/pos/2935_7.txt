Having ventured into the modeling industry (as a model), I see this show with a slightly different vision than most could. While I admit that ANTM can be a fun and entertaining show, as the seasons progress, it seems to continue to deviate from any reality. <br /> <br /> The show seems to be almost pure publicity for its participants, since none of the program's winners (or fellow contestants) have earned a name under the umbrella of the program. Maybe it's because the truth is that any girl with real potential to be a high fashion model should not have too much difficulty to report to the agencies (you can do it by email or postal mail if the distance prevents you from attending an open call). the agency), Sign with an agency and start a career as a model. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently neither does ANTM. And participating in a reality show seems to offer a smaller impulse in the modeling business, than to sign with a superior or decent agency (of which, anyway, only one competitor has a guarantee). <br /> <br /> However, The show can not hurt, it can certainly be fun and has a kind of magic that works particularly for teenage girls, as I discovered. Although, I must add, ANTM can become a bit tired and boring, after seeing several cycles, as it has become for me. And in addition to some unrealistic situations (each more outrageous than the last), the only other annoyance is the excessive use of "Tyra, Tyra, Tyra!" Tyra seems genuinely to want to guide these girls to success, but it is necessary that each of the temporary excavations of the models be covered by the images of Tyra; Practically for each panel and challenge include a story or scenario that "Tyra" experienced and exceeded? I think not. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, get some Tyra out, put it back in a bit more reality, and ANTM could be a 10 star show, instead of a 7.
