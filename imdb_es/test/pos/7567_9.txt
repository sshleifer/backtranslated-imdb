First of all, despite the low rating on this site, I saw something very valuable in this movie and I will gladly defend it. And no, I'm not connected to the crew in any way ... <br /> <br /> I found the Wind DVD by accident, and I had the strong feeling that it was not going to be at all As the package of described video. So I took a risk and I was pleasantly surprised by this strange and very different drama. I suppose that the DVD marketing and the summary were the work of MTI Home Video to hook a rental or a sale (the line of the label "Love comes in many forms" was changed to "Terror comes in many forms"). Of course, rents and sales of smaller films are highly dependent on capturing a person's attention, especially if they have never heard of the film before (a similar case occurred with the movie THE ITEM). That is probably what is working against this release, since fans of horror read the description of an "old wind" that carries with it "auguries of the apocalypse". It is easy to think that this is what this film is about, and that it will turn some university students of history into wild savages that go from a wave of murders. Therefore, at the time this review was sent, it is very likely that it is the reason for the lowest IMDb rating. I can understand that people get upset and think that they were deceived by that summary, seeing the apocalyptic introduction but then experiencing a dark drama. I can forgive the choice of marketing since I enjoyed The Wind and thought it was a refreshing change of pace with respect to the main Hollywood offerings, it's just that if you paid attention to the audience you were addressing, you could express a qualification highest. <br /> <br /> The "wind" in this film is basically a metaphor for society, and it is the story of four friends making bad decisions and how their lives quickly become desperate for self-preservation. After going too far in 'teaching a lesson' to one of their own, a death occurs and each person tries to save their own position. The manipulation between them becomes the norm, and in the end we see how self-preservation becomes their main motivation over good judgment. Civilized for wild, basically. This is very evident when noticing that the use of a knife, branches like sticks, fists and kicks are instruments of violence instead of weapons. These characters are, in some way, doing things wrong for the right reason just to be aware of the situation, since they have already taken things too far. While there are many implicit violent images, it is interesting to see that there is an absence of curse and nudity. <br /> <br /> What works in favor of The Wind are the "unknown" actors. The biggest stars were originally thought, but I think it works better when you have lesser-known and capable actors. In this way, you can enter the story without thinking sometimes "oh, that's Tom Cruise", for example, instead of a tormented person facing an extraordinary situation. Even unusual conversations (such as between Mic and Billy in a field and Mic facing Claire in their room) stay well and feel very natural in the strange universe of Fairview ... which has cozy houses, a forest and fields open I kept thinking about the tranquil landscapes that hide darker secrets in The Reflecting Skin, which director Michael Mongillo mentions as an inspiration in his commentary. <br /> <br /> The Wind manages to convey the messages without being a strong hand in this regard. <br /> <br /> Sure, if you watch carefully you'll see many symbols and dialogues that other directors just hit you in the head with I even understood the infamous "kiss scene" between Claire, John and Billy in the context of the story without surprise me that it happened. It still amazes me how some people (men, mainly) who complain about two men kissing in a scene obviously would have no problem if the scene were two girls kissing. Everything is handled very well here, and the additional visualizations will clear things up without making you moan and say "oh man, how did I miss THIS ...?" Things sink gradually and I appreciate that. Or you can also listen to the DVD comment to see more things revealed. <br /> <br /> For those of us who "understood" the intentions of this movie, The Wind is a breath of fresh air (no pun) In a time when most movies are made to ONLY make money and be heard taking other films out of their "box office competition" when it is mentioned in Entertainment Tonight or CNN. <br /> <br /> Years later, it's always the great little discoveries like The Wind that remain in my mind, not the blockbuster processed by stars. <br /> <br /> Beat the marketing strategy of MTI Home Video, and you may find this an attractive story. I highly recommend it to friends who are looking for unusual movies like this one.
