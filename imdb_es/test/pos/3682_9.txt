Man, I had my doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought, how good this can be, I've never heard of this ...! You know, it was one of those things, we gave it "20 minutes and we'll turn it off if it sucks" and we were locked in from the beginning. This is a very attractive and funny movie. It's peculiar, you know? I mean, you have a lounge singer, a killer (and a credible one), you have a farce, then Kathy Bates in all her acting splendor, Rupert Everett finally acting to his true potential, Dan Ackroyd, and a dwarf who will. make you laugh out loud I tell you, you will laugh / cry. <br /> <br /> Maybe I had a strange week, but I think this movie is at the level of fried green tomatoes. If you do not like that movie, maybe you do not like this, but I think it was a great movie. I went out and bought the DVD.
