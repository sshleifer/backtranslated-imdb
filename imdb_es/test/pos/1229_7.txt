In my opinion, the direction, editing, lighting and acting (except Franco) were very good. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by this movie. I did not expect much, in terms of camera angles, sound, etc., but in these areas the film was not bad at all. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I personally felt frustrated with both characters. because I wanted so much that these two characters came closer to each other. And I felt that the character of Travis (Franco) was not really affected or changed at the end after Terri killed himself. Although, this is probably due to the lack or inability of James Franco to express emotions (of any kind) very well in this film. I've seen some of Franco's other films, and for me he just can not make it when a scene requires real emotion or facial expressions. The only positive thing that contributes to the film is the possibility that more people see it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Rachel Miner did a picture of Terri well done, and it seems she has a bright future ahead of her. I really could see and feel the sadness and emptiness in his character, and that made me feel for her. I wish I could have seen more in Terri's life before the movie ended. <br /> <br /> For a short film, this movie was good, but in the end it leaves you wanting more. I wish it had been just a little more, to see the characters develop a little more. Despite that, I hope to see more movies of the director and the team in the future. :)
