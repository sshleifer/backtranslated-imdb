This French study of the late 50's about disaffected youth (in its first 20 years, actually, "grown up", but has not yet been established in the adult world) probably lost the mark by a mile in terms of being a description accurate of 1958 French young people (Do not virtually all youth films made by adults, those who do not, River's Edge comes to mind, are rare), but the director and writer Marcel Carne, of Les Enfants du Paradis, It is too. an exact human observer to NOT provide insightful insight into the essence of these characters. In a certain sense, the details are not important; You can change the details and configure this movie today and it would work just as well, but the loneliness, the insecurity and the superficial passion and the anger of the characters is well captured. The young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo have supporting roles, but the leaders Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy play the roles with subtlety and depth. There is also a good jazz score, which you can get on the CD JAZZ IN PARIS - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who have commented on the film, I really do not see the director and writer Carne judge these characters: it seems that it is an objective observer for me. Of course, these middle-class characters may look like spoiled people and they have nothing to complain about with some of the working-class viewers of the film, and I think Carne is certainly aware of this. For this American viewer (I saw a dubbed version, literally, I would say, of this one called THE CHEATERS), the film offers an interesting window to the France of the fifties. He is also self-consciously poetic (the scene on the ledge, saving the cat, is just one example of this) and has intellectual aspirations in that charming way that only French films can get away with it. In this way, melodramatic, superficial, this type of material would have been handled by an American studio production, and the sensationalist, moralistic, suggestive, this type of material would have been handled by American filmmakers of management / exploitation. I feel that Marcel Carne has captured the essence of that period between, for example, high school graduation and when, at 30 years of age, people have largely settled into a routine, whatever that routine may be. Those who are willing to watch the movie with an open mind and not shoot at the many easy goals it offers, must find a serious and valuable study of people from the age of twenty. And even if you do not want to do that, you can go to the other room while the movie is playing and just enjoy the good soundtrack, with the great jazz of the 50s and instrumental pop, including the wonderful original score of an American "Jazz at the Philharmonic group that includes Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz (written" goetz "in the credits), Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown.
