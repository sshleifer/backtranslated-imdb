I've been a big fan of the videos of Cky, Jackass and Viva La Bam for a long time. They have had a great career and I expected my laughter to end, eventually. But, he has not done it yet. This movie kept my mouth open all the time. I'm still laughing, randomly. I went to the theater with few expectations, thinking that it was not going to be better than the first one. Oh, how incredibly bad it was. <br /> <br /> There were many great moments in the movie. If you are apprehensive, you do not like the rough humor placed at random, or if you did not like the first movie, you probably will not like this. But, having said that, I almost wet my pants for laughing so hard. He had all kinds of different jokes, masochistic humor, toilet humor, vomiting, laughing, some big falls and massive damage in the whole cast. Ryan Dunn even marked the back of Bam with an image that will stay there for a long time. I'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is. <br /> <br /> No pain, no gain? Right? This movie has already done well, making theaters across the United States laugh so much that they will want it to last longer. I know I did it. This movie did not feel short at all, especially with the credits that continue the recording. But, I still wish it could have continued forever. Now, let's just wait and see when they release Jackass Number 3! In general, an excellent movie, if you can overcome male nudity and some disgusting images. Keep your children out of this movie. They do not need to see this, at least until they are older. Support the team and BUY THIS when it comes out on DVD! I know I will.
