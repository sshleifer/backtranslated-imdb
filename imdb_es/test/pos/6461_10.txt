This is a powerful film that seems not to have reappeared after the censorship period of Joe McCarthy. He influenced me as a Jewish teenager who had friends of various colors and whose father's family had suffered under the fascist regimes in Europe during the second quarter of the twentieth century. Unlike the later scam, "On The Waterfront," which seemed to take some of the same themes and twist them to fit the Hollywood political correctness of the moment, told his story directly and with respect for the characters and for the reality . It is reflected fictionally. It was an antidote to "Gone with the Wind", "The Birth of a Nation", "The Triumph of the Will" and many other glorifiers of hatred and violence. I would place it next to the recent German film (also practically hidden in the USA), "Rosenstrasse". <br /> <br /> I remember that the television version, also in black and white format, as well as the story, was blackened out of some seasons because the wife of the black hero appeared white. As a young civil rights worker, I had a conflict because, on the one hand, I opposed smoking cigarettes and, on the other, I opposed the boycott in Georgia of a sponsor of the television program, a major tobacco company (no longer memory). which - someone else?). <br /> <br /> I would love to find a CD of the movie or TV show so that my children see something that informed my opposition to racism universally (as opposed to just fighting against racism against Jews) and recognition of the inherent connection between racism and militarism.
