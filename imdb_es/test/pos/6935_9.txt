Just finished with the first part of Zombie Bloodbath in the amazing DVD of Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy by CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead is next. Now this left me a little disconcerted due to some holes in the plot and some confusing twists here and there, but it's a better movie on many levels. Director Todd Sheets really shows a great leap in style and talent between the two films. Again, this is not for people who want Horror films that are bright and Hollywood style, this is for people who like their bloody, raw and grainy zombies. As far as I could tell, the story was basically about two thieves who in 1945 tried to rob an elderly couple to discover that the couple is a member of a sect. One man is simply murdered and the other, the one in charge, basically becomes a scarecrow and is crucified, and they arrest him in the nearby field, still alive but dying. Cut to this day and a van full of kids from the university collapses near a farm. At the same time, a group of convicts escapes from a nearby jail. Both groups end up in the same house. The house was the one the elders put together to live and when one of the convicts knocks down the scarecrow and takes off his jacket, he causes the scarecrow to wake up and he in turn causes the members of the cult to return from death. Wow. And this is all in the first half hour. Another conspiracy is also taking place in the city where a couple of serial killers have taken some workers into a hostage of delicatessen. However, this really works, since the people trapped in the house eventually escape and end up in the same Deli. Most of the twists work quite well, but it is obvious that the film was too complex at some points for its own sake. Everything ends in a great confrontation with the remaining heroes finding a delivery truck or something full of jars of bacteria that eat meat. Of course, they throw it to the undead and cause a major meltdown and some heads to explode, and then we have a strange and provocative ending. First, let me say that, while it was not always easy to follow, I still had a great time with this movie. It was fun and the performance was pretty good for a low budget effort. It was obvious that Todd Sheets was really trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie movie, and in that sense, he has succeeded. It had better special effects than the first movie, great rhythm and good music and visual elements, plus there is a real plug of a shot from INSIDE of a mouth when a knife gets stuck in it. Care was taken here and it shows. The weakness lies in the scripts and in some of the laziest performances. Again, I recommend listening to the comment track. It was even better than the first and I learned a lot. How to discover that some of the scenes were filmed in the movie Super 8 to achieve an effect and that the film returned ruined from the lab and could use it. And they had already been editing the movie when they recovered it, so part of the confusion comes from some scenes that are not in the film. In addition, I learned that Todd Sheets really has a passion and love for making horror movies. Sample. The movie is a good example of cinema without a budget that could have used a new version, but it still shines with more style than most of the DV movies that I see. It's not as fun as the first movie, although technically it's a better movie. I admire Sheets as one of the true innovators and pioneers in the DV cinema area ... and this is a great addition to the zombie zombie genre!
