Goldie Hawn, in 1969, was best known for participating in television comedy shows, in particular, ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN, where she was the laughing young blonde. She made films before CACTUS FLOWER, the most notable being a feature of Walt Disney, THE ONLY AND ORIGINAL ORIGINAL BAND. But CACTUS FLOWER picked up her character from LAUGH-IN, and (due to a good script from IAL Diamond, Billy Wilder's second partner, based on a work by Abe Burrows), she was able to develop the television character so that the acting outside real. Developed As a result, Ms. Hawn won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969, and her career became future successes as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although other LAUGH-IN stars did well on television (Henry Gibson has a recurring role as judge at BOSTON LEGAL), only Goldie could have a career as a Bonifide movie star. <br /> <br /> In LAUGH- In Goldie's personality he would show a naivete that would be shameful. Every once in a while he would notice and laugh out loud, but sometimes he just did not see his mistake (example: Goldie introduced himself to variety show host Gary Moore in the 1950s, and they said, "Goldie, this is Mr. Gary Moore. "She shakes his hand and says (to her confusion)," I always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore! "). But as Toni Simmons is quite different. She is desperately in love with Dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), a successful dentist, who can never marry her. Julian has told him that his wife (with whom he had two children and a daughter) will never give him a divorce. So at the beginning of the movie, Toni tries to commit suicide with the gas in her kitchen. But she is rescued by her neighbor, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz), a wrestling playwright, who bursts into his apartment and turns off the gas. <br /> <br /> Toni is resigned to live, but she sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note, but Julian's receptionist / nurse / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) will not stop Julian's work schedule to pass him the phone when Igor calls. Instead, Julian finds the letter and runs to Toni's apartment, only to find her alive. When Igor supports his story that he tried to kill himself, Julian realizes the depth of his love and decides that he should marry such a woman. Unfortunately, Toni has swallowed Julian's lies and believes in his wife and children. You see, Julian does not have a wife and children. Since Toni is a firm believer that she can not marry a man who would lie to her, Julian is trapped in a branch of a weakened tree. <br /> <br /> Julian comes to solve it by having Stephanie pretend that she is Mrs. Winston. Stephanie is opposed to that at first, but alone, on her first free Saturday, she confronts Toni at the record store where Toni is. They talk, and Toni notices all the strengths of Stephanie's character and personality (and since Stephanie has her two nephews with her, Toni thinks they are Julian's children). Toni tells Julian that they have to see who is the man Stephanie is supposed to marry. So the lie starts spiraling for Julian, Stephanie and Toni. Soon, Stephanie receives a lover in the form of a friend of Julian and patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so sordid (Stephanie hates him) that Toni feels he is not worthy of Stephanie. <br /> <br /> And that's the way it is, with one complication (most caused by well-intentioned and ill-informed Toni) following another until the conclusion. The script is full of first class situations and a single line (example: Julian to reward Stephanie for lying about their marriage, buy two discs from Toni's store.) He has given Toni a mink horn, but she decides Send it to Stephanie with Julian's card Stephanie is very happy to have the mink, but does not say a word about the nature of the gift she received, when she thanked Matthau profusely, she says that she would like Horowitz to tell her Vladomir Horowitz. think that Horowitz is the name of the furrier!). <br /> <br /> Bergman must have enjoyed the filming, as several scenes show that earthly brightness that was a trademark for her in the movies of the 1940s. But it also resembled her successful film comedy of 1958, INDISCREET. There, Cary Grant lied to make sure the couple would focus on the romance of their relationship without having to think about marriage. When Grant's lie is revealed to Bergman, she decides for herself a lie to convince Grant that she was making him a cuckold. Here, instead of being the passive lover who believes that Matthau is telling the truth, Bergman tries to get Matthau out of his mess with little white lies, only to find one that leads to the other to complicate the lives of everyone. Bergman is seen as a good woman who becomes part of the problem, despite trying to be part of the solution. <br /> <br /> All potential customers have a good performance, particularly Bergman, all the thoroughness of the business at the beginning but the claim gradually. sexuality. Matthau is a delight, since a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that simply can not be set aside. The cast of cast, especially Weston as the evil and sexually harvey Harvey, and Vito Scotti as the ambassador of the United States who actually has the heart of Bergman. It was a clever comedy, and a very good way for Goldie Hawn's film career to go ahead.
