OKNO V PARIZH, a funny and scathing critique of Russian society and culture during the transition of communism, also shows the West from an unfavorable perspective. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (for example, the "window to the west of Peter the Great" by Peter the Great) find a magical portal that instantly transports them to Paris. Mamin's movie is truly hilarious, and "bizarre" enough to constantly keep even the moviegoer jaded on alert. The songs, dream sequences and fringes of the deliciously disgusting society of both cultures mix to create a memorable and meaningful film. Anyone who tries to understand the change in Russian cultural sentiments since the fall of the USSR should start here.
