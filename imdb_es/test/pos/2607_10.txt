During the War for the Independence of the South, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes its forces to defend local women and children against a Yankee invasion. <br /> <br /> In 1936, Hal Roach decided that it was time for his popular children OUR GANG to diversify into casual feature films. With the great success of Shirley Temple in two films of the Civil War in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was natural that Roach sought in that same direction his GANG. Although given a rather luxurious production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical success or box office. In the future, the small GANGsters will stick to short topics. <br /> <br /> Despite having been awarded the highest rating and the lead role, George ?? Spanky 'McFarland is competing in the first half of the movie with little Billie ?? Buckwheat 'Thomas. Here were two of the best young actors that have appeared in American films. With all the experience of the old and experienced professionals, these two gamin could steal scenes and hearts with the same courage. A constant joy, without a false note between them, provide the essential reason to watch today's movie. <br /> <br /> Phillips Holmes provides a quiet and gentlemanly performance as the adult protector of Spanky. Almost forgotten now, Holmes was a good actor who died too early, during World War II. Great Ralph Morgan is especially good as a sympathetic Union general: his scenes with Spanky are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Other OUR GANGers appear at the midpoint of the film, especially Carl ?? Alfalfa 'Switzer; He arrives at the war? Just before the battle, mother. Even the beautiful Rosina Lawrence (the gang teacher) shows up to play Holmes's beloved. <br /> <br /> Irving Pichel is particularly viscous when a cowardly deck of cards became Vengeful Captain Yankee. The clumsy Willie Best and the fighter Louise Beavers play the slaves of Miss Lawrence. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that there is racism in the film, something that is not unusual in Hollywood at that time, but that is almost completely missing in the original OUR GANG short series. <br /> <br /> The music fans of the 19th century will enjoy paying attention to the soundtrack, which is a long succession of old melodies.
