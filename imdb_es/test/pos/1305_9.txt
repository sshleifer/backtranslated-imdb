I saw this movie at a branch of the Duane Reed pharmacy in New York on vacation, and I thought it was a bit of silly fun. And, of course, the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words, but it turned out to be an action movie for children, and their parents as well. <br /> <br /> Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett, 10 years old) has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to the dismay of his father (Larry Miller). As a member of his school's orchestra, Ricky and his classmates fly to a concert ... and once again, Ricky's mind "takes off" and suspects that a criminal plot is taking place. <br /> <br /> Helped reluctantly by the best friend Sashi, who is a fan of hot sauce (what a strange plot device that was) and others try to solve the mystery. Oh, yes, and Ricky's skills 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience come in handy when you're asked to save the day in the exciting climax of the movie. It was good to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscos play parts in a family movie. And seeing the interviews on DVD, everyone seems to have had a lot of fun participating. <br /> <br /> I really liked Junior Pilot; Lovely performances and good character, fun and real plot; feeling of pleasure and pure stupidity. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an entertaining family movie, you could do much worse than buying it.
