This is a film that everyone living in Sweden should see. The film shows the political unrest that took place in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. It presents interviews with those who were condemned where those people have the first opportunity after the riots, to tell their side of the story and why they believe that the world can be a much better place to live and be a part of it. I react emotionally when I see this, because I feel so angry at the way these people were treated during the riots, but also after the riots. <br /> <br /> I hope that as many as possible can see this movie, as it really makes you think: is this possible? In Sweden, a democracy, in 2001?
