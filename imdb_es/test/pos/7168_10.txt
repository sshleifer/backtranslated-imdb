My first Mamin movie, I saw it at IFC a long time ago, and I LOVED it. It seemed absolutely artistic, original, fun and hilarious. Not one moment in the film disappointed me or bored me, and I laughed a lot or had a smile on my face. I want to say that this movie is really fun. But here's the problem: it's also very artistic and creative: if you do not know Yuri Mamin (probably, unfortunately, because many of his BIG movies are not available here) he has a very original style like no one else's, and for me, This is not my favorite movie (right now it's crazy ("Saideburns / Bakenbardy"). Also, I must say that, as a Russian, this movie is great because it really looks like the Russians are, and this is possible because for me it is a true Russian film, NOT a foreign film that tries to be American or tries to appeal, Mamin was not sold (and, since then, Gorko (1998) was as good or better than ever.) It is a true Russian-style film that emerged from communist social realism. <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, I think you have many chances to love Mamin's other films, in fact, I like some more than this one, I think this is his most accessible film A similar movie r is Fountain, which took place 6 years earlier during perestroika, has the same actor in the main role, and more of Mamin's regular clients whom you will recognize from Window to Paris; This one has a supernatural touch at the end, but it's mostly a realistic comedy, a great one. Viva Mamin, I hope that Criterion will connect all your movies some day, it is still working, and its catalog is great! Watch any of his movies if you can.
