Hong Kong, the 1920s. A young man of poor beginnings dreams of being a hero, and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's will. Help a servant to escape a ruthless businessman, whose thugs chase them, and terrorize the young man's uncle's noodle restaurant. The uncle turns out to be an old murderer of the reformed triad, who now helps the young man to master the martial arts. It is a complete style of Karate Kid with "wash the wok" instead of "wax, wax." The villain of kung fu is the ruthless son of a businessman, who has a characteristic scorpion style that looks good, although it is quite silly and surely completely unreal. <br /> <br /> But the story, which unfolds over time, has an epic feel. , good characterization, great kung fu and generally very entertaining. The young hero is very nice and is a good protagonist to encourage him. However, the dimension of romance remains undeveloped, which is a bit disappointing. Otherwise, a great movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10.
