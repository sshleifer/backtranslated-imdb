This special BRED EYE PAEDO-GEDDON was flooded with complaints (more on this later) when it aired in 2001 after a national debate over a possible "Sarah's law" following the kidnapping and murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne. In fact, programming was delayed while Phil Collins received legal advice after discovering that Chris Morris, the program's manufacturer, had tricked him into starting a campaign titled No Sense. <br /> <br /> If the truth told me that this program is probably more remembered for the controversy than for the content in very bad taste, but I confess that I laughed out loud. The issue focuses on pedophiles and how society treats them and their victims. Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous pedophile has been thrown into space and then confesses that an eight-year-old boy has been accidentally placed in the capsule along with the pedophile. Cue the scared cries of the child. Like I said, in very bad taste. <br /> <br /> Other highlights of the series include Dr. Fox who gives a scientific conference in which pedophiles share a nervous system identical to that of crabs ("Nobody knows , but it is a scientific fact ") Labor Deputy Barbara Follet gives a public warning about the equipment that pedophiles place on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warns viewers that pedophiles can send gas over the Internet , which makes young children susceptible to sexual predators, including a victim. and that he now has the sexuality of a sixty-year-old colonel. "Morris also shows a police officer in the children's protection squad a series of photos they want to know if they are classified as obscene, the photos included Barbie surrounded by an instrument Marriage and a composite photo with the head of a young man, the body of a dog and an erect penis that could only have belonged to John Holmes ... Hey, I never said that this show had good taste, right? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocrisy that surrounded it, where politicians, children's organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject.The show was in bad taste even though I laughed all the time, but it's a scathing satire.Perhaps critics should take a long hard look at the mirror, where a liberal elite allows the doomed pedophile slime to walk the streets of Great Britain to criticize before a single television program exacerbate tensions.
