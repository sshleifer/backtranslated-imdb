Barry Champlain is a radio talk show host in Dallas, whose unlimited ideas about a lot of social issues disturb and offend many of his listeners and interlocutors. Is Barry a media messiah in search of the truth, or a social mismatch to assault his audience? <br /> <br /> This is an article of intense and provocative character about a man without almost redeeming characteristics that at the same time seems to be in a very deep philosophy. Although it is co-written and directed by Stone, this is truly a Bogosian piece and offers an amazing and penetrating performance from which there is no escape. Barry is sometimes one of the most disgusting characters you can imagine, spitting a bilious misanthropy to everyone around him, especially those who care about him. But at the same time, he is also strangely empathetic, hypnotic, wise, even kind. Bogosian's hawk features are burned into the frame, with his green eyes constantly moving as if seeking a permanent response to some riddle. The film is, essentially, an angry and honest speech against all the fanaticism, injustice and banality in the world, culminating in a single rotating shot of three and a half minutes of Barry offering the final discourse of "hatred to everything" . , but the boy punch. The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Greene as the ex-wife and Baldwin as the boss. The enthusiastic photograph of Robert Richardson manages to make the unique radio studio look interesting and there is a tense score from Stewart Copeland, with a poignant coda featuring that endearing piece of phone music, The Penguin Telephone And Rubber Band Cafe Orchestra If you're not familiar with Bogosian, check out his incredible talent in this film, as his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, is someone who rarely appears in traditional media, simply because his writing is very clear. I find the variable of Stone's films; I do not care about his great successes, but when he is more orderly and objective, as with this one (or Salvador and Nixon), he is much more incisive and arrests. A great primal cry for an image, based on a Bogosian work, inspired by the real story of Alan Berg, a talk show host in Denver who was killed by neo-Nazis in 1984.
