I've probably seen the movie 4 or 5 times. Each time, I am increasingly impressed by how far the desire of a young heart can go, and the strength of Kai and Gertha to fight for what they believe. <br /> <br /> And the whole story is presented in such a way, they simply transfer you to the plot and before you know it, you're there. you can see ... yes, Kai is ... working hard in the mirror ... a little jump ... Gertha is fighting for her love ... and there is the Snow Queen ... <br / > <br /> It's just a wonderful mix of love, adventure, tension. <br /> <br /> it's brilliant 10 out of 10
