25 comedies had large-screen spin-offs. Most of these came in the 1970s. Here is a list of all: Are you being served, Blackadder, Bless this House, Lower, Dad Army, Father Dear Father, For the love of Ada, George and Mildred , The League of Knights, Love your neighbor, The Lovers, Man about the house, the nearest and beloved, no matter the quality, feel the width, on the buses (3), please, sir, porridge, humidity crescent, steptoe and son (2), that's his funeral, until death does the part (2), Up Pomeii (3), Whack-o, Whatever happened to the probable boys and Whoops Apocalypse. <br /> <br /> So there was a spin on the big screen of my favorite comedy, Dads Army. What the film focused on was when he enrolled the men. He showed the difficulties of getting a uniform and getting weapons. It was a great summary of the first Dads Army series. At the end of the film some German spies catch in the church. The Local Guard came dressed like other servers and had bayonets with them and defeated the Germans. The best thing about the film was when they showed a HG conference and a German one at the same time: German: central office on the phone, I would get 10,000 bombs, (MAIL TO THE GUARD OF THE HOUSE) GODFREY: Mrs. Mainwaring on the phone, you would get 1 / 2lb from Brussel Sprouts. <br /> <br /> This was probably the second best comedy comedy, surpassed only by Till Death us do Part (1969). It would have been better if, at the beginning of the film, it had already been formed, it was halfway through the war. Although it is still an excellent movie, a good one for the family.
