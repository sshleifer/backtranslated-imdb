The most vivid portrait of the rarity of a small town I've seen in a long time, and I'm not talking about Australian movies alone. This work seems to have been done "under the radar" and, in fact, it is a completely fascinating work, which has a worldliness almost never seen in the recent Aust. make films. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is quite slow and strange; it seems to wander from here to there, not very sure that it is a thriller or a 'movie for the head'. But the surprising aspect of Alex Frayne's film is his ruthless and iron-fisted leadership. He never hesitates, he is highly controlled, precise and absolutely sure of himself. The cinematography is one of the most artistic, beautiful and lyrical I've seen. The sound is psychological, the music increases the tension. <br /> <br /> In the third act, the story intensifies and the episodes collide and converge, do not try to put together the puzzle of the last 20 minutes. It is a bit implacable, but at that moment the film has a bit of trance, a kind of hypnosis, and they have sold you an enigma, which does not have a real answer.
