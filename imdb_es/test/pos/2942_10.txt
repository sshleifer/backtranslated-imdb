I saw this movie with my friends and we all loved it! It's so sweet and comforting, a real tug of tears! I kept thinking about the story days after watching the movie. It is such a beautiful story about the difficult things that all families go through, it is something that anyone can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will enjoy it very much. : D It's a real story about a real family that would attract anyone to the heart. Not to mention, beautiful scenery and fantastic performances. See, I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!
