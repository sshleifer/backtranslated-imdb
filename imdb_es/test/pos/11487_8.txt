It was sad that COMMITTED lasted only two weeks in the Dallas theaters. I thought that this movie had a lot going for it. The script was fun, full of subtle emotional changes, and had a good message. The performance was great. Everyone did an excellent job, especially with the subtleties of the script. Heather Graham not only has beautiful eyes, but also expressive eyes. For that matter, all the actors were attractive! I do not know why he did not do well in his theatrical premiere, apart from the studio, there did not seem to be much of a push behind him. But he deserved to do better, and I hope he does well on video. It is without doubt one of my favorites for the first half of 2000.
