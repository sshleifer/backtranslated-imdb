This is not especially well written. The songs are not memorable. The cast, however, expresses much to this situation of Martin and Lewis in the Navy. Both look very good as young sailors. They are credible. The scenes on the submarine show how narrow they must have been on those underwater missions in the 1950s and before. <br /> <br /> Many sailors in many scenes. Hundreds perhaps, in a large field of outdoor exercises, and again in a boxing field. <br /> <br /> You'll see James Dean in his scene. He stands out even though he is an extra here. In a scene in which Jerry walks down a busy street, we see something of his "almost accident" comedy that he would bring into play years later in The Patsy. <br /> <br /> Dean who gives boxing instructions to Jerry is a good work of comedy. to watch Jerry in the boxing ring shows his great energy that was his trademark in the late 40's and early 50's. Dean and Jerry dancing is a bit of a pleasure. It's not great, but it's better than most movies that do not dance. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you do not care about black and white. Good ending. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
