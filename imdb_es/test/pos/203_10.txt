I'm not surprised that this short (91 minute) black-and-white film that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called "ottepel" or "the thaw" has won so much love and admiration among film lovers. in the world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel as if they have been pushed ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the textbooks and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless love story destroyed by a ruthless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young girl. It is also the film about loyalty, memories, the ability to live when there seems to be nothing to live for; it is about forgiveness, and about hope. The film received (deservedly) the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as the winner of a special prize at Cannes for playing Veronika, the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world at the beginning of the film. After the separation with her beloved who was at the front, the loss of her family in the trip of the bomb and the marriage with the man she never loved and who only wished she had never existed, she went to the shadow of herself , and died inside. His long journey towards redemption, until finally accepting the death of his beloved and learning to live with her, is fascinating and heartbreaking and simply will not leave any spectator indifferent. <br /> <br /> For me, the film is very personal and loved because I was born and grew up in the city where their characters lived and were very happy at the beginning. I walked through the same streets, squares and bridges on the Moskva River. All the families in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one, but often more than one family member in a combat or in the concentration camp or in the ghetto or hunger, cold and diseases during the Second World War World and my family is no exception. My mother and my grandmother knew the horrors of war and never cured the pain of loss, not only of movies and books. "Cranes are Flying" speaks to me in a clear and honest way and touches me very deeply. It is a masterpiece of the creation of films, but it is part of my life: my past, my memory and my past.
