Walter Matthau is wonderful as the "philanderist" dentist, Dr. Julian Winston, whose frequent parents to the girlfriend Goldie provide evidence of the dangers of lying in textbooks. Toni Simmons, the touching headdress of Goldie Hawn, certainly deserved to win his Oscar. Ingrid Bergman's work as rigid nurse starch Stephanie is also poignant to see how she leaves her shell, slowly and nervously. This is a great movie to watch in the spring or at any time. It is very underestimated; I never knew until I found it in the video store, and what a find!
