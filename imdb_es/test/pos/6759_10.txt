There is a complete copy now available on the Internet Archive. Look at it or download it today. <br /> <br /> http://www.archive.org/details/The_Mascot_Complete <br /> <br /> One of the best animated shorts ever made. Starewicz is infinitely inventive and his techniques still amaze fans of animation 70 years later. We may have computer-generated techniques now, but all I had in 1934 was an imagination that would not accept a "no" for an answer. What I would like to see on the screen, created it. <br /> <br /> And I wanted to see some really strange things: every scrap piece imaginable is called for service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats ... it seems as if there was nothing that was out of bounds. <br /> <br /> A truly disturbing and even disturbing movie that should be seen by anyone who has even a passing interest in animation. This movie has to be seen to be believed!
