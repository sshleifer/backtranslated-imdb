I just watched a film that, for all rights, should have been a forage for a second-class MOW in all my life ... but I trust that the Irish will prevent it from being anything other than saccharine. The configuration of all but the SCREAMS "Here is a message about what is REALLY important in life", but the execution was very thorough in "Let's see what we can do, here". <br /> <br /> Help has two fantastic actors in the lead: James McAvoy (as Rory) and Stephen Robertson (as Michael). While Rory presents himself as the close saint, no matter the language and attitude, he is the "life force" in this article and it could have been unbearable in his "affectionate" attitude. Ultimately, McAvoy keeps him active enough as to keep it from being too sweet. But the revelation is of Stephen Robertson like Michael. Since Leonardo Di Caprio in "... Gilbert Grape" no one has captured so perfectly a person with an affliction that I began to believe that he really was an actor with cerebral palsy. And his eyes ... My God, he can tear you with them. <br /> <br /> This movie is, paraphrasing Rory, f **** n 'amazing. Go see it. Take a box of Kleenex and enjoy each well-deserved tear ... and laugh.
