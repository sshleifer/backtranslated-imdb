While driving on a highway to his beloved Betty-Ann's wedding, Adam (Eric Jungmann) is surprised by his former classmate Harley (Justin Urich) in the backseat of his car. Adam has been interrupted with the inconvenience and the stupid Harley because of Betty-Ann. Throughout his road trip, Harley makes fun of some hicks in a bar and then his car is chased by a giant monster on the road. After some incidents, they give a push to the hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks) and before the trio is terrified by a monster that drives the monster truck. <br /> <br /> Despite having one of the most annoying characters. I've ever seen a horror movie, the irritating Harley, "Monster Man" is a surprisingly good horror comedy. The story is a collection of clich√©s, beginning as "Joy Ride" or "Duel"; then it becomes one of the innumerable scams of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; There is a surprising twist, which ends with a hook for a sequel. There are funny scenes, Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy and this movie really entertains. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Monster Man"
