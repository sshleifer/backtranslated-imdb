All I can say is that every time I see CONRACK, dir. Martin Ritt, DP. John Alonzo, I feel a great sense of inspiration and enlightenment in what the power of cinema is possible in such a simple movie. <br /> <br /> The film Conrack takes place in 1969. It is based on a true story. . It's a story about a white man (Jon Voight) who teaches a group of young black children how amazing the world is outside their little island in South Carolina. <br /> <br /> History places the work of a teacher as a noble Cause to change the lives of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
