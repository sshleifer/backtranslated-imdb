Nemesis Game is an amazing movie full of riddles, death, mystery and philosophy. In its simplest sense, the film tries to find answers and what happens when it has finally found them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it becomes more convincing. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, however, Sarah is so close to understanding everything. What would you do if they offered you the chance to finally understand the chaos of life? <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by Jesse Warn. While this was Warn's first feature film, the film does not reflect that at all, but instead shows a polished and artistic approach to telling the story. Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch. I would definitely love to see more of your work. <br /> <br /> Based on enigmas, this is a very cerebral movie. It's your thing, as it's mine, so I totally recommend watching the Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5 / 5
