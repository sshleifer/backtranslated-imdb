The Beguiled is a very satisfying movie for those looking for what is mentioned above. For Clint Eastwood fans, it will be a disappointment. Although Eastwood does his best here in his atypical role (except for the fact that his character is a charming womanizer, which is not so familiar), the ambiguous nature of his character, which happens to be a kind of fallen hero . for a manipulative and insatiable woman who eats (so to speak) will eventually be too difficult for anyone who sees him to play heroes in the best Western tradition, morally a little impure but still without that dark side. I think he manages to get this part unlikely, but those who really steal the show are the two women who compete, the school teacher Geraldine Page and the student director, played by Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> We see that there is a potential demon in every man and a potential witch in every woman, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. Hartman, Edwina, is the sweetest and innocent girl in the world until she falls in love with John McBurney and becomes possessive of him. This is what causes the tragedy, as well as the secret lust of the director, the forbidden fruit. She keeps a big and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother, whom she clearly idolizes. The fourth factor in this "unholy" spiral of love is the evil Carol, played by Jo Ann Harris, who drives John away from his infatuation with Edwina and puts him in his bed. <br /> <br /> The whole nature of the story this film gives is a kind of Gothic feeling, which makes it a rather rare thing in the Western genre, but popular in the films of the 70s. An achievement unique to the Siegel / Eastwood team and a movie that is not for the faint of heart.
