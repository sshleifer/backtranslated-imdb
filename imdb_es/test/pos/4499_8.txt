Based on the best-selling novel by Khaled Hosseini, The Kite Runner is a story of friendship, betrayal and the struggle for redemption. Located in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the days of the Taliban domination, all the elements are present in a great drama but, under the direction of Marc Forster (Finding Neverland), the film lacks the type of impact emotional. that makes it a memorable experience, although it is entertaining, well-acted and occasionally moving. <br /> <br /> It was established in Kabul in 1978 but it was filmed in Kashgar, China due to the dangers in Afghanistan, the friendship that opens the film between two young boys is very real, although they are very far away in social circumstances and economic. 12-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) lives in an elegant setting with his wealthy and educated father Baba, played by the great Homayoun Ershadi, although his wealth seems a bit incongruous in one of the poorest countries in the world. Although Baba is a loving father, he confesses to Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), his friend and business partner, that Amir is too soft and that "something is missing with that child". The family has a servant, Ali (Nabi Tanha) who loves all their needs and whose son Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmoodzada) is Amir's best friend. <br /> <br /> The two are separated not only by class but by ethnicity Amir, an expanding writer, is a member of the Pashtun majority, while Hassan is a Hazara, a minority sect (10% of the population) . Although we learn little about their traditions or social situation, they are bound by their love of kite flying, a popular sport in Kabul and by reading Afghan folk stories from Amir to Hassan, who is illiterate. The annual kite flight competition for children is a great event in their lives and the CGI effects are impressive. The ropes of the kite are covered with glass particles and the winner is the one whose kite rope can cut the other kites in the sky. Hassan is the kite runner who has an amazing ability to locate fallen kites and take them to Amir as a trophy. However, after Amir wins the important contest, a sad event takes place that will shape the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> The thugs, led by the older Assef (Elham Ehsas), who then appears as a ruthless Taliban leader, attack Hassan because he is a Hazara and brutally rape him (off camera) while Amir is too scared to try to avoid it. Unable to cope with his lack of perceived value (although one must wonder what would happen if he could have done something to help Hassan), guilt becomes the driving force of his relationship with Hassan and their friendship becomes tense. In one incident, Amir throws grenades at Hassan as if begging him to defend himself and punish him for his passivity, but Hassan does not take the bait and remains loyal despite his friend's cowardice. When Amir asks his father to dismiss the servants and accuses Hassan of stealing his watch, Hassan admits to the theft even though he is innocent. Eventually, circumstances force Ali and Hassan to leave the shame. When the Russians invade Afghanistan, Baba and Amir also leave, fleeing to Pakistan and then to Fremont, California, where the story continues years later. <br /> <br /> Baba is forced to work at a gas station and sell trinkets. At an outdoor market, Amir (Abdul Salam Yusoufzai), apparently following the movements of life, studies to become a writer at the local community college. After falling in love and marrying Soraya (Atossa Leoni), the daughter of a Kabul general, Amir finally publishes his first novel, A season of ashes and things look very positive. When Amir receives a call from Rahim Khan to ask him to visit him in Pakistan and tell him "there is a way to be good again", the specter of guilt that has haunted him throughout his life makes Amir go home. He returns to Pakistan and, at great risk, returns to an Afghanistan now controlled by the Taliban to confront the demons of his past and discover a surprising secret in the process. <br /> <br /> The kite runner is a sensitive film that deals with the internal pain that comes from knowing that he was not faithful to his best instincts and allows the possibility of moving from shame to a new level of responsibility. Nor does it hide the pain caused to Afghanistan by the wars and the revolution, a pain that may be represented by Hassan's suffering. Unfortunately, it reduces complex situations to the level of good guys and villains and distorts what really happened, exonerating the US. UU., Those who participated in secret anti-government operations within the country, of any responsibility for the disastrous war that left more than one million dead and millions more disabled. Although we are inspired by the leading children's actors and moved by the freedom represented by the flight of kites, The Kite Runner renounces his power when he tries to replace melodrama with history.
