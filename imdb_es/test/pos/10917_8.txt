I saw this again after not having seen it since it first came out (in '97), and it still made me laugh out loud. It's written with skill, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are perfect in their roles, and if you can see Bob Newhart in this film and not laugh, you're more man than me. <br /> <br /> For In that regard, I think the scenes in which Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the cassette "How to be a man" and the wedding scenes with Joan Cusack after ( almost) are three of the most entertaining scenes of any movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, the last scene is an excuse for a happy ending, but ... few movies are perfect.
