This movie says all there is to be said about religion: I would like it to be seen compulsorily for all fanatics and possible clerics. <br /> <br /> The story, set in Danish villages at the turn of the century, is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a rigid priest who discouraged all his dreams of love and exploring the world and its beauty. Now they are old and their life and beauty passed. Her new and silent help, to those who "teach" to cook, is Babette (played by the charming Stephane Audran, who appeared in many of the films of her husband Claude Chabrol). Life in the town is simple and the rigid direction reflects that. <br /> <br /> When Babette wins the lottery, she asks for an opportunity to prepare a banquet, a true work of love. The course of the party and its main guest reveal messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This is a must-see for the devotion with which Babette prepares the party. and by the speech that the general gives at the end. Possibly the best international film of the eighties.
