Now I like Victor Herbert. And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones. But it would have been nice to see a real biography of Victor Herbert. Walter Connolly as Herbert has a decent resemblance to him in his later years <br /> <br /> Jones and Martin sing very well. The music of Herbert is right there to decorate the plot of these two musical performers. John Ramsay, of Jones, is a fragile character, very similar to Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat, to whom Jones also played. <br /> <br /> As for Mary Martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good career in Hollywood. He made movies with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell, as well as this one. She did well, but movie audiences did not take it. The best musical moment in the film is Jones and Martin in a duo by Thine Alone. The recordings that I have of the song are individual and were written in duo. There is also a nice scene with Jones and Martin riding bicycles exchanging Herbert songs while they travel. <br /> <br /> The real Victor Herbert with his womanizer and his patriotic Irish background and his musical training in Germany, where he developed a love for All German things would have been a fascinating study. He was also a violoncello virtuoso before devoting himself full time to composing. I have to make a strong exception to the critic who said that Cuddles Sakall would have been a good Victor Herbert. Sakall as Irish, HELLO. <br /> <br /> Nice movie, but the real Vic would have been much better.
