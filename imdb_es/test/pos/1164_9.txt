This was my late wife's favorite movie. I'm sorry that I did not live long enough to have the video, since I'm sure I would have spent it. What can we say? A great romantic story and the push of two great men, Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are excellent in these roles. But while Connery is his usual sexy sex, it is the late Brian Keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. The backup is provided by Candy Bergen, beautiful in her first 30 years, as the abducted American widow. The great endorsement also comes from the great John Huston as the embattled state of Teddy, John Hay; Geoffrey Lewis, from the Clint Eastwood films, is great as the vacillating US ambassador, Gummere; The late Vladek Sheybal with his devilishly evil look is great, since the Beshaw and much more are given by Steve Kanaly and Roy Jensen, whose faces we have seen in various environments. In short, this is a movie full of a wonderful romance, aware of a time that has passed. History without meaning? No way. The issue of the great nations that press the smallest for their own hegemonic interests is as true today as it was then. Very romantic? Not really ... certainly not in any sense. Fun to watch? You bet I am the owner of the video and I will see it again and again. I suggest you do the same.
