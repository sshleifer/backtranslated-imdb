"It all depends on how you look at it, we're halfway to heaven or to hell," says Rev. Harlan in "Northfork." The film of the Polish brothers is ambitious and will make any intelligent spectator feel, as long as he has patience and basic knowledge about Christianity. The layers of entertainment provided by the film take a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd images that are obvious to a less obvious socio-political and theological comment that should cause a relaxed American to reflect on current social values. The adoption of the film of surrealism (coffins that emerge from the depths of artificial lakes to float and annoy the living, landowners who almost "crucify" their feet to the wooden floors of their houses, angels who need multiple lenses to read, etc.) and absurd images (of half animals, half of toys that are alive, of doorbells that make the most delicate of the musical results of a harp, a blind angel that continues to write illegible texts, etc.) could make a viewer not familiar with the surrealist and absurdist traditions in literature and the arts to ask what is the movie as entertainment. Although European cinema has better credentials in this field, Hollywood has made such films in the past in "Cat Ballou", Lee Marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap, several decades ago. "Northfork", in a scene of citizens leaving the city in cars, seemed to pay tribute to the row of cars in "Citizen Kane" taking Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic. <br /> <br /> The film is difficult for the uninitiated or impatient spectators: the most interesting epilogue (one of the best I can remember) can be heard as a voice towards the end of credits. The directors seem to leave the best moments to those who can stay with the cinema until the end. If you have the patience, you will savor the layers of the film, if you swallow or swallow what the Polish annoys, you will lose its many flavors. <br /> <br /> What is the movie about? ? In the most obvious layer, a city is being vacated to make way for a dam and a hydroelectric project. Cemeteries are even being unearthed so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to a higher cemetery. The real estate developers are selling the properties by the lake to 6 people who can evict the citizens. Of the 6, only one seems to have conscience and, therefore, can ask for chicken broth soup, while others can not get anything for them. <br /> <br /> In the next layer, you have Christianity and its interaction. The people of the village Most are devout Christians, but in many they lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true Christian principles, exemplified in the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions. <br /> <br /> In the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with almost angelic humans and each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel that has a comic about Hercules and dreams of a mother, finds one in an androgynous angel called "Flower Hercules". While the filmmaker gives clues that Flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, Flower's later actions belie this option. In fact, you are in the world of angels, not gods but pure in spirit and, therefore, not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is evident in these shots. <br /> <br /> In another layer, Irwin's toy plane becomes a real plane that takes him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> Is the final layer the social comment? "The country is divided into two types of people: Ford and Chevy people." There is a difference? They think they are different, but both are consumers. <br /> <br /> For the religious, the film says "Pray and you will receive" (words of Father Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). For the consumer, the film says "it's what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the 6 evictors also has wings: a duck / goose feather tucked into the bands of their hats, but their actions are often very different from the angelic ones as suggested) by the different reactions to a scratch on a car). <br /> <br /> The film is certainly not the best American film, but it is definitely pioneering and impressive work: excellent images, amazing performances (especially Nick Nolte), and a loaded script that offers several levels of entertainment for audiences mature.
