Seeing Les Amants Reguliers calls for an immediate comparison with the Bertolucci film 'The Dreamers', in my opinion, the best film about the student revolt of 1968 in Paris. Actually, the director Philippe Garrel does not seem to avoid comparing himself with his colleague, who is much more famous, sharing the main actor and even including a direct replica of an older Bertolucci film. And, nevertheless, LAR is a different movie and an interesting one. <br /> <br /> The story line also seems familiar. The film begins with long scenes of the 'emeutes' of 1968, perhaps among the best done so far. The film is made in black and white, and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade reminds Eisenstein. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action moves on the Parisian floor where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art, smoke drugs, dream and fall in love. There are no direct social comments, nor a real explanation of the background of the revolt. The film focuses on the psychology of the characters and the love story between the main characters. It's like a premonition of the process of transition to the establishment through which the 1968 generation passed, it's just that not all participants can adapt or survive. <br /> <br /> The film is more about the characters than about the characters. the events. And it is merely because of the style of which he will be remembered. The film in black and white is memorable not only in the scenes of the revolution, but also when observing the evolution of the characters. Many sequences are enhanced by a technique derived from silent film films, with long shots accompanied by a piano melody. The effect is exquisite. However, the duration of the film is not justified, lasts more than three hours and I doubt that cutting it to only two hours would have been a fault, in fact I am convinced that it is the opposite. <br /> <br /> Without increasing the depth and subtlety of Bertolucci's LAR film is another perspective to remember about one of the most important years in the history of France and the world in the 20th century.
