This totally strange feature is a typical and primal example of the satanic horror of the 70s. The events are completely confusing and it takes quite a while before you figure out what the hell is going on, but the brooding atmosphere immediately absorbs you. From the indescribably bizarre introduction, which shows a pair of spooky children turning toys into a real-life war machine, you simply know that this becomes a shocking and rough shock. "Brotherhood of Satan" soon seems to be another surrender in the supposed and unofficial "scary little town that hides a dark secret" subgenre. A young widower, who travels with his new and delightful girlfriend and his 8-year-old daughter, stops in a small remote city to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway. The villagers behave in a very hostile manner and insist that visitors leave immediately. The city clearly bathes in an atmosphere of fear and panic, while local children disappear inexplicably disappeared and unnatural forces keep everyone within the city limits. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, apparently governed by the elderly members of the community. I really liked the "Brotherhood of Satan". The story reminded me of a novel written by John Saul, but I do not remember the title. It was also a cult of older people who abused young villagers on their own greedy merits. The film is based mainly on spooky landscapes (like dolls and witchcraft relics), but a script that is a bit more enveloping and coherent would have been good. The subject often raises many problems and questions, and director Bernard McEveety can not always give us answers. The climax is excellent, very seventy (that is, shocking) and unforgettable. Beautifully filmed, too.
