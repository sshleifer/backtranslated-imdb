I do not think I've ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is crazy. Every time I see it, I find something new and it makes it even more fun than the previous time. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracked. All the characters are great, from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed all the way and I will never get tired of that. Look at it! <br /> <br /> If you liked Cary Elwes in this movie, you should definitely see the promised princess.
