This is not the unpleasant video Night of the Demon since there are more than one. Actually, there is only one, but it multiplies. <br /> <br /> After he lives in Suzanne (the queen of the scream Linnea Quigley), he passes it to the gothic girl Angela (Amelia Kinkade) through a nice long kiss. <Br /> <br /> Next, we see Linnea showing us her socks in the bathroom. She shows a lot more when Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks he's having fun. <br /> <br /> Soon, everything goes to hell literally as the bodies fall one by one and are possessed. Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two who try to escape. Max is not much help, leaving Judy a solution. <br /> <br /> The makeup was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that prevented this from being even better was the extremely long build-up to the action. <br /> <br /> The old man (Harold Ayer) who appears at the beginning will return and get his just desserts. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley may be the Queen of Screams, but Cathy Podewell definitely showed the best lungs of this movie.
