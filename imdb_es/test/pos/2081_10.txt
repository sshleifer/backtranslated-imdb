He took this film in TCM at the beginning of A.M. It was incredible. <br /> <br /> Starting slowly but sinisterly ... Scott is a somber character who takes advantage of women. In this case, two women who have an inheritance in Southern California. <br /> <br /> The beach ensembles and neighborhoods of the 1940s are original and intriguing. The title may have been more creative, but the subject and the ominous shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed, almost in a Hitchcockian version. <br /> <br /> Scott reminded me of Uncle Charley's character in "Shadow of a Doubt," one of Hitch's favorite movies. The audience learns, we really do not know what is hidden in the dark side of the human mind. This movie is a displaced gem and it's worth buying. 10/10.
