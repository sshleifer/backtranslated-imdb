There are 3 of these movies, all designed in a similar way and each one extremely fun. Red touches radio detective Wally Benton, also known as The Fox, who is forced to solve real-life crimes along with his fianc√© played by his typical neighbor's girl, Ann Rutherford. Many of the single line and gags are silly and probably were in the 1940s, as anticipated. But, like many, they actually made me laugh out loud, which was unexpected, at least. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence, surprisingly I say it because I grew up with a much older version of the man that his charm did not really play well in my formidable years. I have to approve these movies, if you're in the mood for this kind of nostalgic food. I almost threw myself into the heart, but in truth people are wasted, hit and dare to say, the suspense is sometimes well above average. As with most movies of this era, you get a PI rating (politically incorrect) for reasons you can imagine. I guess Wartime is fun that way, and also these movies. Look one, look at everyone.
