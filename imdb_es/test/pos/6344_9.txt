This is a wonderful sequel to the award-winning miniseries Lonesome Dove in the 80s. This sequel is perhaps, better than the original. It is definitely more familiar. The language is more tenuous. There is a lot of violence and a particular scene with Cherokee Jack is particularly frightening. However, in general a great movie. The acting is excellent. William Peterson is fantastic. A great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing. Jon Voight appropriately fills Tommy Lee Jones shoes as Captain Call. Ricky Shroder gives a great performance full of heart as the young man who grew up with no family to claim him. Highly recommended
