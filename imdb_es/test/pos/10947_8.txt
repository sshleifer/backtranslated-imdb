If you enter the Effect of the Twins looking for a pure Hong Kong movie experience, you will be disappointed. This does not mean it is bad, but it is NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie, in a line similar to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. He is decidedly silly and youthful, so if you want some serious action in Hong Kong, watch a movie by John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping. This movie has a lot of criticism for its stupidity and I thought the first thing I should do is explain what you're getting into, as it has disappointed many purists. <br /> <br /> For those who are not. However, purists and those with more indulgent tastes, Twins Effect is a deliciously silly kung fu comedy. I really liked it for a variety of reasons, no less important, they are the female protagonists that ignite each other in a very entertaining double comedy. I think this is the first movie of its kind they've been in, but they jump, kick and fly like seasoned professionals. <br /> <br /> The plot, obviously ridiculous, is handled with great care and attention. , and the film is written knowingly, causing much of the movie to laugh out loud. Comedy is really the most prominent here, and it's a subtle and smooth comedy that depends on words like inanimate objects that fly up to Stephen Chow. It must be said that the slapstick is an immense fun too. The sequence with the vampires dancing in the disco is a total classic. <br /> <br /> The action is a mixture of two genres really. It falls between the "period drama", the wire-and-sword fight (which occurs more towards the end) and the fighting style of Jackie Chan's comedy, which comes out with a mixture that although a little derivative sometimes is always Exciting to see and occasionally throws some genuinely innovative encounters. <br /> <br /> This is all great, and the movie is tremendously funny at all times. Despite this, it has some points of friction. For example, Twins Effect is in many ways much more Westernized than what Kung Fu fans are accustomed to, the inevitable comparison with the Blade series is definitely a good example, although Twins Effect is honestly much better than Blade has achieved. , especially for Action of struggle. Personally, it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent Anthony Wong (the villain of John Woo's classic Hard Boiled) so underutilized, but the younger audience he is addressing is unlikely to notice this or know about Hard Boiled or his other movies, so this is just a personal complaint. <br /> <br /> If you see it with an open mind, you will probably enjoy it as much as I did, but you must be very aware that it is a COMEDY, there are no balls for the kung fu movie on the wall. Keep that in mind and you'll be fine.
