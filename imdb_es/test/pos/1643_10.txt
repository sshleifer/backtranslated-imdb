Woohoo! It is difficult to put into words my feelings for this episode. Ice is one of the best episodes of the first season. It's my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the Arctic with an unknown organism that causes a murderous aggression, the drama can not be better than that. Paranoia reigns supreme, since even Mulder and Scully have doubts about the sanity of others. I've heard people complain about the similarities of this episode with the movie 'The Thing'. I have not seen it, so I would not know. The ice is more than worth seeing just to see Mulder and Scully really testing their confidence in development. This episode is intense and suspense until the end. You will not be disappointed!
