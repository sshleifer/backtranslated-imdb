Todd Sheets has created one of the best movies of LOW BUDGET Zombie EVER. The story is great, the blood is great, the psychopaths are evil. However, the film is tainted by its small dialogue and, sometimes, slow images. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the ZB2 offers what any Zombie movie should, gore, good storyline, fast-paced adventure in the macarbe. If only the MR sheets had received a budget of 100,000, this film would make EVERY zombie movie ever, including the almighty Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> But as time goes by, he improves and with the money he improves. It enters your pocket In this way, you allow this man, in this modern genius, to better construct his vision. <br /> <br /> Just remember that Zombie Bloodbath 2 was just one of its great steps when it's on top of Gore Mountain.
