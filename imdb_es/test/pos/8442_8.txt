It was easy to dismiss this movie as a hyperbole at the time of its release. Fonda, Douglas and Lemmon were known as "left-handers", but the accident at Three Mle Island provided a shocking context to this fictional drama. <br /> <br /> This movie works on many levels, taking pictures of public services and television news. 1979 was the zenith of the infamous "Happy Talk" format of television news (see also "Ron Burgundy") and is shown here in all its glory. The sound presenter darkly reads a story about a "hard-head collision" before cheerfully introducing Kimberley Wells (Fonda), making a story about a veterinarian making house calls (or is that "aquarium?"). The producer of the program and the manager of the station discuss the content, or the lack of it, behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some technical errors. The Flack (James Hampton) shows Fonda and Douglas the scale model needed for a pressurized water reactor plant, built by Westinghouse. Later, while Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (very well playing Lemmon's friend / colleague, caught between duty and loyalty) fight a sudden crisis in the plant control room, they are obviously directing a boiling water plant ( built by GE). Small point, but curious, considering how many details the writers guessed right. <br /> <br /> Like any good drama, the film raises more questions than answers. The real-world accident at TMI demonstrates the basic premise of the film. The job title for the movie was originally "Power", and you'll see why. While nuclear energy is preparing to return $ 3 in these days of gas, "China Syndrome" is as relevant today as it was more than 25 years ago.
