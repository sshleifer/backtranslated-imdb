Sometimes, the Academy does not recognize the potential of some films, or does not nominate them because they are controversial or strong. Sometimes they are nominated, but they do not win anything (I hope this does not happen this year with "American Beauty"). This is exactly what happened with "Boogie Nights", which was the best movie of 1997. The Academy preferred to give the Oscar for the best movie to "Titanic", a purely commercial and hollow film, and other prizes to the overrated "Good" Will Hunting "and the irritating" Full Monty ". The other images that were nominated in the main category were "LA Confidential" and "As good as it gets", great movies, but "Boogie Nights" is even better and should have been remembered in more categories. <br /> <br /> This incredible film tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, in a surprisingly excellent performance), a 17-year-old bartender who catches the attention of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, in a redeeming performance), a director of porn movies. Eddie has a special 'gift', and this helps him get into the world of porn movies. It changes its name by Dirk Diggler and begins to have great success. But fame ... does not last forever. Other characters also have their parallel stories: Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, such as Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who agrees to do anything, but has to use her shoes with wheels. <br /> <br /> What could have been a banal, trivial film becomes a perfect and memorable in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes "Boogie Nights" a great movie is its execution, added to an intelligent and well written script, a great soundtrack, etc. Each character is very well developed and each of them has its importance in the context. Every feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of modern American cinema. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" is a strong and powerful image that should be seen by all those who really like cinema. Under a plot that seems banal at first impression, there is a wonderful story of ups and downs, things that we face in our lives. It is an amazing portrait of the late 70's and early 80's, exactly a time of ups and downs. That's what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
