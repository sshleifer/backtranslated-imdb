This solid slapstick comedy in black and white with a dark plot (but without hope) is a real pleasure for the crowd that will make you howl with laughter (besides rolling your eyes in disbelief). <br /> <br /> It's the old Psycho in a train story, but that's not of great importance, since the part of the movie's suspense movie almost seems to be simply a counterbalance to the antics of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson. His hapless, almost incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and Schadenfreude in a way that almost competes with Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> What struck me most about the film is that it is wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the joys and the daily annoyances of train travel. They add a very welcome sense of realism and recognition. <br /> <br /> This suspense comedy has borrowed most of its Hitchcock "suspense" and, in my opinion, should only be seen for its comedy value (which is in fact high). In addition to Gustafsson, Lars Amble's solid performance as a deliciously cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
