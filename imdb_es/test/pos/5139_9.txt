Hoot is a good movie for young people about a group of high school kids trying to stop a chain of pancakes from destroying a plot of land that houses some burrowing owls in danger of extinction. The acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to watch. Many well-known comedians are in this movie and they keep their humor almost non-stop. It's a movie for the young audience, maybe 5 to 11 years old. I thought it was a good change of pace from the adult movies that are present on the screen these days. There is no realism here nor accuracy about life in general for adults or children. It's just a lot of fun with a constant message on how to prevent the beautiful places of this country from developing excessively. If you can remember the day you did not struggle to make money, you can remember that money is not everything. Not many people over the age of 12 will enjoy it unless they really have a weakness for the old special series after school.
