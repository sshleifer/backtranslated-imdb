The three names that mean the most to this movie are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. These three offer the best performances, but the whole cast does a wonderful job. The film, although about the porn industry, is not left aside with its own sexual premise. On the other hand, there were many scenes that involved the use of drugs and, although it is important to understand the lifestyle of the characters, I think there was an excess in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson has not directed much, but may have chosen for this film based on his 1988 work "The Dirk Diggler Story." One thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the familiar atmosphere among the characters as they work, live and celebrate together. Although they are not a typical family, they certainly seem to take care of each other. The wonderful soundtrack really helps to give you an idea of ​​the period during a time when the rage was the disco. There are many favorites at the disco and also other wonderful songs. <br /> <br /> The story is about a talented young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) who is invited to the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes an adult movie star almost overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director who takes his films very seriously, since he believes that his work is more than just pornography, but that it is a true art. However, Dirk becomes excessively dependent on drugs and soon runs a dangerous path where he can lose everything. Although there is a greater emphasis on the Dirk character, there are subplots for the other characters and their tests in life. You will find yourself wishing and hoping that your situations will improve. In general, a well made movie.
