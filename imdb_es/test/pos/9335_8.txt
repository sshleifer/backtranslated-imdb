It may be a bit creaky now, and it certainly can never have the impact it once had, but this is an exciting reminder of what Michael Jackson once could do. Looking back now for the first time since its initial prominence, I was not impressed by the trappings of terror, but rather sonenity and fun, and Vincent Price has never sounded so genuinely (unimportant) (sic?) That his absorption of The Horror Movie , which allows Jackson, behind the genre and makeup, to give us a courageously revealing portrait of male sexuality. <br /> <br /> Because THRILLER is not really about horror, in the way horror is not really about horror: it's about that historical subject, the sexual awakening of a young woman. The film begins in a movie theater, with Jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with the images and the aggressively generated response by the genre. Of course, she has an appointment and the movie is less afraid of her than she knows her boyfriend will wait for her. <br /> <br /> The general image of the movie they see, the group atmosphere suggests. Socially conditioned expectations. This leads her not only to think of the body with disgust, hence all the decomposing demons; the loss of her virginity is seen as a kind of death, but the sexual rite is not only about her boyfriend, but about her peers, her society, therefore, its visualization as a gang rape. <br /> <br /> This is brilliant. Disturbing things, the best that Director Landis has done. Jackson, the most popular artist on the planet, was still willing to show that the fixed image of a star contained crowds, not all reassuring. The song itself has remained remarkably well, the rhythms of creepy and insistent bass, the extraordinarily salty lyrics, the beautiful nightclub of the 70s are ecstatic in the choir, break the timelessness, revealing the milky desire behind fear.
