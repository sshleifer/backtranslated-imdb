It has been over 2005 and more than 15 years since this cartoon was released. In fact, I have not seen it seriously or closely in about 10 years. Now that I am a 30-year-old adult, I can look back with serious eyes as I watch the episodes again. <br /> <br /> In concept, the caricature is partly a tribute to the Looney Tunes classic, but also to its own original show. There are some episodes that are structured like old cartoons. For example, there is a singer who attacks Buster and, therefore, takes revenge on this singer's concert, exactly like the old Bugs Bunny caricature. The next caricature is similar to Looney Tunes, only in a different time. If you look at the old Looney Tunes, they did a lot of things exactly like Tiny Toons did. The old Looney Tunes made many social comments and parody. There were celebrity imitations. There was a lot of jokes, jargon and dialogues. The comedy was surreal and crazy. You can say this exactly for Tiny Toons too. The style of the comedy is "spiritually" the same. Definitely, a setback to the classics that had not been done well (if at all) in cartoons in the decades prior to this show. We recognize the cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can roll our eyes when something comes up that we do not like. But the reason why we do not believe that Looney Tunes is corny is because we were not alive in the 40s. In addition, Looney Tunes was original in those days, but nowadays the cartoons are repeated again and again. So it is easy to perceive Tiny Toons unfairly due to our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are differences in many aspects: the timing, the delivery and, obviously, the duration of the shows. They are two different styles of two different periods, which take place in two very different circumstances: Looney Tunes for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons for children who watch television. Even so, they did a good job doing an original show with original jokes and still paying tribute and following the style of the comedy of the old Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> Since Tiny Toons had a lot more time to play with them, they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration. You just have to watch the episodes like 1 minute to 3, the Plucky baby toilet episode ... there are many more. For example, one of the best comedic dialogue exchanges ever animated is in Thirteen Something when Babs and Buster are talking on the phone on a split screen, hoping that each one will miss each other. The lack of communication is spectacular. In particular, the development of the character in this episode and several others (usually those written by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is quite good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual, given that the opposite is usually true for the cartoons of that period. <br /> <br /> This was the first modern caricature that had a lot of reference to pop culture and self-esteem. referential humor. This was way ahead of his time. Tiny Toons really opened a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in today's cartoons, instead of doing the old boring shit we endured as children of the 80s. Yes, I loved the Transformers and the Thundercats, but Tiny Toons turned away from all that. It was a breath of fresh air. The New Adventures of Bakshi's Mighty Mouse may have been a precursor, but Tiny Toons made this surrealistic cartoon comedy style a real success. <br /> <br /> As a child, I overlooked some jokes. For example, an episode is a tribute to the Marx Brothers that I completely ignored when I was a teenager. Now I have a new respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I have never noticed that they are really brilliant. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I NEVER noticed that kind of comedy as a child. I've been thinking about this for most of the episodes I've seen recently. <br /> <br /> You would notice this kind of thing if you really SEE the program. Unlike other critics here that I know are judging him unfairly, I have seen all the episodes and thought about them thoroughly, exposed as much as children as adults. <br /> <br /> It can be said that there was a lot of care with the voice acting as well. I'm not talking just about the main characters, but the supporting characters did very well and creatively as well. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, his best performances in this caricature. She has not been the same since then. Rob Paulsen also did some amazing things here, too. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the program did not have some bad episodes. I had a lot. I also had many mediocre people. But, by far, he certainly had many genuinely funny episodes. Especially when it was aired for the first time, it was really fun to watch it. <br /> <br /> Out of 10 I give the program an 8.5, and congratulations for pushing the envelope and breaking the doors that lead to a new era of cartoons.
