Typical Spanish production: slow movement, but with great sensuality and sexuality that oozes from the main actress, Paz Vega. (Watch it in "Spanglish"). Big sets, lots of color, you can see Cordoba, Seville, Spanish mountains and the countryside. The plot tends to snake here and there, but if you follow it closely (I managed to do it, although the movie is in Spanish), you'll get a general idea. <br /> <br /> It's about how Carmen, a very sensual young gypsy, uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to carry out her orders. Carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow cigar worker at the cigar factory where she works. She persuades Joseph, the soldier in charge of taking her to prison, to let her escape. José succumbs to her charms because she speaks Basque (he is from Navarre and speaks the same language). José is punished for 1 month in jail and is degraded to an infantry soldier. Later he meets Carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers. But Carmen refuses to compromise with him and continues her lewd and coquettish lifestyle. In a fit of jealousy, Jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with Carmen. Then they have to leave the city. Life in the race turns José into a bandit. Carmen, for her part, remains the same, a tremendously promiscuous woman. In the end, José loses his mind and ends up killing Carmen. <br /> <br /> The story is told by José in jail, waiting to be executed. The person to whom the story is told is Prospero Merrime, a French writer and anthropologist, whose elegant watch (which plays Beethoven's Fur Elise) was stolen by Carmen or José. The delicious peace vega.
