I bought this movie just to see Bam because I really loved him, but after seeing this I do not like it very much. I mean, his acting was good and everything I guess, but every time he showed totally unnecessary skating scenes, I said to myself, "Well, we know you're a professional skater, can we go back with Ryan Dunn?" Dunn, Rake and Brandon really made the film in my perspective. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Jenn Rivell (obviously) and Missy Rothstein were in Haggard, but who was Bam dating with? Anyway, I really enjoyed Haggard and I think it's like no other movie I've seen. It is something in its own category.
