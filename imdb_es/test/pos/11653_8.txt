This is the most human and human film I've seen in a long time. Ironies abound, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a film that does not preach but does not condemn either. It is the best of the cinema and, nevertheless, the story is fictitious from several real events. <br /> <br /> Which of the two is more surprising, Sarandon or Penn? It is easy to say who is more sympathetic, but it is difficult to say who is more convincing. They are simply magnificent. <br /> <br /> You may think that all murderers should be killed or you can argue that life without parole is not life and that death is more merciful. Whatever your personal sensation, this movie gives you the opportunity to pause and reconsider. <br /> <br /> In the end, one simply wants to sit quietly and reflect. That's what the great drama does, gives catharsis, creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
