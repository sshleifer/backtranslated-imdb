Well, where do you start? I came across this one in 1993 and I just clicked "record" on the VCR as a habit, more than anything else. "Citizen Kane" certainly is not ... but if you had a bad day and are in the mood to face something that is not too intellectually stimulating, then I tentatively suggest that this could be your "thing". <br /> <br /> We have the lot here: a great title track, more stereotypes than you could shake a stick, the unconscious comedy, the most bitch fight scene of all time and more, more, more, plus! David Hemmings interprets the opposite of his role in the classic of the 60s "Blow Up": he is still a photographer, still with hormonal stimulation but not "quite" the same. <br /> <br /> John Philip Law is easy to criticize as an actor that makes a trunk not appear, but that would not be fair, as he had 5 minutes notice before accepting the role. <br /> <br /> Wexler as "Amanda"? Suffice it to say that it was his only role in the cinema! The real star of this film, however, is Ethel Evans, who plays one, would we say secretary (?), With the morale of a stray cat and the ambition to match. The way she manages to reconcile her current life with that of a future with her future comic husband is, in reality, quite moving in a terrestrial, harsh way, as it will be in the future. <br /> <br /> Actually, I love this movie when I'm in the mood for it ....... and I would not touch it with the proverbial bargepole when I'm not around. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the cast to keep a (relatively) straight face during filming. <br /> <br /> A "classic" at Edward D Wood's film school!
