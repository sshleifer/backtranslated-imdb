Ponyo At The Cliff, played in beautiful colors of water, is definitely a spectacle worthy of contemplation, vaguely remembering the trailer, which did not seem so impressive, I was surprised how beautiful and detailed it was. This movie just floods me with its purity. <br /> <br /> In the center there is a child who comes into contact with a sea creature, and it is their relationship that carries the film. Miyazaki is a master both in creating memorable images and in showing young people how to interact credibly with their little whims intact. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that did not sit well with me. It would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene "looked like" Ride Of The Valkyrians, it's a shame because a movie as beautiful as this can not afford to take liberties and hurts a really great scene. The antagonist and his background story did not interest me either, but I think it served more as a background than anything else. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a great movie. The scenery of the boat trip with all its images and sea creatures stood out, he thinks. Pure and magical. And yes, the hand-made illustrations are more intimate than the computer animations, now I'm really excited for Princes And The Frog.
