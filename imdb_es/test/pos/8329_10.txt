Walking With Dinoasaurs is a new and exciting program that uses incredible visual graphics to show the living dinosaurs. The information presented here is impressive. The moods of the series change to get your attention, things like dramatic music when fights break out. There is clear evidence here for a cracking documentary! My greatest thanks to the writers, directors and producers, without forgetting the other people involved. If you run into this video in stores, I suggest you buy it not only for the graphics, but for the extreme efforts and productive work that the series has to offer. 10/10
