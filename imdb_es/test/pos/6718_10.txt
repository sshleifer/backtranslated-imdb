Danny Boyle was not the first person to realize that zombies can run like the clappers. That honor belongs to Lifeforce, which is, of course, the largest and most nude space vampire zombie in Halley's Comet, which runs in the film about the end of the world in London. It is possible that Tobe Hooper has made many mistakes, but for this deliriously mad science fiction horror he deserves a place among the immortals. In addition, it offers the space vampire Mathilda May, the best that has left France since Simone Simon, passing the whole naked movie. What she does very, very well. Just keep in mind that while it is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence that anyone on Earth has ever encountered, it is also "totally alien to this planet and our way of life and totally dangerous". It's a launch meeting I would have loved to participate in: British space program astronauts find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a 150-kilometer-long artichoke / umbrella-shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of Halley's Comet full of giant dried bats and bring them back to Earth with almost apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of London of their life force in the midst of much nudity, swirling thunder and spit their coffee through the speech of the room ("I've been in space for six months," and she looks perfect to me. "" Suppose we do not know anything, which is an underestimate of the matter. "" Do not worry, a naked woman is not going to come out of it. This complex. "Oh, and we'll get the writers of Alien and Blue Thunder to write it with unwritten rewrites from the Mark of the Devil writer, The Sex Thief and Eskimo Nell and the director of The Jonestown Monster. It sounds like a winner, here you have $ 22 million. have fun. And they do it, they do it. <br /> <br /> Right, there is enough promise in the raw material to have done something really creepy and thought-provoking (at a time when AIDS hysteria was approaching its height, a sexual transmission "The plague It offers ample opportunity for allegory, but in the hands of the Go-Go guys at Cannon, what could have been another Quatermass and the Pit quickly turns into a 10th plan from outer space.It is replete with delirious inanity, already be the fun scene of the death of Frank Finlay ("Here I go!"), The great entrance of Peter Firth ("I am Colonel Caine." "From the SAS?", He shouts discreetly to Michael Gothard. full of reporters: "Gentlemen, that last comment was not for publication, this is a D-Notice situation", responds to the surprisingly complacent prisoners), the security guards offering the naked vampire from the space of Mathilda May a good cookie to stop your e scape., resuscitated bodies that explode in dust everywhere, the sweaty prime minister takes the life of his secretary and London filled with nuns zombies, stockbrokers and brokers while the city has its most complete dismantling screen since Mrs. Gorgo lost Junior at Battersea Funfair and went on the rampage. And that does not mention "This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist!" The scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire "would be much less terrifying if you just come to me," while Peter Firth, with a lead stake, adopts his best Action Man voice to answer. That! "In a single scene, you have a possessed Patrick Stewart who embodies the woman in our mind deeply confused as astronaut hero, Steve" I-I never got to play more-Charlie-Manson "Railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full "Helta- Skelta! "Trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable Aubrey Morris (the only man who makes Freddie Jones seem frantic) plays Secretary of the Interior Sir Percy Heseltine as a kind of insane Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of those actors who always looks as if he should have been a Doctor Who at the time when no one was seeing him anymore) heated up a blas√© public school male with the hope that nobody would see him again and the unequaled reactions of John Hallam as the nurse who continues to open the door halfway through the psychic tornado to bring more drugs, as if they needed more in this film, it's a shame that the scientist Frank Finlay, who is not qualified to certify death in extraterrestrial life forms (a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski ), the action has been lost in that. <br /> <br /> No matter how crazy you think the movie is, it will still get even more angry, be it a zom pathologist bie ("He also needs food") exploding in all the costume of the interior secretary, the blood and entrails of Patrick Stewart forming a nude Mathilda May or the space vampires turned St. Paul's Cathedral into the world's greatest laser show for transport human souls from the London Underground to your geostationary mothership. I loved every moment gloriously crazy. In its own truly unique form, this could be the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> The DVD offers the original 116-minute version that opened in the UK instead of the 101-minute, well-edited US version, which not only offers much more hilarity for its dollar, but also it also completely restores Henry Mancini's score to its original glory (the US version covered many of the gaps with additional clues by Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Despite being a somewhat surprising choice at first sight, Mancini echoed many of the classic science fiction Horrors Universal of the 50s and his score is excellent, with an excellent driving title that offers a rare reminder of how interesting who could have been away from Blake Edwards. Unfortunately, there is nothing more than an extras trailer, although it would be nice to wait some day for a special edition with some of the scenes removed from the 128-minute cut originally planned by Hooper: from what is shown here, this could offer even more Golden comedy!
