Wow. At first I thought you write these things! How difficult is the choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth, respectability and security compared to a husband who offers only oppression, abuse, degradation and poverty. However, our choices are not always as clear as you might think. In fact, the wealthy gentleman was everything a woman could hope for, and yet ... her husband's pull, his sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming. What do you do? As a spectator, you became as confused and misguided as she was. Anyway, what I really came to see on this site was my admiration for Engish's voice, I thought, although it's actually the voice of an Irish singer in the movie. Looking for it, I find it is Glen Hansard, whom I had never heard of before that day. What a find I am very grateful. Wow, what a voice! What a day! Thanks BIFF!
