In one of the best films of the year, Tom Hanks plays Congressman Charlie Wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant dramatic historical comedy (given the reasonably current events) that surrounds the Afghan / Soviet fiasco of the eighties. The Soviets were attacking Afghanistan by killing hundreds of people. Why should it matter to someone? People are dying, right? No, the reason why the United States got involved through Charlie Wilson was because the Afghans, fearful of being fired, began to enter Pakistan illegally, which in turn stopped the Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. Charlie Wilson in an effort to fix this situation joined the sixth richest woman and religious fan of Texas, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) and a fun and robust American spy from the CIA, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to help supply the Afghans. with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet fighter planes that will attempt to attack their lands. <br /> <br /> Although he is certainly not a serious candidate for the Oscar for Best Picture, 'Charlie Wilson's War' is probably one of the best of the many political films of the year. Academy Award winner Mike Nichols provides a solid direction as expected, while Emmy Award winner Aaron Sorkin (Sport's Night, The West Wing) offers an extraordinary script that balances comedy and drama almost a The perfection. The acting is great for the most part as well. Tom Hanks offers his best and nicest performance since his shift in the 2000 Oscar nomination as a FedEx worker stranded on a tropical island in 'Cast Away'. Hanks takes a viscous character like Wilson and with his characteristic charm makes him a nice guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are reliable as always, but the true outstanding performance of the film is Philip Seymour Hoffman. It could be said that he is the best actor working in the film industry today. Hoffman takes on a small supporting role and eclipses everyone around him. From his first scene in which he shouts at his boss before violently breaking his window, Hoffman sucks you. The only disappointing cast member is, above all, the Hollywood star, Julia Roberts. By making her way through yet another film, Roberts' overbearing and dominant portrayal of a wealthy oil woman from Texas reaches all the wrong notes and, in most cases, is annoying. At 97 minutes, the film is short and sweet, and that does not mean it does not drag on some points, but when it is dragged it is for a very short period of time. <br /> <br /> In conclusion "Charlie Wilson's War" is not a perfect movie, but it's worth watching. Grade: B +
