Woohoo! I caught this in IFC recently after seeing But Im A Cheerleader. I had never heard of this movie, but the description sounded remotely interesting. I entered with low expectations and now I must say that this is one of the best love stories in history. Robin Tunney does an excellent job portraying a person with tourettes. The relationship between the two and the smallest details in the film are so precise and credible. I usually hate "romance" and I love movies, but this movie really moved me. So I recommend this movie to anyone with the ability to see.
