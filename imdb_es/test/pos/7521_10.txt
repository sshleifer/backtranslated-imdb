Undoubtedly, the highlight of this film is its cast. <br /> <br /> Diana Rigg, George C. Scott, Bernard Hughes, to name a few. <br /> <br /> I have accumulated more time in hospitals and with Doctors over the years I want to think about. <br /> <br /> This comedy attacks the pomp and pretension in all aspects of our society, through the establishment of one of its institutions "More Haughty" ... the Medical profession. <br /> <br /> The idea that such events could be possible, could be a shock for some, but it is a delight for anyone with the perspective of experience. <br /> <br /> Dr. Brock (Scott suffers a mid-life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes while we, and he, fell in love with the prospect of his relationship with Miss Drummond (Rigg). <br /> <br /> The thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mixture in the form of irony that the Hospital seems to be killing its own workers, as they mismanage their affairs in it. <br /> <br /> The Climax is unpredictable (unless you've seen it) in it and even more fun if you guess it. <br /> <br /> It's not everyone's mood, no doubt, and it has "Dark Moments" strangely funny if you're open to them. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute and I loved watching it on DVD.
