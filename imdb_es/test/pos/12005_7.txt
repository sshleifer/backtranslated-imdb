And I do it. Peter Falk has created a role that will last forever on TV land! And I'm grateful for that. However, this is not one of your best hours. Columbo goes to college and basically teaches how to solve a crime, and yet there are bad guys who think they are smarter than him. What all the fans know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent. Without a great enemy, how can the hero be in the wrinkled coat? Still, it's better than NO Columbo, and I'll wait and see the next one too.
