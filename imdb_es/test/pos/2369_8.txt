I recorded this at Sundance and had no idea it was a Miike movie. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. <br /> <br /> Then I saw things like the saxophonist <br /> <br /> that sounded like an Eastern Oriental Barbieri, and I knew this had to be Miike. <br /> <br /> I lost the initial initial credits and had to wait until the end of the final credits to see the credits of Miike. <br /> <br /> So far I have not been disappointed. . Audition, City of Lost Souls, Ichi the Killer and The Happiness of the Katakuries were good movies, and now I have discovered that this was the third in a trilogy. <br /> <br /> Apart from Miike and Todd Solendz there is no one making interesting films today.
