This was the most provocative death penalty film in history! He refused to appear unilateral and the emotions that are perceived throughout history are as real as they can be. This movie had one of the most compassionate religious characters (and I use this term in a good way)! This movie actually made me go out to find and read the book (which is weird to me). Sister Helen exercised a more spiritual than religious tone (which is also rare). And he presented both sides of the problem so that people on both sides who watched the film did not feel that a point had been left out. And we have to thank the director for that. This is not an entertainment movie. But it is a film that transmits a message that can reach the heart of your heart. I can not think of another movie like this.
