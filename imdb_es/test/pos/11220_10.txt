I loved the movie "Northfork". I did not know anything about the movie before I saw it. Therefore, I had no external influence or information to guide me on what I was seeing on the screen. In retrospect, I would recommend anyone interested in the film to see it, for the sole reason of the quality actors that appear in it. Do not read anything about the plot, the story or the evaluation of the film. In fact, LET ME read more in my comments, although I think they are general and would not ruin the movie for you, I do not want to diminish the value of the movie for you. Find your own path of meaning in this movie or your potential will decrease. <br /> <br /> In general, I found the 3 benign strangers in Northfolk disconcerting. As the film unfolds, they could qualify as three entertaining fugitives from a mental hospital or, the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish child, or three angels "sent" to find the "lost angel". <br /> <br /> The sick and perhaps dying child works to convince the three "strangers" to abandon the search for the lost angel, become its guardians (mother and father) and take it to a safe place away of Northfork (not less than 1000 miles). He even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them to be their guardians. Only one of the three responds positively to the child. The other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this participation. <br /> <br /> The priest who is caring for the sick child shows deep concern for the people and a deep conviction of their faith. He transcends the desolation and emptiness of Northfork and his people; He is the light of kindness and hope for both Northfork and the viewer of the film. <br /> <br /> Near the climax of the film, the boy and the new tutor travel by land to a field where a plane waits. They board to find the other two strangers also on the plane; in fact one is the pilot. The engines start and the plane takes off. <br /> <br /> Who are the 3 strangers? If only a stranger was interested in helping the child, why were the three of them on the plane? Where will the plane? Did the other two find the "lost angel"? Is there a lost angel and if so, who is it? Who are the six men dressed as grave diggers? If all this is just the feverish dreams of the sick child, how did one of the 3 strangers end up helping one of the men dressed as a gravedigger when he jumped and hit his head (neither the boy nor the stranger had contact with these men )? <br /> <br /> One or two sentences written with the title that tell people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake (this is not a spoiler, it's a statement about advertising only). So if you have not seen the movie, Northfork, the questions above show only some of the interesting and fun bifurcations in the way of thinking when you watch the movie Northfork. If you read the publicity summary of the plot of the movie before you saw it before, maybe you should see some of the previous questions and see it again ... I know I will. <br /> <br /> Terry
