Most of these criticisms are open, so I will go to another chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen here. <br /> <br /> While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actress / actress herself was 17 and 18 at the time and therefore obviously on the 16th barrier. Here in the USA. It is still controversial, but the simplicity and innocence of the film do much to compensate. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I did not see any more of Sean; in this film at least their expressions are demonstrative and obvious; You know exactly what the character feels if he is angry, scared or confused. Anicee had a healthy career, whose life was cut off by cancer at the end of 2006. She was a beautiful and talented actress. <br /> <br /> FRIENDS VHS tapes can be found on Amazon.com from time to time, but usually for a significant price; I have seen it as low as $ 60 approximately and as high as $ 152 (as of this comment, there were two for that price). The PAUL & MICHELLE continuation video is not as expensive and can be obtained (when available) on Amazon for an average of between $ 16 and $ 70.
