I do not really care that anyone here likes this movie, I do, and that's what this review is about. Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this comic role. that line on the train ab and c is now an instant classic, the CG is great, yes, the train seems a bit fake, but the aliens, how do they rock?, Todd Bridges, where is Arnold and Mr. Drummond? , wow, he's been out of the loop, I guess that's what jail does to you ... a bullet train is on its way to Las Vegas with the senator to deliver a big speech, a meteor just hit, and now All of a sudden, the aliens ran out on the train, and our police hero has to save the day, to make matters worse, his ex-wife is on board arguing with him. I just thought that this movie was so wonderful, a must see if you like the action.
