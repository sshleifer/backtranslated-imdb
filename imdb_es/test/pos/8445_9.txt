As long as you do not mind paying a little more attention than you would normally do for other movies, this is one of the best "thrillers" you've ever seen. The film portrays an incident that could occur in real life; in fact, nothing seems fictitious at all. It also describes how people could react in real life. <br /> <br /> In fact, it portrays them so well that it seems to be real life. Combine that with the lack of a soundtrack, and you'll almost have the best news movie you've ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are particularly good at this masterpiece of the late seventies, evoking concern for its end and a real and tragic grief for its end. I recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers.
