The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about the lack of love. The movie begins with the main character; Hans Epp, returning from a spell in the foreign legion. He returns with his mother, so they do not tell him how much he loves him, or how much he misses him; but to be told that it is worthless and, what is worse, that she would have preferred that the man she had gone with should return to her place. It is the character's relationship with women that makes this film so odious; the fact that his wife is taller than he symbolizes his relationship with the other gender; He is constantly humiliated by them, and it is through their relationships with them that their life is not as great as it could have been. This is also clearly shown by the way he treats his wife after a drink. He lost his job as a policeman because of the lust of a woman, and even of his wife; A woman who is supposed to love him never shows any affection for him. Even in the end, his wife is more concerned about what she and her daughter will do than about the state of her husband. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Four Seasons is a completely unpleasant movie. There is not a scene in the movie where someone is happy, and not only that; but the film seems deliriously happy to wallow in the misery of its central characters. The film is certainly not recommended to anyone who is currently having difficulties, that's for sure. Despite all the misery, the film never leaves the limits of reality; every event in this movie can, and most likely, has happened, and that only serves to make the film more impactful. The film is, of course, directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; the cult German director who committed suicide in 1982. This is just my second sample of man's work, but through only two films, it's easy to get an idea of ​​the kind of art he creates. Both films are trampled and rough, but they are realistic pieces of art. His characterization in this film is subtle; we only know the characters through their difficult situation and not through their character. This is a very smart way to show the audience that it is their environment that defines the people in the film, not the people themselves, and as almost everyone who sees the film knows what it is like to live in an urban society, it will not be difficult for them. The majority of people with whom to relate. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Four Seasons is not a movie that is easy to forget; The film is high in substance and low in style, and that makes it a memorable image, and one that all those who consider themselves movie fans should experience. It is with that in my mind that I give my highest recommendations to this movie; It's not sweet and it's not nice, but you will not see a more realistic portrait of depression, and this is definitely a movie that will stay with you.
