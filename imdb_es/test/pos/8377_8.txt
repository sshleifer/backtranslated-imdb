A fast-paced and entertaining noir located in Vienna just after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who can not find legal work because he does not have any documents. Without documents means that there is no work permit, which means that there is no way to obtain a passport. He survives by driving a friend's taxi at night. If he gets caught, it means three months in jail. One night, he picks up a fare at a large hotel and takes the man to the office of an airline. Buka takes the man's luggage and returns to the car. There he finds that his client has acquired an unnecessary hole in the back of his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they will grab you very quickly. No, he needs time to think this. Drive to a secluded place, empty man's pockets and hide the body. Now he has a US passport and a lot of cash! Go through a contact in the underworld to change the photo of the passport. Now he just needs to go to the man's hotel and pick up the man's plane ticket. Your ticket to freedom! Needless to say, it would be too simple. Waiting in the hotel is the lover of the dead man, Joan Camden. Camden is fleeing her rather nasty husband, Francis Lederer, Lederer is, of course, the pig that had hit the man in Buka's cab. Camden calls the police because he thinks Buka has stolen his lover. Buka shows her new passport and manages to talk to get out of the mess. Camden is broken when husband Lederer appears at the police station. Lederer convinces the police. Camden suffered a mental crisis and she is released. He escapes again, finds Buka and the two decide to flee the country together. Lederer reappears and Buka must decide if helping Camden deserves his freedom. This movie is much better than what I'm making sound of. Buka is best known as the low life police killer in the 1950s "Between Midnight and Dawn." The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey.
