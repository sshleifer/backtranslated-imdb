"Why are there so many songs about the rainbow, and what's on the other side?" Kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of "The Muppet Movie" while singing his lead song, "The Rainbow Connection." As time passes, the question and the movie only gain depth. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give up reviewing this movie as a comedy for children, but consider it a classic for all generations. love with serious ideals and a comforting message that gains more warmth with each passing year. <br /> <br /> As the milestones of my own life come upon me, I hear more and more the evocative tendencies of that elemental element. , and realize that it can adapt to the soundtrack of anyone's life, because we all dream. And that's what this movie is about. It's not just a group of puppets, it's a group of puppets that have the strength to pursue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> And while the humor and joy of the movie always feel good, they are not a fair judge of the movie. Only "The Rainbow Connection" and the powerful emotions it will perform. And everything fits: "Rainbow Connection" * is * the movie Muppet, and vice versa. Existentialism meets child entertainment: there is no easier way to describe it.
