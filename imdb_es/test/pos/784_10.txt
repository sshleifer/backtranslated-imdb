I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and I must say that I thought it was incredible. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile. The film was about a seventeen-year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. Ben, the seventeen-year-old, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls, driving and life. It is very comical and moving. Honestly, I must say that it is now one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. If you did not see one of the presentations at the film festival, it is supposed to be released in theaters later in the year. Please go and see it! It's a great movie.
