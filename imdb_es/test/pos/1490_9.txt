Rowan Atkinson offers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean, who never goes far without his teddy bear. Mr. Bean's appeal is largely his childish behavior and his innocence. We do not know if it came from heaven or from another planet. It's the kind of strange character that you can not easily recover. He is often alone and accustomed to it. He has difficulty communicating through speech, which may be the reason why we only hear his grunts at times. There are other characters that speak to him and he responds. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is. Live alone and do the unthinkable when you can do the sensible. Mr. Bean is rather a strange man who does not care much. She prefers to live a simple life with her yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to be able to get to work on time.
