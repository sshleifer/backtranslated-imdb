I was really starting to enjoy this show. He just started slowly and was not given the opportunity he deserved. It's summer, many people are not at home watching television. I know there are some talent and singing competitions, but I enjoy them like so many others. Believe it or not, when American Idol is done for the year, I miss it. Although this was not an American idol, I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers in the show that we are really starting to grow in me. I would like you to reconsider and put the show back on. I think it was a hurried move to cancel. My only complaint about the program is that I was not too interested in the judges.
