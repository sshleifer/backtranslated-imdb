I hope that the summary line will not irritate you so much (it's a little tribute to Chappelle Show / Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I will try to put all the things that I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything that I did not like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things! The quote "strong bloody violence" (which is used on the scoreboards to describe the content of a movie, fits very well here.) This is not a movie for children! Or for the weakest of heart! as a central element The character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a story thread crazy enough to contain / justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very attractive and clever.The action scenes are also great here. < br /> <br /> OK for the things that I did not like, the general story is too thin, it's enough, as I wrote above, to keep the action scenes together, but there could be more, and a character like Blade deserves more (imo) is not the best ... also its use of clich√©s does not help ... Some characters are subscribed ... That's it !: o)
