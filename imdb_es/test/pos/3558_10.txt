Based to a certain degree on the writers, David Croft and Jimmy Perry's, own experiences as animators of Butlins Holiday Camp in the United Kingdom during the same time scale as the program, "Hello to everything!" it embodies the postcard mood of postwar Britain. Located in the fictional town of Crimpton-on-Sea, "Hi-De-Hi" chronicles the comic events within the Maplins Holiday Camp, one of the many splashed British coastline, owned by the mega-rich, but never seen (on screen) Joe Maplin. <br /> <br /> Although the real show began in 1980 with the pilot episode and lasted until 1988, when the BBC considered it too moderate. for the avant-garde comedy department, seasons 1-5 were focused in 1959, while seasons 6-9 were focused in 1960, a time when the old British vacation camp began to decline. During the first 5 seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (played brilliantly in the evening, the great Simon Cadell was the entertainment manager of the camp, a well-intentioned, if somewhat thoughtful, former university professor who freed himself from his high-class background and ventured into the "real" world to lead his team of entertainment staff that was in stark contrast to his own relaxed personality.From seaso n 6 onwards, Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin when Cadell left the program at the the heyday of his popularity), a former war hero of the RAF who, in many ways, was similar to Cadell's character in the background, but more a scoundrel than a gentleman. <br /> <br /> However, the true stars of "Hi-De-Hi" throughout the nine seasons were Ted Bovis (played superbly by Paul Shane), a stereotypical working class, drinking beer. bsceno - someone who could never resist the opportunity to touch the campers; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc who is currently experiencing a resurgence of her career with appearances in the hit BBC comedy, "Little Britain"), head of Yellowcoat (what was called the entertainment staff because of its bright yellow jackets ) and sports organizer, but more importantly, the only person who saved Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster from shame by covering up their inexperience by running a holiday camp; Peggy Ollerenshaw (Her Pollard), the unsuspecting but at the same time adorable house maid, with a burning ambition to become a yellow jacket, and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), Ted's innocent protégé who learns more about "show business "of what I expected. <Br /> <br /> As usual in a Croft & Perry production, the cast of characters gathered was a group of misfits interpreted excellently by the actors involved. Mr. Partridge (played by the late Leslie Dwyer, who was about 70 when he left the program), the child alcoholic artist who hates children; Fred Quilly (Felix Bowness), a former jockey champion with a dubious past; Yvonne & Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Dianne Holland & Barry Howard), the former ballroom dancers who were in the twilight of their careers; and Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard), the two main Yellowcoats girls who were always looking for the kind of fun that Joe Maplin would never allow in one of their camps. <br /> <br /> "Hi-Of-Hello" typified the slapstick era of the late 1950s with its spicy flavor and, to some extent, a vulgar "ironic" humor (jokes about people sitting in the toilets and anecdotes about "women with large knockers" were the order of the day). But despite its fun smell "Carry On", it was always so innocent and became something recommended by the family in the 80's. Of course, critics of the program commented that the program had exceeded its acceptance for a good couple of years, but I do not agree. While the early seasons focused mainly on capricious humor and slapstick, the latest series of "Hi-De-Hi" saw how they put more thoughts into the scripts and the main characters (especially Spike Dixon and Gladys Pugh) were able to Grow with a more sensitive story. lines. That said, there were some criticisms of the show. Clive Dempster was not Jeffrey Fairbrother, and the first one did not have screen chemistry with Gladys as Jeffrey (I personally think it would have been more credible if Gladys had married Jeff); five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than a few errors of continuity (the disappearance of old faces and introductions of new characters were not explained correctly, especially with yellow jackets that came and went very regularly; of Gladys Pugh, who, in the pilot episode was conceived as a lover of free love who suddenly became a naive virgin of character.Also to mention quite pedantically, most of the holiday season of 1959 was covered in the first season, so lengthening the rest of the year in another five series was unbelievable, however, the show was not meant to be meticulously watched, and comedy far outweighed its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> All In total, "Hi-De-Hi" was probably one of the last comedies of the BBC's Golden Period, and even if it never managed to compete with pillars of British comedians Like "Only Fools & Horses", "Porridge" or even "Last Of Summer Wine", "Hi De Hi" will be bes. It was remembered as a comedy that the whole family could enjoy. If you have not checked it yourself, I beg you to do it.
