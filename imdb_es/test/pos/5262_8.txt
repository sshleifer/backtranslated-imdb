An excellent comedy drama about the powers of friendship. Although it is a new version of a 1939 film with the same title, it would probably be compared to Sex And The City. I would not compare it completely. The story begins with Mary (Meg Ryan), who seems to be the life that most women would envy, is happily married, has a good daughter, great friends and a great home. But Mary's perfect life is not what it seems, when she discovers that her husband is cheating on her with Crystal (Eve Mendes) of Zach. Mary is confused and does not know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith) try to be there for her in any way they can. I really do not want to give further. But I found this nice, and I am a man. Meg Ryan is great, it's good to see her again on the screen, after a series of failures. And the rest of the cast is great too, including Eve Mendes as Crystal. Just a fun gay comedy.
