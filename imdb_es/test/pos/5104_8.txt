Yes, the 1939 version / Robert Donat-Greer Garson was the best ... Perfection ... Donat won the Oscar in a very difficult year ... Gable in GWTW and James Stewart as Mr. Smith. They were 2 of its competitors. .wow it was a difficult year ... Most critics in New York hated this version. So do not see in the theater! Finally I saw this A.M. at TCM and I enjoyed ... Peter O'Toole was excellent and I'm glad I was nominated for an Oscar for this, and especially pleased, Oscar finally awarded him a special prize last year ... Petula Clark was as good as Mrs. Chips but his character, I feel that it was badly written ... Some good songs esp. You and I ... sung by Ms.Clark and then recorded by many others, including T.Bennett / S. Bassey and Carmen MacRae ... the black and white version was more authentic ... but this is a good movie beautifully photographed in color and panavision ... which is worth seeing and Bravo, again, Mr. O'Toole!
