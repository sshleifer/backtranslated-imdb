Argument: Ed and Alice are engaged. They live together and live a boring life. He has slept around before meeting Alice. She has much less experience. She decides that she needs to sleep around before getting married. He reluctantly accepts that both should see other people for a while. <br /> <br /> At first he is not really interested in that. His wild days are behind him and he is simply happy. Until one day, Alice comes back and tells her that she got a random boy; which of course begins to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a BAD idea that causes extreme tension in the relationship. <br /> <br /> Good movie. You can see the shock of the next train but it's still good. <br /> <br /> It's worth renting it.
