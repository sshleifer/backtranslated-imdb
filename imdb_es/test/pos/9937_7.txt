The opera (the title of the United States is terror in the opera) is somewhat disappointing after some of Dario's other films, such as Phenomena, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can not find Inferno anywhere.) It's one of those movies that has an excellent first half, but halfway it's like someone starts letting the air out of the script and logic. <br /> <br /> the basics the plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being harassed by a fanatic obsessed. This killer begins to kill people close to her in a unique way. She ties her up, tricks her, and sticks small sharp pins under her eyelids, so that if she tries to close her eyes, she will pull it out of her eyes. This forces her to watch while the murderer murders his acquaintances in the typically brutal and bloody manner of Argento. Unfortunately, almost half of the movie becomes slow and illogical. (This is especially aimed at the murderer's motivations - I have not yet fully figured out why he's so crazy.) The end comes out especially from the left field in the worst possible sense. <br /> <br /> but, for Around the first hour, more or less, this is one of the best films of Dario and the work of the camera is impressive. Too bad he could not keep it until the end. <br /> <br /> rating: 7
