It's very nice to see Bruce Willis come down from his throne of action and see that he really is a talented actor. It shines in this film as the image consultant of almost 40 years of age who has totally lost contact with his inner child, until he finds him face to face. This is one of those rare movies that does not talk to your audience and really offers something for the whole family. It's about taking care of each other, keeping the child inside you and realizing that you do not grow exactly as you thought. Willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with children (just witness "The Sixth Sense" with Haley Joel Osment), and has a great chemistry with Spencer Breslin here. There is good photography and music, and the ending is wonderful and uplifting. A great movie to watch with EVERY member of your family.
