I had completely forgotten about "Midnight Madness" until now when I found it while navigating the IMDB. Now, everything is coming back to me ... <br /> <br /> It was one of Naughton's first films (as well as Fox's) and sharp-eyed connoisseurs will also select Kaplan (Henry's "Alice" from television), Fiedler (makes the voice of Piglet in the cartoons of "Winnie the Pooh") and Blocker (son of Dan "Hoss" Blocker of "Bonanza" of television). <br /> <br /> But the two stand out in my mind are Furst (from "Animal House") and the superdude himself - Eddie Deezen. Furst plays a villain this time and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad: "Why can not you accept me for what I am?" His father looks at his obese, disheveled frame and gives a simple one-word answer: "Yuck!" <br /> <br /> And Deezen ... well, he's a show in itself. Like Jerry Lewis of the last days, he stumbles, walks through the minigolf ponds, puts melon halves in his ears and ends up making Maggie Roswell fall in love with him. My hero. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it's a stupidity typical of the early 80s when college students get up after curfew and go on a treasure hunt all over the city to show what division of Students is the best on campus: athletes, nerds, rich children, feminists or the group formed by a little of each. <br /> <br /> Who wins? Who cares, you'll have a lot of fun watching Disney Pictures' first foray into PG territory before creating Touchstone Pictures. <br /> <br /> Seven stars. Capture the "Midnight Madness" as you can! <br /> <br /> Long live Leon!
