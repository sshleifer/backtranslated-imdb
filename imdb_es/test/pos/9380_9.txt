Never the words "hidden gem" have been so precise. Lovers of bad movies can search everywhere for the next hidden darkness, sometimes they fall short with things like Weasels, but my luck will prevail and it is possible that you end up with something like the Deathbed, and I hope that we will later Mind you, it's not a bad idea. The film at all, only has a bad title, and not even a bad title, but a humorous one that could throw you out, but somehow, Death Bed still fits in the category of "bad". With a gloomy and empty atmosphere, Death Bed is a true masterpiece of low budget horror, reserved only for those lucky enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision. <br /> <br /> Death Bed implies an incoherent, however, an intriguing relationship between a demon in bed and the cute ghost caught in the portrait, who just wants to be able to avoid someone the terrible fate of being devoured by the yellow foam. Although it is not so frightening, considering that it is a mortal bed, Death Bed has the qualities that make the horror successful. A desolate, dark vibration, confusion, a mysterious, subtle note and that quality of dream that this masterpiece almost flaunts. Such quality, or vibrates usually seems unintentional. Not only is it intentional, but from what I've read, Death Bed is based on a real dream. George Barry, the director, successfully transferred the dream to the film, only a genius could perform that task. <br /> <br /> The old mansions create a horror of good quality, as do the portraits, not knowing what to do with the murderous bed with its murderous yellow liquid, a rather strange dream, in fact. Also, this is not the B-horror mark I expected, considering the title and everything. Before seeing this Gothic gem, I expected something more like the Massacre of the class reunion, now that it's a bad movie, if you've seen it, you know what I'm saying. After considering all of the above, I feel that Death Bed deserves only eight stars, but since it remained so dark for so long, we will say that the bed he eats deserves nine.
