I have seen this movie on 3 different occasions. On the first occasion, I was surprised by this movie. It appeared like a very nice movie for me. I hated this movie as sentimental trash on my second visualization. However, my third visualization reaffirmed my belief that it is a good movie. There is a lot of emotional power in this movie, especially the scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr. Kramer and Madam Kramer. There are some scenes in which Meryl Streep seems a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life. Dustin Hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to deal with the recent task of custody of his son. There was even a controversy in the filming of this movie. According to the master cameraman Nestor Almendros, there was a shot in which he only escaped hurting himself when the character of Mr. Kramer, to show the intensity of his anger, decided to break a glass with force. Fortunately, nothing happened to Nestor. Kramer against Kramer shows the destruction of a family structure. As fa Mily should be maintained if there are children involved.
