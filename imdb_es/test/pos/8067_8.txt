Annie Rooney lives with her father and her brother Tim in the slums of New York, where she constantly engages in many fights with the other children in the neighborhood. Annie, secretly, is in love with Joe Kelly (whose little brother Mickey is the gang boss that Annie is constantly fighting), who is in a gang that is headed for trouble, says Officer Rooney. Kelly sponsors a dance, where Tony plans to shoot Kelly to match him for making him look foolish in front of his girlfriend, but Officer Kelly is badly hurt. Tony and his friend Spider tell Tim (part of Kelly's gang) that Kelly shot his father, so he goes after him in revenge. Annie finds out about this and will arrest her brother, if he arrives on time. Very good mix of humor and heart in this film, although the plot does not begin until 40 minutes of the film. Pickford is nice (although he was 33 years old playing a girl no more than 12-13) and really gets into his character. Haines does not play Kelly as hard as he should, but he can make the audience feel for him emotionally. The scenes in which the officer tells Annie about the death of his father and the ending really make a lump in his throat. The mix of all kinds of children throughout the film is fun to watch. Score, 8
