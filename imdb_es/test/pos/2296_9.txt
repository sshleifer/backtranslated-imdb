Many of the comments seem to treat this movie like a baseball movie, but I think this is only secondary. It really is about living in Japan, and it really succeeds. <br /> <br /> I spent a few years living in Japan, and I guess the reason why this movie was not so good is that you have to have experienced Japan to get it. I was seeing this with a very traveled friend who has never been to Japan, and he noticed that many of the events in the film were so ridiculous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief. My response was that those events were the absolute truth of life in Japan! <br /> <br /> I think it's definitely worth watching this movie, especially if you've lived in Japan or you're interested.
