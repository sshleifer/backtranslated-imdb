Thorn-BMI has no business, before they stopped making movies, they made a chiller movie. Using E.S.P. and telekinesis as the base of the daughter whose father dominated a terrible power. Alone on the death of her father, Olivia discovered that her father nicknamed Raymarkovitch's 'Raymar' had actually murdered 6 girls and was planning two more using the technique of psychic vampirism. <br /> <br /> Our image starts with 6 forensic wagons coming in and the music to match the great discovery of the 6 girls. Dead all with eyes wide open in a closet. There were all sorts of objects on the walls, outsiders were pulling an old man, when a blue beam hit the ceiling, which caused a circular hole to form, which made the film more strange. <br /> <br /> If you like Extremely chilling scenes this is for you. Unless you can see corpses from years ago at each level of decay, do not see it without a friendly companion. As "The Changeling" has a heart that stops the horror. I gave this a rating of 7, it's in color, the actress Meg Tilly debuted in this movie if you can find her.
