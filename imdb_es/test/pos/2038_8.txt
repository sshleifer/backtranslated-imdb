I am a fan of action movies, but until today I have never seen a preview or an advertisement of this film in Italy, so I went to see "The Good Kiss Goodnight" on pay television without expecting anything special. <br /> <br /> But, what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and fun action movie ever made. <br /> <br /> The transformation of Samantha / Charly from the common wife-teacher The cold-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. The action scenes and the acrobatics are the best I've seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best phrases I've heard and his chemistry with Geena Davis is good. <br /> <br /> And what about Geena? She is wonderful, she plays the best heroine of action that has ever been seen and makes strong, convincing and fantastic performances. <br /> <br /> So I think this movie had weak box office performances and bad reviews because most of the critics and some types The audiences have difficulties with strong female lead roles. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
