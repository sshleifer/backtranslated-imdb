I've seen this movie again and again, every time it makes me laugh, it makes me think and it makes me cry. Robin Tuney does an incredible job of portraying Marcy (and I'm glad that Kate Winslet and the other lady reject their part) is just one of those rolls that you know no one else could have compared. <Br /> <br /> It's a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in fucking situations that come together. They are side by side no matter what, even if they are in a strange and crazy situation. <br /> <br /> I will tell you that it is not for everyone, of all those who showed it to I I would say that the results are 50/50, but if you like it, you will love it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!
