An article in the New York Times of March 1947 described Crossfire as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to "confront racial and religious prejudice with a more direct value than the public was accustomed to expect." While RKO produced Crossfire, Twentieth Century-Fox was doing Gentleman's Agreement, another story about anti-Semitism. RKO rushed to beat the very fierce photo of Fox to the theaters, launching Crossfire several months before the Gentleman Agreement. In July 1947, RKO selected Crossfire for representatives of various religious groups in Los Angeles. In addition, several surveys, which were designed to measure the prejudices of the audience, were made before and after the screenings of the film. Crossfire received praise and criticism for its representation of anti-Semitism in the United States and was the subject of many editorials. Crossfire received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, but lost the Gentleman Agreement. He was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame), Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). In September of 1947, Crossfire was named the best social film in Cannes. In December 1947, Ebony magazine, an African-American publication, awarded the film its annual prize for "improving interracial understanding." I really liked that movie. If you have the opportunity to see it, look at it.
