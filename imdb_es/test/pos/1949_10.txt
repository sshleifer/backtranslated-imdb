I did not expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies that I thought I would only watch because I was on TV. I certainly underestimated this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a boy who kills his girlfriend and boasts of his friends. I was very happy with the performance, they had the characters well interpreted. It was a particularly great scene when Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) are talking to each other about why John killed Jamie. It is annoying to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel the control and for that. But Feck had loved the girl he had killed. Feck felt remorse while John felt nothing, hell, he was proud of what he had done. It really makes you think of people. Keanu Reeves did a great job as Matt and Ione Skye was good. It's weird to see her as valedictorian in 'Say Anything' and to her as Clarissa. Each actor did a great job ... acting. It was very nice for a change. It was a great movie and I would definitely say that I recommend it.
