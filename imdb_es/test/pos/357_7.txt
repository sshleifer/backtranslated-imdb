I would have to disagree with the previous comment. I saw this without expecting too much of it. The fact is that the cast was excellent, especially the teenage protagonist. The dark sides of all of them appeared, all were ruined in a non-obvious way. There was an underlying current that ran through the film of adolescent angst and sexuality. The role of the serial killer was also played well, since you could feel that he had gone through what they had when they were children. What this movie is, is a strong drama / thriller. Yes, I agree that they do not do the obvious, but you could relate to the adolescent heads that were wrong, did what they did and is credible. Also a decent dark ending, instead of what could have been so easily a happy exclusion option. The attention to detail in the movie was also fantastic. Very good solid 7 out of 10. A bit slow at times, but it allows a thinking person to see where the characters come from.
