Exclusively for the lovers of Coop, although Clint Eastwood is a great advantage of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private files, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc.). ), as an older man, finally as a sick man and close to death. After "the end", I did not have the feeling of knowing the man much better. But I've had a very good time, going back to seeing many of the best moments of his films; and my respect for the talented actor and great professional was multiplied by ten. The film shows, more interestingly, how Cooper's career can be parallel to the evolution of US society. UU Before and after the Second World War. Two of the great moments are the moment in which Cooper has to respond to justice about communism in the world of cinema; and when James Stewart (also very large) received a Prize for Cooper one month before his death. I'm not a weeping pot, but ... it was very close! Look at it, if you can: it's really worth it. ... If you love Cooper, that's it. Or an older America ...
