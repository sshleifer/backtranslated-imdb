Well, I can safely say that I am human, Wong. And I did not throw up. I laughed. And serious. If this movie made you throw up, there's something wrong with you. But this movie is incredible. I bought it four days ago and I've seen it 5 times already. Animal cruelty seizes my heart, but not enough to be guilty. The movie is shocking, disgusting and vulgar. The acting is horrible. What more do you want from a movie? I'm a fan of cult movies. Pink Flamingos is awesome. It makes Rocky Horror, as someone said, look like teletubbies.
