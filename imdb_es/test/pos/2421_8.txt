Growing up as a son of movies, one of the trilogies that I will not soon forget is Karate Kid. You can leave Ralph / Daniel as much as you want, but the message behind the movies is important, that it is important to be respectful of all creatures large and small, but to defend yourself when the moment demands it. Going back to the movie in question, it's quite funny because I saw Boys Do not Cry and I was really impressed with Hillary Swank's performance, and when I flipped through the sea of ​​channels the other night, I found proof of this. movie and I had not realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it. The story centers around Julie, like Daniel, not knowing where to fit or if she even wants to fit in and the teacher is hired to help her straighten her out and guide her. I really liked this addition to the series, as it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes, even some of the outfits that Hillary was in kept me, we would say stimulated. <br /> <br /> General 3.5 out of 5
