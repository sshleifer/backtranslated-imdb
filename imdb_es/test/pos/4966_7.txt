I wish I could have met Ida Lupino. When people ask you if you could invite 6 extraordinary people of the twentieth century to dinner, well, for me a person would be her. I think that now is one of the great forgotten personalities and not recognized in the film industry. The story of his life would be a great television movie (Hey, Mr. Bogdanovich ........). Ida Lupino has been the engine of many of the fascinating films of the 40s and 50s. I remember being saddened to see her reduced to a horrible part in a scary AIP movie in the late 70s. She was bitten by a large worm in the sink from the kitchen. Ugh I should have contacted her then, since she died soon after ... also more for the part than for the worm. From High Sierra, Roadhouse and the extraordinary RKO On Dangerous Ground thriller, Ida Lupino was often the producer and lead actress. Later, with her husband Howard Duff, they produced many now-timeless noir dramas that are still very fascinating today. One of them is JENNIFER, which I think is the last movie with copyright of Monogram Pictures. Monogram changed the name of the company formally to Allied Artists in 1953 and JENNIFER has both company names in the opening credits. This is a top haunted house thriller, as terrifying as The Innocents and The Haunting made 8 years later. Really spooky and very spooky, this little movie is exactly the kind of really good movie that Ida Lupino did and was responsible for. Try to find him ... he will always remember him and, as I think, a lot of admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress / producer.
