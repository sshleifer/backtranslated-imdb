Take a subject that I did not know much about and make it exciting, why do not you do it? It happens that in 1979, the director Robert Altman said that he did not believe he had made a real movie and that he expected one of these children to ride skateboards, if he does not break his neck, the first movie does. Well, I would not put such an expectation on Stacy Peralta, but he is a skater who has made a good movie. Of course, he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing images, and it is certainly good that there were so many archival images. Peralta edited it well along with unusual head shots from his former colleagues as they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense, but it has been done. Altman's prediction has not come true. However, what Peralta has done is to capture the energy of those days so exciting that we can appreciate how it should have been when the Z-Boys invented the modern skateboard. All this is fine. I highly recommend "Dogtown".
