When I first saw the announcement of this, I said: 'Oh, here we go. He's done High School Musical, but he can not go ahead with that, so now he's showing up at other Disney shows. ' Personally, I love The Suite Life and I'm a big fan of Ashely Tisdale. But for some reason, I'm not very interested in Zac Efron, although all my friends think it's the best since Jesse McCartney. But he really bothers me. Anyway, I saw the program (taking a break from the English courses) and I was pleasantly surprised. The performances were good in all aspects, especially the usual characters from The Suite Life, and Zac Efron was not as bad as he had anticipated. In short, a very good show.
