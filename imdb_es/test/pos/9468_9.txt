I saw this movie in a special screening. At first I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The film is based on Shakespeares' book "The Twelth Night." This film tells the story of a girl who lives to play football. Well, when the women's team is cut, she has to make great efforts to be part of the boys team at a different school to take revenge on the selfish boys team at her old school. On her way, she is trapped in a long web of love, lies and deceit. This movie is from this year Mean Girls. I think it shows some of the new abilities of the great actors and, definitely, there are some great stars that will be presented in this film.
