A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She is not yet a star, but she gets a great break when she is chosen as a cover girl for Vanity, whose owner was really in love with her grandmother. When he sees the resemblance, he chooses it immediately for a contest in which his maganzine runs. Hayworth's new fame at first works great for Kelly's club, but her star soars so fast and so high that her dominance over her begins to waver. This is not the most original of the graphics, but the two drivers really make it work. It also helps that the script is great. Kelly is not yet at its peak, especially his peak as an actor. His dance, however, wow. Hayworth is the star, but Kelly claims the most memorable moment of the film while dancing passionately with his own reflection. Obviously it's a takeoff of the dance in the shadow of Fred Astaire in Swing Time, but I think Kelly lifts it, which is not credible. In fact, this has to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history, except perhaps the An American finale in Paris several years later. The rest of the songs are also excellent, and the musical numbers are even better. Too bad Rita did not sing her own songs (well, she may have a couple of them, since her singing voice seems to be different sometimes). His dance is wonderful, as is the rest of his performance. It's hard not to love her in anything. She is truly one of the few truly beautiful women of the classical era. Not plastic like many of them; No, you can really see the heat in that woman. His smile is so disarming. Phil Silvers has the role of Kelly's best friend, and it's also fun. The Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers trio is obviously the nucleus that became the Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connor trio in Singin 'the the Rain eight years later. One of the biggest musical numbers in the movie seems almost completely stolen with the number "Good Morning" in Singin '. I think Singin 'in the Rain is the best movie, since Cover Girl is a bit rough. This harshness, however, only adds to the charm. There are aspects of this film that beat Singin 'in the Rain, and even An American in Paris. For example, the central relationship is more emotionally enveloping. Instead of the dominant older man chasing the girl (after all, Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers), we have a very good relationship with two people who seem more equal. There is no need to go around, an aspect that unfortunately makes many of the best musicals a bit bitter, you have to admit it. Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the beginning, and when that starts to fall apart, I really felt it. 9/10.
