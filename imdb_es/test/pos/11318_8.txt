This movie was really interesting ... it's also quite shocking, since similar events happened only 10 months after the movie premiered. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see the problems that can be found and realistic enough. to show that no matter how prepared you are, you are not. If this were done for a US audience, it would be different because they would have used it as a full-length propaganda film and not as a wake-up call from the BBC. It is still propaganda, to some extent, no film today with these issues can not be, but tackled the problem successfully. <br /> <br /> a movie that should be shown in all courses on terrorism / antiterrorism, but it will not do so because it shows flaws that can not be recognized! A great movie in which the BBC took some risks and, unfortunately, London no longer needs a fiction story, due to the reality of July 7, 2005.
