I saw this movie, when it first came out. Patty did not want to be separated from her brothers. However, the juvenile justice system does not care. When Patty looked at the case file, the judge sent her to a juvenile detention center. He claimed that she violated the privacy rules when looking at private files. She just wanted her family together. I could not blame her. The parents were not even fit parents. One of the youngest children had to have a bath. The father stopped and let them go. He walked away from him and left the children stranded at the service station. Patty had to take authority to protect them, since she was the oldest. They were placed in foster homes. The good thing is that the social worker recovered them as a family. The chief social worker was still telling him to go all out and not interfere. I was crazy about power. He was the one who had Patty at the youthful facility. Why did not they persecute the Father, who was released from prison, by abandonment? However, children are stuck in the middle and feel insecure.
