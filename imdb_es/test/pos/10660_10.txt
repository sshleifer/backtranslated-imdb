The silent film masterpiece, Battleship Potemkin (1925), was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the 1905 revolt and to establish the event as a heroic omen of the October Revolution of 1917. Ironically, the director of the film, Sergei Eisenstein, was one of the first and most influential advocates of a formalist approach to film art. Subsequently, Eisenstein's formalism and suspicious politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies that insist on "socialist realism." Influenced by the theorist of Russian cinema, Lev Kuleshov, and through him by the intolerance of DW Griffith (smuggled to Russia in 1919), Eisenstein built his films from a "collision" of rapidly edited images, a montage of varied shots in length, movement and content. , lighting, and camera angle. Undoubtedly, the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach, and probably the most cited and studied sequence in the history of world cinema, is the sequence of the "Odessa steps" in Potemkin. <br /> <br /> In the structure, Potemkin is a "five Reeler" divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the arrangement of five acts of Western drama. In "Men and Maggots," Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and discontent of navigators of the ironclad working class as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny. Even before the sailors and their superior class officers / teachers are presented visually, Eisenstein symbolically establishes the revolutionary conditions through the collision of the waves that break in a violent and sinister way in the sea. On board the ship we are witnesses of overcrowded and unhealthy conditions. Eisenstein emphasizes the dehumanization of the sailors with shots of arbitrary whipping, hard work and, most memorably, the meat infested with worms for dinner. The short-sighted doctor is taken by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suited to be served with the dark soup, boiling like the rage of the sailors. According to Marxist maxims, the church also fails men, and we see one of them breaking a plate with words from The Lord's Prayer from two different camera angles (perhaps in the first "cut cut" deliberated in history of the cinema). Br /> <br /> Identified by inter-titles such as "Drama in the Quarterdeck" and "An Appeal from the Dead", the second and third parts of Potemkin represent the royal riot and the funeral on the ground of their leader and first hero of the revolution, Vakulinchuk. Joined by Vakulinchuk's appeals to the brotherhood, the initial mutineers were joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers. There follows a chaotic scene whose violent passion is served well by the editing techniques of Eisenstein. The officers' quarters are trampled and the symbols of their privilege are destroyed. The doctor of the ship is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic cuts to the meat loaded with worms and their lenses that hang metonimicamente in the rig. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the revolt (there is no tortilla without breaking eggs) and it is presented with dignity on a dock in Odessa. Hundreds of ordinary citizens of Odessa meet with the sailors to honor him and promise "Death to the oppressors." The fist shots that tighten and loosen signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness. <br /> <br /> The complex and unforgettable sequence of the Odessa Steps constitutes the fourth act of the film. It begins with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the exalted faces of various people on the shore and selected objects (parasol, glasses, baby stroller). Suddenly (as a letter of title in large letters exclaims), the music stops and the ranks of soldiers with rifles drawn and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. Here Eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing when almost one hundred shots are put together to counter the panic and victimization of citizenship with the relentless assault of soldiers leading citizens to the trampling horses and flying sables of the Cossacks that wait below. . The staging is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom, symbolic metonyms of the oppressive institutions of Russia: the Tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian church. <br /> <br /> Scoring The sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children. In the first, one of the first victims of the massacre was a mother and a child who had been presented among the cheerful faces of the crowd. The child is shot, but the mother keeps running until the close-ups of her face express their horrified look at the fallen body of the son being trampled by the crowd. With a very slow editing pace, the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her son up the stairs to face the soldiers (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). They summarily shoot the dead. After this pause, the carnage continues for several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot in the stomach (Mother Russia's womb?) While trying to protect her baby in her car. In a famous scene in The Untouchables, the carriage slides incongruously by the stairs. The horrified faces of the huddled citizens observe the slow progress towards their destiny. When the car reaches the bottom, there is a cut in the Cossack with a sword and the classic Kuleshov effect suggests what we do not really see: the sacrifice of this pure and symbolic innocent. The final series of shots in the Odessa sequence is of three stone lions, one at rest, one sitting and one roaring. The edition encourages them in a visual metaphor of the awakening fury of the people. <br /> <br /> In a somewhat anticlimactic way, the fifth act returns us to the battleship when the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await a meeting with other ships. the fleet. They and the spectator expect retribution, but when the meeting takes place no shots are fired and instead, all the sailors salute and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of camaraderie. Eisenstein was rewriting history at this point, since the revolution was not launched successfully for another twelve years. But aside from that, Battleship Potemkin is one of the fundamental works of the silent film era and retains an extraordinary cinematic power.
