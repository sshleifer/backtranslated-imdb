The first spoken words of Garbo in this 1930 film electrified the audience and became part of the Hollywood legend. Garbo had become a star in his first American film, The Torrent, in 1926. And audiences waited until this movie to see if Garbo could make the transition to talkies. She did. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banky and Renee Adoree stayed on the road due to their accents, Garbo continued sailing for another decade. Despite the stupidity of this film, Garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally great Marie Dressler as Marthy. The two big stars exchange dirty glances and sharp words as they measure each other as they drink a few glasses and set the tone for the rest of the movie. Garbo was 25 years old; Dressler was 60 years old. Charles Bickford is fine as Matt, and George F. Marion is as good as Old Chris. Marion originated this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in the silent version of 1923 with Blanche Sweet. This work by Eugene O'Neill is a true classic, although, curiously, it was never recorded again. Anna Christie is one of the best performances of Garbo. And despite the stupidity of the film and the seriousness of the story, she is truly a marvel. See this one for Garbo and Dressler!
