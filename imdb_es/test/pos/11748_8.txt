Age can not tarnish the beauty of this love story from east to west for me. Ignoring the famous and lovely song of the title and its lyrics, what we have is a dramatized biography of two extraordinary people trapped in a moment of countercurrents that involve social conformity, bigotry, war, doubt and the need for immense value. With Hong Kong as a backdrop, this film tells the story of a Eurasian doctor and an American journalist who met and fell in love during the Korean War. Like Mark Elliott, William Holden is smart, windy and a little weak; Jennifer Jones is perhaps almost perfect like Dr. Han Suyin, both full of doubts and ecstatic, anxious and hesitant. Others in the big cast include Torin Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Matheson, Virginia Gregg, Richard Loo, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell; Many of Hollywood's best oriental actors also performed smaller non-accredited parts. The script of John Patrick followed closely the exquisite novel of Han; The direction of Henry King was solid as always. The thrust of the story is how unwilling Han was to fall in love with Elliott, his busy and demanding agenda as a doctor and his doubts about his future; and what fear he had, despite the intolerance and interference they faced when his adventure was known. The movie is undeniably physically busy, interesting and, often, beautiful too. The hill to which the lovers separate, the beautiful bay where they swim are located in a commercial city already very crowded and busy, large social events and crowded streets, corridors of hospitals and arteries full of traffic. With the photography of Leon Shamroy, the makeup of Ben Nye and the hairstyles of Helen Turpin, the great work of set decorators, sound and lighting, department of art and everything related, this must be one of the most memorable productions in a great city not American. All the time, and one of the most difficult to capture on film. However, what is most remembered here is that lovers, fortunately, are not extremely young, face the odds against them and evaluate exactly what they are, and then move on as if love mattered and conditions that are set as barriers to love do not. The high point of the matter is that Mark is going back to war; from then on Han receives his letters, even after she knows that he has been murdered; They look like messages from a better world. A world where hope is all that matters, value is the price of admission to that world, and it is always summer on a high, windy, secluded hill and above an area where beauty and individual desires can be victimized, subject to bad treatment. Fortune or set aside by the militant forces of evil. In truth, love is a thing of many splendors, says Dr. Han; and this film stands as one of the brilliant proofs of that doctrine, lucid as a pearl, timeless as a Chinese proverb and beautiful as polished jade in a coarse background.
