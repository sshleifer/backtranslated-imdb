Last night I had the great pleasure of watching the movie Hitch. I was stunned and amazed. Will Smith did a phenomenal job in a role he is not always associated with. He proved once and for all that he does not need to have a weapon to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I've always liked "The King of Queens", but this role really brought it to light more, and I hope to see it on the big screen much more in the near future. The movie was fun and adorable, and I recommend it to any guy as the best dating movie you can imagine. The mix of comedy, romance and drama left me feeling complete. It does not look like most "chicken movies" in the sense of tears and sadness, but it stands on its own and I think that males and females can enjoy equally. I encourage all couples, especially to see this movie, but even if you are not involved with someone, you can get some great ideas from Hitch. <br /> <br /> TWO WAYS GREAT PUMPS!
