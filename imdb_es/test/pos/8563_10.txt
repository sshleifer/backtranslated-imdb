This image was released in May 1979, starring Playboy Playmate Susan Kiger as Honey Shayne, Playboy Playmate Lisa London as O'Hara and Playboy Playmate Pamela Jean Bryant as Terri Lynn. In one of the most delicious comedies in the history of a drive-in, a group of young beauties bouncing come together in a story of struggles against sisters of sororities of women who will stop at nothing to undress everything. So, what does H.O.T.S really mean? You'll have to watch the movie to get the answer. You see, the girls are having problems with the society girls on campus that make them just maniacs coveted for sex. Therefore, the girls set out to discredit the girls of society no matter what they have to do to get the job done. Also, in this mess is the dean of the university who wants to dismantle the group of girls before they get out of control. I loved this movie especially Lisa London. I thought his acting was fantastic and I was disappointed that he did not get other acting jobs. Based on the three playmates alone, I give this movie 10 weasel stars.
