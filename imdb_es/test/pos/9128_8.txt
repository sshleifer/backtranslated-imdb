How good is this movie? Apparently, it's good enough for them to plan to do it again in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us Le doulos and The Good Thief, wrote and directed this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost a silence. These are men of few words, who prefer to let their actions speak for them. They live according to a code that governs each of their movements. <br /> <br /> There are some excellent actors in this movie: Alain Delon (The Leopard), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, Let's Make Love) and Gian Maria. Volonte (The Indian of A handful of dollars and a few dollars more). The movie does not shine on them; They are along the promenade that Melville has for them. Melville makes the movie; they do it better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville's work in the Ocean movies, but the idea only comes to mind. He can not make it work like he did. A great loss in the seventies, but his work is to our liking.
