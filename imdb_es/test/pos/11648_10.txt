After having read most of the comments, I feel that I also have a word to say. <br /> <br /> What bothers me the most is that most people here think that this movie is pro or against the theme of death. Grief and if it worked with them. I remember reading an article in 1995 when the film was published (yes, it has interested me so much since I found out that it would come out that I have not forgotten the articles I read back then) in which Tim Robbins said he did not want to do a movie to convince the audiences of one or the other. <br /> <br /> And I think that is completely correct. I must admit that I think that the way he did this movie, he leaned a little towards the side of the death penalty, but nevertheless, people can still make their own choice. And this is very rare in American movies. <br /> <br /> I have shown this movie to many people since it came out and I have seen all kinds of reactions. The supporters of the death penalty became opponents or even became stronger in their beliefs. And many opponents of the death penalty (including myself) became stronger in their belief that the death penalty should be abolished throughout the world. But I've even seen opponents become supporters. This and the fact that the people here seem to be fighting shows me that there really are many ways to see it. So, whatever effect it has on you, the important thing is that it makes you THINK. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies that really gives you the option, that you do not get scared with a simple way by making the condemned one bad or innocent. This can be difficult for people who prefer to be entertained or taught a lesson. There is no lesson here. You need to find one yourself. <br /> <br /> Everyone praises performance, direction and music, but since this has been said so many times, I will not repeat it again. <Br /> <br /> So if you have not seen it yet, do it - if you dare to be challenged!
