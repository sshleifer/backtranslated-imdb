This is a film by Oshima, the director of the notorious "In The Realm Of The Senses", a film so blatantly sexual and blatantly controversial that was banned for a time. This film takes place initially in 1895 in Japan and stars the very cute Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls in love with a much younger man who cheats on her. That man, Toyoji, approaches her while she is sleeping and seduces her, although she is soon ready to be seduced. Soon they are having a love affair and a plan to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever. They do it, and they throw him down a well. However, they did not count on the ghost of the dead husband who was persecuting Seki and others in town! This film is visually very impressive, the use of shadows that highlights this story of murder for passion. Ms. Yoshiyuki (who is still an active actress) is especially good at her role. It is sexual at times, but not as "In the realm of the senses". Something of what follows depends on our imagination. I found that this film has a consistency of humor that makes it very visible. A bit creepy but that goes with the territory. I would recommend this.
