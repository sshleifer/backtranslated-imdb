Good job. This is how I would describe this animated adventure of Scooby-Doo. So far, this is the best of the Scooby animated movies I've seen. I liked the story. I thought it had some depth. The movie is also good. paced.it does not get bored for a minute. It also has an interesting group of characters (in addition to Scooby and Shaggy and the gang, of course), in addition, the movie was a real explosion. I enjoy watching her. I also liked the great Scottish music. It was very catchy and infectious. Naturally, we know that Scooby and Gamg will solve the mystery, but it's still fun to get to that point. The animation is also pretty good for this movie. I love if they did a Scooby adventure in 3D animation, but we'll have to wait and see. For me, Scooby-Doo and the monster of Loch Ness is a 7/10
