Jackass Number Two is easily the most hilarious movie of 2006, beating the also hilarious Clerks II. It is one of the best sequels to recent memory, surpassing Jackass The Movie in every way. Now, this movie can be the most fun, but it is also the most offensive, frightening and absolutely unpleasant. You will feel sick several times throughout the movie. I am completely serious when I say do not eat anything before watching or during this movie, because it is likely that I will literally come back to torment you. Keep the drink to a minimum too. You have been warned, because, as the slogan says, it will make you ask for mercy. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two follows the blockbusters of the hit show Jackass, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Brandon DiCamillo and Jason 'Wee Man' Acuna (Chris 'Raab himself' Raab is absent) while performing the most extravagant life - Treatment, and disgusting tricks imaginable. I will not say what the stunts are, but I will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickly or psychologically terrifying, and that a cast member (once again, not counting) will flirt with death several times in the movie. <br /> <br /> What makes Jackass Number Two so entertaining is not the tricks themselves, but how the cast reacts to them and when making them. In short, if you loved doing it and had a great time, you will too (this is true for 99% of the stunts). All the acrobatics are very original, and 90% of them are never seen before. You will witness some recycled, but they are amplified. You would not think to really direct the factors in a movie like this, but it does; The direction of Jeff Tremaine makes the film much more fun, because it provides guidance for the gang in their comic time, which is simply brilliant on their part. He could have lain down and slept during the shoot (actually, you'll see in the movie he slept during a shoot), but he went out and helped these crazy people to make the maneuvers as fun as he could. I give Mr. Tremaine two thumbs for that. Another great thing about Jackass is his bonanza of famous people, and this time they include BMX legend Mat Hoffman, skateboard god Tony Hawk, director / actor Jay Chandrasekhar (Super Troopers & Beerfest), actor Luke Wilson, to the Miami Dolphins star Jason Taylor, and director / actor Mike Judge (office space). The scenes with Hoffman, Taylor and Chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film, as it is even more fun to see these men as part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is one of the most politically incorrect, morally degrading, and simply wrong movies of all time, if not the most. Despite this, it is so original and so fun that you will not mind. You will gasp for air, you will laugh so much that you will cry and jump from your seat laughing throughout the movie. Due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film, no one under 18 should watch this movie. You have been warned I hope you enjoy Jackass Number Two as much as I do. <br /> <br /> 10/10 --spy
