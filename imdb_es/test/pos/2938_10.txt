As if reality shows like "American Idol" were not enough, in which judges like Simon Cowell throw skills to the contenders trying to make their mark in the world of music - beards that have often reduced even the most outstanding singers to the tears After what was considered a "bad performance", now "America's Next Top Model" has invaded the tube with its own version of "Looking for the next big thing" in a business that values ​​superficiality, beauty concepts during the last three years. , and body dysmorphia. <br /> <br /> A concept created by Tyra Banks, who is also a judge in the program, brings together about fifteen participants from all walks of life and subjects them to countless "tasks" in which they must demonstrate their "talent" "in front of the camera and submit not only to the now deceased Janice Dickinson (self-styled" First US Supermodel "), but also to Jay Manuel and Nore Marin, who are equally malicious, who may at some point focus on a girl not It is working well and cheerfully ri Pass it in strips as if it were a bad morning coffee. As in many other reality-based programs, each week a participant is voted and she must pack her bags and leave immediately (something Tyra reminds them on each shift). Of course, there is the disturbing tension between several of the more A-type women, female ties, tears, the dramatic swell of music at key moments, and some really impressive images that transform beautiful, ordinary girls into unattainable goddesses. <Br /> <br /> I'll have to admit that the show is a guilty pleasure. Maybe it's the state of mind that I'm in, but I was wondering where the vomit was in cases where already thin girls would have to jump in to make the cut and look like the judges, the photographers and many inconstant designers would feel right. for the moment. Even so, it attracted me despite my previous paragraph, possibly because I've always been interested in the world of fashion and I've always loved seeing incredible women become even more extravagant with makeup and perfect lighting. But I wonder where they are going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It's as if they were competing with "Fear Factor". Shots that look like recreations of fight scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, shots where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations. Next: pose while tied to the train tracks while Amtrak approaches them at 70 miles. one hour? Or a shot where they are underwater, chained, trying to break free in record time while at the same time they seem to break the gauze, and never, never, never forget to smile at that camera with its pearly whites? How about a version of "Pit and the Pendulum" from a photo shoot? <br /> <br /> In one thing, the program should receive some congratulations, and in some way is similar to "American Idol". With this I will probably justify the harshness of both programs and their abrasive judges, and I will essentially go against my initial paragraph. "America's Next Top Model" is a program that is an extended audition, like "American Idol", and in it the girls will get the kind of test treatment they will receive in the real world, where possible designers and photographers, as monstrously inconstant as they can be, they will be crushed to pieces in the blink of an eye if they can not be sold as expected, and when one is asked to leave, another will replace it with the necessary requirements. Which makes it a wonder that any girl wants to enter such a difficult environment, but that's what dreams are made of. <br /> <br /> As he enters his fifth season, he has been a big disappointment with the departure of Janice Dickinson. ; during her career she was a rather difficult barometer in terms of how girls should walk, talk, express themselves, express themselves and, ultimately, present themselves as a living, traveling product sold. With the cold addition of Twiggy I wonder where he will go from here: Twiggy simply can not replace Dickinson's excessive temper. So with Janice's absence, the show has lost some of its advantage and may even have signaled its slow demise, but in the meantime, it's still a catchy pleasure to watch it, meaningless entertainment on weekdays, if it does so. the magnificent visual effects. In any case, it is the program that launched Adrienne Curry in the spotlight. Curry has made a name for herself because of the events that have less to do with modeling than her theatrical love affair with the child actor Christopher Knight in her own reality soap opera.
