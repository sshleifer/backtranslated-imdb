The moment we look at Monica Dolan (in a truly genius tone of genius) cheating on her as Cora from the beginning, we are already hooked, but it is later when she reveals herself in her wonderful screen creation, disturbed, intriguing . , malevolent queen of murder and deception, disguised as the nervous Miss Gilchrist, who not only effortlessly steals the full telephoto for herself, but simply turns off the screen to anyone who approaches her, including the always measured David Suchet, who It seems to be himself. to be somewhat dazzled by his acting talents and, very cavalierly, allows him to occupy a central place. Dolan is the true motor of the film and his Miss Gilchrist, a genuinely well-rounded character in this interpretation of Christie, helped by an intelligent script and the direction of a cheerful rhythm, and also by the rest of the cast directed by Geraldine James and Dominic Jephcott, who all show signs of sympathy for the given material and play with gusto accordingly. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are correct as usual, and if there are weaker links, they can be placed in the comparatively lower quality music than most later Poirots, and perhaps also the lack of an actor Genuine born in Italy for the role of Cora's husband. Apart from that, this is an hour and a half of pure television pleasure, which is as indulgent and entertaining as it is with love.
