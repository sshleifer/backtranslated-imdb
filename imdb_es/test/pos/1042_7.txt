I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck, who was, perhaps, the most hardworking leading actress of the 30s and 40s, although few of her roles in the movies are memorable. Today it is most remembered for the television show "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked hard because she was durable; It seems that she would accept most of the roles and take advantage of it to make the film a success, so the directors loved her and many common images gained credibility for her presence. <br /> <br /> And so it was for "Christmas in Connecticut" is a very common effort whose plot shows credulity and really is not even about Christmas. However, it has Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan, as well as some actors of supreme characters, such as Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall, so there are twists in the plot and funny moments that, no doubt, seemed more real in 1945 than today. To begin with, the plot refers to a magazine writer (Stanwyck) who readers of the magazine believe is a domestic goddess, married with a son and who lives on a farm in Connecticut but who is really single, lives in the New York City and does not know anything about cooking or cooking. household chores Could someone get away with such fraud even then? Apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived, although one might think he would have seen the deception but the story continues and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor recently survived his sunken ship (Morgan) and The Restoring Friend of Stanwyck (SZSakall) is spending Christmas in Connecticut on a farm owned by Stanwyck's boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities that exist for this, since the fraud unfolds as it should. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the awakening, but one wonders how he can stand it. Morgan and Stanwyck fall in love, but he is supposed to be engaged and she must be married. In any case, they start what seems to be a fantasy affair, dance from cheek to cheek and steal in a sleigh pulled by horses. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive character of Greenstreet who has seen Stanwyck and Morgan go together but still can not, sees one of the neighbors retrieve a child who has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the police to denounce a kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sled and the deception begins to unravel. <br /> <br /> At this point, the film is funny as ridiculous or absurd, it is not funny ha ha and ends like comedies always. did. The good guy stays with the girl and presumably they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie every year at Christmas to fully enjoy these actors in a story that reflects the way it was in 1945 and because of a long fascination with Barbara Stanwyck. Thank God, it was set at Christmas or about 95 percent of Stanwyck's films would have been forgotten a long time ago and we would not be able to see it again every year.
