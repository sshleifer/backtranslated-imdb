This is Ghibli's last film and it is also a GREAT departure from the studio's established style. First of all, this film was obviously aimed at young children, much more than any of his previous films. It lacks the depth of the other films and presents a completely less realistic style of animation. and yet it is very entertaining. Even though there is nothing that appeals to adults, I found myself attracted to the screen and completely immersed in the story. The secret of the film is the brutal honesty regarding the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are very direct with their feelings / intentions, etc., but that makes them even more attractive. Special attention was also paid to the soundtrack, which is absolutely incredible despite being very different from the previous Ghibli soundtracks. I find myself singing the beautiful theme song all the time like anyone who watches this movie!
