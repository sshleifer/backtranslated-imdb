This interesting film noir presents three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, like the detective, unfortunately is not so good. He lacks the intelligence, the strength and the cynical vision of a Bogart's world. If Humphrey had played this part, we could have had a classic. <br /> <br /> The pace, the location (a library) and the atmosphere are good. But there are some holes in the plot. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless (Nazi) organization he represents. However, after having killed Blackmer by mistake, Sanders seems not to experience anxiety or remorse. Then, Sanders seizes the library and its occupants using the trick that he and his men are detectives investigating the murder. However, Sanders' hitman later tries to kill Demming by shooting him (without a silencer), despite the fact that many other detainees may have heard and alarmed by the noise. Finally, Sanders' hit man tries to kill Roberts, who has discovered the truth, but when she faints, she inexplicably does not. <br /> <br /> However, what bothered me the most was that I missed the opportunity to come to an excellent and unexpected conclusion. Throughout the film, Patrick is portrayed as an intelligent and hard sociopath who fears nothing. However, in the end, she flees overwhelmed by the panic of the last surviving Nazis, a brutal bully. When the cops find him, he has killed her. And she ends up being just another weak and stereotyped victim. What should have happened is this: the police find the Nazi bully, but he is dead. She has skillfully killed him, and then disappeared, to continue his evil.
