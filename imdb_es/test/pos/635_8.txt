I could not stop watching this movie, although it was time to go to sleep. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Hitchcock are well deserved, this really plays with you. It runs a wonderful line between real and immediate suspense and a dark and distant mood. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our silent witness has innocently stumbled upon something truly horrible, and accompanies us with it, while we identify and feel his fear, we look at her with suspense like her. Put more in danger. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have taken great care to resolve this. From the first planes, they involve you and challenge you to determine what is real and what is manufacturing; Who to trust and who is a monster. The plot turns and rotates unpredictably. The suspense is created with a combination of camera work, images and music carefully selected, but more simply, THE EYES of the characters, who send fear directly to you. <br /> <br /> One warning: there is some terribly real blood, as well as some nudity. The scenes of terror are done in an emotional way that makes them much more terrifying and disturbing than in any photo of teenagers. <br /> <br /> And an image of teenagers is not IS NOT. On the one hand, the characters are extravagant and feel like real people: a couple (including the heroine) that you can even find attractive like me. There will be no mistake in watching a movie made for adults. I mean, Alec Guinness is in that, briefly, and you know he DOES NOT NEED work! <br /> <br /> This appears on the VCR one night when you can not sleep. . . and I do not want, yet.
