If you do not like Italian horror, you will not like this movie. On that note ... <br /> <br /> "In general ... it was a terrible experience ... Many things happened." Vanessa Redgrave was scheduled to be in the film and she retired. crushed by a car, I was committed to getting married, but at the end of the photo that was finished, my father died during the shooting ... all kinds of things. " -Dario Argento about the performance of "Opera" <br /> <br /> I was very impressed by Argento and the film he made here, especially against such anguishing circumstances. All the mystique of "Macbeth" and its curse on those who try to organize the work adds untold volumes to "Opera". <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Argento implements some of his most intelligent (and audience-directed) tricks. A young opera singer, Christina, is harassed by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders. By sticking several sharp blades on Christina's eyelids, the killer makes it impossible for him to close his eyes. "Look at it well, if you try to close your eyes, you'll separate them, so you'll just have to look at everything!" <br /> <br /> It's clear that Argento was very careful in the construction of the fake "Macbeth" opera on screen , and your hard work is worth it. Add to this several brutal and unforgettable murders, an incredibly tense chase sequence and the great use of POV to portray a certain character (the role that Vanessa Redgrave played, thank God) and has one of the best horror films of the history. created. <br /> <br /> That said-- it's still Italian horror. Why Christina never seems to tell anyone about these brutal murders is beyond anyone's understanding. Some scenes may be difficult for certain viewers to assimilate, but personally I felt more tension towards Christina and her eyes than any of the brutal murders in the movie. The end of "Tenebrae" made my stomach turn more than anything in "Opera", but it's probably just me. <br /> <br /> And the last five minutes ... Argento wanted it, filmed it and he fought to keep it in the movie. Absolutely nobody likes, I include myself, but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the movie for me. It remains one of Argento's best films to date. <br /> <br /> 9/10
