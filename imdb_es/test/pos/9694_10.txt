I should not like Jackass Number Two. Nobody should. There is and has never been anything particularly redeeming about Jackass. And yet ... it's one of the funniest things I've seen in my life, and I just can not explain why. <br /> <br /> This new movie leaves the first in the dust. It's so funny, so horrible and so bad. The whole team gives it all, with Jackss in Chief Knoxville leading the charge. He is crazy. I love it, but it's crazy. And more power for him. With his thriving film career, he could have sat down and just let everyone else do the dirty work, but the fact that he has thrown himself, almost literally, into the world of 'Ass' makes him respect him strangely. More congratulations go to Bam Margera, who before seemed happy to sit down and make sure everyone around her did what he wanted. Here Bam is not the tormentor but the tormented one and it is better because of that. <br /> <br /> I just can not tell what my favorite part is because I laughed all the time. I admit that I saw a lot of the film between my fingers, but I have not seen a "real" movie for a long time that made me feel as invigorated as it did. Love them or the odds are that you hate them, the Jackass team has fulfilled my expectations. But I agree with Bam. There can never be a Jackass number three because someone will die and I want these guys to stay.
