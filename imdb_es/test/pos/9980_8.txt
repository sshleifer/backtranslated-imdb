Shia LaBeouf has impressed me before with her ability to act, but I can honestly say that I look forward to her next efforts ... her interpretation of Francis Ouimet, a 20-year-old caddy who ignores his father's insistence that golf is not his. place in life and enters the tournament of the United States Open in 1913 in his hometown ... the beginning of the film dragged a bit, but it is necessary to configure the secondary plot that Shia works so well ... the whole cast he is well chosen and they work very well together in a story that, based on the real event, has an ending that everyone can discover before watching the movie ... but even knowing that the information does not spoil the fun ... Josh Flitter is charming as Eddie Lowery, the caddy of Francis, which keeps him at bay and loose, while proving to be an invaluable part of Francis's effort ... Stephen Delane stands out as Harry Vardon, the legendary British golfer Francis idol who still does not fear ..and who knows the background from which Francis comes because he also had humble beginnings ... Bill Paxton takes a film of formula and makes it worthwhile ... bravo, Mr. Paxton, and bravo to the cast ... from images to history, to the people who give it life. , this is a movie to enjoy, enjoy and enjoy ... it's good to have movies like this so we can feel good watching ...
