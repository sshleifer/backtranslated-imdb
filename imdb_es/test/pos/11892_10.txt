We just finished projecting The Godfather in Australia. A phenomenal work of cinematographic work. We hope to see many more Mr. Chapa movies in the future. It was wonderful to see a film so well made with so much suspense and a story that it will remain an instant classic. Watching a film with great quality really describes the serious potential of Chapa and his ability as a writer, actor, director and filmmaker. Chapa has impressed many with his triumphant "blood on blood" performance and has now demonstrated to all who have seen his works his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with genuine artistic control. With his main role, Kilo VÃ¡squez is a perfect combination between Milo Velka from "Blood in Blood Out" and Al Pacino from "Scarface", the film will do wonders with us here in Australia.
