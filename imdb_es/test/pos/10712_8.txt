Although this was a low budget film and clearly last minute, it has a certain charm that is difficult to identify. I tend to believe that it is the screenwriter, Grant Morris (see Dead Dog), who, despite the distorted plot, injected a fantastic slice of humor, very absent in many of today's box office hits. Without a doubt, a must for a Sunday afternoon. Speaking as a true single girl, and very skeptical, this film did not inspire me especially, but it did ignite a small flame of hope for a person who loves. It's not my love, as much as the love of my neighbor, a little crazy, who lets her hamster sleep in her bed with her. She can find someone.
