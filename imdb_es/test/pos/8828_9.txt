I recommend it to anyone who likes good plotting, good actors (although they are not very well known) (often, it's better that way), science and / or science fiction are presented intelligently on the screen (small ), very special effects, even if they did not have billions of dollars to produce it ... <br /> <br /> much better than any war in the stars ... <br /> <br /> there was only one comment that was not necessary: ​​talking about the comet, the commentator says that LIFE was perhaps brought to earth through a comet ... that's fun, there should always be an opportunity for a magical form, huh? That's the good thing about LIFE, it can come anywhere, without the need for external force
