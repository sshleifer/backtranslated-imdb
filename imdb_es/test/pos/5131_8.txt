Today I saw the film and I thought it was a good effort, good messages for the children. A little predictable. The book was better, he offered more details of the plot, he talked about the environment and how the children discovered the conspiracy. I think Hiassen's deformed mood appears better in the book than in the movie, but there were also many funny moments in the movie. It is probably a bit too slow for children under 6 years old. I loved the Jimmy Buffet casting as the science teacher. And those baby owls were adorable. I wonder how they managed to film them. The movie showed a lot of the best of Florida, it made it look very attractive. Can I imagine it or did the author Carl Hiassen make a brief appearance?
