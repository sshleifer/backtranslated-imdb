I've never really been sure if I liked this documentary or not. It was shown on Channel 4 before a reduced version of Revelations, and is on the video tape Revelations before the show uncut. Basically, the documentary is a friend of Bill who says how wonderful it was for an hour with the video clips of the program mixed, a bit like a trailer for the movie you're about to see. He also presents David Letterman crawling like a worm for leaving Bill out of his show before he died, the reason? Bill made a joke about how Pro-Life people should organize funeral pickets, and Letterman had Pro-life advertising. Anyway, look at the video, since Revelations is Bill.
