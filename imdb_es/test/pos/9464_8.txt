At first, I honestly thought it would be a corny movie. But after seeing this, I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly entertaining along with the support cast (especially that character played by Snatch's "Bullet tooth Tony." What a contrasting role between those two movies!). Now, I'm not someone to say if an actor is good or not, but his performance was especially nice. Even though the plot turned into a love triangle of small (but fun) teenagers halfway through the movie, I feel that this should not be dismissed, what I think, the movie really is: simply entertaining. So, if you run into him, either by DVD or theater, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
