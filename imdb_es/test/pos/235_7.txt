Although I firmly believe that SITR is the best movie of Gene Kelly, but this one is pretty good. I liked the music and the dance and the ending about how Gene got the girl. My favorite part, without a doubt, is Gene's dancing with his alter ego. I love seeing two Gene Kelly's for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It's a movie that I think everyone should see at least once in their life. So you have not seen him go out to see him see today! I'm sure everyone has a friend Gene Kelly who has this movie in his collection. So go to your house and get some popcorn and enjoy!
