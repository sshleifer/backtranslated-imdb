Fantastic series, one of my few favorites (Miami Vice and Tour of Duty are the other two, and this series is up to them). <br /> <br /> These guys are not interested in wearing stockings with ruffles, dress more like lumberjacks. Everything about this series breathes an air of realism, artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> Paint an image of a Europe only slightly out of reach of paganism, since most villagers still have their local deities, and there are nuns who worship Satan, and wizards, witches and sorcerers who cast spells. <br /> <br /> However, what stands out most is that it is a series of your time. Instead of the 1950s version, which was a lament against the centralized government and persecutions of the McCarthy era, this series is completely rooted in the 1980s, the desolation of Thatcherist, and has a strong environmental bias. Robin's protector is a worshiper of nature called Hern The Hunter, who often appears with the head of a deer, and is a personification (as is this Robin) of The Green Man, an alternate version of Osiris (the god It is interesting to note that in these series, Robin In The Hood is not a person, but a concept: when the former is killed, Hern calls a new telepathic: the person may die, but Robin In The Hood will live forever, hence the concept of resurrection). <br /> <br /> The music and the score are really exceptional, and are performed by the Irish Clannad. When I saw it, I could not help thinking about what authentic medieval Anglo-Saxon folk music would have been like. :-) <br /> <br /> All this is very well filmed in the leafy forests of Wales, which go through The New Forrest. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that in the initial episodes of both series, the actors must overcome their own skepticism and convince themselves that this is really a serious job. After that, they get into that and the acting is great! Michael Praed as the first Robin (the second is played by Sean Connery's son, Jason), Judi Trott makes a beautiful and fragile red-haired Marion, Phil Rose as the corpulent and very kind Tucker, Ray Winstone as the volatile and in love Scarlet , Clive Mantle as the giant shepherd Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as Little John's best friend and his partner Shepard, and Mark Ryan as the former Hashashin / Assassin Nazir, all of them with excellent performances. They are also great bad guys, Nicholas Grace as the intriguing sheriff of Nottingham, and his aristocratic and clumsy partner (and Robin's stepbrother, as a result) Robert Addie as Sir Guy de Gisburne. It's also great fashion designer Richard O'Brien, as the evil magician of Lord Owen of Clun (Olliver Cotton) Gulnar (appears near the end of the first series and later in the second). <br /> <br /> Tithe Barn, from Bradford, on Avon, replaced the Sheriff's castle. (Check it on bradfordonavon.co.uk in "places of interest"). <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you like mythology, the Middle Ages, romanticism, do not waste your time. Xena or Hercules: this is real, so go out and see it! <br /> <br /> Alex
