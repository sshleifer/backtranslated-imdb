'Radio' is a beautiful film based on a true story of James Robert Kennedy, mentally nicknamed, nicknamed 'Radio', and the football coach of the T.L. Hanna High School, Harold Jones. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as a radio! I would never have imagined seeing him in a serious performance, especially because most of the films I see with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones, but this actor IS great, so this is nothing new. <br /> <br /> The young man with mental problems named James Robert Kennedy, always walks around the T.L. Hanna High School, without disturbing anyone and almost without noticing it. One day, when the soccer ball is thrown near him, he decides to keep the ball, due to the impatience of Johnny Cash, one of the best players on the football team and also one of the most unpleasant types he has ever met. One day, Cash decides to punish James, mocking him with other soccer players and even going so far as to tie him up. <br /> <br /> When Coach Jones discovers that horrible act, he gets angry and punishes the whole team, deciding on this day to help James, who gets the nickname "Radio" because of his passion for radios in general. <br /> <br /> The film shows how Radio becomes an assistant adept, helping the team to train despite the difficulties. of the players, and even get the respect of basically all the people who live in the small town. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone who wants to see a real and beautiful story. It has a life lesson, which shows us especially how a person can make a difference, even if they are not what we call "normal". The radio has a big heart and is incapable of hating anyone, and that is something that we should all apply to our daily lives.
