Rarely do I see short films, since they only seem to be on nightly television and I do not get to know enough to know what short films are worth. As The Room is an additional feature on the DVD The Hitcher, it gave me the wonderful opportunity to witness a high quality short with Rutger Hauer in excellent shape. <br /> <br /> Artistically filmed in black and white, The Room explores Man's obsession with a room that passed in the early stages of adulthood and is expressed in a documentary style / interview. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man who expresses his feelings for a woman, but is also juxtaposed with occasional wanderings and deficiencies in fluency. This adds great realism and depth to the interpretation of Hauer, who is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him. <br /> <br /> The piano music that Harry (Hauer) hears from the living room is constantly in the background and enhances the moving mood of the film and intensifies the feelings of sadness expressed by Hauer. <br /> <br /> Hauer shows that he is more than a bad Hollywood psychotic with this role and perfectly shows his most sensitive side. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in flashback scenes as the young Harry with a silent role. It shows how affected he is by the music and his disappointment when it disappears. <br /> <br /> The ending is prophetic and leaves you in a state of reflection for longer than many feature films. A very good effort.
