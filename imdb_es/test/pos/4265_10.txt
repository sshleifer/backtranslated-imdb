Sometimes, the main news media seems to be run by a group of brainless reporters. In that they only listen and report what others report. <br /> <br /> This documentary shows what you can find if you put a little more effort into the task of reporting something. <br /> <br /> True journalism should consist of providing people with different perspectives on the things that happen so that they have a fair chance to create an opinion of their own. <br /> <br /> This documentary, along with the main media reports, will help you with this. At least for me, it provided a lot of relevant information about the purpose and motivation behind the frequent worldwide protests at political summits.
