I can see that the ratings of this movie are not that high for this movie, so I must be in the minority to like this movie so much. Well, I'm right and everyone else is wrong (kidding). I guess I like it because I'm a psychology teacher and I really liked the melancholy character played by Ryan. While it is really dangerous and VERY threatening, you can not hate it exactly because he is clearly mentally ill and is likely to suffer some type of brain trauma. And wow Ryan did a really good job of portraying this man! You are really feeling for Ida Lupino while he destroys his life. So, with such an intense performance and a threat, why is the film relatively low? Well, probably because it's not credible, but it's entertaining and creative. Try it and do not create the score of 6.4, it's much better than that!
