The bachelor of swing, Matthau, a successful dentist, is following his blond mistress Hawn, having told him that he is a married man with three children. After she tries to commit suicide, Matthau decides to take responsibility and marry the girl. Concerned that she is going to be a "home thief", Hawn wants to see his wife and explain everything to her. Matthau employs his faithful nurse Bergman to act as his wife and that's when things really get complicated. <br /> <br /> An absurd comedy with irresistible clues often comes to reality, but it's not for a credible second. The script asks us to believe that we, men, are such one-dimensional turds that we can not really believe. But maybe this comedy does not need to be analyzed very thoroughly, just sit back and enjoy the always fun Matthau, the always charming Bergman and the debutante Hawn, who here basically created the role of blonde and silly girl.
