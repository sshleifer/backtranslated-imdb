Flatliners left a remarkable impression in my head. The story is fast-paced and leaves you constantly absorbed and, on many occasions, quite tense. Its approximately five outstanding student doctors (especially Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon), among which, one of them has devised the mechanism to remain dead (or stand in line) for a few seconds and then come back to life. <br /> <br /> The procedure is quite 'complex' and involves a lot of medical trinkets: injections, electric blankets, oxygen masks and a variety of esoteric medical terms. I strongly suspect that the doctors coined all these words so that they never need to be fired. But interestingly, they follow the KISS philosophy (original version for engineers: Keep It Simple, stupid) (extended version for doctors: Keep it Stupid, Simple) too. At the risk of being sacrificed by a reading doctor who takes revenge, let me continue. <br /> <br /> So the first guy who looks disappointed hopes to find the answers to life that philosophy and religion can not answer convincingly. He hopes to get an answer (and be famous) through applied science. He was in a straight line for about two minutes and then returned to our world, which was quite affected. During the death, he had a vision of an incident, when he was young, that left the strongest impression in his life. He murdered another child as a child, by accident, and still feels responsible for it. <br /> <br /> With the success of the first flat line, the others follow each of them by extending their flat line. More and more time to test the limits of how long one can remain dead and experience life after death. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, monsters from the past and the future, keep coming back to chase after their flat line experience. The first flat line is obsessed by a small child who tortures him when he is alone. The second one filmed all the women he took to bed, he watches TVs everywhere playing his videos. The third is persecuted by a young girl who was joking at school. The fourth is tormented by his father killed by suicide, for whom he feels responsible. <br /> <br /> They all go crazy over these obsessions and obsessions and think that the past seems to want to take revenge on them. The main focus in obtaining a flat line is that all his life passes through his eyes, at the moment of "dying", whatever the stage he is in, and remains mostly with the strongest impressions of the life in your mind. Since they did not die, these strong impressions have resurfaced in some way and have become the focus of their lives. <br /> <br /> Everyone somehow comes to an agreement with (and extinguishes) their demons from the past. All of them, except the first one who realizes that the only way he can move through life, is to go back in a straight line. During this flat-line session, he sees himself on a flat line the first time and also sees the child he killed, trying to kill him this time. The child kills him this time for a few minutes and in doing so he has sought revenge. For a few minutes in the movie, one is left wondering if he can come back. Fortunately (because most of us like happy endings) the child absolves him of his past and comes back to life.
