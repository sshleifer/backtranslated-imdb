In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the best classics of the family of all time. Account with Mickey Rooney as (My Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). <br /> <br /> Velvet wins a racing horse, called (Pie) in a raffle. She falls in love with it immediately. With the help of Mi, an ex-jockey, he is trained to compete in Grand National's. After the rider who was scheduled to run, Pie retreats at the last moment, Mi convinces Velvet to take his place. <br /> <br /> This was a well-made movie. Good story and first level performance. The inner game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family photo directed by Clarence Brown. The photography is impressive. This is a movie that you will enjoy in the coming years. <br /> <br /> This photo is what made Elizabeth Taylor a household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth remained close after the movie. Postcards are still sent after so many years. <br /> <br /> A side note. Elizabeth loved the "Pie" horse so much that the studio gave it to her.
