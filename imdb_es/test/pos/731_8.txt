As a late pattern of drive-in fans (1970-1980), there are many movies that I have seen and forgotten. This is one I could never forget. Despite its low cost, the exploitation style of film making, HISTORY was very well done. Isolated therapy-asylum, where patients represent their fantasies to help heal their physio, the accidental murder of the chief doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene, the (supposed) medical assistant who takes over, the various crazy parents . , the revelation that the attending physician is really a patient, and, finally, the rescue of the young nurse by the simple Sam, who killed everyone else in the house to escape unharmed, made for a great HISTORY, that They kept the movie together. I emphasized the word HISTORY because that is what makes a film good or excellent. No matter how much blood, blood, nudity, sexual matter or outrageous behavior you put in a movie, if the HISTORY is not good, then the movie is not good. The credits of the film show clips of all the actors, including the old witch with the last line that tells her to leave and never come back, which is a great ending to this movie. If it's on video / DVD, watch it and enjoy it.
