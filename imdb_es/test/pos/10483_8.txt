Stephane Audran is the heroine of the same name in this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community towards the end of the last century. Two beautiful and talented sisters musically renounce their own prospects of happiness and marriage to care for their elderly father. One day, a Frenchwoman, Babette, comes to work for them. After a few years, she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have welcomed her. Your solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous banquet, which changes the lives of all the guests. This is a film about human and cultural interaction, which is reflected in the changing language of dialogue from Danish to French, and especially between the sobriety of Protestants in northern Europe and the sensuality of the Catholic south. It also has to do with human needs, and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. A deeply edifying movie.
