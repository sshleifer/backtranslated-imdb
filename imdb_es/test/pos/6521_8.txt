In a sport that values ​​extravagance and treasures its characters, one of the greatest of the 1930s was the pitcher Dizzy Dean. He was such a colorful personality that he was probably chosen for the Baseball Hall of Fame because of his strength compared to his shooting stats. After all, part of Dean's story is the early end of his career. <br /> <br /> At the Pride of St. Louis, Dan Dailey successfully captures the character of Dizzy Dean, at least the Dean I remember. I'm not old enough to remember him throwing, but I do remember him broadcasting the Game of Baseball Week during the 1960s. That's also part of Dean's story, being a pioneer radio station and then television. Now that the advertisers are in the Hall of Fame, there is no doubt that Dizzy belongs there. <br /> <br /> Jerome Herman Dean was one of a tribe of sons of sharecroppers who had very little education, but an incredible talent for throwing a baseball. at blinding speed. In fact, he had a younger brother, Paul Dean, who was a pretty good pitcher. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna plays Paul in this film and is one of his first film roles. Paul Dean in real life was a kind of quiet retreat, whose career was also interrupted by injuries. Because of that, Crenna is not given much to work with. During Dean's heyday, sports journalists tried to give Paul the nickname Daffy, but never took it. <br /> <br /> Joanne Dru, taking a break from the game, the western girls in plaid cotton dresses and corsets is first class as the wise, patient and understanding that Patricia Nash, who knew and married Dizzy while playing for Houston in the Texas League. <br /> <br /> In the 1937 All Star Game Dizzy started for the National League. In front of Earl Averill of Cleveland, Dean was hit in the foot by a line that hit him. By refusing to listen to medical advice, Dean re-launched very soon. He had broken a big toe and put too much tension on his arm. It was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept that is part of the story. <br /> <br /> If I had had a career of, say, ten to fifteen years, who knows what launch statistics I could have accumulated. Dean was the next to the last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after Denny McLain (who was a character) did it in 1968, it has not been done since. <br /> <br /> Dean started broadcasting and although he was not the first former player to enter the broadcast booth, his colorful game descriptions made him an instant hit. He started broadcasting for the other St. Louis team, the Browns, and the Browns were a pretty miserable team with little to cheer about. Dean became a star attraction there. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of Dean's story is the problem he got into because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself in the air. That is part of the story that I will not tell, but in the film it is treated with tact and humility and your eyes could get wet if you tend to sentimental. <br /> <br /> A good baseball movie, a true tribute to an American success story.
