I write this criticism right after listening to the death of Stanley Kubrick. It's a big loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I think it's Kubrick's consummate movie, the one he'll remember the most. It is an image like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably the first "artistic" film in the United States and has inspired people like George Lucas and countless other writers and directors. <br /> <br /> Apart from its visual grandeur, the reason why the film generates so much discussion and analysis is because many people have so many different interpretations of that. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really discovered what was going through their minds. Of course, the weakness of his "message" is how the technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. The end of 2001 is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the escape of the star child back to earth. It does not make sense to many, but the enthusiastic spectators will understand. <br /> <br /> Although 2001 does not have the evil and dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or they contain strong and eccentric characters that filled their previous works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel that they would have liked to be remembered more for this. In any case, HAL will be his most memorable, dangerous, murderous and artificial character. It was half a decade ago at a time when Hollywood still produced boring musicals and was awakening to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a nonconformist director who made great films on his own terms, in his own time, and for everyone else to marvel. He will be missed.
