A movie to divide its viewers. The just critics point to its funerary rhythm, the oversized zoom and persistent and persistent glances among the protagonists. The defenders point out the powerful performance of Dirk Bogarde and the reference photograph of Venice by Pasqualino De Santis. <br /> <br /> Taken together, this might suggest an indulgent and romantic elegy for the nobility of homosexual love (at one point, 1971, when it was becoming consensually legal). In fact, Visconti has managed to make a film richer and more complex than a vehicle with a single theme. He has united his ideas, weaknesses and everything, in an arc of meticulous rhythm. <br /> <br /> Inside this, in fact, is the central performance of Aschenbach de Bogarde. Instead of a nice, Johnny-eat-lately gay, manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity that sees salvation in Tadzio. His hypnotized amazement around an increasingly infernal Venice after the child is a direct metaphor for the artist's tenacity for the truth in the teeth of the dilettante mafia (and is cut explicitly with a flashback). <br /> <br /> Mahler's music It may be a little over used although it is well suited. The Italian overdub is a worn out anachronism, but fortunately the performance does not suffer too much. 7/10
