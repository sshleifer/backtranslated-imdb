I can not believe I missed this one. Made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow him to make an indifferent episode of a television program, it's about 90 minutes sharp, sharp like a movie of knives. You will find the scheme, the plot, etc. in this site. Consider that everything was filmed with a single 16mm handheld camera ... all the dialogue was improvised ... none of the "actors" had appeared in front of a camera before ... It seems a recipe for disaster. Instead, what we get is that hippies and cops run through the California desert in what evolves into a "that's not fair." I'm on that person's stage. The only problem is that the director continues to make him change loyalty and at the end of the 90 minutes we are still not sure who has one. Brilliant ... Pretty bright.
