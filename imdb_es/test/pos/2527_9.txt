This is probably the best film by director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown to foreigners, which is the same reality that torments all Latin American countries, poverty and an instinct for survival. The most affected in this reality is that children generally orphaned or abandoned by their poor parents have to do so in a society of "dogs that eat dogs" that often falls into the breach of crime, prostitution and crime. Very well acted and with a "no frills" approach, this film will reach you, a great plot of history, a must-have movie in anyone's collection. The leading role was for Fernando Ramos da Silva, a young man who fell in the wave of crime, killed some years later during a robbery. I would suggest that people watch the movie "Who Killed Pixote?" so that I can have a deeper idea of ​​the life of these characters. Some other characters in the film had a similar fate, some died and others are in jail. However, this movie will last a long time in his memory
