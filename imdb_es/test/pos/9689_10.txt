Seriously, people need to lighten up and just accept that funny is funny, and this movie is fucking fun. Better than the first, and Knoxville really grew a couple for this movie and did more crazy tricks than the first. If Ebert and Roper (without saying that I'm a big fan of them) can look beyond the sheer idiocy of this film enough to give it two thumbs, then I think other people can do it. I was not sure what to expect from this, but I was surprised and it is rare that a sequel is better than the original. This new one I think exceeds the first big moment. so do what I did, just relax, try not to throw up at some points and laugh.
