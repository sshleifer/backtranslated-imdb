Bon Voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the necessary nonsense of a comedy with enough sobriety to keep viewers engaged and interested in the outcome. But the most important thing is that the film is also historically instructive; it captures the tension of the so-called "false war" and, later, the flight of the French aristocracy from Paris before the German attack. However, Bon Voyage is not a "war movie". It is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people in a context of extraordinary times. Bon Voyage conveys the chaos, confusion and emotional turmoil of a nation on the verge of collapse and the broad spectrum of French reactions to the new political order. This film is a comedy that entertains the public, a romance that skillfully uses many clich√©s and the story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them.
