This film brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a D & D group. As I watched, I could not help noticing how vividly the characters reminded me and my friends of the game to the point where they acted literally like us. Including the disputes, the fights, the internal jokes, driving the DM crazy. ALL. <br /> <br /> He has everything. Jokes that made me cry, scenes of action that, even filmed with little budget, I found incredibly impressive. The story is quite simple and surprising, but that does not really matter, since the best part of the movie is to see the characters react and interact with each other and with the NPCs. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if playing D & D or any other similar RPG, I can not emphasize this enough, LOOK AT THIS MOVIE, beautifully captured the spirit of D & D.
