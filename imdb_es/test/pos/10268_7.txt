From today's point of view, it is quite ridiculous to rate this movie 18 (or X in the US). The film has a sexual, but sublime, erotic story to tell, but the images are pretty innocent. Throughout the film, you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in fashion, dialogues and typical experimental cinematography and lighting. And this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing.
