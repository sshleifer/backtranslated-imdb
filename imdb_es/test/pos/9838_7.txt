This is not a "real" vehicle for James Cagney since his screen time is unusually thin. Frankie Darro plays the tough kid Jimmy Smith, the leader of a gang of street thugs who is sent to school with some of his friends. Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, a gang leader, who is assigned a symbolic position as deputy commissioner. When he discovers firsthand the brutal treatment that is given in the reform school, he is forced to make some important changes with the help of the nurse reformer (Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> THE HELL MAYOR is fast and remains entertaining after all these years. The cast is well rounded with: Dudley Digges, Arthur Bryon, 'Farina' Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
