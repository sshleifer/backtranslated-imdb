Writing about something so wonderful is completely difficult. Actually, it is almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie. This is a wonderful story about sex and gender, and it's almost incredible that we do not have to deal with obscene sex scenes. With feeling, this movie was made for people who like to feel, and just feel, life in all its complexity in a simple and beautiful way. We look at it, and something begins to grow inside our minds, even our hearts: it is a pure poem. I have seen some "gay" movies, and almost always I feel dissatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex, not because I do not like sex scenes, but in general they are so pornographic that I am forced to think that the director or the producers or the Writer of the script think that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from those. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle. Ito likes her best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what this could turn into unsuspecting hands? But, on the contrary, Hashiguchi makes a magnificent story that delves deeply into the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me think, astonished, at the end of the film: Why? And that's why it expanded into multiple questions within my brain and within my heart. The scenes, in reality, sometimes tend to be boring, are moments of the most charming poem we can feel, but we are totally unable to write in words. And maybe that's why, we can not understand the question at the end of the movie. I'm sure this movie was not made to discuss every part of it? Some people want to understand a movie almost by dissecting it. Others are so accustomed to "American gay" movies that they can not appreciate the real value of this masterpiece. Look at it, close your eyes on the credits and feel, everything, feel, feel the wonderful song. For all this and much, much more, I give it a nine. And I just do not give ten, because ten out of ten is perfection. But I confess that I almost did it.
