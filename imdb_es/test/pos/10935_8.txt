An unusual, Western revisionist, well worth seeing. Despite a slow start, the movie builds ?? With little dialogue and without subtitles? A portrait of life increasingly intense and almost existential in the harsh environment of the western desert. The growth of the main characters is worth waiting for, and the strong central cast brings a true sense of desperation to the struggle for the property of the horse of utmost importance. How interesting that this has been done by a British director. I hope he is smiling now: I have the impression that the film was ignored by contemporaries; but time works like its usual alchemy, and hidden gold shines as is inevitable. One note caught my attention: revisionism is only carried out until now. Sam Waterston as an Indian? - He conceded that he fulfills his part with real emotion and intensity, but in reality, could not you find an American Indian actor to do the job? But her scenes with Caroline Langrishe have an intimacy that contrasts very well with the immense landscape that surrounds them. <br /> <br /> Forget the great versions of Hollywood's past in bankruptcy, men with big lies and swirling music; This is all about a primal struggle between the protagonists who, stripped of all the trappings of "ordinary" life, come to understand why it is worth fighting. Awesome.
