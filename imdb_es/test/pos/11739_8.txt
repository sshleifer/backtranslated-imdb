On a second visit, this is still a wonderful romance that, in my opinion, is much better than the movie I was paired with in my 2 DVD game, Leo McCarey's classic, "An Affair To Remember." However, it seems to have fallen a bit in disgrace (just a rating of 6.6 here on IMDb, and many critics have dismissed it as "bad luck"). How sad, because this is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work of the two protagonists, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. In any case, the film should be well remembered for the magnificent color photography and the unforgettable musical score. I do not really like Valentine's Day, but he gave me an excuse to watch this movie again, and I'm glad of that. While I still think that the death of the character of Holden is too announced, eliminating the suspense of the final scenes, this film is very moving and I really enjoy it.
