This seemed like a mediocre movie that betrays a low budget with a bad picture and not such a good editing job. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the Second World War era, but I recommend that everyone else be careful. Many of the scenes in this movie were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about men being called back into service during a brief leave seems realistic enough, but there is no real rhythm or tension in the story. It also cost me to understand what the actors were saying, in part due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to a lower sound recording job. I give this a 55/100. Most people will want to "direct" clear.
