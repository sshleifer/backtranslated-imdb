I just saw this movement recently on the Encore channel. What a great movie, a great cast too. Flatliners is very suspenseful and unpredictable. The film has a great opening scene next to the ocean and then a series of scenes that establish the questions about life after death that provide a very strong participation in the story. Therefore, Nelson, played by Kiefer Sutherland, was the first to pass the test to die and come back to life. Then it becomes very dramatic to bring back to life their bad deeds of the past. Then, all the characters mentioned above went through the same experience, except Randy Steckle, played by Olliver Platt. Then, the story unfolds in a resolution and basic understanding about the life and presence and meaning of God. David Labraccio played by Kevin Bacon and atheist ends up questioning his own belief about God. It is amazing to see Julia Roberts along with Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland at such an important moment in their careers. One can ask why we no longer have such a good movie. This is one of the best productions of Joel Schumacher. I really enjoy this movie.
