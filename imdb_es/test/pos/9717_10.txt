Unfortunately, every person who asks about this series says they have never heard of it. I remember him fondly from my childhood (he was not nearly 10 years old when he left). <br /> <br /> My favorite story was "A Story Short". Something about the way in which the history of the "stone soup" is woven into a larger story makes me more and more. And then the narrator explains why he does not have a story to tell, and it becomes a story in itself. I've always been a fan of Jim Henson, and this is just one of the reasons why. <br /> <br /> I am adding this DVD with Labrynth, The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, The Last Unicorn, Willow and MirrorMask. These are all the DVDs that I share with my brothers who are 6, 5 and 4 years old.
