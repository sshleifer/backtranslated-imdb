"Beyond Rangoon" is simply wonderful. From the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending, you'll be surprised at how good this movie is. Patricia Arquette surprisingly portrays Laura Bowman, whom we know as a young, dejected and abandoned doctor, unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son. Throughout the course of the film, while trapped in Burma, the rebellion and Democratic massacres in the capital city of Rangoon, flee for her life and save the life of her tour guide (U Aung Ko), she is recovering her will live. This can be seen artificial or with a hard hand: it is not. John Boorman, a teacher in spiritual and emotional conflicts, paints the film with broad strokes and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state and physical situation. Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincing and credible performance as emotionally wound Laura. What Arquette does surprisingly, in whatever role she plays, is to give us a window to the heart of her character without words. Each time a close-up is given in the film, the audience has a vision of their character. She does not need to talk to convey emotions, or be above. Some critics were harsh with Arquette's performance in the film when it opened on August 25, 1995, considering that she was "flat" or "boring" on paper. I found his characterization a stalemate, staying away from the melodramatic that is normally part of an actor's performance when a personal tragedy occurs. She is shocked and reserved about her feelings: that is as normal as screaming at those around you. I hope that Warner Brothers releases this title on DVD very soon. With the hugely successful NBC drama, "Medium," by Arquette, which bears his family name, not to mention the Emmy and the 2007 nomination, would be the best for the studio. Hopefully there are extras, with the alternative ending. Do not go through this movie. It is one that you will surely not forget after seeing.
