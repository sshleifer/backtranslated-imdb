"Pixote" is the most powerful, shocking and moving moving image that comes from Brazil. It is about the lives of street children in the streets of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and centers around a ten year old boy. The camera follows them in an almost documentary style, from the juvenile detention center (where most of the staff is as corrupt as the police) and back to the streets, and never far from the horrors of the city. Prostitution, drug use / trafficking, corruption and murder are witnesses of these young people; however, it is something to which they are painfully accustomed. The director HÃ©ctor Babenco used street children as actors, adding brutal reality to the film. Although it is not for everyone, a film that I highly recommend. An emotionally devastating movie. <br /> <br />
