The last days is a very, very independent film. And compared to many of today's most modern films, it lacks many parts. The shooting seems sometimes quite amateur, the dialogues can be a little clipped and the characters are not very complex. So, I do not have too much hope in this movie, because as I said, it's very independent. But what is lacking in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked by the enchantment of history! I can not say that the plot is exceptionally original, but the story is still beautiful and moving in many ways. It's not about being gay instead of being heterosexual, it's about faith and how you decide to direct your own life! It's a silly story, that makes you want to cry and smile at the same time! So to be honest, Latter Days is far from perfect, but I really loved the movie and I highly recommend it. It is very critical about the religious aspects of our society, and there is homosexuality involved, but it is approached with an open mind, and I am pretty sure that most people will enjoy it as much as I do.
