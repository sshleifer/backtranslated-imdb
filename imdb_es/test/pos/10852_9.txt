I really liked that movie. Not because of romantic history among women, but because of the visualization of human strength, despair and liberation. This movie is a must see. Entertaining! Emotional! Captivating! All the characters are very well written and represented by some very talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. A journey of the mind, body and soul. You find yourself identifying with the characters and in some points, even the story. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I recommend watching the movie first, then reading the book. If you read the book first, you will be a little disappointed. The adaptation of the script cut a lot and some things changed. Some for better and others for worse.
