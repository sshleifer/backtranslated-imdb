Apart from the fact that this movie was filmed mainly in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful city where my mother once rented a small store and spent a very pleasant summer when she was a child, it's a fun and cute movie. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I had no desire to see this movie even though I have a weak point for romantic comedies (I do not know why). The trailers I saw were not attractive, the cast did not seem so interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be about. In the end it seemed an interesting meditation on relationships and family. I enjoyed it a lot and I must admit that I thought that this movie was one of the most forgotten gems of last year. I am disappointed that so few people seemed to have enjoyed the "humanity" that this film presented to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I have read many negative reviews of this film and I must admit a certain level of shock to the cynicism that prevails in them. As a graduate student, I consider myself quite cynical, but this was a beautiful little movie that deserves much better than it received.
