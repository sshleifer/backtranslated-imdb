This film tries to escape the typical 'I'm fighting because I'm forced to defend the homeland. The NAZI are all bad, I am against them (typical of German war movies). How? By not talking too much about it, and only referring the war and the prisoners of war. However, I would like to see a German movie that would be something between the tip of Come And See and Das Boot of the "bad NAZI". I say this because, excluding this factor, German films are those that best represent World War II and the German side. You easily see some of the German hierarchical relationships, very different from those of the US Army. UU <br /> <br /> This is a movie that tries to get a real glimpse of what Stalingrad was, and I was not there, and I doubt most people were there now, but if I chose a movie that represents this battle, surely it would not be the only American Enemy At The Gates. Why do I say this? Because even the best soldiers are not heroes and, given the conditions, they can consider their own lives instead of the fatherland. This applies to all ranks, and at the end you see Von Paulus setting the example.
