After a robbery incident at Grand Central Station in New York, an innocent policeman detains an innocent (Kevin Spacey, "The usual suspects") who believes he is under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We can understand why they think this, considering how the man informed them politely that he wears his dark glasses because "the light on his planet is really bright". And so, Prot (as he identifies himself, pronounced as rhyme with "goat") is sent to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, where a tired workaholic doctor, Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski"), tries understand the so-called deception of this man. <br /> <br /> Prot's attitude is courteous and cooperative. When asked why he believes he has been institutionalized, he responds in a practical way that it is because "you think I am crazy". In a matter of minutes, after satisfying his new insatiable hunger for Earth fruit, the completely revealing Prot revealed that he is an extraterrestrial from the planet K-PAX, which is 1000 light-years away, surrounding the binary star system Agape and Satori located in The Constellation of Lyra. He also details how his infinitely more advanced species has already mastered the journey faster than light, by harnessing the energy of light, an achievement that is supposedly a lot for the human race. <br /> <br /> Powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims, although they still fascinate him, and he is committed to understanding how Prot came to believe such a thing. Meanwhile, Prot uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward, and eventually offers everyone around him something to live for and hope for a cure. On July 27, Prot reveals later, will depart again for K-PAX, and can only take a human with him. What will really happen on that date, nobody is sure. <br /> <br /> Originally scheduled to play Dr. Powell? with Will Smith as Prot ?? Kevin Spacey entered the lead role when Smith had to withdraw from the movie. It can be said that he had a lot of fun with his character, the fact that in his ridiculous dialogue ("Your product has only been worth the trip") often provokes a real laugh. There is an undeniable intelligence behind many of Prot's words, but logic holds that he must be delirious ... is not it? <br /> <br /> Is the audience being driven back and forth between the possibilities? for the first segment of the movie, we almost accept the possibility that Prot is an extraterrestrial (this is a science fiction movie, right?), before being totally convinced when Prot inexplicably shows an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of a system planetarium newly discovered. A final investigation by Dr. Powell offers a well-packaged terrestrial explanation for Prot delusions, but this is quickly eliminated and we are left scratching our heads again. The film, quite rightly, keeps its ending open, leaving the audience to contemplate what they have just seen and discuss it with those around them. However, whether you believe that Prot is an extraterrestrial or not, there are two irresistible certainties in your mind: the Universe is, in fact, a fascinating place, and perhaps there are superior forces that humans have not yet discovered.
