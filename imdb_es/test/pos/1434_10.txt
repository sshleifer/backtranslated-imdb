Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra), recently freed from a six-month drug rehabilitation program and served his time for dealing cards in illegal card games, has high hopes of going clean and finding a new life as a big-band drummer . However, upon returning to his former neighborhood of Chicago, crime, he soon finds pressure from those around him, including his wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) in a wheelchair, to return to the old "Dealer" lifestyle to earn money. that he first got. He started the path of self-destruction that is being a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> It is very rare that a film has so many interpretations of characters as big as this one. Frank Sinatra is excellent as Frankie Machine, and realistically portrays the symptoms of a drug addict through abstinence, possibly better than anyone who has done before him. Sinatra seems to possess a keen understanding and awareness of his character here and expresses the constant battle for control of his own life that is always happening within the heart of the man who is Frankie Machine. Parker as his crippled wife, Zosch, wants to own Frankie forever, so that he "makes a deal" to earn good money in order to take care of her and pay her increasing medical bills. She seems terrified by anything she sees as a threat to her control over him, such as the freedom that a drummer's life could offer, or anything that could change the status quo between them. <br /> <br /> The spectator Molly (Kim Novak), a girl who lives in the same building and seems to possess real and strong feelings for Frankie, does not want to control it, but just to help him shows that the best thing that Frankie can offer you in the world if you can. just stay right enough to wake up and realize. Darren McGavin as the heroin seller and drug dealer Louie, however, is always there waiting in the wings knowing the right buttons to press, what needs to be said, to make a former addict return to that old habit, a profitable one for Louie but mortal. for the addict. <br /> <br /> The stage also seems to take on a life of its own, constantly dark, gritty, seedy and ravaged by crime, with nothing positive enough to hope for in life, a place where it is very easy to escape through of a bottle or drugs, a quick "solution" that really is not a solution at all, but only serves to keep one in the dark away from the light of day and all the bright prospects the world could offer. It's a nice touch that when Frankie is on the right track, the configuration always seems brighter than when it's headed the wrong way. While some argue that it is a little outdated, for me this is a high quality film with a realistic interior war inside a man for the control of his own destiny, one that presents performances of very strong characters by all involved . Given that, THE MAN WITH THE GOLD ARM gets my highest possible recommendation.
