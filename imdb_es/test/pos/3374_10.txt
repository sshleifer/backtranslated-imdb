Honestly, I would give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to compensate for the 5 pages of unbeaten and unjustified 1 star reviews. This is an interesting story, the whole performance is good or very good (even Mrs. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual bimbo role and smiles, plays well). The scenarios are perfect and the cinematography is always horrifying right. It's a good moral play and there's no reason to explain the origin of the supernatural / alien / god / whatever it is that is "performing the show," so I'm glad the movie does not try. It is really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long but quite convincing and is summarized quite satisfactorily in the end. <br /> <br /> Before deciding that this movie is terrible (or really, anything below ~ 7.5) read some of the dozens of "hated" 1 star reviews that are full of misspellings, lack of punctuation and use of capital letters. , and youth criticism. Maybe the trailer was misleading or something, I did not see it, but apparently some of these critics expected Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (a critic actually compared this movie with Saw! What completely inappropriate and unrelated!) <Br / > <br /> Seriously, most of these criticisms are read as if they were comments from you-tube: according to these "critics", this film is too confusing but too predictable, there is not enough action, but there is too much information , too smart but too silly. It explains too much but leaves too much unexplained ... oh, and apparently it's a "waist (sic) of time". Consider the quality and origin of the reviews before taking them seriously. I am afraid that these 1-star children did not understand the phrase "coefficient of altruism" and, therefore, were completely unable to understand the premise of the film (although they categorically claim that they "understand" it before explaining the confusing what was it.) If he knows! What those two words mean is that you will not have trouble understanding (and enjoying) this movie. <br /> <br /> I really wish there was a reputation system of reviewers here, so you could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this 1-star movie forever. <br /> <br /> See for yourself and enjoy the excellent presentation of an interesting couple who take an interesting moral "test" and face the consequences. It's a good time, in my opinion.
