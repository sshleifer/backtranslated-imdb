The one who says that Lucio Fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of Splatter is probably crazy. The Italian director is a legend among hardcore-horror fans, and his work overcomes gender barriers (who can forget his western, criminal or fantasy films). This is probably his saddest movie, and unfortunately it is the last. A director of terror (Fulci as himself) begins to hallucinate about horrifying murders. He goes to a psychiatrist, who makes him believe that he is the criminal. At this time, the doctor begins a long chain of serial crimes. With a plot of this kind, the movie should have been filled with something. And there are decomposing corpses, starred or melted heads, stabbings, beheadings, chainsaw dismemberment and many others. Sometimes boring, the film is saved by excessive violence that will definitely please blood addicts.
