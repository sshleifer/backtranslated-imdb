... I do not like this movie and everyone would understand why. The plot is poor, so is the performance. But in my opinion it is better than Halloween 5, although even this does not give many surprising moments. Some scenes are very well directed. But these few moments do not give the reason to rent it. I do not despise violence in movies, but the H6 presents extraordinary strong and bloody scenes that do not conform to the tradition of Halloween movies. The most sucking aspect of H6 is the lack of tension. There is no comparison with the first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want, rent it. But do not expect a great horror experience ... <br /> <br />
