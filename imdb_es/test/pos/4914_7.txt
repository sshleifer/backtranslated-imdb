An excellent performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful by Jean-Hugues Anglade adorn this story of lust, desire and alienation in France. The work of the two main actors is surprising: subtle, intense and passionate. Unfortunately, the script is deliberately turgid and sordid, and the general effect leaves one with a dejected spirit. Even so, those who can appreciate the good quality of the performance will be able to taste the courageous work of the protagonists in this often difficult film journey of Gallic Low Life. <br /> <br />
