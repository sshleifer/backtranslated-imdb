Exciting, action-packed and interesting film that tells the story of a group of men stationed at a naval base in Italy and their adventures aboard a Navy submarine during the First World War. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two friends, and I must say they are a couple of very handsome officers, I must say. A new Captain arrives on board, already known to a few as "Dead Pan" Toler (Walter Huston) and is a real mugger for following the rule book and a "code of honor". Soon, Tommy and Brick chase an attractive blonde at an officer's dance, Tommy insults the Captain and, of course, the blonde is actually the Captain's daughter. But Tommy wins anyway when he and the daughter escape the dance to a carnival in the street, and soon they are united during an aerial attack. Unfortunately for him, she reveals that she is married. Later, Tommy gets into a real problem when he disobeys orders in an effort to save his friend. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite entertaining with an absorbing plot that kept my interest and the best performances of all. A climactic death scene with Sterling Holloway is really disturbing: the most memorable scene in this movie, I thought. Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante add a little humor here playing a couple of fools: the character of Durante is studying to be a dentist by mail and continuously has clashes on the ground with a British man who makes fun of his nose. Okay, if you're looking for a movie that shows a man boxing a kangaroo, this would be the one.
