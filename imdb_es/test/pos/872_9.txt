(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> People who put a Lonely Heart ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to put in a few words all that they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope ... Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the Reunion Island (east of Madagascar) is so affected by the letters from Julie Roussell that he proposes. But not the expected pretty brunette comes from the board of the "Mississippi", but ... Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the beginning that she is an impostor of marriage and that a crime has been committed. She shows no interest in the "Julie" wardrobe (she does not even open her trunk) and neglects her canary until she dies. But the most basic tricks of seduction (an open zipper) are enough to transform Louis into a flexible puppy. First: a joint bank account. And then, when Julie's sister catches the eye, the flight. With 27,850 million of Louis's 28 million, she would have needed his signature for the entire sum. <br /> <br /> Louis and Julie's sister hired a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis manages to track Marion (the real name of Deneuve) in Antibes, where he works as a taxi driver. Her lover of the gangsters left her penniless, or rather it makes no sense. Louis finds himself unable to kill her. She tells her story: orphan. Early. Lesbian experiences Many sugardaddies. Jail - and soon she takes him back by the nose. The detective turns out to be astute as a fox and tenacious as a bloodhound; Louis and Marion bury his body in the basement. They flee to Paris, where Louis discovers that Marion has an expensive flavor. She loves money as a deity. He sells his signature at a fraction of its value. But when the detective's body is discovered (a flood) they have to flee again, without the money. Life in a mountain lodge, along with a plaintive loser: Marion can think of a happier life without this appendix ... <br /> <br /> A high point in the careers of everyone involved. The self-deception of Belmondo makes it almost endearing. Deneuve looks beautiful in her Yves St. Laurent wardrobe, and her performance is charming: at first she falsifies the frail woman, too shy to ask her husband for money, that's why a joint bank account is needed, but after Being exposed, sounds like Katharine Hepburn at the BRINGING UP BABY jail scene. The landscape is spectacular: the tropics, the riviera, Paris. Truffaut directs with evident aplomb: the sixties were the only decade in which European films were above the American productions. After this movie, Truffaut could look at his idol, Alfred Hichcock, in the face.
