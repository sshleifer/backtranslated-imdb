"Everything is illuminated" is like seeing a museum-quality work of art. Absolutely floods emotions across a broad spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played frankly by Elijah Wood. He is looking for his paternal inheritance in Ukraine. His trips put him in contact with Alex, he played very well and with extreme humor of Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional link in this film and Boris Leskin portrays him accurately. If you find little humor in the human characters of this cinema, then you just have to turn to Mikke, a real dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. for Alex and his grandfather. They also call him the "bitch that sees the eyes". The cinematography is spectacular. The colors are a very important part of the mosaic of the film. It is a film that is worth the time and the emotional investment.
