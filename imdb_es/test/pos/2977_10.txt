I was attracted to "Friends" by the soundtrack of a young Elton John who was still famous and who had seen in a club in the vicinity of Houston. I had no idea of ​​the emotions and the impact that the film would have. I recently returned to the movie with a song that Heart called "Seasons", then I found that the song "Friends" by Elton John thought it was the same song ... 35 years have passed. Anyway, the flood of "Friends" emotions came back as if he saw an old photograph of his first real love. I remember more the way the film hit me than the actual details of the production, the plot, etc. So forgive me for a pretty bad review. I remember having a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and be as moved and tearful at the end as I was. I am anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many films that seemed so important to me at that time (ie, "The Graduate" "Easy Rider") now seem ridiculous and I do not want this to fall into the same category. But, I will find it and if it turns out to be silly, then at least I can turn my wife into a great ... no ... exceptional soundtrack. When we met, we went through this with "Last Tango in Paris". The young people with whom I work (I am 56 years old) respect my opinions, but it is difficult to explain the feelings of the sixties and the films and songs that reflect such strong feelings but now seem a little "aged". I just can not figure out if the aging process is the cinema ... or me. "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. I will bring back many special feelings, I'm sure. Of course, rent or buy a copy ... The Indies were not as close to the strong genre as they are today.
