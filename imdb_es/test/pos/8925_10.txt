I am a gay white man quite tired of 55 years. Since I do not watch TV, I watch at least 250 movies a year, mostly on DVD. I take notes of all the movies that I see and I rate them. Since December 2003, I have only seen five films as big as Eighteen. Therefore, I have qualified Eighteen better than at least 700 other recent films. Mr. Bell is too modest in his film commentary. Eighteen is a great movie. And, it also resulted in two "first fruits" for me. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw the movie, I was fascinated and tearful for the last half hour, something that only happened to me three times. times before (Five minutes after the movie, I knew it was going to be very good). When Jason started reciting Whitman, I lost him and then ... The kiss. Well, that's one of the great kisses of the movie, and that scene among the most moving and unforgettable of Filmdom. When Pip puts out the candle at the end and the credits come out, I applaud. I applauded Master the happy endings. I cried. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the trailer and TLA previews and thought, "Okay, are these $ 800,000 Indie really that good?" So, immediately, I saw Eighteen again, something that only happened three times before. And, Eighteen blew my socks one more time, even more. Then I saw the documentary "The Making of EIGHTEEN" and was completely delighted with the cast and Mr. Bell. <br /> <br /> Then, I thought I would see Eighteen again with the Director's Comment. I had never seen a movie three times in one night before. After the third time, at 3:00 AM, I knew that I had just experienced a Great Movie; Eighteen now ranks # 10 in my Top Twenty Films of all time. And, in the small universe of the great gay movie or subtext, there's Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Bell! Eighteen is brilliant and fully realized, with a magnificent cast, a wonderful, moving score, excellent cinematography, an entertaining, moving, totally appropriate and humble song. I can continue, but I will not spend much more. <br /> <br /> This movie should have received Oscar nominations, certainly one for the Best Film. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. The lovely and sensual voice of Mrs. Gill was an amazing epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? 'Nuf said. Awesome. <br /> <br /> Eighteen is the reason why I go through more than 200 mediocre movies to absolutely horrendous (some in the range of more than $ 150 million) a year, to find that treasure, that exquisite, magical, Unique and charming, perfect "Faberg√© egg" enveloping an unforgettable heart. <br /> <br /> Finally (I promise), my second "first": I had never posted a comment about any movie I've seen before. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Mr. Richard Bell! Awesome genius. Give this man $ 100 million for his next movie! He made $ 700,000 in one of the 50 best movies of all time. If I had the cash, I would give him $ 75,000 a year for living expenses and match the funds raised for his next movie. Mr. Bell is already a great director at 31 years of age. Can you imagine it at 45 years of age? <br /> <br /> Wise and witty, tender and brutal, balanced, poignant, sober but avant-garde, chilling and exciting, fascinating, unforgettable: unforgettable: EIGHT, THE MASTERPIRA.
