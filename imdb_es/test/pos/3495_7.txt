Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full movie that is 'Ali G Indahouse' <br /> <br /> Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand is completely different. Comedy outside the wall definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen as well. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, which make this movie a fuss for fans of Ali G. <br /> <br /> If you've seen it and you did not like it , avoid this movie like the plague, because it is definitely more of the same; for everyone else - look at it Aiiii! 7/10
