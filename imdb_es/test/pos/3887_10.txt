Garlin is, without a doubt, a comedian comedian and comedian for anyone looking for a good time. His first film, which is entirely his own creation and production, tells the story of a Chicago actor, James Aaron, with whom Jeff obviously identifies himself. He juxtaposes James beautifully with "Marty" by Paddy Chayefsky and with Poor Soul by Jackie Gleason while exposing James' dilemmas with a variety of real-life actors who are friends of Jeff, many of whom are alumni buddies of Second City <br /> <br /> He uses deliciously the diametrical sympathy of Sarah Silverman and his incredibly absurd humor to exemplify how, despite common sense and talent, the satisfaction of life can often belittle the unwavering frustration. Bonnie Hunt offers an endearing interpretation as a romantic interest. <br /> <br /> Do not let a simple story fool you, the characters and conflicts are well thought out and sound true. Those who follow Garlin's career and understand that his humor is based on telling reality with humor, not necessarily creating a fiction that can be easily created, will appreciate his story based on dialogue. <br /> <br /> Surely we will see Garlin working much more as a director and writer with other talented intelligent comic actors who take on the great challenge of making life fun.
