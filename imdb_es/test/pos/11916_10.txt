This movie is a perfect example of great escapism! I loved this movie and it absorbed me from the beginning. Surely it's just an action movie, but is not it fun to have fun watching movies? <br /> <br /> The cast of this movie is very strong with nice characters. The friendship between the boys is very realistic and attractive, it is comforting and fun to see a group of teenagers interacting, especially this group of guys! Sean Astin becomes a great rebel, successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun, watch this movie! I enjoyed it even though I was watching it on a very dirty and old VHS that was of terrible quality (Go to DVD!)
