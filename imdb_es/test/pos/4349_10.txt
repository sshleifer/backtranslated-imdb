I think it definitely is. The writing is of such quality that the beginning students of the English language should model their conversations after their dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey (Bronson) and Mrs. Kathryn Davis (Deborah Raffin) (more on this character later) is extremely clear and precise: Mrs. Davis says: "I hope you like chicken. the only thing I know how to do, "to which Kersey responds deftly," Chicken is good, I like chicken. " If that is not English Grammar 101, I do not know what it is. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this Mrs. Davis character: Kersey sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself at him and tells her she wants to see him "for the last time" (this is the fourth time they met) before moving to his sister's house in Binghamton, New York, to get away from the creepy ones; then he really does not even blink as his corpse burns in the street only a few minutes later. Kersey does not even say his first name through the entire movie. Not even once. Never a "Get out of here, Katy," or a "That's a nice dress you're wearing, Kathryn" or a "Be careful, Katie, or the creatures will catch you!" <br /> <br /> And while this 'love' is developing between the two, Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) keeps his eyes always vigilant about them. It's almost as if Kersey was using her as a bait to get to Fraker, the same way he uses the camera or the car. Indeed, when Fraker bites, Kersey does it with force ... in the most incredible sequence of events that has been seen in the film! The fifteen minutes or so are possibly rivals only for the final thirty minutes of Delta Force in its brilliance. And that is giving Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other movie can you see Ed. Lauter take Alex Winter to retrieve the back of Charles Bronson, a troubled gang leader who apparently calls a hotline to summon neo-Nazi cyclists to come to his aid, and agile Broadway dancers wearing mesh stockings posing as street punks, all in a soundtrack written by Jimmy Page. If that's not the highest comedy, then nothing is fun. <br /> <br /> Honestly speaking, there are a thousand ways to express the unintentional comedy of Death Wish 3, but the only way to really understand it is to look at it and judge for yourself.
