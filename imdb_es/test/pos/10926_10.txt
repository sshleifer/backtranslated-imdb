I have seen many short films in my day. I often find them too compressed (throwing too much information at the viewer in the short time they have to run), too "artistic", or lacking a clear vision. I can not say any of these things about Starcrossed. In this review, I will do everything possible to avoid the dramatic spoilers, but I will also assume that the reader understands that the theme of this film is fraternal incest. <br /> <br /> As with any short film, The story is quite simple, direct and easy to digest. It is clear that the film tries to illuminate one of the deepest taboos of modern society. This movie is successful in all aspects. In the fifteen minutes of execution, I found myself feeling a range of emotions. With only a small dialogue, the viewer is quickly drawn into the most personal moments and thoughts of these cross-starred brothers. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene in his early childhood, one can see the very close relationship the brothers have. When the film progresses to the present in the next scene, the excellent acting and the honest and sincere performances remind to the viewer that love can come in the most unexpected and hard way. As the relationship progresses, any discomfort that the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress when the viewer suddenly realizes that there can only be one possible resolution. And the consequences of that resolution are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an open mind would do well to see this movie and absorb its message. If nothing else, boldly and honestly challenge the viewer to reexamine some of our deepest beliefs about the secret and shameful taboo of incest. Although the film is only fifteen minutes long, it resonates with the viewer long after the credits roll. This is perhaps my favorite short film that I have seen. I can not recommend it highly enough.
