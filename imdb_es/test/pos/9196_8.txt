1st seen 10/28/2007, 8 of 10 (Dir-Jesus Ponce): simple and sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures that survive in the everyday world without a roof over their heads. The film begins when the woman in the story (played by Isabel Ampudia) is released from prison, but we do not know what she was in and how long she was there. She meets the antihero of the story and her boyfriend, played by Sebastian Haro, while parking cars for the change. They huddle together under an old ruined building with nothing but the warmth of each and a small mattress in their possession. He is a drug addict who only tries to get from one solution to another, but she has a strange and obsessive attraction to him as a person, which we finally accept. He also has some kind of sexually transmitted disease, so sex for them is out of the question, but this does not seem to be a problem for any of them. She loves this man as he is, without a doubt, and without having to change, which is a rare find anywhere. He earns his living carrying a bucket and washing the windows. They eat a bakery roll every day and consider it a banquet. The character of Isabel dreams of a normal life, but does not expect it to happen and does not expect to fit into that role, so she does not give much importance. Both characters come from extremely broken homes and, therefore, the public feels sympathy for them despite their imperfections. Without giving up much of the story, the character of Isabel continues to persevere as the man gets worse and worse in his obsession with drugs. There is a good melodramatic conclusion to the story that raises it for the masses to enjoy, but in general this is a wonderful independent film about a relationship between non-worldly misfits that keeps you interested until the end.
