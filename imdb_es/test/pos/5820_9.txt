This love story warmed by light (for Cassavetes) is pleasantly transmitted by two wonderful performances by Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassell. Rowlands was never as beautiful as a repressed and damaged woman in her mid-30s who meets her partner in Seymour. Cassell is a dust of energy and romantic notions (in his terms). <br /> <br /> Val Avery has an excellent supporting performance as Zelmo Swift and an unusual (as always) Timothy Carey that is worth the price of admission. Made between Husbands and A Woman Under the Influence, this is the most accessible film by Cass that should touch the heart of anyone (especially those who hate Cassavetes) who claim that their films are too long and heavy at times. I made my Top Ten that year and it was not seen by enough people. 8 out of 10
