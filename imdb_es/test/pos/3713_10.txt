Two Soldiers is an excellent example of fine cinema. The director and producer took a moving story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast, excellent photography and a very creative art. <br /> <br /> The relaxed lifestyle of the brothers was represented in great detail, and contrasted strongly with the militaristic lifestyle in which they were pushed. The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears, as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the forests of North Carolina and an even harder war life. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent, particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful performance of the Colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was extremely good. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers, and I highly recommend it to audiences of all ages.
