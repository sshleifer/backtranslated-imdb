Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this film portrays the African American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), who was named CEO of a corporation after the white CEO passed away (white executives hate each other and can not decide who should happen to the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did! "Putney Swope" is the latest blow to the US power structure. It's the kind of thing that seems to have come from the mind of Richard Pryor. This is a classic comedy in every sense of the word. A true masterpiece. Hilarious
