Well, let me start by saying that, in general, I do not really like anime. I've enjoyed a couple of the "classic" series that are frequently cited, but I consider the medium in its entirety exactly the same way I do it on American television: namely, that a good 90-95% of that is absolutely triple, with the rest falling from "visible" to "decent". This being the case, it is not surprising that I do not like the self-deprecating anime parodies. I do not understand most of the jokes, and the medium itself imposes a certain style of humor that does not appeal to me at all: noisy, hyperactive, low profile and completely exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Then, when I started watching this series at the behest of a friend, I was prepared for disappointment after the first couple of episodes. I thought that the characters were supposed to represent the clichés of the worn out story schemes, and that their actions were supposed to be equally satirical. I could see where it came from, but I did not think it was that smart, a lot of crazy and funny high school shenanigans, and we just keep being ironic about it. "Approximately in the third episode, my opinion changed drastically. <br /> <br /> At that point, the strengths of this series began to manifest themselves: the peculiarities of the order of the non-chronological episodes, their sarcastic sense of self-consciousness and, above all, intelligent humor with (panting) a well-executed heterosexual man. <br /> <br /> In what I consider to be a rarity in any medium, this show presents cleverly thoughtful interactions between diametrically opposed characters. perpetual of the vaguely angry resignation of the protagonist Kyon provides the perfect complement to the actions of the generic character of Haruhi as the generic "anime" feats.It is a break with the formula and works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on that solid foundation, the series is more successful with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail.As previously stated, episodes are broadcast outside of or chronological order. I thought this was a trick at first, but it works surprisingly well. The chronological sequence of the events has a logical sense, but the aerated order of the episodes follows more closely the traditional structure of the Aristotelian drama. The chosen order does not leave narrative gaps that can not be filled with a simple inference (but if it is possible to guess what happened in an unwanted "previous" episode, one still feels obligated to see exactly how those events unfold), and the excellent planning avoids any drawing holes or contradictions. I saw this series for the second time immediately after completing it for the first time, and I was surprised at how well even seemingly inconsequential events were all together. <br /> <br /> The last point is indicative of extreme attention to detail in each area of ​​the series. While the designs of "anime" characters surrender a bit, the background art is exquisite, realistically made based on real photographic references. The quality of the animation is also excellent at important points. For example, there is a late musical performance in the series in which the characters are shown playing a song. This may sound trivial, but the subconscious effect of watching an animation (with movie quality) that corresponds to the soundtrack is incredible. <br /> <br /> In summary, I love this series for some reason. By its very nature, it is something that I do not usually like, but its execution is so unique and well taken that I can not help it.
