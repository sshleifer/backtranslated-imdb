I really felt that the film was ahead of its time. The only potential daughter-in-law was a strong, career-oriented woman. She knew what she wanted and was diplomatic, but firm with the mother-in-law she was. The role of the mother played extremely well (you loved to hate her). Her need to control her son's life was neurotically evil. If you have ever been in a relationship where you have been tried and found to be missing (and everyone involved knew that) this could affect your home too much. It's been years since I saw this movie and I remember thinking that this plot and dialogue would work in a movie of the 50s or 60s. It's hard to see due to the dynamics of the mother and the children, but I'd love to see it again . I still hope to find it in one of the old movie channels, but until now I have not had any luck. The attempts to buy it were also useless (I do not think it's on a tape or DVD).
