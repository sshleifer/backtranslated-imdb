I was lucky to see this film at a festival last year and I had half expected it to go on sale. The fact that it was recorded on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success, but, as I understand it, the filmmaker never intended to make LOOK LIKE FILM, in the first place, be more about the story than the characters and their relationships Is not that what movies are supposed to be? But it had a texture quality in its visual appearance that suggests that May Thomas is something we should pay attention to. Both for independent filmmakers and producers who have talent and lack money and unity, you can learn a lot by watching this film, technically it has everything in its favor, the use of light, music, etc. It's much bigger than any movie. Another digital movie that I have seen and therefore, is worthy of many accolades. The performances of the actors are credible to a certain extent, if they are not interpreted a little below, I felt that there was much more inside, deeper, in particular of the male leader John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really bothers me, as a filmmaker, is the film in black and white the need to cover a multitude of sins if it were color? Do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology? Or is this the future of wonderful and affordable cinema?
