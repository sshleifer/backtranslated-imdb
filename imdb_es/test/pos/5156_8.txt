You can not really call Roy Andersson prolific (6 movies in 37 years). You can not accuse him of being conventional either; it does not do it "straight", at least when it comes to narrative. "You, the Living", his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary in which you can see a lot of characters that do not do anything and if that sounds unpleasant, I assure you it is not. This is a funny, accessible and surprisingly warm movie, a portion of life far removed from what we normally see on the screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, 'life portion' is hardly the proper nickname to apply to this movie since most people's lives are unlikely to be something like this. The incidents on the screen range from the almost terribly ordinary to the most outlandish and while the characters fly by, sometimes never see them again, others reappear as if eager for approval, Andersson grants them all a kind of benign affection. That, and a little fun music, ensure that the time we spend with them is a time well spent.
