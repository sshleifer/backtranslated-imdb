If people were really that stupid, I could be the SRW - Supreme Ruler of the World. In this, Knotts plays a vertigo bean counter for a small city of rough water led by a group of crooked simpletons, only a little brighter than him. When things seem a little shaky for thieves, they go for a framing of the Figs patsy. A lot of laughter as Knotts makes his usual and awkward act of stumbling. I especially appreciated the extension cable scene; asininity at its highest level.
