This is a fun, smart and well worth your time movie. In my opinion, it's much better than American Pie and other movies of the same genre that seem to be knocked out all the time. I had not heard of this movie, so I guess it did not get much press, which is a shame. It is not taken too seriously, but at the same time it conveys a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is important ... Unlike a movie about a group of desperate guys who are trying to have sex for the first time. and an uncle put his p ** k in a cake, but in the end everyone went to bed and complained ... One thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was quite impressive and not the typical American pop-punk. ... In fact, they had old punk like the Ramones ... That in itself improved the movie! To be honest, I did not expect much from this movie and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this comedy is.
