I have not read Anne Rice's novel on which this movie was based, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting LA REINA DEL MALDITO and it's probably better for your health. It's not that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more than this movie. You can count the number of pages of Anne Rice that I read on the one hand, but after watching this movie and Interviewing a vampire, I have the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots of both films point to a whole sea of ​​deep and interrelated stories of vampires. <br /> <br /> However, Stuart Townsend's voice-over narrative is much more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative, and it can be said that the limited production resources of QUEEN OF THE DAMNED hardly give enough importance to the story of Anne Rice. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low-budget special effects that they really try to take seriously. You can see that the original novel had potential as a film and that the production team focused its attention on the wrong places. The wardrobe and the rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and a more strange soundtrack. <br /> <br /> However, I will give credit where the credit is owed. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed restrained me with the illness by shaking my noggin like Butthead. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a cool Goth-rock splice and zoom assembly, but after the first ten minutes or so, the direction degenerates quickly. It is as if the film was so long that the director realized that there was not enough time and enough money to do justice to an Anne Rice novel. The results are some scenes of mediocre vampires and a lot of corny special effects. Unfortunately, the QUEEN OF DAMN does not do justice to the genre just as her counterparts of John Carpenter do not impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is the pale blue makeup? Scene after scene, I shook my head remembering the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when the low budget went well. <br /> <br /> There are redeeming qualities that prevent this movie from being garbage. Props to Aaliyah, and may her soul rest forever in peace. She could have become a renowned actress, if they had not taken her life so prematurely, because she gave this movie a decent performance with a lot of belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It was not too long. Anne Rice's novel could easily have been a three-hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola had it in his hands. There are some twists and turns here and there in the plot. But in general, it was a legitimate addition of rock and roll to the large number of second-rate vampire movies that exist. The director of this film went on to direct a new mini series of Battlestar Galactica if that tells you something. <br /> <br /> JY <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com
