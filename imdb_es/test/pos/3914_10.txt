PEOPLE ARE STUPID. You should not cheer when Paris dies in the head with a pipe! It's rude! What did Paris do to you? What if it was you? You would not want people to cheer your death! Anyway, it was really bloody, what I liked and it was great when Elisha's finger was cut. It was strange that with that touch they did not have 2 children, they had a tree and all, It makes way for a House of Wax 2: Ressurction or something. Paris was great acting in the scene of the chase. The chemistry of Elisha and Chad is great, they deserve an Oscar. My friends and I were joking when that guy said it was great when Paris and the cousin Skeeter's boy kissed. Lol.K goodbye.
