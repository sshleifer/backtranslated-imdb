Working in a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to basically see all the films that come out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought: "Great, another Samuel L Jackson movie from 'Snakes on a Plane'". But of course, I wanted to see it because of the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the insinuations in the title, the images in the promotional advertisements and the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and a young woman who are going through difficult times and can communicate with each other. The story is really moving and sends a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it for young audiences because of some artwork, but if you're looking for a great story and a genuine performance by Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and, yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see 'Black Snake Moan' .
