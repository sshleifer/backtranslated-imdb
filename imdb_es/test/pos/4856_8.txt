The main criticism of this film by others, namely that Macy suddenly seems Jewish when putting on her glasses, is out of place. The glasses are just the little change needed to CONVENGE others, he is a Jew. The scene in which he tells his boss, (paraphrasing) "but you KNOW what my background is", along with another discussion with his mother, suggests that he had to fight against this same assumption in the past. The lenses now make him look Jewish enough to "confirm" the existing suspicions of his neighbors and coworkers. Then there is the big nose of his new wife and the taste for noisy clothes, which, of course, means that she is Jewish. The central point of the film is how those little stereotyped things become the complete basis for judging others. <br /> <br /> If he has a screech, he should be gay. If you have long hair, smoke drugs. If he is Hispanic, he has a knife ... and if he has round black glasses and has little weight, he must be a Jew. Those statements sound equally (im) plausible to me. If the conclusion to which the people in Focus jumped was reasonable, the whole point of the story would be lost.
