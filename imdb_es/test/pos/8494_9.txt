Taylor Hackford wanted to make this film for 15 years and finally found Jamie Foxx to play the lead role. Foxx is amazing in his interpretation of Ray Charles. In an interview I saw with Foxx, he met Charles several times and the two also played the piano together (Foxx had piano lessons as a child and played the piano in all his scenes). I did not see Charles live until his later years, so it was great to have a perspective on how his career developed. I hope that Foxx is nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor since he certainly deserves it. The music, too, is amazing: it really shows the breadth of Charles's music, from country to blues, and everything in between. The film also provides an impeccable description of the life of Ray Charles, from the many women with whom he was involved to his habit of using drugs and the consequences of that.
