Lucio Fulci made a lot of great movies throughout his career and the way in which many of them presented a lot of gore led him to win the title "Gore's godfather". Although Do not Torture to Duckling was made before Fulci became famous among the gorehounds, and is not so bloody; Without a doubt, it is a small and exciting thriller, and for my money, the best film that Fulci has done! Do not Torture to Duckling really is way above the Giallo genre in terms of production values ​​and, unlike many of Fulci's latest films, everything about this Giallo is great. The plot focuses on a small rustic community where corpses have begun to appear. The murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. Shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes, a reporter named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own. Martelli soon encounters several suspects, including a sexy young woman named Patricia, a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making stings and sticking pins in them. <br /> <br /> While this movie may not show much blood, it has two of Fulci's most unpleasant sequences to compensate for it. The most unpleasant thing involves a woman being brutally murdered by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any amount of rocks on the way down is likely to turn some stomachs. Do not Torture a Duckling presents an absolutely fantastic Italian cast. Barbara Bouchet (one of my favorites) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia, and flexes her acting muscles more than she did in many later films. Tomas Millian is excellent as always, while the rest of the cast is well developed by people like Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel. The cinematography on display is impressive and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into each scene. The story unfolds slowly, and it's always interesting, since Fulci never allows the film to deviate too much from the central plot. There is not much mystery towards the identity of the murderer; but Fulci almost manages to keep us guessing until the end and Do not Torture to Duckling reaches the climax. In general, it's a shame that Fulci has not made more movies like this one. Do not Torture to Duckling is his best work and I insist that all Giallo fans see him.
