It's okay. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What surprises me the most is the message that this film could direct to all of you there. And the message is sad. He says that it is very difficult to do something that is amazing or even genius without having to obey the governments, the establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you may not be able to stand it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems. <br /> <br /> A great movie by this wonderful Korean director. Please see it if you have an opportunity.
