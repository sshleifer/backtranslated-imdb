First, the positive aspects: an excellent job in representing urban landscapes to adapt to the mood of the film. Some of the shots could be paintings by De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, beautiful. <br /> <br /> The negative: the stories are hard to believe. The unreal, one-dimensional characters squeeze and pose 100% of the time, as if they were on a kind of catwalk. This is not the Antonioni of his previous films, much better, nor the Wenders that we have all come to know and appreciate. Malkovich is the excess baggage in this movie.
