Aspiring aspiring caricaturist Hoops McCann (a wonderfully engaging performance by John Cusack) and his best friend George (the delightfully inexperienced Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer after graduating from high school. Hoops, George and several recently arrived friends come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most charming moment), a singer whose family home is being threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer / director Savage Steve Holland offers an often hilariously witty and witty bombardment of certainly broad and foolish jokes, but still very funny. The constant madness madness has a real vitality, vertiginous and infectiously insane, which is impossible to dislike or resist. In addition, the animated and enthusiastic performance of an excellent cast of the game adds immeasurably to the bizarre fun: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic egg stork, Tom Villard as his crazy brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as evil jerk Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern as the bad stuffed animal, Kimberly Foster as the cracker he's looking for, Joe Flaherty as General Raymond, William Hickey as the old crabby Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as the boastful preppy bully Ty, and John Matuszak as the demolition cyclist Stan. Isidore Mankofsky's elegant cinematography, hip thrashy soundtrack, Cory Lerios 'rockin' cool score and funky animation are uniformly excellent. One of the funniest scenes: Egg in a Godzilla costume that terrifies an elegant dinner. An absolute cry
