Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays Vanaja, 15, who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. If you are going to be successful in life, you will have to overcome the liabilities of low caste and poverty. <br /> <br /> I went to the movie waiting for the representation of a miserable girl who is crushed by society. This is not what "Vanaja" shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. She will not accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed, and it is never clear that she will not succeed, despite the odds. <br /> <br /> The performance that Mr. Domalpalli takes out of his cast of fans is miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya is outstanding in the lead role, and Urmila Dammannagari does an exceptional job as Ms. Rama Devi, the rich landowner who was once a famous classical dancer. <br /> <br /> In the film, Vanaja learns classical dance from South India. , as he did in real life. I could not say how good the Vanaja dance was to Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were fascinating. (Do not think of Bollywood: this is classical dance, it's also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer lifts the heels of the floor.In the Indian dance Sound, the heel is the main point of contact). <Br /> <br /> This is a movie that should not be missed. It will work on DVD, but it will be better on a theater screen because the dance will be shown better. However, if the DVD is your only option, then see it that way. Just make sure you see it.
