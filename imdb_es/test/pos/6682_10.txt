The always charming Kevin Spacey makes us question once again certain truths in our lives. After making us believe that he is a petty thief (only to expose the true power of cinematic deception) in the classic The usual Suspect; this time it leads us to believe that it is Prot, a nice extraterrestrial who assumes a human form while walking the Earth. <br /> <br /> Prot is a strange stranger who has apparently appeared out of nowhere, only to be Hospitalized in the Manhattan Psychiatric Institution. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) soon becomes extremely interested in him, and he even finds himself thinking if Prot is really a supreme being on the planet K-PAX, or maybe he's just a forgotten human being with serious psychiatric problems. While the ending can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a complex and enlightening journey that leaves a lot of intriguing / philosophical questions behind it.
