I'm a Geena Davis fan for life because of this movie. I always liked Samuel L Jackson. And the two make a great pair on the screen. That said, I think 'TLKG' is the best action movie I've seen in my life, forget about the twisted endings audiences now expect and that filmmakers now try (mostly fail) to incorporate into their films. <br /> <br /> 10/10
