The first time I heard about this program was in 2005, first online and then seeing (and, of course, buying) the typical BBC connection book. Then I got the DVD; It did not disappoint! I was hoping that for years someone would do a science fiction program with an emphasis on the thrill of discovery instead of aliens, laser gun fights and other "boogieman" Hollywood tricks! Thank you, Joe Ahearne (also for your work of Dr. Who, and Ultraviolet, the miniseries, not the fucking movie of the same name). What forced me to write this now (2 years later) was that I had just seen SUNSHINE the night before. And what seemed to be in the same family as SPACE ODYSSEY became (about 2/3 of the entry) Freddy Krueger turns 2010! That's when SPACE ODYSSEY really stood out as a positive example of how to make a REAL sci-fi movie; More science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (as SUNSHINE) also dealt with the shortcomings of the astronauts (the failed EVA of Zoe, Ivan's excessive efforts on Venus, the spats with mission control) and the danger of exploring new planets with unknown dangers (the peak of radiation on Mars). I would have easily paid to see this in a theater (I-Max, anyone?). And to make matters worse, not only were the space views beautiful, but the characters were also very well drawn. I found his game more realistic than the SUNSHINE histrionics of Icarus 2 (Icarus, silent name for a solar mission: did anyone read the Icarus mythology?). Sometimes you need a not so good movie to force her to watch a better movie again. As an astronaut in an armchair, I would change my ticket in Icarus for a seat in Pegasus any day. However, to be fair, the images of SUNSHINE are quite impressive, and quite memorable. That's why I was so strongly supported to succeed as a science fiction film honest to kindness. So, even though this revision is almost a revision of SUNSHINE, I hope it is read for what it is supposed to be; Strong support for a BBC telefilm that succeeds where most big-budget inflated movie shows fail. SPACE ODYSSEY (a.k.a. VOYAGE TO THE PLANETS here in the United States) opens the appetite for solid, science fiction and offers a banquet. I also liked the pseudo-documentary approach. As for the delay / speed of light, they are addressed, if attention is paid. When SUNSHINE melts, ODYSSEY stays cool. If you are considering going to the movies for another dose of SUNSHINE, stay inside; Go for a true SPACE ODYSSEY instead!
