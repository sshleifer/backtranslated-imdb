I've seen this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and every time I see it, I'm attracted to the film and back to 1963. The film takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I see it. <br /> <br /> I think the important thing is to say that I was 15 years old in 1963 and I can remember "before they shot President Kennedy and before the beetles came." I can feel myself saying something like: "I brought a watermelon". And then realizing how stupid it was! Jennifer Gray plays Frances "Baby" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. The baby is going to start college in the fall. She goes to Kellerman's on vacation with her family (mom, dad and sister Lisa). <br /> <br /> One of the staff dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant by another staff person (one of the children's college played by Max Cantor) and have the opportunity to have an abortion, but it is in One night she and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are scheduled to dance at a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the need for a fill dancer for Penny. Johnny is convinced by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) that he can teach Baby to dance in time for the show. Baby learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes! <br /> <br /> Baby's father (Dr. Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when the miscarriage is performed. Dirty Dancing brought me back this time in history when the girls got pregnant and had abortions in the butt rooms of butchers. Around this time (1963), many girls died because of this type of abortion, but there were not many options for a girl at that time. <br /> <br /> Lonnie Price plays a great cocky grandchild (Neil Kellerman) for Jack Weston Kellerman's maximum. Jane Brucker does a great job as Baby's annoying sister, Lisa Houseman. <br /> <br /> The music is excellent and the dance is wonderful! The "dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very attractive. I can feel Baby's amazement when he sees them dancing and says: "Where did you learn to do that?" <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are simply perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song, "She's Like The Wind" brings tears to my eyes every time I hear / see in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie ends on a positive note, but leaves you wanting to know what happens next. In the lives of Baby and Johnny. Dirty Dancing gives something new every time you look at it: it hypnotizes the observer with nostalgia, a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again.
