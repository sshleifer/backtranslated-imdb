It always surprises me, given that the famous main song of 2001 is called "Also sprach Zarathustra", that nobody (nobody who has read, anyway) has noticed the parallels between the film and the famous work of Nietzsche, "Also sprach Zarathustra " . The idea of ​​the rebirth of man in a star child; a childish form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of "Zarathustra" by N .; there is a prominent passage called "On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the superman as a child, which transcends the ascetic and altruistic side of man (the camel always asking for more weight) and the rapacious, brutal and will power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song is reproduced during the sequence of the star child can hardly be a coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that "man is a rope tied between beasts and man". The structure of the film fits that description: a brief history of man as a beast, until we become true men dominating weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence on man (rope, so to speak), and then a brief glance at the superman The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in "Zarathustra", he makes it quite clear that he has no idea how people can make these changes for themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on a stranger (Zarathustra) to show us how to "sink". Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near end could be seen as Kubrick's best attempt in the 1960s style to represent mysticism "going under." <br /> <br /> I know that these parallels are quite broad, and almost certainly have been observed in other places even though I have not seen it personally. But I just wanted to mention them, if only to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was, ultimately, a somber philosopher. Few people consider that the end of 2001 is bleak and, in my opinion, explicitly and unequivocally Nietzschean. Without a doubt, it could be said that 2001 is above all a dramatization of "Zarathustra" updated for the modern era. Feel free to ignore the absolute snobbery of tying everything to Nietzsche.
