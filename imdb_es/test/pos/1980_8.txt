This movie is awesome and amazing. But I think maybe it can only be appreciated by the enthusiastic RPG RPGs. It's like a game. One problem is that the plot is too similar to a game and has too many twists. The turns are excessive. Jude Law gives a very good performance. I like it a lot in this movie, like Jerome in Gattaca and Gigglo Joe in A.I.
