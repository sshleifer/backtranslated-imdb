Reach the mind and feelings of all those who lead them deep into the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and layers of sound and scores. The landscape develops its own person, parallel to the internal geography of the three characters as their stories unfold. The absolute emptiness of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then the transcendence of emptiness through the opening of this desolation. Three wrong souls who struggle to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars offer skilful performances. A naive schoolboy, a suicidal blonde, a bitter car thief ... all converge with unexpected twists. Together they create an explosive portrait of fractured love, one that conspires involuntarily to mend itself in the midst of the most difficult forms of adversity and illusion, the blindness of human emotions.
