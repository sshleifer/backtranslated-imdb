This movie is absolute gold. If you have not seen it, do it. Mani Ratnam is overcome once more. This movie also introduced me to Nandita Das, although everyone shines in this movie. The only thing I regret is that I have never found a copy with subtitles in the lyrics of the songs. They take us from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of southern India, as well as from the terror of war to the last conquest for love of the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, with some hidden surprises waiting for the viewer, this film refuses to be seen again and again, and the story within the story, The Umbrella, is fine, as we watch the scene unfold from the drawings. in a book. Charming. Look at it.
