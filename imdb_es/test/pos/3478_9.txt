When I was 10 years old (currently 14), I swore I would never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except Shakespere for English class ... etc ... I was just watching things that ended happily. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, who was cute, not good, but entertaining enough to see her. After seeing this a few times during the two or so years since I first saw it, I started liking it, especially music. So I did a search on it and found IMDb ... I saw "Inside I'm Dancing" and I assumed I had made another dance movie, and I looked at it. Later, in an image search (of Rory, looking for the Gilmore Girls poster), I took a picture of this movie ... Then I looked for a trailer, found the trailer and, when I saw the hospital, I heard Rory. Say "You have the future" I remembered my vote and I realized that this would not be a good movie for me. But it only stayed in the back of my mind until we were in the video store and there it was used for $ 5, so I went ahead and bought it. After seeing it, I just wanted to get it out of my head because I was so sad. I still would not get close until I had cerebral palsy as a vocabulary word. Then I just had to see him again and this time all I did was laugh, even in the saddest parts that I did not feel depressed anymore because I realized that throughout this film I was happy and uplifting ... I love it and now It's one of my favorites, I'm sure this is the worst comment I've read. But watch the movie worth it.
