OK, I'm a fool. I loved it. I had no expectations and had them all fulfilled. It was a terrible movie. I loved. I have managed to use a DVD of excessive use. Nobody can understand my obsession. I can not tell the truth either. For those who have seen the movie, this will not be a surprise, but I asked the video store clerk if I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in stock and only one had checked out and more than half of The time had been for me. <br /> <br /> Now, the movie is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The acting is terrible, but I loved it. The actors are fools, the plot is silly, the fools are numerous, like being able to see through the monsters, the "arachnids" seemed to be made of plastic garbage bags (maybe they were), there was light underground, TNT did not it was not deafening, etc ... <br /> <br /> You really must love the B-Movies to enjoy this ... alcohol helps others enormously.
