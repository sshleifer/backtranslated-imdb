I thought that this movie was quite good and quite entertaining for a movie full of emotion. I agree with what another user wrote about the script sympathizing with the three main characters. I think this is what made the movie good. It was not bad either Mr. or Mrs. Kramer, and it was comforting, I think, to see two people essentially solving the problem on their own and finally doing the best for Billy. And, although it was a bit strange, I also liked the music of this movie. For some reason, the music seemed appropriate for the trip that the three main characters undertook. This movie flowed pretty well and did not draw, as some emotionally heavy films do. It was a serious situation, but he did not take himself too seriously. He simply told the story in a straightforward way and it worked quite well.
