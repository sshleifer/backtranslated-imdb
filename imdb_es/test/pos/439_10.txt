The story of Renoir about Paris, the Cancan, a washerwoman and the Moulin Rouge. A more tenuous but entertaining version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge. Jean Gabin offers his usual excellent performance. The technicolor photography that I saw in the print was exquisite. An easy evening. chris w galla
