Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's film work that has no equal. After seeing it again on DVD, almost a decade after its initial release in the United States in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as the recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris, winner of the Herzog Academy Award, The Fog. Of war. Like the first, it details, in its 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter, it gives a glimpse of one side of the war that few see. Yes, we see violence and heroism, but when The Fog Of War took us to the mind of one of the oldest warmongers of the last century, this film allows us to take a look at the life of a grunt that is captured by the enemy tortured. And finally triumphs. Except that, in no way, the form, nor the form, is the film as simplistic or optimistic as my brief description of it. The titular subject of Dieter Dengler and the German immigrant who survived the depredations of the Nazis is not Little Dieter Needs To Fly either (we discovered, as an example, that in his hometown, Wildburg, in the Black Forest, his grandfather was not the only one man to vote for Hitler, and suffered brutally for that position) after the Second World War in Germany, and his own imprisonment at the hands of the Vietcong, when his Air Force plane was shot down on Laos on February 1, 1966. Yes Well the title of the film and the idea of ​​Dengler's passion for becoming a pilot were shaken by the impression that the Allied fighter aircraft caused him when they destroyed his city when they were children, they make believe that Dengler is the central theme of the film . , this is not true. The theme is the survival of Dengler, or, more precisely, his human will, all human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are too Hollywood-like and an aspect of interest to Herzog. Neither is the fact that he won a Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, D.F.C. and Navy Cross. What pushed Dengler to survive so much, and to remain a relatively optimistic man (although there are flashes of darker sides), is what is at the center of this film, and the whole Herzog canon. Dieter Dengler's "distant barbarian dream" of his past is fully mature in Herzog Country, and the use of a Madagascar chant, Oay Lahy E, during many jungle scenes, among other excellent touches in the score, shows that Herzog is, maybe together with Martin. Scorsese, the best manipulator of image and music in cinema. How much time can be merged!
