Few people realize, but there was world literature in the ancient world before the Greeks appeared. In addition to the literary remains found in the "Old Testament" of the Jews, there were considerable works from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The summit of the first was religious poetry and "The Epic of Gilgamesh." The Egyptians produced many poems, but in addition, there was a story of adventures of a traveler and doctor called "The Story of Sinuhe". It is from this work (actually a fragment, of which we do not know the end of) from where the novel "The Egyptian" comes from. <br /> <br /> The story is unique (as is the movie). "The Egyptian" was a bestseller in the early 1950s, and Darryl Zanuck decided to risk it: yes, he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend Bella Darvi as Nefer, as well as the rest of the cast (Victor Mature, Edmund Purdom , Peter Ustinov, Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney), but he was aware that these films rarely made big box offices. One can point this out as an example of Zanuck trying something different. <br /> <br /> The amount of films about ancient Egypt is very small. "The Land of the Pharaohs", "The Egyptian", "The Ten Commandments" (both versions of De Mille), "Moses", "Holy Moses", "Cleopatra", "The Mummy" (all versions) , "The King Scorpion". If there are 20 films about ancient Egypt, it is tremendous. But "the Egyptian" is unique. While the second "Ten Commandments" is about Ramses the Great (Pharoah Ramses II - Yul Brynner) and his father Seti I (Cedric Hardwicke), and the films about Cleopatra deal with her, other names from ancient Egypt appear in the film. The greatest Pharaoh of Egypt was Thutmose III, who conquered most of the known middle east of the 1470 BC era. more or less. No film has appeared about him, nor about his usurper predecessor, the first great ruler in history, Hatschepsut. But the only known pharaoh who tried a religious revolution that came close to what the Jews (and later the Christians) tried, a kind of monotheism, is the theme of "The Egyptian." This is Pharoah Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> Actually, Akhnaton was practicing a personal form of monotheism that was not intended for public consumption. But he angered the priestly class that worshiped Amun, instead of Aton. Due to our uncertain historical records (although Akhnaton's official records, the letters "Tel-el-Amana", are quite complete as to their survival), we do not know if the Pharaoh was killed in a palace coup or not. However, he died, was succeeded by a young brother or son of his whose name is better remembered than any other pharaoh, except Ramses: Tutankhamun. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty good so far. Wilding is an Akhnaton of good character, who is too weak to be as effective as he is supposed to be a religious reformer. Mature is as good as the ambitious (and, out of the movie, the future success of Pharoah) Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom do well in their main parts and Ustinov is good as a friend of Purdom. Mrs. Darvi is also good, in a large part of support. In a wonderful cameo is John Carridine, like a philosophical grave robber. The film is certainly worth seeing, as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of ancient Egypt.
