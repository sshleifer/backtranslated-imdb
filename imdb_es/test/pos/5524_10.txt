The job title was: "Do not Spank Baby." <br /> <br /> Wayne Crawford became a successful producer of films like Valley Girl, Night of the Comet and others, even though he was not too good at this little gem. And the little-known Abe Zwick should have got tons of work from this movie, but he did not. Filmed at Moberly Studios in Hollywood, Florida, on the same lot as the first Tarzan movies were filmed. This movie is definitely for those who appreciate the abstract. The film was originally shot with some scenes of nudity and much more graphics. For reasons known only to Tom Casey, the Director, the bloody slasher scenes were given an LSD token and the nudity was removed. Although this version is worth a look for those who want it, in my opinion, the original version would have given the necessary blow to make this a complete in the Cult Classic Slasher 70.
