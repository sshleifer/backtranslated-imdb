"Lights of New York" originally started as an experimental two-reel Vitaphone short film that eventually became the first "talkie" movie. Helene Costelle was supposedly one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood and her sister (in my opinion, the real beauty) Dolores Costello, who seemed to have all the breaks. Poor Helene is best known for appearing in this rather sad movie that bought her a revolution in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Two smugglers on Main Street convince a couple of small-town barbers to try their luck Broadway Hairdressers Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Gene (Eugene Palette) do not realize that your hairdresser will soon be a cover for illegal contraband activities. Soon they will realize and regret the day they left their small town. The only thing that keeps them going is the loan that Eddie's mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay. Eddie returns to meet Kitty Lewis (Helene Costello), a girl from her hometown who has performed well on Broadway. Kitty is worried about "Hawk" Miller (Wheeler Oakman) who is always surrounding her, but Eddie, innocently, thinks he is exaggerating because "Hawk" already has a girlfriend Molly (Gladys Brockwell), but to reassure her she gives him a small gun. to scare unwanted admirers away. "Hawk", who killed a police officer and has "Feds" approaching, decides to incriminate Eddie. Meanwhile, Molly is quite sick of her treatment of "Hawks" and after a confrontation where he tells her that he is behind a chicken and not an old chicken, the stage is set for: Murder !! <br /> <br /> The fact is that it's not all horrible, apart from gangsters and dancers who speak in their best voices of elocution and that still happened in the movies in 1930. Gladys Brockwell (albeit somewhat melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (quite natural) were fine and they were the most experienced actors in the cast. You could not see John or Ethel Barrymore; Cullen Landis and Helene Costello soon returned to the darkness from which they had left. I also did not notice much of the "hidden microphone", where people had to be grouped around different objects, that is, a telephone or sitting on a sofa before being able to converse. The people who saw him in the cinema probably began to think that all the policemen spoke in that monotonous tone while that tendency continued in many of the first fanatics, that is to say, "Small CÃ©sar" (1930). In any case, they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a fully spoken movie, with some singing and dancing, in 1928. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
