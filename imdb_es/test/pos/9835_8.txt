As a fan of history, mythology and fantasy, the "Mystic Knights" program attracted me from the start. It has semi-decent scripts, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), it has a pretty good performance, and the heroes and villains play well with each other. <br /> <br /> WRITINGS - Half of a script is Pretty good, the other half is deflated, but everything is mixed, which means that many episodes turn out like that. In addition, some of the key players repeatedly receive dead dates (King Conchobar and Angus, for example) need to be given something ... more. I'm not sure what, but writers should be able to come up with something. ACTING - Apart from some of those who acted excessively on the part of the villagers (horrible lines on which they ended up putting too much effort), the casting did very well in the choice of their potential clients and so on. Everyone, good and bad, works well together! SUITS / ARMS - Everyday clothes everyone wears is spectacular! The Mystic Knight armors that fall short are those of Deirdre and Garrett. A chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in her case ... and it would not look so plastic; It looks like a handful of pieces of brown plastic, when it should look like bronze. Ivar's trident looks like it was bought at a discount store and although Garrett's weapons look good, they also look plastic. <br /> <br /> Recently, "Mystic Knights" has acquired too many "Power Rangers" traits, if you observe them. The show, you'll know what I mean. However, as the series progresses, you must find your niche and refine your style. In general, it is a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and I see it and we are all over 20). The plot is complicated and twists, although it becomes a little juvenile in some places, and everything is still more interesting. It could be of some interest to fans of the movie "Willow" or the television and television series "The Adventures of Sinbad." Lots of adventure, a little mystery, a hint of romance, a handful of forces in nature ... Take a look! (My score: 7/10)
