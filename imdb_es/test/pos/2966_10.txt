I liked this movie. I was not really sure what it was before I started seeing it, but I still enjoyed it. It was a girl (Meredith Monroe) whose mother did not want her to come out like her. Meet and fall in love with a child (Riley Smith) who is the city for a charity football game. It's a good movie. I just hope it turns on again or comes out on video.
