I do not go for so many "robbery" comedies, and I may not care about this if it were not for the actors, when it was made, and when I VIGO FOR THE FIRST TIME (just a few years later). It's almost too similar to "The Happening" (although it's obviously a far less serious comedy than that): the mafia figure takes over his own kidnapping, or rather, turns it in a completely different direction. Of course, Raquel Welch did not play the kind of sharp character that Faye Dunaway played in The Happening, but that does not make it a sexist film either: she was practically playing an original character, almost her version of "moll"! But I'm completely skewed: it's one of the first movies I saw with her, and the moment I saw her, you could not turn around without seeing a poster of her (luckily). I think Robert Wagner really was right as a leader of the group that was neither very nice nor unpleasant, like Edward G. Robinson (naturally) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who always managed to be funny.
