I was surfing IMDb one day, when I came across "The curious adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". When I realized how dark it was, I decided to go find it. Thanks to Digiview, it did not take me long, so I bought it for a dollar, and when I got home I saw it, although I must say it impressed me a lot. <br /> <br /> Three of The paintings in a king's apartment, a shepherdess, a chimney sweep and a self-portrait of the king (who is as selfish and sadistic as the king himself) come to life one night while the king sleeps. The shepherdess and the chimney escape, while the king's painting calls the police to capture the couple. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wonderbird comes to help them, often mocking the police and the king. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD case describes this film as "a surreal visual delight and an underestimated entry in The History of Classical Animation". I could not agree more with that, considering that many of the backgrounds seem quite strange, and many of the characters are rare, which include the depressed citizens of an underground city and the hungry lions calmed down with the music of a blind man (who looks like Andy Warhol), not to mention that the Wonderbird itself is somewhat eccentric. The film is very creative and above all fun to watch, and its only flaw is that it can be slow. But in general, this movie was very good, and is truly recommended by their own. <br /> <br /> Grade: B + (Impressive)
