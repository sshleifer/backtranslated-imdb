Billy Crystal is Larry, a writer who has not written and is suspected of murder in "Throw Momma from the Train", starring Danny Devito and Anne Ramsey. The phrase "black comedy" was invented for this madness, which is a takeoff of "Strangers in a Train" by Hitchcock. In fact, Owen (Devito) has the idea of ​​Larry killing his mother in exchange for Owen killing Larry's ex for watching that famous movie. "I saw the movie, Crusade," Owen tells Larry. It's not that Larry knows what he's talking about until it seems it's too late, like "Strangers." Larry, a writing teacher, claims that his ex-wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put his name on it. He has become a big celebrity, appearing in "Oprah", where he refers to Larry as "a beast". Owen is in Larry's class. She lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has visions of poisoning her, putting a scissors in her head. It was not long after seeing "Strangers in a Train" who is in Honolulu, stalking Larry's wife. While leaning over a railing on the boat trying to get an earring, Owen stands behind her and crawls up ... Soon, the police are looking for Larry to interrogate him, but he is in Owen, where he encourages to live until the end of a bargain that he had no idea of ​​having done. You know, "crisscrossed". There are several scenes copied from "Strangers", which are hilarious. Especially, I loved Larry's confession with Mrs. Lift, Owen's mother, when he thinks he's talking to Bruno's stepfather. <br /> <br /> Crystal and DeVito are complete masters of comical dialogue and time and will leave you laughing, often out loud. Ramsey is disgustingly funny: a totally "out there" performance. Kim Griest and Rob Reiner also have roles: Griest is Crystal's girlfriend, and Reiner has what amounts to a cameo. <br /> <br /> The ending is very intelligent, and the whole movie will leave you laughing.
