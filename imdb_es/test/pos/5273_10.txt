The answer ..... No, unfortunately not. Even though Miller and The Sweep must be considered as a more capricious cinematographic delight. The drama, the suspense, the romance and the unidentified crowd at the end, add to the complex story of the film, which must have been too much for the public of 1898. Experience, one for the whole family!
