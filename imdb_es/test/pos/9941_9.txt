"Opera" is one of the greatest achievements in the horror genre. This masterful image has everything that should be in the pure horror movie: good captivating story, many symbols, wonderful images and lots of blood. The murders are very shocking and bloody. An unforgettable atmosphere of fear and fear. A must see for a true Argento fan, so if you have the opportunity to see it.
