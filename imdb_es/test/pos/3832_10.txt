This is one of the best episodes of "Star Trek", with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to fight an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they discover that the feared Romulans are a racial race of the Vulcans! The young Mr. Stiles, well played by Paul Comi, is one of the few really unpleasant characters in the "Star Trek" universe. His barely concealed hatred of Mr. Spock is disturbingly similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern descent. The atmosphere of the paranoia of war is too real. Then there are the Romulans: they are the best nemesis in the Federation. The Klingons are unpleasant but basically harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, are very important: they are the ancient Romans reborn in the space age; despite their Vulcanoid characteristics, they are clearly intended to remind us of imperial Rome, with names like Decius and titles like "centurion" and "praetor". The chainmail armor is really cool. Guest guest Mark Markard, who played Spock's father, Sorek, as well as the Klingon commander in "Star Trek: The Movie," is an appropriately graying and tired war commander, a character who bears a striking resemblance to the Crassus by Laurence Olivier in "Spartacus". In addition, his questioning of the insatiable thirst for conquest of the Empire reminds me of similar misgivings that Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) expressed at the beginning of "Gladiator." A must for Trekkies and for the fans of the sword and the sandal.
