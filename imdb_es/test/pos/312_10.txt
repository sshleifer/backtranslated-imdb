Somewhere in IMDb there is a discussion about the best director of all time (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named there). The biggest argument was around Spielberg and whether or not he is a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that, although he is a technical teacher, most of his films lack depth. The fact that Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but his message is boring and although it is very entertaining, it does not make you think about everything. AN is the best film I've seen, as it combines a great film with a deep philosophical perspective of so many things, from the war in general, the clash of civilizations, the status of soldier in times of war (is it a soldier a hero or a murderer? Brando says he is neither, the French lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to discuss whether these points are true or false. But a great movie, and a great work of art in general, is supposed to generate arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he is not, nobody has the truth anyway. You can see this movie for its exterior beauty, amazing scenes, great performances and memorable appointments, and you will be completely satisfied. But what really makes this film a masterpiece is its interior quality. You can not help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary. Both Copolla and Moore approach similar problems, but while Copolla presents the issues from an external and objective point of view, Moore adopts a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of view. a documentary ... It's really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 has won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway, if you want to start understanding a bit about the Vietnam War, the Iraq war, the Second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, and not the other ...
