The first time I saw The Victim (also known as Out Of Contention) was more than 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate Bewitched fan since I was a kid, I loved seeing everything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real pleasure, whether you're a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, as her representation as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the alleged killer in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden. His performance in The Victim as Kate, a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, with a murderer behind her is brilliant. If you like thrilling suspense thrillers, this is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. Another great performance that is worth mentioning is that of Eileen Heckhart, who plays the mysterious and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately, like most Miss Montgomery films, The Victim is not available on DVD and I think that although it was released on VHS a few years ago, it's a rarity these days. I was lucky to have recorded it when it aired on television about ten years ago and to have a good copy of this very good movie. You must see it!
