If you like alternative realities, contemplating what is real and what is only a fantasy, this is a thriller that will leave you tuned and will make you think. Try to get a copy of it and see for yourself! I saw him recently at a film festival of L.A. and he was by far the best of the group I saw. It helped that it really was something, unlike the others that were examined. It is very well run and the production value is first class. I would compare it to Jacob's Ladder in the sense that it keeps you guessing what the true reality of the world we are in is. You should definitely try to catch this movie and, if you are screening at a festival near you, try Take a look.
