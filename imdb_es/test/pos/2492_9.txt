My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film, which has now been released on DVD for the first time in the UK, has been more than rewarded. Peter Watkins has excelled in his audacity and technical skills. This pseudo-documentary is certainly ahead of its time and remains terribly relevant and up-to-date. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by the turmoil of the late sixties in the United States, when the government has increased its legitimate use. Of violence and oppression, while the anti-war movement reacts increasingly violent and radical. To deal with this, the overcrowding of prisons and to provide special training to riot police units, the government has introduced so-called punishment parks. Convicted "criminals", mostly activists, have the "option" to remain in prison for years and years, or spend three days in one of these parks, where they can obtain their freedom after their death or even a sentence of Longest prison. . However, the situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations. It reminded me of a kind of realistic version of Battle Royale (2000). <br /> <br /> The structure of the film is extremely effective and recalls parallels with the cannibalistic Holocaust, which took place almost 10 years later. Both films are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged to think and feel that he is really watching a real documentary and, therefore, surprised, although he is aware that: this is a movie. Both confront us with the inherently violent nature of humanity, but where the cannibal Holocaust lacks a deeper meaning (above all, it is a film of exploitation in every sense of the word) and does not pose any critical question about the state of the human being. world. , Punishment Park does exactly that. <br /> <br /> I have been deeply impressed with Punishment Park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Maybe that says enough about the truth of its content, about how the power structures in this world work. I do not agree with the criticism that Watkins polarizes and creates stereotypes, because the film shows the activists and the guardians of legitimized power structures that are actually as polarized as they are here. If they were not, there would be no conflict and, therefore, no change in our societies. In reality, the confrontations between these two groups often take stereotyped forms, whether they are placed between activists and establishments in Latin America, Russia or New York City. If these groups were not polarized to these extremes, the activists would be part of the silent majorities that tacitly complain, but at the same time reside in the injustices of the world. <br /> <br /> As Peter Watkins tells us in The Introduction to the DVD, the actors in Punishment Park are mostly amateurs. Most of the children were true Los Angeles activists, most of the policemen had been part of the national forces and even some of the members of the courts were part of the social and political establishment of the time. Not presenting both groups before shooting the scenes that take place in the improvised court room adds to the spontaneous and improvised feeling. Parallels are drawn with themes of the time, such as the repression of the members of the Black Panther (it is said that one of the black prisoners looks like the charismatic condemned BPleader Bobby Seale) and the trial of the seven in Chicago. <br /> <br /> I admire Watkins' obvious and sincere commitment to injustice and his concern for human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (today in the name of the War on Terror) to silence those who do not agree and refuse to be brainwashed. Punishment Park remains an extremely important film that should be shown in schools and seen by all who share these concerns. Maybe their marginalization can finally be compensated.
