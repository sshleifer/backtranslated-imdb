At the end of the sixties, the director Sergio Corbucci made four spaghetti westerns followed: the classics THE MERCENARY, THE GREAT SILENCE, SPECIALISTS and COMPANIONS. Three of these, all except the SPECIALISTS, appear constantly in the top ten lists when the spaghetti westerns are classified. Until recently, all I had seen was a compilation of very poor quality with some English, some Italian, a blurred image, and it was almost incomprehensible. Now, after having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (even in two languages, however), I can safely include THE SPECIALISTS in that group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is very good as the charismatic Hud, a notorious hand with the weapon that returns to Blackstone to investigate the death of his brother, who was lynched by the townspeople for losing their savings. It is a voluptuous beauty that the bank owns, a leader of Mexican bandits, El Diablo, who was once a friend of Hud, an honest sheriff who dreams of better days and a small band of hippies. Well, it was in the late sixties. and hippies were everywhere, even seemingly in our westerns. It's not a western desert, filmed in the Alps somewhere, and it's lovely to see. There's a bit more nude than I expect in a western, but that's not a bad thing. Sylvie Fennec is charming like Sheba, who may be Hud's niece, or her dead brother's girlfriend ... that's not clear. This movie deserves to be seen, and once again, we ordered a good DVD with all the trimmings. I think THE SPECIALISTS would be as well known as any of the other Corbucci westerns, and that's a great compliment.
