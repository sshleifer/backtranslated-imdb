Basically, this is a very good movie. However, it is very different from the other Seagal films, which unfortunately can put out some of their fans. Unlike some of the other movies, this does not feel like a 'Seagal vehicle'. You can also see many of the other characters and all of Mr. Seagal's actions are not the same as we have seen before. The concept that he is an "intellectual" in something other than bombs and other weapons is a pleasant change. Although there are some unrealistic parts in the movie (some more obvious than others), in general, you can let them go because the movie is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It comes down to this: if you're looking for a classic Seagal action movie, I'm sorry, but you'll be disappointed. Look at it anyway for fun. If you're open to see Seagal without the action, it's worth checking out. Personally I think it's one of the best jobs he's done in a while. <br /> <br />
