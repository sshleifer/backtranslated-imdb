The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of World War II, a unique setting, with a couple of British agents held by the Germans on a farm. As they are not yet technically at war, it seems that both parties must have realized what was coming. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) escape to the field and separate. Milland runs into Marlene Dietrich, a gypsy woman, one night while she is alone in her camp preparing dinner. Their meeting is a surprising and captivating scene, not so much for Milland but for Dietrich, who brings the sensuous sensual to a new plane. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy to hide from the Germans, but remains committed to his mission, and has to do with locating the scientist who knows the formula for a new poisonous gas but is not a committed Nazi either. Hollywood's vision of Gypsy life and customs can be predicted, but the underlying knowledge that they would be one of the targets for the extermination of the Nazis adds some tension. The film crosses the line between being a serious story about poisonous gas and the urgent search for the formula, and a colorful, if not too convincing, love story between Milland and Dietrich. However, both are very good; it is the fault of the film that did not give them or their relationship a dramatic realism, based on and exploiting obvious cultural differences for questionable comic purposes. However, there are some tense and interesting points here and there, the surprise meetings with German soldiers and agents of the Gestapo, where Dietrich makes a great reading of the palm of his hand and Milland is almost as good as a fake, and a dinner of Germans of diverse tendencies in which the announcement arrives on the radio from which Germany had been attacked by Poland and all stand up and make a stiff arm salute. Mitchell Leison may have missed some opportunities here and there, but took full advantage of others.
