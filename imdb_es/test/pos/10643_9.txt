After reading a biography about the last Russian Tsar (Nicholas II), and his inability to secure the support of the army, I decided to try this film. <br /> <br /> I saw him with a completely open mind, not knowing anything about it (except his reputation). <br /> <br /> These are the things that impressed me the most. <br /> <br /> 1) The shots of the battleships and the soldiers used as extras. More than once I stopped to think "if this had been done in this time and place, 80% of this would have been generated by computer". <br /> <br /> 2) Realism in him. From the meat infested with worms to the sailor's shot with his candle and the legend "Killed by a bowl of soup", this film makes no concessions to the cause of the PC (which, fortunately, had not yet been invented). br /> <br /> 3) The slow descent into the madness of the Odessa steps sequence. From the first shot, when the man appears without limbs, you have the idea that something could be wrong; However, since shots are generally composed, you end up feeling comfortable in your surroundings. Then an amputee appears and people begin to fall into dramatic postures. Still, the shots are composed ... until the Cossacks appear on the scene, and the incredible juxtapositions of shots appear. This scene is easily worth the price of the entrance. <br /> <br /> 4) The fact that this film is 100% unadulterated propaganda. On the other hand, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan, it also had something to do with "propaganda"; just a different type. <br /> <br /> In general: a film marked by a somewhat slow narration. However, Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this film are perfect examples of ingenious and avant-garde films that are still remembered for their merits today. They really make modern movies look boring and repetitive.
