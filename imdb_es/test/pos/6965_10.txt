Sixth (and last) movie in boxset. Well, it seems that I saved the best for last. Ghoulies IV. I originally did a review for this in February, but I decided to make a new one. The Ghoulies series is quite impressive. I know there are some people who do not like them, and that's fine. This happens to be my favorite in the series. Yes, I know that real Ghoulies do not appear and are replaced by 2 guys with costumes, one of them is Tony Cox from Bad Santa. Now, in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film centers around Jonathan Graves, the main character of the first film, which is being played once again, by Peter Liapis, who is now a police officer for the Los Angeles Police Department and he has put his Past of the occult behind him. During the first part of the film, we find Alexandra (played by the very hot Stacie Randall) who communicates with a demon from beyond named Faust, which is the dark side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra for a red jewel and something goes wrong, therefore, unleashing the Ghoulies from beyond. <br /> <br /> I think Jim Wynorski did a good job with the management. And the music of Chuck Cirino is also fun. (SPOILER FORWARD) At the end of this film, the Ghoulies say there will be a Ghoulies IV, Part 2 or Ghoulies V. I'm still waiting for a sequel to be made and, especially, I hope Jim Wynorski will return to direct. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies on that.
