While it is not as good as announcing a murder, which was not only delicious but almost exceeded the book, this is an excellent adaptation. And you know what, it's a great improvement in Geraldine McEwan's version. Now I'm not proud to speak ill of Geraldine McEwan's adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started well but were ruined by a poor script, a confusing final solution or both. Geraldine McEwan's version suffered from a slow pace, and the two previous problems, and I would consider the second worst of the ITV adaptations, being the worst Sittaford Mystery, which even on its own merits was boring and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a great improvement, not only respects the book, despite some liberties, but also corrects the problems that had the version of ITV. Despite the added character of Lionel that presents itself as somewhat irritating, it has more to do with the way it was written than with the way it was acted, and one or two slow-paced moments, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully filmed, with a beautiful photograph and period details, and music as always is excellent. The performances are wonderful this time, and make the most of a script well done in general, with Joan Hickson brilliant as always as Miss Marple, and solid turns of Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is outstanding in a chilling and moving performance like Clothilde. In general, it is worth seeing, better than the recent version in almost all departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox
