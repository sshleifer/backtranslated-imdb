He was never kissed, starring Drew Barymore, as Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely sad and sometimes quite painful story of a shy woman named Josie Gellar who, although brilliant, is silent and shy and has never been kissed for a man. He is assigned his first important news for the newspaper in which he works: to go undercover as a high school student, establish a friendship with great children and get information about what really happens in the high school world. The only problem is that Josie has never been popular. High school was, in fact, a traumatic experience for her, as she received many cruel jokes and jokes. Josie takes this task, both to finally "fit in" and to get a scoop: what she finds is the main premise of the story. <br /> <br /> She was never kissed is one of those films that is so sad and Schmaltzy sometimes, particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of credibility are very proven and that many cynics do not like this movie. However, it is very sweetly done. Drew Barymore is perfect as the clumsy but lovely Josie. She breathes fresh air into the character and makes it look perfectly realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day at school. <br /> <br /> She has never been kissed, she has some really funny moments while Josie unravels herself in her frantic efforts to be cool. Example: the bar scene of reggae. I also loved the appearance of Rob, Josie's brother, who also comes back and registers as a high school student, the way he helps give Josie her "dream" of finally fitting in is simply funny. At the same time, since Josie's sad story of her original years in high school is shown in a flashback, it is extremely painful. It is not necessary that you have had similar experiences in high school that Josie to be affected by her story. Drew is wonderful in making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we love Josie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of "bad girls" a 2004 release, in this movie, but honestly the girls were much more grumpy. He has never been kissed, it becomes a very romantic image, since Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question is whether they will meet. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It was very well done in some areas. The movie is corny in some places, yes, the last scene, realistic, by no means, does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious way in Hollywood? Oh yes, yes, yes, baby! But it is manipulated perfectly, there are some lessons to be learned here. The film never preaches, but manages to paint a precise picture of what high school was like for a select few. In fact, I've met people who have had experiences similar to Josie's. I have met people very similar to all these characters. I think many people simply do not know or can not conceive the cruelty that can exist in the world. of high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it's there. It is not realistic at all. What struck me was Drew's speech at the prom, as she demonstrates the "sheep mentality" that can exist so often, like Hollywood and the fabrication that many believe there may be, was well done and It was very true. <br /> <br /> I'm making you never kissed me sounding louder than it is, in truth, this is a perfect movie to choose when you want a sweet and good image. He is attractive, sweetly acted and only Rufus. I would say take a look. 8 out of 10
