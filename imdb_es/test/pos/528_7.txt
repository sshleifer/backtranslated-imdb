Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was very excited to see this film on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This film has great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting ideas about a London 'not so well known'. <br /> <br /> The film develops completely in "dark" colors, which I personally do not like. much. Also, the narration was too British and the comments were sometimes a bit flat. Apart from that, there are some excellent comments from Londoners and excellent shots. FINISTERRE does not glorify London by showing all the great attractions of the city, but offers a deep insight into what London really is like. From the east end to the vibrant center with its music scene, as well as the "special little retreats" for Londoners. <br /> <br /> In general: <br /> <br /> + Fantastic soundtrack + Beautiful images + excellent ideas <br /> <br /> -Narration -Sure to look sometimes -Very dark image < br /> <br /> Worth seeing! I give it a 7/10
