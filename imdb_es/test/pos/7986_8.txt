The best Batman movie of the 90s without a doubt. This film takes place in a city full of insecurity and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Although the villains are somewhat corny, they fit perfectly with the colorful and nightmarish cinematic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> The performances are really excellent and the comedic tone behind them really generates expectations. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cheesy costumes, this is a movie in Burton's pure style. That can not be described; Burton is a sui generis director who took the Batman franchise to another dark level but without forgetting his comic past. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of action movies and, best of all, if it's superheroes.
