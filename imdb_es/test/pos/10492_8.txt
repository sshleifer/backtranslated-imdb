Of the 600 Spaghetti Westerns made, this has to be among the top twenty somewhere. I can not believe that this has not received any revision! Gemma is excellent at this. Van Johnson is also good, although his bent voice is a bit of a killer, but that's the charm of the Italian style. Beautiful photography and some action excellently staged. All the secondary characters are well played. The severity of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough, even by today's standards, which creates an emotional depth for the character of Gemmas in some of the situations that occur. Absolutely FANTASTIC score by Luis Bacalov. Watch this on Japan's wonderful widescreen DVD. A spaghetti must have.
