I have read all of Jane Austen's novels once a year each year since I was 9 years old and I received the Modern Library edition of her complete works as a birthday present. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie for its romance and for the music, which remained, eerily, in my head. It was an interpretation, of course, not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility, but something very different and something that Catherine herself would have loved. And oh be loved by this passionate Henry! This was Henry's imagination of Catherine, and is the romantic heroine he read in his novels, and was promised by Jane Austen, who tells us from the beginning that the unlikely Catherine will be one. I wonder if Jane was being completely satirical in her novel. Maybe, she too, could imagine a certain Henry. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie in many years, at least a decade. But, I've been yearning since then.
