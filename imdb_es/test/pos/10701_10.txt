"Ninja 3: The Domination" by Sam Firstenberg combines martial arts with "The Exorcist" as horror. The horror elements thrown on the screen are simply ridiculous, but the movie works like a mindless action / martial arts movie. The fight scenes are well choreographed and exciting, and the movie is never boring. So forget the stupid dialogue, the silly action and the annoying soundtrack: drink some beer and take a look! Highly recommended!
