The 1970s are often seen as a golden age of British television comedy, a period in which many classic sitcoms and sketching programs were seen such as "The Monty Python Flying Circus". However, the period was not a golden age of British film comedy, and what worked well on television was seldom transferred successfully to the big screen. Pythons provided the most triumphant exceptions to this rule, but their best films ("Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Brian's Life") were very different in their conception of their television program. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the adaptation of comedies for the cinema is that the concepts designed to fit the 30-minute spaces of the BBC (25 minutes on ITV, you have to find space for commercials) They do not always work so well when they expand into a three or four movie. Sometimes longer Few people will remember the film versions of, for example, "Up Pompeii!" or "Steptoe and Son" with the same affection as the television versions. In the case of many classic television comedy shows ("Some Mothers Do 'Ave' Em", "Yes, Minister", "Fawlty Towers", "The Goodies") no attempt was made to film them, so we can be grateful Characters like Frank Spencer by Michael Crawford or Basil Fawlty by John Cleese can be fun in half-hour doses, but I doubt they're still so fun for two hours. A comedy show (though a dramatization of a comic novel instead of a comedy in the normal sense) that might have worked in the movies was "The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin," but the hopes of a movie were frustrated by how tragically early The death of his star, Leonard Rossiter. <br /> <br /> "Papa's Army" was one of the few television comedies of the period that became a decent movie. (About the only other one that occurs to me is "Porridge"). This was possibly because he had an unusually large number of well-developed characters and derived most of his humor from the interactions between them. The original situation comedy was published between 1968 and 1977 and told of the misadventures of a National Guard squad in the small coastal town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The National Guard, initially known as the Local Defense Volunteers, was an auxiliary militia during World War II composed, for the most part, of men too old to serve in the regular forces). The film version is a three-act drama. Act I deals with the formation of the platoon and the recruitment of its members. In Act II they wreak havoc during an Army training exercise. In Act III, they manage to capture a group of Nazi aviators whose plane has been shot down. <br /> <br /> The three key players in this drama are the platoon commander, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe), and his two subordinates Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and Corporal Jack Jones ( Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, who in civil life is the manager of the local bank, is a demanding man, who looks at the world through a pair of thick glasses. It is he who takes the initiative to form the unit of the National Guard and appoints himself as his commander. He is pompous, officious, with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and his own leadership powers, the kind of man who does not suffer fools with gusto. (And in George Mainwaring's worldview, the term "dumb" covers most of the rest of the human race). He, however, has his good qualities. He is motivated by a genuine patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage, as evidenced by his encounter with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Wilson is the Mainwaring officer at the bank. The two men are very different in character, somewhat emphasized by a difference in appearance, Wilson is tall and thin, while Mainwaring is short and sturdy. He seems to be smarter and better educated than his boss. (His accent suggests he may be a former public schoolboy). However, he has ended up playing a secondary role in both civil and military life, probably because he has the kind of passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeatism and the inability to take something seriously. Jones is an old soldier who now runs the local butcher shop. (His promotion to Cabo is mainly due to his ability to bribe Mainwaring with black market sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role only compares with his incompetence and ability to cause chaos. Although his slogan is "Do not be scared!" he is prone to panic at any given opportunity. <br /> <br /> Several other platoon members are featured. Private Fraser, the Scottish gravedigger, is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Sentence: "We are damned, man, DOOMED!"). Soldier Godfrey is a kind old man whose main concern is the location of the nearest bathroom. Private Walker is a sharp Cockney spiv and Private Pike (another employee of the bank) a spoiled child of a mummy. (Pike's mother is Wilson's lover, although Wilson tries to keep this link of Mainwaring's disapproval secret). Two important outsiders are the suave Vicar and the director of ARP, the detested enemy of Mainwaring and its equivalent in pomp and craft. <br /> <br /> There are occasional two-way noises ("Keep your hands away from my privates" - Mainwaring ostensibly refers to those soldiers who have that rank), rather than on the television show that was surprisingly free of advances. (Its creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, would then create comedy shows like "Are They Serving You?" And "Hi-de-hi," which were notorious for their suggestive humor). However, the film retains much of the mix of soft wit, nostalgia and sharp characterization that made the television series so successful. 7/10
