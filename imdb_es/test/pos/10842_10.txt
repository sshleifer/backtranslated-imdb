This is one of the best lesbian movies I've seen! This series brought joy and sadness of true love. Being set in the 1800s was an amazing look at the lives and desires of lesbians. The cast went beyond expectations! Rachael Stirling is an amazing actress, I have never seen her other works, but her interpretation of Nan made me connect with her feeling of pain, pain and pain. The only thing that seems to me more important is to connect with the characters in everything I see. If anyone has doubts about watching this movie ... Think twice! This is a must-see series. Well done again to the BBC! We need more lesbian movies that portray real love and wounds, like this one. Living in Canada I imported this DVD and I am delighted to have bought it.
