It is difficult to imagine that "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch", directed by the legendary D.W. Griffith was created in 1914. It is a showcase of Griffith's emerging style. <br /> <br /> The story centers on a group of settlers called Cameron Brothers and their families, which includes a young waif (Mae Marsh) sent from the east to live with his uncles and a young wife (Lillian Gish ) who has just given birth. A group of Indians tries to capture the pets of the dogs and they are expelled by the men. During the confrontation, the son of the Indian chief (Henry B. Wathall) is killed. The Indian chief plans his revenge and launches an attack on the small community of Elderbush Gulch. <br /> <br /> It is this attack, which is quite brutal and graphic for this or any other moment, which forms the core of the image. The Indians kill the people of the cities, women and children alike, and expel them from the city to the Cameron farm. The newborn baby separates from its mother and all hell breaks loose. Someone goes for help and returns just in time with the ordeal. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman with a live scalp and there is also a sequence in which we see a horse knocked down. I have never seen an animal being killed so convincingly on the screen. Mr. Griffith was becoming a master at organizing large-scale battle scenes, a talent he would use extensively in his epic Civil War drama, "The Birth of a Nation," released the following year. <br /> <br /> Although it runs in just 29 minutes, "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch" is, however, a little exciting and historical movie making. See if you can see Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in small parts.
