"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying journey not only to the vast mind of a serial killer, but also to one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imagination. This is audacity in the work, separating thoughts to fall into formulas and clich√©s and creating something really magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date. <br /> <br /> I have read numerous complaints about this film, from any style and without substance to misunderstood characters and bad acting. Criticizing this movie is losing the point. This film can be a milestone, a tradition that we hope future films will follow. "The Cell" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So, can we slam the door on him and tell his director Tarsem Singh we do not want more? Personally, I would like more than to receive another Tarsem movie, and I would love to see someone try to challenge him. <br /> <br /> We've all heard of going to the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the "genre" is a little overloaded with work. The 90s were full of films that tried to represent what makes serial killers work; Some of them worked, but most failed. But "The Cell" does not open the same path, it gives us a new twist, we transport ourselves physically to the mind and present us with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject ever studied. <br /> <br /> I like how the movie does not get stuck with too much scientific jargon when trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez gets into another person's brain. Instead, he simply lays on a lab table and wraps himself with what appears to be really long Twizzlers and plunges into another entity. "The Cell" wants to let you "see" what it is and not "how" it is, and I guess that's what some people do not like. It's true, I like explanations with my films, but when a movie ventures into new territory, you must let it do what it wants and just assimilate it. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the film was very dark when it showed the reality, maybe to contrast the bright images when they are inside the brain of another. However, the design of the set was simply amazing. I would not be surprised if this movie took home some Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me, at least I would be nominated for best film. <br /> <br /> I've realized that I've been repeating myself. Not because there is nothing more to say, but because I can not stress how fantastic I thought "The Cell" was. If you enter the film with a very open mind and to take charge of wonders and a feast that will leave you breathless, then I assure you that you will have a good time. I guess this movie was too much for some people, calling it "weird" or "crazy". I am very interested in the psychology and in the imagination of the human mind, so it was right in my alley. When leaving the theater, I heard a member of the audience say: "Whoever made that movie probably did a lot of good drugs". If so, I want what I was smoking. <br /> <br /> **** (of 4)
