If you agree with the extravagant work of Italy's top horror director, capable of accepting his outrageous story lines and flamboyant style, then you should have a good time with Opera. If you do not do it, then you will not. <br /> <br /> Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a young and beautiful operatic substitute who is given an opportunity for fame (in an avant-garde production of Macbeth) when the star of the show is run over by a car. As any actor who has "stepped on the boards" will know, Macbeth is a production with a curse and Betty soon discovers that the show in which she is now the star is no exception: a murderer is systematically eliminating the theater staff and the poor Betty is forced to see her by the sadistic murderer (who puts needles under her eyes to keep her from closing them!). <br /> <br /> With the help of a girl who crawls through the air -Ducts, her director and her agent, and some ravens who have seen the killer's face (!!!), Betty discovers the identity of the murderer and the truth about his mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Opera is a crazy movie, with its absurd twists of plot, scenes of convoluted death and an end that begs the belief. And while director Dar√≠o Argento has never been one of them, so to speak, conventional story lines, this giallo in particular is so silly, and presents many of his signature touches with style (all maximized), which is almost as if, with each successive film, he sees what he can escape (sometimes he almost parodies his previous work). <br /> <br /> That's exactly why the movie is so funny !!! <br /> <The movements of Argento's camera are absolutely incredible: sliding, crawling and, in an incredible scene, even surrounding the opera house above the audience; the power of Verdi's music is perfectly combined with the majesty of Claudio Simonetti's score synthesizer, which provides an adequately grandiose accompaniment to sumptuous visuals; and several outstanding set-pieces (with the nauseating gore FX of Sergio Stivaletti) show that nobody makes death better than Argento (verify the impressive disappearance of a character, in which a bullet goes through a spy hole in a door in slow motion, and straight to your eyes!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
