Very nice from the 50's west. I have it in my collection and I recommend it to Western fans. <br /> <br /> For the most part, Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my opinion. <br /> <br /> He is a trapper who joins a border post as an explorer. Red Cloud caught three of them in their lands and took their possessions. They all joined as explorers after their loss. <br /> <br /> Victor has put his eyes on the Colonel's wife and lives life in the post regardless of the regulations. <br /> <br /> Action performed quite convincingly but there is no great depth or feeling for other characters. <br /> <br /> The westerns of the 50 are my favorites and this slips easily to satisfaction. A western of this type is in the pages of the past and may never be done much more. One to enjoy. He gave it a rating of 7. It's probably worth 6.8 but movies like these become more precious over time. <br /> <br /> For black movie fans ... "The Big Steal" "They Live By Night" "Side Street" are the most wonderful movies you can see enjoyed Bought and seen. Noir seems to resemble westerns in a way. Some a long time ago and never forever.
