I saw this 1918 film recently in our local Helsinkian film archive. It seems that the Danish Film Institute rebuilt it in 2006 to celebrate the centenary of the Nordisk film company, which was one of the largest in the world at the beginning of the 20th century. I think there are several copies with English translations circulating in Europe at this time. <br /> <br /> I found the movie fascinating and the trip to Mars well thought out. The line of the plot is certainly original, but I really do not want to reveal anything else at this time, since now there is the danger of spoiling things ;-). <br /> <br /> The film is also available on DVD, check the websites of the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) on dfi.dk with 'Himmelskibet' for more information.
