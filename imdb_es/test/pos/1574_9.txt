Until I did a web search on "What Alicia Found", I did not realize that the name of the movie is included in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The full title of the book is "Through the Looking Glass (and what Alice found there)". <br /> <br /> The Alice in the movie comes from a very different background to Lewis Carroll's Alice. His fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young girl in New Hampshire who steals money from her head of caresses and goes to Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She meets a middle-aged couple in a motor home (the retired husband of military service) who rescues her from a strange man at a stop on the road and from the breakdown of his car (perhaps caused by his mechanizations). <br /> <br /> As a result, the couple is very involved in prostitution at truck stops and sees young and sweet Alice as a promising recruit. The wife (played by Judith Ivey in a performance worthy of a grand prize) buys Alice's sexy clothes and shows her how to apply hot makeup. Initially, Alice passively accepts his attentions and, with the couple's instructions, makes several tricks. The encounter that is shown in more detail is quite different from the more cinematic sex, but may be typical of what happens most often in real life. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for "finishing" too quickly. <br /> <br /> The wonderful thing about Alice (and different from her Clarissa prototypes to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and affirms herself. This is how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither good nor bad. Alice leaves the motor home with her money well earned and a feeling of mutual respect.
