This is the thirteenth Falcon movie. Tom Conway has not lost any of his humor and style, and shows no signs of fatigue. The movie has a very satisfying story, with many false leads, suspects and ladies. Madge Meredith is the good girl in the story, she interprets it properly but in no way catches fire to the screen. Myrna Dell is a bad girl, and she has an excellent stone face, with agate eyes, and you're expecting her to kill as many people as possible to cheer you up. Edward Brophy has returned as Goldie's partner, but surprise surprise, his manic excess action has stopped, and is actually under control. This is a good tribute to the leadership skills of William A. Berke, who had done so many westerns that he probably was not prepared to take any nonsense from a Brooklyn doll. The result is that, for the first time, possibly in his career, Brophy was toned down enough to add something to a movie instead of testing the viewer's patience with the irritating behavior of a retarded but ungovernable six-year-old child. Everything is going very well, and it is very entertaining.
