A blaxploitation classic, this film was terribly influential in rap music for the "toasts" performed by Rudy Ray Moore. Toasts are long, rhyming stories that are fun and offer a point, and you can see how they will naturally evolve towards rap. For more information about the toasts, Rudy Ray Moore, and why this film is important, visit Dolemite.com. <br /> <br /> What leaves us alone to talk about the movie itself. This film contains a lot of "laughs of costumes, hairstyles and hairstyles", but almost all the shots have some kind of element or scandalous dialogue. It begins when Dolemite is released from prison to find out who framed him and bring him to justice. I did not know that prisons free people so they can prove their innocence, but that's me, I'm a neophyte at the prison scene. He is helped by Queen Bee, who is the main prostitute of Dolemite and who has been running his brothel while he is gone. She has also taken all of her prostitutes to karate school, so now he has an army of karate fighters. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in two parts, which is usually an error, but in this case it provided an interesting contrast. The first part I observed during my lunch break while I was exercising, and I was not enjoying it very much. I thought it was a particularly bad blaxploitation, with a ridiculous history, poor quality craftsmanship, well, I guess that sounds like it has SOME craftsmanship and tons of scandalous places, costumes and dialogues. But I was not enjoying that, in fact, it made me feel dirty. Let's face it, a white man who looks something like this to laugh at the outfits and the things the characters say is essentially enjoying something that is racist: what ridiculously does that black people wear, what nonsense they say. I really was not enjoying it, I was not laughing and I did not feel like seeing the rest. <br /> <br /> Later that night, when I was in a "much more relaxed state", I observed The Rest and they loved him legitimately. As Disco Godfather, who had seen a few days before, this has a warmth and a sweetness in its core that make it pleasant even when it is silly or violent. The character of Dolemite has an element of self-parody about him that makes everything fun, and the appearance of several actors who were also in Disco Godfather implies that we are observing the effort of the group of a group of friends who just want to do something fun together Even poor dubbing, karate fights and everything else makes it much more charming. <br /> <br /> What I find interesting about Dolemite films is that they have a moral ambiguity that I do not see in other Blaxploitation Movies, and certainly in very few conventional films. In this, there is an African-American woman who gives a speech about the Mayor (white) and says that "he has done more for the black community than anyone else". Later we discovered that the mayor is surprised, corrupt, but I like that the film presents this woman as essentially wrong and does not try to "redeem" her in any other way. There is also the figure of Hamburger Pimp, who presents himself as a useless drug addict, and no one makes an effort to find a redemptive angle, socially positive to what he is, it simply is. In Disco Godfather, the religious character played by Lady Reed is presented as crazy for wanting to pray for her son, desperately lost in the dust of the angel. I like that the films present critically critical portraits of people in their own community without covering them with sugar or trying to exchange them to make them more tasty. <br /> <br /> There are many valuable elements, like when Dolemite says "Move over and let me pass, or I'm going to get these Hush Puppies out of your muthatf ** to **". There is a queen bee who comes and answers the phone: "The total experience of Dolemite". And you can not miss (although you may want to cover your eyes) the extended nude scene of the REPULSIVE mayor. I am in favor of perverted and mustachioed older men, but I even have limits, and my limits are usually a few kilometers beyond most people, so be careful. The DVD I had is clearly edited, which is noted in some of the dialogue scenes, and in the end, when Dolemite's murder of a main character with his own hands obviously excludes the main event. <br /> <br /> If you get the DVD, however, be sure to watch the three trailers of the Dolemite movies, as they are a flash. I was not going to watch The Human Tornado, but after watching that trailer, it's better that you BELIEVE that I am. Also, there is a scene in the Dolemite trailer that I do not remember from the movie when Dolemite swings against a Mexican-looking bully, obviously gets lost, and the boy throws himself into a nearby car trunk. <br /> <br /> After seeing the first half, I was going to tell you to skip this and see Disco Godfather, since the film making and the storyline have improved slightly, but after really enjoying the second half , I would advise you to see this in Disco Godfather, since This is even more exuberant, funny, scandalous and of good character, and has those toasts that, even if one does not understand the roots and nuances of the form, they are still something to see . <br /> <br /> --- Check out other comments on my bad and cheesy movie website, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
