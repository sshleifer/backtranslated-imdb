A wonderful story that should be seen by all families. History, acting and production values ​​are all first class. I highly recommend "Checking Out!" <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderful as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die, so he can continue to know how things will end up and not be a "member of the audience." His three children rush to New York to confront him and try to change his mind. Of course, there are unresolved family problems that must be addressed, and the script and the actors handle them well and with great humor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a Jewish family, but it could easily be about any other family. Well, maybe it's not a WASP family. The brothers have problems with each other and also with their father. I loved writing and directing, as well as acting. In short, a humorous and moving film.
