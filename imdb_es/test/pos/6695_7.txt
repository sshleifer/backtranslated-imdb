I got this as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. I did not know anything about the history of the series. Season 1 of the series has the pilot episode as episode 1 and then 3 more episodes for a total of 4. Season 2 lists 5 episodes, the last being Beyond Good and Evil with an original issue date of 7 December 1998. The other 4 episodes in season 2 was broadcast from December 1997 to Febrausry 1998. So Beyond Good and Evil looks like season 3, episode 1, except there are no more episodes in season 3. Spoilers here. The two main characters of the first 8 episodes, Dr. Iain McCallum (John Hannah) and Dr. Angela Moloney (Zara Turner), are missing from this episode and were replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and the Dr. Charley Fielding (Eva Papa). I recognized Nathaniel Parker from the series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, which began in 2001. So they planned to have a season 3, but only one episode was aired. <br /> <br /> It seems strange to try to continue a series named after the main character, McCallum, when the main character has left the series. So they could have been planning a return of Dr. Iain McCallum, but when that failed, the series was canceled. I do not have inside information about this, but I see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker participated in other projects in 1999. Does anyone have any information about this?
