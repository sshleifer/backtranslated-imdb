I laughed for an hour. I had no idea who Dan Finneity was. Why have not I heard about Dan Finnerty before? He is hysterical and so are his backup singers. They do all these feminine songs that we would never want to hear a new experience. They blow these songs away. This was at Bravo last night. Why is this type of Dan not "ultra famous"? Great voice! Charisma to burn! I was impressed with this show! I just read on the Internet that once was a member of "Stomp", I guess there's nothing I can not do. I saw "Stomp" in a UCLA theater years ago and those guys were amazing. This show last night was done by Dreamworks! Does that mean that Spielberg did this? Why do not Dan Finnerty star in a movie? There was a standing ovation at the end of this program and each time the camera cut the audience, everyone was so interested, singing or dancing. The whole show had this incredible energy. My only complaint was that it was not longer, but looking back, when you see the energy that these guys put, I think it would be impossible for a human being to perform with such enthusiasm for more than an hour. Man I loved this show!
