To keep it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. That is well written, and has a fantastic cast. It is not loaded with blood and guts. And it focuses on a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now priest (George Dzunzda) and, finally, the person who gets into his hack that episode Are you likely to find something like this in your city? DO NOT. Is this still a good story? And it's good to see a man represented as a good father despite his flaws. Look at more than one (2-3) and you will see why many of us are hooked on this program. And thanks to David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!
