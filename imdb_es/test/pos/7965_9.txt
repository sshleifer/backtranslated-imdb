I felt very happy and at the same time very surprised by other positive comments written by non-Koreans below. This film is amazingly moving and shows a very "sad but warm" view of life that is typical of Koreans. I thought that other foreigners would not understand this delicate feeling and would underestimate this calm film for boring, but I was wrong. The attraction of this film can also be difficult to avoid for foreigners. (Even without subtitles ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some points that others have not been able to see. Of course, this movie shows the love between a man and a woman. However, the issue is much beyond that. Actually, it's about time, the value of memory and death. In this film, the focus is not on the "love story" between two people. As some pointed out, they do not kiss, they do not hug, even without holding hands. So love itself is not completed (either positively or negatively) in the film. Rather, what lurks Jungwon (a leading actor) is his imminent death. He is running out of time, he can not stand it, leaving some behind, including his father and, of course, Darim (a metermaida). So, the problem is how you can face death and leave something valuable in your short life, not how you can make love with Darim. <br /> <br /> This type of theme sounds very familiar to us. There are many movies about patients with non-curable diseases such as 'Love Story'. However, what makes this film stand out is the way Jungwon deals with his death. He is a loser, but he tried to give the best of himself while he is alive, IN A SILENT WAY. He does not tell anyone around him about his death. It hides something in your mind but without anger, hatred, revenge. He just tried to do the best while he was alive. This limited communication and obedience to destiny is the typical mentality of Koreans and the point that most Westerners do not understand or, at best, misunderstand. <br /> <br /> This theme is expressed very effectively by the director of this film (Surprisingly, his debut). Some say he is heavily influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro, who directed Tokyo Story. In fact, I remember that in a magazine I read that the director himself admitted that he was influenced by Ozu. I do not have as much knowledge to analyze his style compared to Ozu's, but they have some in common and others do not. Low angle and static camera, especially reminds us of Ozu's style. But, in terms of theme again, this Korean director seems to have a somewhat warmer and hopeful vision. <br /> <br /> It is expressed in a concise way with the last picture of Jungwon. Very well done and really heartbreaking scene, I think. Actually, the director had the first idea of ​​this film when he participated in the funeral of a very famous Korean folk singer who died young of mysterious suicide. They say he saw the photograph of the singer at the funeral and thought of a movie about death and remembrance. (And possibly the hope of the remains, I think ...) <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who has a great interest in the cinematographic art and Korean culture. This film, in my opinion, can be rivaled by other films like the history of Tokyo and a kind of American beauty. It's great if there is no language barrier. The DVD version will be released this February, so it could be of little help to foreigners with English subtitles.
