Okay, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right. Do not get me wrong, 'American Werewolf In London' is a top movie, but 'American Remake In Paris' is also a decent movie. <br /> <br /> First, the only similarities are the TITLE, 2 American BACKPACKERS, and WEREWOLVES. Apart from those 3 things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands out pretty well by itself with its special blend of humor, action / adventure and horror. Most people who say that this movie is better than the original are the young people of the current generation who think that any movie made before 1990 is a total shit. While we grew up in the 80s we can appreciate old movies and what they have added to today's horror movies. What many people do not realize is that without the old classic movies, including those of B & W, the horror would not be what it is today. Now I'm getting a bit out of the way ... <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a good attempt to recreate a classic, but it will never surpass the original, ever. That said, this is a very entertaining movie to watch and I recommend it. I give it a 7 out of 10. Maybe it's a little generous, but I've seen much worse attempts to try to recreate a classic.
