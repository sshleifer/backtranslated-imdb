Most Hollywood movies seem to follow one of the few pre-formulated and highly predictable plots. This movie does not do it and is a perfect example of what I see by IFC. <br /> <br /> There is a boy, Michael, and his girlfriend left him without saying a word. He wants to know what happened. Is she well? Can you say goodbye? Maybe I'll get some closure. He has not been able to get in touch with Grace and, in an effort to find her, he made a movie asking for her help. <br /> <br /> Michael thinks we might need a reason to help him, so he tells us his story by reliving his relationship with the help of a friend (Nadia) to play the role of Grace (the girlfriend who left ) <br /> <br /> The Hindu view is 20/20 and it is not different for Michael. By telling your story and receiving comments from your friends, you realize your mistakes and how much you value what you have lost. Unfortunately, this is a lesson that we all have had to learn (or we must learn) and it is easy to identify it. That's what makes you want to hear more of Michael's story and want to know if he finds Grace.
