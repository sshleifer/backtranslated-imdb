KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1979. This intense and moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life turns upside down when his eight-year-old wife leaves him, leaving him in charge of his son and building a relationship with him that he never had. The incisive script of Robert Benton presents us with defects, but real human beings with hearts, souls and brains. For example, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted that she is leaving him, she does not just run out the door ... she hands him the keys, her credit cards, the dry cleaning ticket, She tells him what bills have been paid, and informs her that she has withdrawn from her bank account the same amount of money she had when they got married, nothing more. This decision to leave was not a whim ... she thought and Joanna felt, with no other choice but to leave, if she was going to do it correctly ... and without a specific plan in mind, it did not seem right to take Billy . Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing bacon home, that he had no idea that his home life was falling apart. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna, the unhappy wife for whom we feel sympathy at the beginning of the film, but everything changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always start crying during the scene in which he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar nominee) why his mother left and does everything in a whisper on stage or when he meets Joanna on his return and hits his drink against a wall (a moment of Hoffman not included in the script that was not spoken to Streep to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry plays all the right notes like Billy, the confused child who does not know why his mother has left and does not know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also received a nod to the Oscar as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who changed allegiance to the conclusion of the film. This is an intense family drama, but there are also laughs here ... Billy and the chocolate chip ice cream ... Billy pouts because Ted is picking him up for a party ... Billy catches his dad's night (JoBeth Williams ) I walk to the bathroom completely naked, but it's the moments of human drama that you remember ... Ted running down Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly fell out of the jungle gym ... Ted he was fired just before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene, he tells the guy in a whisper ... "What a shame." And, of course, the ending where Joanna tells Ted she's not taking Billy, which I found a bit hard to swallow. Why would he take all the trouble to demand custody and then simply change his mind? But this is a small objection to a wonderful film, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and played to perfection by a first-rate cast. You must see it.
