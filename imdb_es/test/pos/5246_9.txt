The first leading role of John Wayne left me speechless. Mailbox style televised in AMC, I had to check and make sure I had the correct date. Indeed, this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm wide screen process. Apart from that, it presents some of the most gray and realistic images of the westward trek I've seen. Wagons, men and animals are really lowered by a cliff with a rope. The trees are cut by large men, and corpulent women, so the train can move another 10 feet. The Indians are not the polishers of the city of the "pretty boy" who portrayed them later; They are the real business. A river crossing in a torrential rain is so realistic, it has to be real (in fact, I understand that director Raoul Walsh almost lost the whole cast during this sequence). I could smell the wet canvas. Every day is an agony. The various subplots are forgettable, but the film as a whole is not. I can not think of another title that can beat The Big Trail by evoking a sense of living history on the road to Oregon. Bravo.
