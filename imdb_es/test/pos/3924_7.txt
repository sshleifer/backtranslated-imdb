Okay, maybe he does not deserve an Oscar. Or a gold balloon. Or any prize, for that matter. The acting is not outstanding, there's no reason to give credit to the direction, and it's really just another semi-bloody 21st century slasher movie that most people will consider just decent. Or maybe even terrible. But in my opinion, all this does not matter a bit. And that's because I had a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, the first 40 minutes are pretty slow, but as the movie progresses, something in it will like you, if you're like me, and anyone else should be watching this movie. And that is: looking for 2 hours of fun, violence without meaning. (And an incredible ending, which I will not ruin). Yes, there are many flaws in this movie, but do not let the list of actors on the cover fool you. Hilton offers a decent performance that nobody saw coming. Even his biggest enemies like me and my friends had to agree that he surprised us greatly with his barely credible acting skills and a striptease that was not as unpleasant as anything an online pop-up would promise, but not yet so unbearable in terms of overtaking or turning off the DVD. <br /> <br /> The violence in this surprised me; no one at school or on the terror board talked about it like "these new movies called 'Saw' and 'Hostel'", but I can safely say that "Wax" was more graphic than Saw, and some scenes from the death were actually quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I'm not surprised that House of Wax has not had a place in the Top 250 of IMDb, but it's definitely worth checking out.
