Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his feature films. And, I suppose most people have seen, at most, only some fragments of him from his days before the feature film, when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> If someone sees this movie, you have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's best shorts. because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and joined them with a little narration to make this feature film from 1959. This is great for several reasons. First, in Chaplin's first films of 1914-1915, his Little Tramp character is still in his early incarnations or absent altogether. Also, even when he is there, he was often petty and self-centered, something very strange to the Little Tramp we have come to love. Secondly, because the shorts that were chosen were in excellent condition, if you watch this movie you will not have to worry about seeing a film with scratches and with a terrible musical accompaniment that does not fit the action (a common problem). <Br /> <br /> So, to see Chaplin's shorts at their best, give this movie a shot. It is sure that it will provide you with some excellent laughs.
