It is quite surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, since Hollywood in general had its collective heads in the arena with respect to the black and white themes at that time. The film deserves great recognition for taking this position, for having an exceptional performance from its lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that does not insult the audience or take the easy way when it comes to white racism. Also, with the quite modest budget and the fast execution time of the movie, it does an incredible job! <br /> <br /> Juano Hern√°ndez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the time) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south. The crowd could really worry less about the details, they are just bent on hanging up. And, despite his commitment to the law, the city's only lawyer who has agreed to defend him also assumes that he is guilty and does not really want to know the truth; simply delay the execution until you can try to condemn it and then have a legal pendant! Fortunately, a young white man (Claude Jarmin) begins to wonder about Juano's innocence and begins to seek the truth. At this point, the best character in this wonderful drama is presented, played by Elizabeth Patterson (the old woman who later played Mrs. Trumbull in I LOVE LUCY). She only steals the show as the white person not only with conscience, but with the will and determination to defend the black man. In a wonderful moment of the film, a crowd is trying to push it to get to the prisoner and kill him, but she remains very firm and forces them to back off. There's a lot more to this story that's pretty complicated but intelligently written, but I'll let you see it for yourself. Look at it with your children if you have an opportunity: it will open an amazing dialogue about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, apparently, 1949 was a great year Hollywood finally addresses racial prejudice, since Twentieth-Century Fox also released "Pinky", an equally effective and strong film about racism, the interracial marriage and even rape! Watch both movies if you can.
