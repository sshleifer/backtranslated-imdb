I wonder if I could play an entire musical comedy from Russia, East Germany or other countries that for decades published almost always propaganda films, anti-fascist films, anti-war films (as this documentary points out) that only reflected the dark and exhausting times under Stalin and the life behind the iron curtain. It is fascinating to see the other side of the coin, the kind of clowns and rebels with music by their side to try to please the masses more often than not stuck in socialist life. A film actually seemed quite impressive, called Jolly Fellows by the pioneer of the very small group of musical filmmakers, Grigori Aleksandrov. From the clip (s) I saw of that movie, I would bet that it was one of the only jobs that really came out of itself and went into the wildest, manic way that makes you laugh. But as this film shows, if you were a filmmaker looking to entertain, it is better to have a 'message'. <br /> <br /> Through interviews, some occasional quasi-dramatizations (from the Russian / Germany movement class / image association etc) on the censorship table, and the clips, you get a complete picture of what which was, both behind the scenes and on the screen, to offer entertainment to the masses. Some of the films (well, most of them, since apparently only 14 were screened over 40 years in the mentioned countries) made a good part of the change, but for what really? One is also drawn to the culture of all this, how it differs greatly from the American way of "if it works, make it a fiery attitude". But at the same time, maybe out of this repression, some interesting, funny movies were made (from what I saw). They could have been quite typical of what was asked to be shown to the masses, under the loving but demanding terms of Stalin, like life with tractors. However, as they show us what it was like in the 60s, the latest wave of musical comedies, rock and roll and pop finally reach their peak. <br /> <br /> In summary, some good things ... but only if they are interested, really. They showed me the film in a class of documentary films, and half of the class fell asleep. Therefore, be careful, on the one hand, although if you are looking for it, you can make a truly rewarding trip to the history of European cinema.
