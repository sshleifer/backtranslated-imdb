When the Accepted trailer appeared for the first time, many people began to get excited to see it ... really excited. Who could blame them, it seemed fun. But that is exactly the thing. People came to Acepted in search of a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted is not the kind of film meant to be a good movie. It is meant to be a movie that pleases its audience without too much effort. That said, for those of you who were expecting a great movie, you should think about what could be done about a comedy like this. Think that, and you will really enjoy the movie (because you get rid of your idea that the movie will be fantastic). BOTTOM LINE: Watch the movie and have fun, but do not look for anything innovative.
