After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distressed woman's remote home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is not in sight. That's because someone murdered her and put her body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm breaks out, Kate tries to figure out where her sister may have gone and puts her own life in great danger ... the killer is still in place! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery offers a solid dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's teleplay is based on a story by McKnight Malmar. Malmar's story first appeared on television in 1962 as an episode of the anthology series THRILLER by Boris Karloff. THRILLER stayed very close to the story, which is a shame, as he could have used a little punch. Granted Malmar wrote a moderately spooky number, but Gerard (creator of the ONE STEP BEYOND program) adds several clever ingredients that increase tension and suspense.
