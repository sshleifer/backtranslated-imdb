I went to see this movie with my family that was expecting a perfectly conclusive story like "mr. & Mrs.iyer". They returned home completely disappointed. Therefore, this is a warning to all "lovers of conclusive stories". Stay away. 15 Park Avenue does not seek to answer questions or provide moral solutions on how to treat the mentally disabled. Instead, his intention is strong and clear. It questions the sense of reality of every human being, healthy or not. I even wake up doubts about my sense of sanity taken for granted. The security, the slavery, the satisfaction that I find in my present, is it really what I am or does it really create an illusion that all of us desperately and sometimes ignorantly? To cling only to the false consolation of the careless 'meethi' that exists in all of us in one way or another? So, why does Anjali so maniacally make it a point to show his mental strength when he is really distressed when he realizes that he is becoming a monster? Are not we all who think we are "normal", really monstrous? And helplessly vulnerable about it in the background? Is not it better to be happy, even in an insane way, than to create the impression of "normality" while suppressing one's fragility? meethi with courage, madness, sincerely do that. And society calls it "schizophrenic." The ending confused me at first, but then you realize that the courage and sincere belief of meethi took her to where she wanted to go. Did you find what you were searching for. I was looking, no matter what society had to comment on their search. and it is the apparently "real" people, anjali, the psychiatrist and jojo, who never get anywhere. My family thinks that I am also schizophrenic when trying to make sense of a film that is largely "crazy" for the rest of the world. world.one someone more willing to believe in my sense of reality ...........?
