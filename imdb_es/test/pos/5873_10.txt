The brilliance of this film does not lie in the process of creating films, which is a conventional story, but executed, that is intertwined with the lies of three soldiers after the Second World War, but in the fact that this story was told absolutely. Samuel Goldwyn deserves the credit for having the cheeky to promote a film that has as protagonists a disabled veterinarian with hand clamps, an alcoholic and a low performance.
