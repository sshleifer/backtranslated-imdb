Honestly, I do not know what words will allow me to use IMDB in this review. As a result, I find it difficult to describe these shorts. Let's say there is a good amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a good amount of masturbation and several artificial limbs. And I loved every minute of this. <br /> <br /> It's not that EVERYTHING is raw humor. It is not. They are far from the fart gags for the most part, with the exception of a sketch entitled "Pizza" in which they use one very well. "They" are 3/11 of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on MTV called The State, namely, David Wain, Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black. <br /> <br /> The trio follows adventures, usually playing themselves and encountering strange and unusual people, people who are often more normal than they are. The cast is fantastic too. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Rockwell make appearances in several sketches. They are also joined by other The State students such as Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. The musical selections are also very well placed. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed these sketches again and again, but they are not for everyone, as they are quite vulgar most of the time. If you like intelligent humor that is not afraid to push the limits of good taste, I recommend this. If you liked Wet Hot American Summer (Directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or The State, then you really should enjoy this. <br /> <br /> I think that currently it can only be ordered online. Take a look at their website and transmit a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first, and then find out how to buy the DVD.
