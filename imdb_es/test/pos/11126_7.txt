"Fama" is a very well done portrait of the students who live in the Superior School of Arts of the City of New York. The film focuses on a group of students who dream of succeeding while perfecting their craft in the now famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the highlighted students to mature on the screen, allowing him to feel a connection with each of them. The music here is contagious and fun. The dance is exciting and fresh. The film eventually became the basis of an Emmy-winning television series starring Debbie Allen and some of the other actors in the film. One of the most pleasant "dance" movies of the eighties. Oscars received for music. 8/10
