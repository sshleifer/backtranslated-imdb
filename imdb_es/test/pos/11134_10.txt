Bobbie Phillips, who in her own right has accumulated a large list of credits as a hard-working Hollywood actress, shines in this third installment of UPN and the Village Roadshow Chameleon series. In this installment, the sexual innuendo has been attenuated, with Kam showing a loving maternal side towards a recently orphan genius teenager. Bobbie offers this role to the audience with great style. The action and the acrobatics were the best in the series.
