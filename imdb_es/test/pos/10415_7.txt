This image is an interesting saga of the pioneer struggle led by Daniel Boone in the Cumberland Gap desert while being threatened by hostile Indians. A treacherous Frenchman is the cause of all the problems between the colonists and the red men, while Boone tries to convince the Indians that the pioneers only want to build houses and live in peace. The film has some appeal because it is not a polished production, but there are good scenes of action, although somewhat violent for its time. The cast is composed of B actors, but they're all good, especially Lon Chaney as the Indian boss. Bruce Bennett is fine as Boone, but he is too clean and soft to be credible as a frontier man. The dialogue is quite trite, but the scenario lends itself to the realism of Kentucky's forests.
