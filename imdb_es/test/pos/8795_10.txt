The only way to really understand and relate to the characters in this film is to experience the situations that you experience. For many people, this film is almost biographical, a kind of snapshot of a weekend in our lives. (I've done about 85 percent of the things in this movie and I've witnessed the other 15 percent, usually on the same weekend). For me and for others, I know it's good to have this movie to look back because, apart from some pictures Of the people we remember and the nights that are patches and blots, this movie is from our generations "Studio 54", a piece to add to our scrapbooks to look back and smile. Personally, I'm glad that those days have passed, but it's great to see this movie and say "I remember when ........." Justin thanks for making this simulated biography of a weekend in my life.
