This movie is wonderful! I can see it again and again. Robin Hood is perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. Personally, I think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While the space balls became boring and stupid after a while, it always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great movie, and it never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is perfectly simulated, it makes a lot of sense and can be seen again and again. You will love this movie if you only look at it, except if you hate comedy or do not think Robin Hood should be manipulated. But this old story gets boring, and this movie gives it a great new flavor!
