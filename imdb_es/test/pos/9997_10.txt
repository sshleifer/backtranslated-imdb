Wow, here's another great golf movie. Those are at least three in recent years that I've really enjoyed, that were well done, beautifully filmed and inspiring. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius" and "The Legend Of Bagger Vance". <br /> <br /> This is a truly lost story, if ever there was one. Making an amateur defeat all professionals and win the US Open Golf Tournament is an unprecedented feat. I think this is the only time in the 100 years that has been achieved. How much of this movie is decorated with fiction for a dramatic effect, I do not know. I know I plan to read the book, and I know that in real life, Francis Ouimet had a three-stroke advantage in the playoff with only two holes to go, unlike what we saw in the movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever. The victory of Francis Ouimet over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is a fact. It's an amazing story and the filmmakers did an excellent job presenting it here. It is not something just for golf fans; This is a funny film Kudso to the actor-turned-director Bill Paxton for an outstanding job. <br /> <br /> Yes, a lot of this is just golf, but there are subplots like Ouimet's relationship with his father and with a beautiful young woman who is obviously interested in it. It is also a moving story of someone who loves him. It gives an opportunity to a small child. The film also deals with the demons of Vardon to come from the wrong side of the tracks and try to do it in an elitist sport, which was at that time for both Europeans and Americans. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf is attractive Ouimet as Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who do not know, Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his time, perhaps even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is depicted as a warm and pleasant boy; a genuine human being The other major competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as a brutally nasty guy. <br /> <br /> The fourth main character in this golf story could be the coolest person in the movie: a fifth-grader who ends up being Ouimet's caddy at the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie. <br /> <br /> If all this, a playoff with the big loser against two powerful professionals and having reached the last hole, it was not true, one would think: "Oh, man, this is so bad. this?" That's what makes this real-life story fun to watch it finally captured in a movie. As with another 2005 sports film, "Cinderella Man," here is another excellent movie that was unjustly ignored when it came to prizes. I guess good movies do not win prizes ... only the hearts of their viewers.
