I saw Sleeper Cell with a little fear worrying if the terrorists would be glorified. This fascinating series not only handled the issue responsibly, but also created depth and substance for almost all the characters. Oded Fehr simply swallows the screen in every scene he's in, and although his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has a hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy stayed well, although in some scenes I wondered why he was not shot on the spot because of the frown on his face. <br /> <br /> The professionals of the series are the two protagonists, Fehr and Ealy, the well-written characters, all credible and tragic, and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story. Having been married to a Muslim, the environment created was quite realistic. The disadvantages, for me personally, were that the female T & A was an exaggeration, most seemed free, as well as some of the sex scenes. Despite that, it is a series of rough grip that will make you think. Someone gives Fehr more juicy roles like this and lets him run with it. He has an incredible presence on the screen and a strange kind of innate power that emanates from him.
