A bad-tempered police detective suspects that a French duke is the infamous thief ARSÃˆNE LUPINE. <br /> <br /> John and Lionel Barrymore joined for the first time in a movie in this intriguing crime drama. By the same and so different, they are the perfect counterpoint to each other. John plays his role with a gentle sophistication (when he is not disguised) and Lionel is earthy and common in his interpretation, and obviously everyone has fun trying to play the other. Helped by a generous script, the result is almost a draw, with the viewer the clear winner. <br /> <br /> Although dominated by the two male stars, Karen Morley is intriguing as the mysterious woman that John finds naked in her bed. Tully Marshall offers a colorful performance as a silly noble with much to lose before the criminal master. Henry Armetta and George Davis are very nice as two very inept security guards. John Miljan provides a solid presence in his small role as a police prefect. <br /> <br /> The film's experts will recognize an unaccredited Mischa Auer as a guide at the Louvre during the climactic scene about an attempted robbery of the Mona Lisa.
