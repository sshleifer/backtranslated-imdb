The creative team that brought us to the Police Squad, and the Naked Gun derived from him, said in an interview that their contact in the network told them that the program would be canceled, after the delivery of the first episode. Basically, the show never had a chance. Typical of Hollywood Apparently, the contact told the team that the problem with the program was that, for the program to be fun, the viewer really had to see it; most programs are presented on television with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while buying food or going to the bathroom, etc. <br /> <br /> The humor of the program is extremely dry (it does not use the hint of laughter), and the universe inhabited by the characters is one in which anything can happen, regardless of logic, provided it is totally awesome; So, for example, in one episode, a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street to get advice about heart surgery. <br /> <br /> Those familiar with the Naked Gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the movies. In the films, Nielsen developed a particular "take" approach, that is, the eyes opened to the unexpected. This does not happen in the show, where Nielsen's Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves, nothing is unexpected for him. Also, there are no romances in the program, and there are no MTV parodies. Finally, the show assumes certain risks that the movies avoid; In the first episode, Drebin, to "recreate the crime", has a squad of homicide detectives that shoot at each other from different angles: ballistics in the most difficult way. This is actually a bit of risky humor, since we must accept that it is perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime, for no other reason than experimentation. This kind of thing rarely happens in movies. <br /> <br /> Taken individually, each of the episodes is actually more fun than any of the Naked Gun movies, as they are more compact (more happens in less time). -frame), even more leisurely (there is no hurry for a line of blow as sometimes happens in movies). There are some inconsistencies that occur in movies (mainly "2" and "3") that never occur in the shortest time frame of the program. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema. And if you watch the TV show episode after episode in a single session, the quality of humor can wear down the tolerance. <br /> <br /> However, it would be useful to have a DVD of this, and watch an episode a day for a few weeks: if laughter has, as some say, medicinal value, seeing this show is good for your health .
