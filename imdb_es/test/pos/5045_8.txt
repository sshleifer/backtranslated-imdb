"Autumn Spring" talks about the misadventures of a 78-year-old Czech man (approx.) Walrus with a walrus face who confuses and confuses everyone who knows him with his naughty ways, while his wife meticulously plans his funeral. The central piece Hana (Brodsk√Ω) shows us how to make babies kiss you when you are 78 years old and how to make you sit in an elevator and to be thanked while mocking him day by day in this warm and bright look to the old age and the creative, fun, but socially unacceptable ways of a man to enjoy life while refusing to be relegated to the home of the elderly. "Autumn Spring" is a compliant and subtle comedy with messages for all ages that will have the greatest appeal among the most mature foreign moviegoers. (B +)
