Remove all parts of the movie that were "present" and stick to the flashbacks. Then you would have had a great story. The story of Faith and Wolf and their relationship was the best part. Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful. Brewster was heavy to sit through. Surprised to see Blythe Danner as mom. She was great. She also looks for Patrick Bergen as the father, always like him (Sleeping with the enemy). This is a very hippy movie type, except the world. I do not care much, but I recommend seeing him only for the performance of Diaz. She has an excellent range and should be used more. Eccleston is, as always, convincing. He is wonderful
