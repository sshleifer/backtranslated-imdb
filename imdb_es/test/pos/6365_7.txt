Many people do not think Dan Aykroyd is funny. This movie proves otherwise. Aykroyd is brilliant delivering his phrases in this comedy. The only major problem with this is that he wastes too much time near the end, jumping from one side to the other of Aykroyd's character and the doctor who is chasing him to prove it is a fraud. The doctor goes crazy like Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) in "What About Bob?". The scenes in which the doctor tries desperately to return to Los Angeles are silly, incredible and not very funny. Apart from this aspect, the movie really is fun, especially the first half.
