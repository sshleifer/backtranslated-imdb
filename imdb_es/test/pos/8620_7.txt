The accounts seem real with a human factor added to the mix. Much sadness. I'm glad it was not him ... another thing to add is that all the women in this program were not really beautiful stories of real women. But, I do not think it was about women, although it was because of JFK Jr.'s passion. What a pity. any loss of life is a real shame. <br /> <br /> It seemed like a good story of his life. I recommend it if you like biographies and melodrama!
