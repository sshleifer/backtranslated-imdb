For fans of Chris Farley, this is probably his best movie. David Spade plays the cynical and sarcastic yin perfect to the yang "Baby Huey" by Farley. Farley achieves hits of comic genius in his monologues, such as the bit "Let's say you're driving on the road with your family ...", the "Jo-Jo the Idiot Circus Boy with a fairly new pet, (its possible sale)" speech, or the sale of brake pads "Guarantee of smell of cola". The bad moments in the film contrast sharply with the scams of Farley and Spade. Even after many visits, it's still fun to see Farley pour everything he had on paper. "Richard, what's happening to me?"
