So far, Miguel Bardem's career has been one of the most frightening in recent Spanish cinema. He has not done anything but trash ... until now. "Incautos" has been a surprise: it is a serious film, with rhythm, with a great cast and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The art of stealing, that's what "Incautos" is about. A film very similar to the "House of the game" by David Mamet and things like that. Thousands of twists in the script and a story in which there is nothing that can seem. <br /> <br /> The weak points of Bardem's latest film may be the very American language, which makes some of the characters seem unnatural (especially Victoria Abril's, she is a great actress, but in " unsuspecting "looks a bit forced). Ernesto Alterio is not that bad, but he's not as good an actor as his father ... And what about Luppi? Well, he is the MAN. <br /> <br /> In summary: a good movie. The best that Miguel Bardem has done. I hope this is the beginning of a new stage in your career. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
