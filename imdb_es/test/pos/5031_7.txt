Although this film does not stand out especially among the multitude of films, it is still a very pleasant film to sit and look up with your feet up! Maybe the one or two strange errors that you catch, and the cinematography are a bit neglected, the movie itself is very nice and has a wonderful atmosphere. Music contributes a lot to the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is no less impressive (especially the dog hehe!) With John Travolta at the head of Michael, a lover of problems and fun. Other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the film. <br /> <br /> So after a long day of work, hit "Michael" at night with a little ice cream and enjoy a high quality movie in your own right :)
