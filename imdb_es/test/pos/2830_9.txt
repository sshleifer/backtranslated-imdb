I would suggest that Only the Valiant is one of the most original and intriguing films and, somehow, strange that Peck has ever done; daring, surprising and one of his few best westerns (no, no, of course, it's not really a western, but a military chronicle, which is sometimes better). It's a pretty low budget, but, oh, very original and striking. It's one of those goodies that sometimes gets a real fan; Movies that nobody has yet told you exist. You say "that sounds intriguing or interesting" and exceeds your expectations. <br /> <br /> In general, the script shows an unusual level of maturity for westerns and somehow reminded me, obliquely, of ULZANA; It is also direct, meaningless, suspense. <br /> <br /> Peck looked like a young and tough, somewhat somber and official stoic; and there are many unexpected touches, like the blond baby who kisses and flirts with the one she decided not to marry, maybe a feeling of it for justice and retribution. <br /> <br /> Even of gender, ONLY ?? it is much more than a military tale, it is also an action drama, a thriller, a command / action thriller, the strangest combo you can imagine; A group of soldiers on a special mission to counteract and stop a possible attack by natives? The crazy decision not to take all available troops to the place where those natives could be detained? -and this plot never takes a shit route? as most would and he did. The interest for human beings, for people and their reasons and actions never falters. <br /> <br /> A word about Peck himself; he acts with brio, and although I usually find that his famous films are quite insipid and boring, in those small outings I find all the glamor and even creepy of Peck intact. It was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I gladly recommend this extraordinary film.
