I had been interested in this movie for a long time, especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the DVD edition; however, I continued postponing their purchase due to the excessive price tag and the absolute lack of relevant supplements. When it sold out earlier this year, I finally gave in, but the entire order (which included a number of other highly desirable titles) was lost in transit. Fortunately, the DVD has been reissued at a bargain price, and I am very happy to have picked it up! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a strange movie, and a person who really sleeps: initially confused but surprising hidden history that manages to hit the bullseye with respect to its small-town atmosphere that forbids it and the inherent restlessness of sinister events. -in. A small cast perfectly responds to a smooth, absorbing and intelligent script: the leader Strother Martin, in particular, makes the dialogue sound better than it really is with his nuanced interpretation as the city doctor / witch coven boss ; L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (who also produced the movie!) Offer strong support as the sheriff's curator and his amateur comic strip assistant. <br /> <br /> The plot combines elements from several previous films that deal with witchcraft. and the supernatural titles, and not only the obvious ones: the fact that the city remains under a spell that can not be identified at the beginning, for example, immediately reminds us of the similar affliction of a specific bourgeois family in the sublimely surreal by Luis Bunuel. EL ANGEL EXTERMINADOR (1962)! the angle of the "possessed children" was taken, perhaps, from VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960); There have been many films, especially from a recent crop, where the satanic rites of a witches' coven are shown: from THE CITY OF LOS MUERTOS (1960) to LOS DEVIL RIDES OUT (1968) but, since the procedures take place in the modernity Today (although in remote environments) and revolve around the older witches (who seek a "rebirth"), the film they remember most is BABY OF ROSEMARY (1968). <br /> <br /> The hidden scenes (accented as both in hazy exteriors and in the gloomy lighting of the ruined house where devilish events take place) are presented in a completely practical way to make them disturbing and extremely effective , in particular the opening sequence that involves an army tank crushing a car (!), the rampage of a demon doll (a concept that has been killed over the years but, in this case, raises an undeniable frisson) , a sequence of surreal dreams (placed inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept, since they can not be buried!), a sequence where the witches attack a dubious member of the coven, a beheading committed by a medieval knight riding a horse (!) and the long end of the "black mass" (with the witches, accompanied by the respective child, will "seize", all dressed in red (except by a Martin dressed in black who presides over the ceremony) that culminates in a mass ritual suicide! <br /> <br /> The movie also has the guts to deliver a 'curtain' downbeat; it's so refreshing to find a title (albeit a low-budget production) of an important Hollywood studio, Columbia, that manages to go so completely against the grain (as, I said, the movie is quite rare, which also extends to editing and scoring)! It is also strange that such an elegant and cinematic offer of terror comes from a television director most often associated with westerns and other family meals! By the way, the same subject was discussed almost at the same time in the collaboration of Christopher Lee / Peter Cushing NOTHING, BUT THE NIGHT (1972, which he produced himself!) - a film that I stupidly missed some 20 years ago when it was shown on local television, and that has been MIA since then !! <br /> <br /> P.S. This review of THE BROTHERHOOD OF Satan will certainly contain spoilers, but, anyway, the synopsis and the illustrations that appear on the cover of the DVD manage to reveal everything anyway!
