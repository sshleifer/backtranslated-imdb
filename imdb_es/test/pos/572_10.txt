You know, before watching this movie, I felt little sympathy for those who were involved in criminal cases. I mean, if they were arrested and charged, "they must have been guilty," I reasoned? <br /> <br /> I formed this opinion for a few years. You see a good friend of mine who once worked as a detective in some of the most sordid areas of Sydney. He often complained that his police efforts were wasted due to "bleeding heart" lawyers and magistrates. He would "hit the thieves in the morning and they would be" back on the street at noon. "It had its effect ... it was worn out, he resigned. <br /> <br /> He has argued since, not without reason, I thought , that the collection of creative evidence, to keep the bad guys "where they belong", was ... well ... "acceptable". <br /> <br /> My arguments about the rights of innocent people were not It is valid, he said. "What are the chances that he will ever be arrested and accused of a serious crime?", he argued, and, as a law-abiding citizen, the weight of his argument convinced me that he was right. from me, or from any of my family or friends, the fact that I was charged with murder or a serious offense was zero to none, I thought. <br /> <br /> Hmmmmm Well, as mentioned above, see this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that. <br /> <br /> I am sending you a copy.
