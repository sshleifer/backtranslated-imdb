This movie was announced as a comedy, but it was much more serious than the trailers did. Do not get me wrong, I liked the movie, but I expected more laughter. Great performances by Robin Williams and Laura Linney. It's worth seeing, but do not expect to be rolling on the ground. The movie left me wondering what it would be like if the Robin Williams character were a real person running for president. Would we choose a comedian? I doubt it, unfortunately. That kind of honest honesty is something that is missing a lot today. This is a movie that I will add to my DVD library as soon as it appears on DVD. The movie has a heart
