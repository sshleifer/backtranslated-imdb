It's been years since I had the privilege of watching this movie on television. I would only like to be able to contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome. I did not realize this but watching this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My stepson is now 35 years old and, thanks to the Lord, he has blossomed beautifully but still has many side effects from being born to an alcoholic mother. We talk every month with rehabilitation patients with addictions to alcohol and drugs, and this exchange has really made monumental changes in their behaviors and efforts to start a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol. Please let me know how I can get a VHS or DVD copy of this movie or when it will be shown on TV again. If you have not been in these shoes, you probably could never understand their value. Thank you.
