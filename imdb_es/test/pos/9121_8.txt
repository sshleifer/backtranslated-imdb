I love a movie that mixes suspense on the edge of the seat, laughter, style, good acting and a bit of self parody. Hitchcock took this consistently, and in "Le Cercle rouge" Jean-Pierre Melville does the same. I was sorry when this long movie ended. <br /> <br /> I agree with the English commentator who found comments from one of my chauvinist compatriots. I love French films, Italian films, English films, Indian films, and increasingly rare American films. I also feel that the writer who criticized the film for not being even a good copy of a US gangster movie lost the point entirely. But I think it's like jazz: you understand it or not, so why waste time trying to explain it? <br /> <br /> Just go "Le Cercle noir" and get ready to entertain yourself deliciously.
