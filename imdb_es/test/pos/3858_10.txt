The Aristorcats is a hilarious movie that not many people have seen. Clearly not so many because he only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with that at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which already have lots of fantastic movies. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the movie is. I hate to say this, but I do not blame Edgar for what he does. Probably would have taken care of them too. I will be devastated by an old bag that I had been working with for so many years, only that I decided to give their will to the cats. I killed them too. I do not even like cats, so I would not mind. I think The Aristorcats is so funny and cute. There are many characters that are hilarious, like Edgar. The Aristoloats are my favorite of the Disney classics, and that is definitive. The cat is out of the bag. <br /> <br /> The Aristorcats: **** / ****
