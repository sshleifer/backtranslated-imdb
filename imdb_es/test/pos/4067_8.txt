Contains Spoiler The movie is a good action comedy, but I do not know if the director cut too many parts, but it seems that the bad guy dies too fast. The end of the movie came, the bad boy dies and that's it. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good and I do not regret having seen them at the cinema.
