This has to be one of the most powerful message-sending movies I've seen lately, it was absolutely perfect at all times, incredibly original and thought-provoking. The story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very powerful. It's about a guy who kills his ex-girlfriend's held brother, and when they send him to juvenile prison, through many memory flashbacks, you understand a story and do not let it pass until the end. The murder he commits changes the life course of each member of his family and the family of the deceased, and as he watches and realizes that each has his own story and his own dark side, he simply appreciates this movie even more. It is a total journey. strength, because those actions can not be described with simple words. His motive for committing a murder is incompletely explained, and makes viewers think. The performance was quite impeccable, and the cast was very good, it contains many familiar faces. If you like movies that make you think and that make you think during them (for example, 'Donnie Darko', 'Mulholland Dr.'), then 'The United States of Leland' is an excellent choice for you, otherwise You should pass this movie and watch it when you're in the mood for a serious movie that provokes thoughts. <br /> <br /> 10/10
