It was incredible. As a librarian and assistant at the Vitality Fund Event of the Library Association of New York, on Thursday night, I had the privilege of seeing a preview before the release of the new film, The Kite Runner. The release of the film was delayed due to concerns about the well-being of the children involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event has been allowed to continue as planned. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, I think it was done with mastery. I think it had as much impact on me as Stanley Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange, although it's much less graphic, much less. There is no comparison between the horrific, shocking violence and the rape that is shown in The Mechanical Orange and the little violence that is actually shown in Kite Runner; Only the subject and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. (I have written more details about violence and child rape and how it was handled in my MySpace blog). My overall impression was that this movie was fantastic; One of the best movies I have seen. The depiction of Afghan children flying their kites captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject is very serious, and the film takes the emotions of the audience to that subject without many discordant "Hollywood touches" that have ruined other films. Although the overturned cart of grenades was a bit obvious of symbolism (to me). <br /> <br /> Finally, I must mention the excellence of the soundtrack. The recitation of Rumi's poetry boy as two main characters are fleeing the country during the Russian invasion, in terrifying circumstances, showed the power of those poems. I urge all those who look to ignore the subtitles of that scene as much as possible, and only listen to the beauty of language. I do not even know what language Amir is quoting, if his normal Dari Persian dialect is the same as Rumi's original Persian dialect. Also, keep in mind the sound that is heard each time a kite line is cut. It seemed like a deep and distinctive sound, although the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. I can not help but wonder if the kites really make a sound like that when they are "cut", or if it gives you an idea of ​​the vibration / sound that the kite flyer experiences during the competition.
