As in Rififi, the most convincing scene in the movie is the perfect silence of the jewelry heist. The scene is masterful in its execution, each of the thieves has their own specialized work to perform, each one successfully combines their unique talent towards the goal, and each one, up to a month before, complete strangers. <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes unfold very slowly. In fact, the opening scene is a long introduction of the character to both Corey and Vogel, as we see Corey released from prison and Vogel escaping capture on his way to prison. The two characters then met methodically through fate in a roadside restaurant while Vogel hides inside the trunk of Corey's car. From this unlikely break, the two strangers agree to become partners to perform a perfect and accurate jewelry heist. <br /> <br /> However, to obtain this theft they must include the help of a third man named Jansen. Jansen is hired as the safe shooter. Its inclusion in the mix was an interesting and desperate option. At the time of his hiring, Jansen is in a complete battle with DT's and spent most of his day in his crib hallucinating about lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the disheveled and amazing world of a dream of William S. Burroughs to a strong and sober shooter is very fast and perhaps the only fake moment of the film, but that is me very demanding. <Br /> <br /> Another slightly fake note was that of Police Inspector Mattei. At times, he seemed to be brilliant about the ways to arm the right people or gather information and wait for his fugitive prisoner to make his move. Other times it looked like he was 10 years old, especially at the beginning during Vogel's flight through the forest. <br /> <br /> I wonder if I got a meaning too hidden from the beginning of the movie. At the beginning of the film, when the police car moves at great speed through the city, the first image we see is that of a red light. My first thought was that this could be the "red circle" and that if I have to find a deeper meaning in the movie, maybe it's that this car, or rather the people who are inside it going through the red light, They will be the ones that will 'stop' the theft of jewelry. Hmmmm <br /> <br /> Perhaps the red circle refers to the ring of triumvirate thieves? Maybe it was the burning sleigh? No matter. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it does not feel that way. The end is a bit disappointing. He seemed too hurried for a movie that felt like a delicious slow burn. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
