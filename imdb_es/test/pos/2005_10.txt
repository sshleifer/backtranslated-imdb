Eve is revealing, due to the great scenarios and technology, there is no music in the backgrounds, we listen. This film shows a good aspect of the human body: the creation of God and, to consider it, viewers can gain more respect in the legendary story of Adam and Eve (whether it is true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we created) of watching this movie The personification of Eva of the actress / model Inger Ebeltoft is so good that there is not a good word to describe her performance, and I can not imagine that another actress is Eva. This movie for me, is really useful for the type of therapy to relieve stress. We would never have fallen so relaxed before watching this movie. This movie is a masterpiece, God supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first place! <br /> <br /> Mr. Razbin!
