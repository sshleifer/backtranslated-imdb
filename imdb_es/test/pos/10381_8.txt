They are just stories, some that we wish would happen to us, others that we wish would never happen to us, all about an unfulfilled wish. The nude locations and bodies are beautiful, but after the second story, all I could think about was "it takes more than beauty to create a real movie." Then, of course, the movie unfolds. Stories are moving, except that Sophie Marceau fails to communicate her story in this film. Malkovich interprets the story for both however. The voice-over does not manage to link the stories, but it helps Malkovich to provoke some reflection. <br /> <br /> I would say it's worth seeing and the best of Antonioni I've seen. Considering your age - remarkable!
