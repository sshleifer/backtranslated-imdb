Now, dear children, I LOVED THIS MOVIE, although not as much as FAREWELL OF THE KING, another of the most beloved moments of John Milius. It was fun, much more than if it was based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It is a great thread, with a bit of political correctness. I love this movie because of its beautiful photography, its humor and its attenuated criticism of the Bad Guys (Berbers) and the REAL Bad Guys, the spearmen of the 'civilized' world, with their repeated rifles, artillery and great gunboats. there in the harbor <br /> <br /> The most prominent scene is the Berber camp with gray-blue smoke from the fires that rise in the cold desert air. It is visually eloquent, highly evocative. <br /> <br /> Established in 1904 in Morocco, WIND presents a defenseless American woman (Candace Bergen) who is kidnapped by a Berber bandit, albeit immodest, and very immodest (Sean Connery, the very model of a Muslim nomad Scottish). The exciting story is based on some historical facts. The picture is beautiful Milius, marked by the outstanding score of Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Pedicaris and Raisuli lead the long preliminary games and bounce in the desert between the oases. Although Raisuli prides himself on tracking down his lineage to the apes, he is a perfect gentleman, even allowing him to keep his head after she hits him in chess! A marine detachment assaults the palace of Bashaw, extinguishing the fires of the hegemonies that compete with gasoline. Do not mess with the Body, Abdul. <br /> <br /> There are many entertaining stereotypes: <br /> <br /> Despicable Sultan - looks like a dissipated ferret. Definitely not a liberal. <br /> <br /> Cruel German Official: a big and bellicose Dachshund who has a monocle. He gallantly chooses to fight the Raisuli with swords instead of shooting him in the manner of Indiana Jones. Obligatory nobility, through Von Clausewitz? <br /> <br /> Navy officer who crashes - kicks the shit out of Bashaw's army from Tangier and assaults his palace while chewing tobacco. His speech is mildly aphasic. Bashaw begged him not to breathe. <br /> <br /> The Berbers, a horde of sycophants who crawl under the guidance of a charming megalomaniac. None of them bathes, except perhaps with camel urine. <br /> <br /> President Teddy Roosevelt is immensely portrayed as empty and concerned about guns, toys and grizzly stuffed bears. <br /> <br /> Beautiful American widow - gives men a lesson in courage, as do their two children. Obviously, she has a lot of clean and starched clothes and rarely has a hair out of place. <br /> <br /> The Raisuli sends Teddy Roosevelt a message, thanking him for the gift of a Remington replay rifle, declaring, <br /> <br /> "MEESTER ROOSEVELT, YOU ARE THE LION AND I AM SOY THE WIND ROTATION. "<br /> <br /> What a truth. <br /> <br /> Please, do not take my scathing comments to say that I did not like the movie. I had so much fun writing this as watching Da Pitcher.
