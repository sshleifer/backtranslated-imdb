This is one of nine shorts on the anime disc, "The Animatrix." It is my favorite. The work of art is incredible. The texture in black and white, something grainy, perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to represent. The story is tense, and the ending is true for the film noir. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave The Animatrix a "7", but this particular segment deserves a "10".
