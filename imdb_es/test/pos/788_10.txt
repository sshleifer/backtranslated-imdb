This is a wonderful short comedy, one of Keaton's best. Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. And, as a result, most of the film consists of him fleeing the police and a particular detective. Although in general I am NOT a fan of movies with many chase scenes, this is the best in terms of athletic ability and acrobatic. I have seen some who have had wilder acrobatics, but none where the star was so flexible and able to move with amazing grace. In particular, there is a scene in which he runs across a table, jumps on the shoulders of a man and plunges through the crossbar as faithfully as possible. In addition, many of the gags are fun and perfectly synchronized, like the way he really thinks he has killed someone. By the way, this movie is VERY similar to COPS, also from Keaton, but original enough and with enough energy to make it worth watching. <br /> <br /> This movie is brilliant and Keaton's only short film that I can think of that I probably liked the most was THE PLAYHOUSE, where Buster plays all the roles in the theater.
