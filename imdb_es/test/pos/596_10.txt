I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame Street muppets and later I realized how much effort and time he dedicated to bring these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I saw this movie the other day, I delayed in time when I was younger and things seemed much simpler. For this little time travel, I rate this movie with a 10. <br /> <br /> The plot explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughter and the gags are classic muppetismo. I'm glad that these movies are still available for the next generation. I hope I never let the magic of the muppets grow.
