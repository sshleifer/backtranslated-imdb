I saw this movie when it was aired on Lifetime in 2004. I've never seen it since then, but I've thought about it often. It left me with such an impression that I've been looking for it lately. I finally found it and realized it was made just for television. The movie is fabulous, full of great writing and acting. William Petersen is perfect, as always. This movie left me speechless and in tears. It is a wonderful story of faith, love and compassion. Does anyone know how I can get a copy of this movie for my home? Is that possible with television movies? I would really love to see him again. This is a must-have among my collection !!
