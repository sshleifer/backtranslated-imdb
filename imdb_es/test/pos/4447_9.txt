What a surprise this movie was. I've seen some of Fulci's horror and zombie movies and I was surprised that it was the same director. He also wrote the screen game that shows that the chapter was quite capable of elaborating a complex and detailed plot. The dubbing of this is not good, but it is far from the dreadful inclination that only makes the later howlers even more difficult like 'Manhattan Baby'. <br /> <br /> The photography in this movie is fantastic. A strange road, almost futuristic, appears throughout the film that focuses on a small city where young people are murdered. A scene that involves the mistreatment of a woman is uncomfortable to watch, but refreshing in comparison with the usual violence in the movies. <br /> <br /> What went wrong Lucio? Perhaps there is a solid case to suggest that it had peaked with this movie, and then it went downhill slowly.
