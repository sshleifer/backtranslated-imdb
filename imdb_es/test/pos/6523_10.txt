"Island of coconut fruit salad Fred"! It is a hilarious show that takes place on Saturday mornings at WB. It stars Coconut Fred and all his friends on the island, and each episode is a very funny disgrace to them. Most of the time, it's because of Coconut Fred's problems to make mischief, what makes it fun, and other things that happen on the island at the same time. The humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright, which adds that it is as much fun as it is. I do not think this can be more fun. The voices of the characters are magnificently superior and exaggerated, which adds to the hilarity of the show. If this is ever on DVD, I am getting A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to laugh.
