This movie is a warning for all people who sit down to surf the Internet on a typical day at the office. My warning is: Do not reveal too much about yourself, 2 Be careful who you cross! , there are spies in this internet thing. I thought it was so scary what that combination of man and woman did to poor Angela Bennett, I did not realize that someone could take her life with a single click of this mouse. Angela I thought he did an excellent job of outwitting Jack Delvin and that horrible one. girl, my question is, why does that computer make that noise when it works? Like a click sound, mine does not do this or this one. This movie also tells you that there is fraud on this internet. Why could not Angela do the virus destruction program in a CyberCafe? I also thought that, like all computers, the transfer speed to the disk was slow, as shown correctly in this movie, when you save the program on your floppy disk, the bar moved slowly. I also really liked Angela's house at the beginning of the movie. Why did not anyone believe Angela?
