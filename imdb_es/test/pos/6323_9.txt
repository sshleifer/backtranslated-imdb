'Sleight of Hand' is my favorite Rockford Files episode of the entire series. This episode shows a side of Jim Rockford that is generally ignored. In fact, Jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to his little daughter. The woman is recently divorced and she and Jim have recently returned from a weekend getaway with the young man. Through a strange turn of events, the woman is discovered missing after they return home. <br /> <br /> Rockford's story to his father, Rocky, of the events that led to the woman's disappearance recalls Mike's Mickey Spillane series of hammers from a previous era. After meditating and reflecting, and with the encouragement of Rocky, Jim finds himself on the track that dismisses him from investigating the disappearance with his usual firmness. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Jim's girlfriend, Karen, unwittingly witnessed some mafia activity while staying at the Buena Vista Inn. The crime bosses responded by killing Karen and substituting another woman in Jim's car. The imposter, apparently asleep in the back seat, made her leave immediately after arriving at the house. After a couple of covert assassinations, Jim proceeds to his solution on suspicion that the LAPD even when warrants are issued for his arrest. <br /> <br /> This episode causes a more emotional reaction than all the other episodes of Rockford Files. set. James Garner as Jim Rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment and, nevertheless, retains the presence of mind to pursue the case. This is personal for Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not hired to do a job but is trying to recover his lost love to save his life. Unfortunately, this is not possible, but Jim struggles to clear up his feelings, but clearly he will not overcome his pain. <br /> <br /> Despite the appeal of the main story, many key questions are: Raised but never answered in this episode. (1) What will become of the young daughter of Jim's girlfriend? (2) What did Karen really see in the hotel that caused the mafia to kill her? (3) How could Jim drive for hours with an impostor in his backseat without realizing this? (4) The daughter stated that "mom did not come back with us". So, why did not the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent during the hours of car travel? Despite these ambiguities, "Sleight of Hand" is the episode of Rockford Files that comes closest to being a jumper of tears.The suspense is convincing and the story is narrated in a sensitive and vulnerable style that makes us feel the pain of Rockford.
