Others have insisted here on the age of James Stewart when he played in Lindburg (he was 47 years old and Linburg was twenty-five years old). But Stewart does not seem to be his age and the film, for him it was a dream come true. As a real pilot and retired general of the Air Reserve at the end of his life, Stewart had the feeling of character and understanding of his passion, which other actors could not contribute to the role. Added to the cast was co-star Murray Hamilton, who would also be featured in "The Story of the FBI with Stewart" and other actors from well-known characters such as Richard Deacon, from the latest "Dick Van Dike Show" and Robert Cornthwaite from "The Thing from Another World ", the 1951 science fiction classic. <br /> <br /> Billy Wilder captures the flavor of the Lindburg Autobiography and the narration of what would become an important event in the history of aviation. History and The movies are a testimony of the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream.One box office failure at the time of its release, has become one of the great classics of American cinema and another in a long line of outstanding performances by an actor that has been called America's Everyman.No student in the history of cinema should miss the opportunity to see this.There have been more than 500,000 movies since the ini of the movies, and this is among the 500 best.
