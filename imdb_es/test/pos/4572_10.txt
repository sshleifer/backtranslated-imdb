I've seen this movie since I was a child, and being from New York and remembering how people lived, it brought back many good memories. This film is not just about wanting the end of a fairy tale, but about understanding the difficulties of becoming a better person, and the provider that Claudine tried to be. It was the social welfare system that puts women in a binding situation. It was the injustice of a system that invaded and demanded that a family stay afloat. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and it was well deserved. If you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful moments of union, enjoy Claudine. Your objective as a spectator is to keep an open mind and understand the general frustration.
