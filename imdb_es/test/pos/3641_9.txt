If you're looking for a fake Hollywood action movie, this will not be one for you. If the Truth is what you are looking for, rent or buy this. From a true story, the film tries to capture the heart of what was happening in South Africa (and in many other places). <br /> <br /> For historical knowledge, this is compared to stories like "The Pianist," "Schindler's List" or "Nuremberg." Millions of people today have no idea what apartheid is or that it exists. This movie can help them learn, and can even help them dig deeper.
