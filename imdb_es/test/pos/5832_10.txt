Oz, was the first original television program that HBO put on its channel (in the form of 1 hour) and to this day it is still the best ... The story is simple ... Oz is a surreal look at the life of the maximum security prisoners in Oswald, focused mainly on "Em City". Now there are many things to complement this program from the editorial (which in my opinion was the best on television when this program was broadcast), the address (first class), the performance (the best of the best) and the characters .. This The show simply took off my socks ... This show was a critically acclaimed gem until The Sopranos bowed, after critics salivated that epic tale of trust and family as they noted this fascinating drama. Oz for me is a better show than the Sopranos in general, and it is a pity that I have never won any great Emmy ... = / <br /> <br /> congratulations to all who participated in this magnificent show. ..
