The Hookers was for me a great story of everyday people, like someone you may have known. Trying to do it, my big opportunity is just around the corner. Then the little temptations of life crawl, the spoiler stumbled again. How much can your love take and give to the man who really is not so bad, after all, only human. I liked it, it was also an extra paid in the movie. I played the drums on the bar shots, with the band, I made several shots, my green 66 'corvette was on the party shots of the motel. Wonderful cast and crew, people of the first order, movie of the earth. I had lunch with James Coburn, on Mother's Day, what a wonderful man, as I have known him for years, I will never forget him. My father spent the day with Slim Pickens, and they exchanged stories of horses, Slim was also very sensible, he loves those guys, we really miss them. Real people making movies about real people, Thanks Levy, Gardner and Laven.
