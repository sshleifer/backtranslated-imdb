There are few movies that have the huge amount of ninja action non-stop like Ninja III: domination. This is a story of love, redemption and revenge; however, it is mainly a story about the murder and murder of people for no reason. If you've been looking for a movie in which a ninja goes crazy and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he is a ninja and he can do it, this is the movie for you. I can not think of any movie with which to compare this, because no movie is so amazing. Wait, oh, have you ever seen the thing with two heads? There is a part in that where the owner is on a motorcycle and about a million policemen are chasing him, but they keep crashing and what is not, BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT FIND THE THING WITH TWO HEADS !!! Well, that's how Ninja III is. I recommend this movie, especially if you like the following things: Ninjas, swords, Lucinda Dickie of Breakin 'and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, videogames on how to be a doorman in a bar, ambiguous and undeveloped love stories or "good" ninjas "
