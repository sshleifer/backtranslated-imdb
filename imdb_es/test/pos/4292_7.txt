An old man is driving his bicycle down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, hits him and drives on. The rest of the film is dedicated to discovering who hit him, why he was beaten and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie by the way. I am not saying that hit and run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way in which everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hardworking and respectable citizen with a "rigid" attitude towards the tragedy. His wife Anne (Emily Watson), who is twenty years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive and more prone to drama. <br /> <br /> The man who really spices life in this quiet town is William Bule, the millionaire of the playboys, played by Rupert Everett, deliciously diabolical (most American audiences will remember him forever as the gay friend Julia Roberts who stole all the scenes of the wedding of My best friend). In Separate Lies, Everett is cruel, cold and selfish, but it is a real wonder on the screen. No, it's not such an exciting movie title (Separate lies, how did they end up with that boring and forgettable title, they just did not have a marketing team, did they care now if people watched this movie?), But more beyond the title there is a heart-rending drama about the power of forgiveness.
