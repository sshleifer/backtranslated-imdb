I personally did not know Karen Carpenter, or Richard, really, so I must explain how the film portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about its accuracy would be his brother Richard. However, from what I saw and learned from Karen, I felt her pain, I shared her sadness and she was a very special person to me as I grew up. I know I was not born until 1965, so I did not know her as much as some of your older fans, but I definitely grew up listening to her music and have good memories of her music. I remember the song about "Radio" (all the sha la la whoa ... very well,), etc., and I remember "We just started! In fact, I memorized many, many of their songs, and some people ( quite a lot) tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to it (I'm not kidding about this.) I also used to be anorexic during high school and part of the university (1978-1987) to be Exactly, I weighed between 82 and 120 pounds in 1987 I developed some pretty serious health problems that helped me identify with the actress who plays Karen in the movie.The mother (Agnes) was very similar to my mother in many ways.

To portray the whole life of a person in 2 or 3 hours and relate each detail perfectly, I must say that there probably is not a biography that is so precise. Although I will give an 8 to this story! I wish I knew Karen personally! I would have died to meet her! I would have loved to shake her hand, give her a hug or talk to her. I feel her warmth and love every time I hear one of her songs and we miss her a lot.
