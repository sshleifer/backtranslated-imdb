For Greta Garbo's first film, MGM wisely chose the work of ANNA Christie, winner of the Pultizer Award by Eugene O'Neill. <br /> <br /> Also wisely, the producers backed Garbo with not one, but two members of the Original Broadway Cast (George Marion as Anna's father, Chris, and James T. Mack as Johnny the Priest - transmuted to "Johnny The Harp" for the films so as not to offend). <br /> <br /> This small change is interesting. As too many films accused (by those who want the MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins) to be "little more than filmed plays," the problem is not the work, but the filmmakers who would not be more faithful to the property. . By diluting a great cinematographic work so that it does not offend anyone, or by opening it because they COULD, too many lose the qualities that made it worthwhile to shoot the piece. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the studio's respect for O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to admirably survive the normally destructive process in Frances Marion's generally sensitive screen adaptation. Marvel of wonders, Marion even allows the POINT of the scene in which Anna, of Garbo, reveals her past in "the farm" to the man with whom she is very eager to marry and the father who sent her there intact. What the League of Decency must have thought of that! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the source game has always been that Chris's friend, Marthy, tends to get away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can take the stage, Two faces of the really good woman. Men do not always recognize. <br /> <br /> Marie Dressler (who also cut her teeth on the Broadway stage before going to Hollywood) is the perfect balance for Anna de Garbo in this area and the fast-moving movie just 90 minutes away , it does not allow us too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits of the atmosphere that is shown instead of being described eloquently in the original - And the screenwriter Marion is smart enough to get away from O'Neill and bring Dressler back to play it Scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of the second performance of Julie Laverne in SHOW BOAT. <br /> <br /> The initial scene of Anna and Marthy together on the screen (16 minutes in the film) taking the measure of the others and setting all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most shocking scenes of the whole piece. Do not be surprised <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragic work and a good cinematographic drama. It's hard to imagine that a remake of the last days, which would almost certainly lose the sharpness and atmosphere of this remake of 1930 (it was filmed for the first time without sound in 1923, also with the original Broadway Chris by George Marion) could improve this excellent filming. <br /> <br /> The internal scenes are the closest to the work, but nobody should miss the exterior. While the background screen work does not meet modern technical standards, the backgrounds offer a better view than most real-world era films in which screen reproduction is developed (especially at the port). from New York). <br /> <br /> Almost all of Garbo's naturalist interpretations of the era of sound have been superbly maintained (only the scene of CAMILLE's death, too often parodied, 7 years later, will occasionally elicit giggles from the direction hard-boiled and parodies), but this ANNA Christie, along with the variety of his films of 1932, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the sublime touch of Lubitsch in his 1939 comedy, NINOTCHKA ("Garbo laughs!" ), surely stand out as your best. <br /> <br /> Or 'Neill fans who are left with this work on the edge of their praised "sea works", should track the excellent film in the form of World War II launched in the year before the Conflict of the United States, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). It is almost as cleverly extracted from those sea works as this by ANNA Christie, and features a young John Wayne in one of his rare non-Western artists who supports an excellent cast of veteran actors who show him the way.
