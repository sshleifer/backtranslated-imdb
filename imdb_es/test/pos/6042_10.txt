I have not seen this good movie in 50 years, but I'm still entering a comment anyway. <br /> <br /> Although JACK WEBB's movie was undoubtedly intended as entertainment, showing Marine's basic training on Parris Island in realistic terms as a difficult character-building exercise, it was said that the military they feared that the film would discourage recruitment. It did not work that way. The film showed that entering the Marine Corps was a greater challenge than most young people had realized, and (guess what?) Being offered a big challenge was exactly what many wanted. Personally, I met many guys who joined the Marines shortly after watching THE DI. The lines at the recruiting centers were suddenly so long that the Marines had more recruits than they could handle. <br /> <br /> That's right. The United States will always have young people who seek to become the best, while the lazy and the lost are born limping to nothing. <br /> <br /> What we do NOT have in 2007 is any film that inspires patriotism, devotion to duty of any kind, positive values, etc. What we do have is movies that inspire fans of air to be aerial heads, beer drinkers to consume beer, other negative values. The test n. ° 1 is that the fan of the teenage airhead and the beer that consumes epics, SUPERBAD, is now the n. ° 81 on the list of all the great movies of all time. Values? What does it mean, values?
