I am surprised that you have a real affection for this, since I am not a lover of action and adventure. But hey ... it's hard enough to make a mistake with a Robert Carlyle movie. I have read several poor or moderate reviews in this film, separating them for their time mistakes or the improbable plot development, but nobody seems to mention the rather intriguing character transition that shows how a hardened, unlucky scoundrel. (Carlyle) becomes a rather noble and selfless hero, and the way the cowardly and handsome bum (Miller) develops a true taste for the life of a man on the road once he "realizes it". Filled with a lot of bad guy humor, lavish scenes (particularly the use of "fireworks" by the old apothecary Plunkett) and a delightfully eclectic musical score, Plunkett & Macleane is a fun and funny piece of film. It's definitely worth your viewing time FOR THE CLIMAX SCENE ONLY! Shoot them, guys!
