Amazing, amazing, brilliant, magnificent. Those are the four adjectives that appear in my head when I start describing "The Kite Runner". The adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's book had already captured many minds, in fact, it is rumored that he himself burst into tears after seeing the prime minister. I must say, even before I started, that I had read the book before seeing the advanced projection of "The Kite Runner". Therefore, my opinion and points of view may be slightly skewed. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say, that although in my opinion the book was better than the final product of the film, in no way is it a bad idea. adaptation. I mean, for a two-hour movie, it has the well-deserved answer. Things appear a bit quick in the last twenty minutes, but other than that, he has achieved what the book did. It has captured the minds and imagination of millions of people around the world. The magic woven by Khaled Hosseini, to give us a feeling of remorse of joy, of sadness, of pain, of loyalty, is clever in this adaptation. Especially in the first scene, when the young Hassan says: "If you tell me to eat garbage, I'll do it, but I know you will not ask for it." Such a moving line is destined to capture the hearts of many. The two young actors were brilliant, absolutely superb. Especially the boy who played with the innocent but loyal Hassan, a boy who refuses to abandon a kite that he caught because he promised his best friend he would take it, only to be abused by big thugs who beat him and used him sexually, and then be reprimanded by his best friend as a coward. The whole act is so moving that you can not stop wetting your eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is well placed, except for the last bit. The point when Amir learns of his true relationship with Hassan and reads him the first and the last of Hassan, when he breaks down crying feeling helpless, lonely and repentant, he seemed a bit rushed and felt that Amir was behind a facade. In the book, Khaled Hosseini had devoted between 10 and 12 pages to describe Amir's mental state in that position. But that was compensated in the penultimate segment of the film, when Amir defends Hassan's son, his nephew, Sohrab, in front of his father-in-law. The end was well deserved and I'm sure it will be well appreciated. I felt that the torch passed from one generation to another. <br /> <br /> Moving on to the technical aspects. First, the performance. Only one word-excellent From beginning to end, the young Hassan and Amir, his father, his friend Rahim Khan. All have been excellent, especially the young Hassan. Second, the management was amazing, along with brilliant camera work. The background score was also impressive. From the beginning, the credit tracking to the end, and I especially loved it when Amir is in the mosque of Pakistan, the Western and Islamic fusion, made it very special. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is definitely one of the best movies, and it's a welcome break from all those Iran-inspired films we've seen this year. 9/10 !!!
