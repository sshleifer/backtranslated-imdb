I remember this movie with love for having seen it in the theater. I recently found a copy on VHS and it was saved in my memory. Although obviously it is not a "big budget" movie, the performance is quite credible and the stage, the location and the costumes are very well made. I wish the Mamuts had been more in the image, but when you see them, they are also well made (remember, SFX was made in those days without the benefit of computers, some poor demon had to put all that hair and fake). Fangs on real elephants!) ... the same effect was used on elephants in "Quest for Fire". Rod Cameron, a better than average adventure film and an opportunity for the star, to play something more than a cowboy, which he also did very well over the years.
