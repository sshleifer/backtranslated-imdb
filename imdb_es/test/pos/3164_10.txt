It is worth taking a look. I saw it on the MLK 2006 birthday and it hit me big time. Sometimes it seems that we are all in a trap and we are condemned to repeat the past, no matter how much we try to change. All we can do is follow and talk. Just keep going. I do not pretend to be downcast because it is not the point, but we may have to go down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves. What happens when the best people like MLK tell us what must happen to get us out of our "way out" but we do not listen. I know some of us listen, but how do we get the rest of the world to see things as they really are? Just keep going, I suppose. This movie made me think even more about all this, so I guess he has done what he had to do. That's what I consider a good movie, a play, a book, a poem, a speech or something else: something that makes you think and encourages you to move in an active direction instead of getting stuck, bored and without hope.
