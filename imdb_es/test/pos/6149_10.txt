I do not agree with the synopsis of imdb.com that he is a bisexual man preparing to get married. It is more about all the trash we go through, self induced and by our parents, that we have to "overcome" when we grow up. As the poem by Linda McCarriston says: "Childhood is the barrel in which you are thrown by the falls". This movie is much more like a narrative poem. It's about life and the mistakes we make and hurt that we inflict and experience over the years, and how in the end, it's about love (I'm not trying to be hypersensitive or clumsy) and to find and be with a special person .
