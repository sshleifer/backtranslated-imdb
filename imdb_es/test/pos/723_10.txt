Located mainly in the back streets of Toronto, NG is a dark and mysterious journey that takes the viewer to the mind of a young man and woman (Vern and Sarah), each of whom has a fascination for enigmas and an incident disastrous in his past. The fine dialogue and first-class cast drive this discreet and novel journey towards the girl's search for the meaning behind the word riddles that continue to appear in her life. Helped by her, anything less enthusiastic, male friend, the two reached the end of their search, but with a price to pay. The film never tries to answer all its mysteries, but does an excellent job in exposing several twists of the plot.
