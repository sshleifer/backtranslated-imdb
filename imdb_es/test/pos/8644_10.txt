Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. Even when nothing happens, it's suspense. The director David Lynch uses too many cheap tricks of emotion here and there, but intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to prevent them from becoming obtuse. <br /> <br /> In general surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sound. I am still trying to understand everything and I will probably have to see it again to detect the things that I lost and to help me understand it better. It is a very detailed plot that joins very slowly, so you must be patient and pay attention. Get out of your way to the bathroom before it starts. And, nevertheless, the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the development of the character and the shooting techniques. <br /> <br /> The dual roles of the lead actress, Naomi Watts, show her enormous talent. That is, when I could take my eyes away from your castmate. What a couple acting. <br /> <br /> Lynch surprises throughout the film with unusual camera angles, duration / synchronization of editing cuts, jumping between scenes. Combined with the intelligent use of music and sounds, all this helps to create suspense in our minds, undoubtedly one of the main objectives of the director. Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, he even made me talk to the actors to be careful here, and not be so naive there. You know, the kind of things you want to hit your kids to do at the movies.
