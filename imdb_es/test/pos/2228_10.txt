I remember seeing this movie in my teens or early twenties on television, probably HBO. I saw him with my parents, a brother and some friends. As that was about 30 years ago, I do not remember much of the story. I remember that the whole group of us that were watching agreed that it was the funniest movie we had seen. When it was over, our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard. My father worked in a hospital, so everything was better. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch The Party on the TV listings, I see if this one is also there. To my dismay, it never is. Although I loved the party, I think this is more fun. Peter Sellers was great as an administrator of a crooked hospital. Why it has never been published in video is a mystery to me. It's a classic, but it seems that no one under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it. I would buy it in a second if they ever released it to DVD.
