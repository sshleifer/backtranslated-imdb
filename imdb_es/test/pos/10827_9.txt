On its surface, this is one of the most entertaining, classic-style action / comedy / romance movies I've seen in a long time, and it reminds me of the old and enjoyable "Saturday afternoon" movies that had the perfect balance of twists unexpected Synchronized humor and integrated action. Beyond this, however, there is our knowledge of the context of this film. It has the same "Casablanca" elements, but it is established just before many of the characters really understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country (and the world) and the consequences of some of their own behaviors. This adds a strong note of irony to humor (we feel that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in their future). This is a movie that you will not regret seeing.
