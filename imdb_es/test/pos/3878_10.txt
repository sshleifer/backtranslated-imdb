Because this program was cut early, I never realized why until I recently read the story behind the series. I felt that this program never had its quotas as one of the best, this program is iconic in its nature and deserves the film it always had the intention to have, if not with the original A team at least with the cast incorporated in the line of the story or a long cameo, perhaps in the end commemorate the late Colonel Hanibal Smith (Preppard). This cast gave us so much that it brought us happiness to grow that deserve a last effort. The fact that the series ended openly because they cut the series is a sufficient reason. This team and the cast made us understand as children the essence of being one of the good guys, especially seeing how spoiled the world is today, I think a softer version like the original should get moving. I have already read the previews and I know These are not the plans, but if it is a DVD movie, I would buy it. I really do not understand how the fucking shows get series endings, but this great show that still runs regularly today and probably looks more than some of today's junk shows, we will not always remember the Incredible Hulk series, Knight Rider, Airwolf, and Team A, because those kinds of shows are broadcast over time, I'm pretty sure that these acquaintances that you see on the detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years. How these old shows are really treated.
