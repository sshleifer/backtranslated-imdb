Cactus Flower is not a work of art, but it is compared to most of the tired farces of the world. 60s like The apartment, How to murder your wife, Goodbye Charlie, A guide for the married man, Divorce, American style, Any Wednesday, Kiss Me Stupid, Boys Night Out, is a masterpiece. The director Saks and the writer I.A.L. Diamond has effectively "opened" the success of Abe Burrows on Broadway, and the film benefits greatly from the shooting in New York City and the excellent performances of Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming, he looks great and shows a talent for comedy. Hawn in his Oscar-winning role has never been better or more attractive. Matthau is fine, although it's hard to believe that Hawn's character was so in love with him. And in retrospect, Hawn's suicide attempt at the beginning of the film is misplaced and unbelievable. However, the film has a plausible farce configuration, and once it starts, it generates laughter. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Eve Bruce and Vito Scotti provide good support. The movie is nice and fun, and Hawn and Bergman make you worry.
