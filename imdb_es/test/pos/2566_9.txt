Then you will be a big fan of this movie. It's almost the same basic concept, a good mix of music, soul and drama. I admit I was a little worried about watching this movie, I had only seen the progress of a white garbage girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow, so I thought I would give it a try . <br /> <br /> I am very happy that I did it. It turned out to be something more than the simple story of a southern nympho girl imprisoned by a black man of 60 years. History had a heart and was very influential. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie also gave it a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style of Hustle & Flow in this film, except that he took a new turn and used the Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts in terms of performance scenes. It also has very interesting flashback scenes and it only gives you a feeling of general madness during some of the most controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will love this movie, and if you like it. If you are a blues fan, you should definitely go see this. I give it a 9 out of 10, a very interesting movie, and it's extremely undervalued. shame. <br /> <br /> Go out and rent this movie.
