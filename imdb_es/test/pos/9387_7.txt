Bed of death: the bed that eats. <br /> <br /> Judging by the title, you can guess what this movie is about. And yet, there is a much more (background) story in this movie than one might suspect. <br /> <br /> Well, then the main plot is about a bed to eat people and food, but there are also some subplots. I will not spoil them for you, but they are a good touch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the acting in this movie is very mediocre. The fact that the actors do not even talk about the dialogue does not really help to improve the quality of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Because there is a lot of talk work. The thoughts of the characters are also revealed to the observers. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. <br /> <br /> The effects are fine. Sure, it could be much better if you compare it with today's movies. But you really should not; Just judge the movie as it is and do not take it too seriously. You have to admit that a killer BED is pretty creative. If you are easily scared, do not watch this movie. You may never want to go back to sleep again ... <br /> <br /> Death Bed: the bed you eat is a strange gem of horror on a low budget, but I would still recommend it to horror movie fans. <Br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for its creative history and unexpected twists here and there.
