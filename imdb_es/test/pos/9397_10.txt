It is really quite simple. The name of the film is Deathbed, The bed that eats. If you're like me, you know if you're going to like this movie. I came across this gem at Best Buy the other day and picked it up for Ten Bucks. I got ten dollars of title fun, and only the box. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of B movies. In my opinion, this is one of the best B movies I've seen. Now, it's not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not even for most people. In fact, I suspect that we're just going to be a few of us who really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who like B movies, this movie is a diamond in the rough. . It has a great premise, a bed ... People who eat. It does not walk, it does not move, it does not have a siren to attract people. It almost depends on people who walk and sit in it. <br /> <br /> I loved every inch of this movie and I've seen it three times in the few weeks I've had it. <br /> <br /> As I said, after reading the title of the movie, you know if you will like it. If you laughed or smiled, then give it a try. worth it.
