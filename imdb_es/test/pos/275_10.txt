I like many others, I saw this as a child and I loved it and I was horrified until adulthood, I've been trying to find this movie and I've even been looking for it to play it on TV someday, since it was originally heard in US networks UU Does anyone know where to buy this movie or does someone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also, does anyone know if there is a possibility that it will be reproduced on television again? Maybe all the fans should write a station with the hope that they will broadcast it again. I do not think they've done a good job promoting this movie in the past because nobody really knows, people only know the wives of Stepford and the films of her stepford husband. Nobody is familiar with the fact that there was a version for children. Maybe they should also do a new version, since it seems that they are doing a lot lately with many of my favorite thrillers / horror movies. Well, if someone has an entry please, I beg you, write me with information. Thanks Taira tcampo23@aol.com
