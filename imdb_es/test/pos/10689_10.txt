This movie is surprisingly good. The ninja fight sequences were incredible. I have not seen all the films of Sho Kosugi, but this is probably the best one I've seen. Probably the most impressive combat sequence was at the beginning when the ninjas killed about 20 people, that was one of the most impressive combat sequences I've seen. Another good fight sequence was at a police funeral where the ninja provide more people to bury. The last fight was also very impressive. I also liked a little the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja movie, it was actually something different from other ninja movies. So if you are a fan of ninja movies, you probably like this one.
