By 1950, John Ford had already fully developed the ideas and motives that would form the core of his most successful westerns. For example, there is always a strong sense of community, captured most movingly in the Joad family of "The Grapes of Wrath (1940) by Steinbeck." Within these communities, even in the midst of Ford's higher themes of racism and pioneering spirit, there is always room for the smallest human interactions, the smallest friendships, and the romances that make life worthwhile. 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford had released the first two films in his "Cavalry" trilogy. 'Fort Apache (1948)' and 'She wore a yellow ribbon (1949)'? and it covers a similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damning, the strong leadership of John Wayne. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr. are good actors, but they feel like they are playing a secondary role for someone, and Ward the damn old Mormon elder, although potentially a candidate for such a role, does not have enough attention to adjust satisfactorily to the project. law. <br /> <br /> In 'Wagon Master', Ford seems to be so comfortable with its tried and tested Western formula that any character development is largely neglected. Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and Harry Cary Jr's charm of a Mormon girl is so superficial as to be almost non-existent in the final film, leaving one to reflect on the survival of deleted scenes. Only in the charismatic and blatantly evil Uncle Shiloh of Charles Kemper, Ford tries something different, and it works, even being surrounded by a troop of incredibly hammy heels. Where is Ford successful in orchestrating the conglomerate of three different American races? The values-oriented Mormoms, the carefree horse merchants, the eccentric traveling travelers? in a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future. This apparent harmony is disorganized with the arrival of the outlaws armed with Uncle Shiloh firearms, who exploit the anarchy of the western border, but ultimately lose to the noble cowboys that "only attracted snakes." <br /> <br /> It is said that Ford considered Wagon Master among the favorites of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with its selection of regular players, Ford can generate a sense of community by avoiding focusing on any character, although most Mormom travelers remain completely anonymous. Despite being undoubtedly well done, I can not help feeling that this movie only does a good job with other Ford films: the majestic majesty of the western frontier was presented more beautifully in "She wore a yellow ribbon"; romances and friendly squabbles among members of the community took greater prominence in 'Fort Apache'; the first relations with the Native Americans, which were only suggested here, were examined more thoroughly in 'The Searchers (1956)'; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored in a more moving way (though by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in "How the West Was Won (1962)." 'Wagon Master' is pure John Ford, but it is not a milestone.
