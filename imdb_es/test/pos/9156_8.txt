This show was really good in many ways, although certainly an atypical Western with the hero (?) Walking on a motorcycle instead of a horse, due to the configuration of 1914, very "late" for a Westerner, who usually tends a was established between 1866 and 1890. I remember some controversy about its cancellation at that time, but I did not really see it during its time on NBC. When I came to see him and I loved it, it was a decade later when he was in the Army stationed in Germany and showed up every week from the beginning in Armed Forces Television. By then, Margot Kidder was famous as Lois Lane, but I will also always consider her the girlfriend of Nichols. In many ways, Nichols looked a lot like Maverick; Both felt much more attracted to enrich themselves with little effort than fighting. It was in the small TV magazine that they distributed on the PX (which is not really an authorized edition of "TV Guide" but that resembled as much as possible a copyright problem) when I learned the real story behind the cancellation. I really wonder what the next season with the more violent twin would have been like if they had really done it as planned. Of course, when this program was made, the "Western era" of television had been in decline for about a decade; Someday I hope to write that the "era of reality" has been in decline for so long! While "Gunsmoke" and "Bonanza" kept running, both were nearing their ends and it had been years since a new Western had really realized; I think this trend did a lot to contain "Nichols", and that was the main reason why NBC executives doubted that they would ever find a large audience. But for me, a good western, unlike a program set in the contemporary era, is something timeless, as are other "period" shows; The change of fashions and similar things does nothing to make them look more "outdated" than they were supposed to be, and I think that seeing this program, 10 years after its production, is what really got me to this point. In addition, this show is an early pairing of Garner and Stuart Margolin, who is really one of the great companions of all time, and not only in the Westerns.
