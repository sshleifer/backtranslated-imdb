These are the types of movies that I loved, and I still love growing up. Unlike big budget movies that make huge holes in the plot and never recognize them. This film takes everything calmly and only does something that you can sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Previously, there was a film student who complained that he was not a material on the list. But that is not the point. The point of this movie is that nobody likes movies full of CGI clich√©s. There are many people who like movies that just want to entertain you, and not get as much money as they can. <br /> <br /> Also, it's also good to know that good old Bruce is not. dead yet
