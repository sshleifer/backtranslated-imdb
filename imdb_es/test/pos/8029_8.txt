Once I knew that Donald Sutherland, (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) was appearing in this movie, he instantly told me it was going to be a good image to watch. Most of Sutherland's images are full of action and suspense, and he can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and kind. In this photo, Jack Shaw did his best to be a good guy and a bad guy while training in a Naval Office to become a spy who had to change his whole identity and become a different person during the night. There are many scenes of car chases and many situations of acrobatics that I would not like to perform. This naval officer lived in a quiet community with his wife and was a father, but he would never realize it until the film reveals his horrible background secrets that he had to hide from his family and friends. Good spy movie and great acting of all the actors.
