I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was. If you are a gore fan or a suspense fan; you'll love this. I used to dislike horror movies, considered stupid. But, anyway, it happens that I make exceptions. I find something really extraordinary in this movie. I have rarely seen a movie that scared me, but I tell you the truth that this movie gave me the creeps. Unlike most horror movies, it worries about the development of the characters. I recommend this movie and I'm glad that Asylum is finally releasing good horror movies these days <br /> <br /> I recommend it! Enjoy!
