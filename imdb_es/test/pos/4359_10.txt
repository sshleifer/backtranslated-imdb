We see at the beginning of Little Dieter Needs Fly Flyer Dengler, the subject of the film, an obsessive-compulsive. Or at least that's what it seems to be when opening / closing doors constantly and with its large amount of food in the basement. In a way, director Werner Herzog raises a central question, as a way of speaking, of why Dieter is like that. Well, in fact, it's not necessarily obsessive-compulsive since it's okay, well, prepared. And why should not he be after the life he has lived? Apart from the more juicy, dark, exciting, terrifying and simply disturbing survival story, which is the core of the image, Dieter's background story is also fascinating. Dieter's own childhood, for example, was already a problem from the beginning, being in postwar Germany, poor in a family without much food or perspectives, eating wallpaper for "the blue on the walls". But enter into a passion, a desire that does not give up (which, of course, is part of Herzog's bread and butter and the love of man in his films), that is flying, and for Dieter there was nothing more than comply with this. What he ends up leading to, after becoming a US citizen, is more than he could have negotiated. <br /> <br /> Dieter is one of Herzog's most compelling, peculiar and compassionately observed figures throughout his career. a man whose memory is marked by the brutal memories of his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, but at least provides some of the most compelling narratives of any documentary of the past 20 years. Ironically, the storytelling is presented, unlike The Wild Blue Yonder, mainly in Dieter's exhibition on some of the most minute details of his time in different prison camps (torture tactics, bugs, brutal ones and miserable violence and threats as with the tale of a wedding ring, and driving to the most interesting and sad parts with his best friend Duane.They escaped from the prisons together, but discovered that their journey to get to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, through most of this, the conversation does something that is fascinating, and that is that as Dieter reviews his stories and occasionally makes recreations (in the way that Herzog could only do it, with Dieter already middle-aged being guided with handcuffs and everything through the jungle), one can imagine all this in the mind, everything becomes even more vivid to try to obtain these small details and the intensi ad of all together in a form of reality. The fact that Herzog keeps these simple portions, and knows when to retain Dieter in his answers, makes him a key figure of interest. It is never totally 'normal', but unlike Timothy Treadwell, you will not really think about laughing at it either. <br /> <br /> So, along with his hero (whether it's war or not, it's hard to say, while Dieter discusses that claim by saying that those who died were the true heroes, typical but perhaps quite true, Herzog stylized his film with a mixture of old archive images detailing Dieter's early life (the image of the WW2 scenes and German post rubble) is always a captivating spectacle, and with Herzog it increases its level in its synchronization and assembly with music), and in capturing images of Vietnam in aerial sightings of jungles and fields, Herzog is also very wise not to inject much policy into procedures, there is no 'I was used by the Americans' or whatever There is even the feeling that Dieter does not hold too much grudge with everything that happened to him, which is what happens in times of war (and, of course, he was throwing bombs on him. from your plane). Now, through much of these heartbreaking, and even in the smallest fragments related to what happened in prisons, bathrooms and food remains, it is always heartbreaking. Fortunately, Herzog keeps a level of humor under control. One of my favorite scenes from the movie, where Herzog separates from Dieter for a moment, is when he shows an "apprentice" movie used for American soldiers with the intention of showing what should happen in case they are left alone in the jungle. With all the equipment they could have, including a knife, a flare gun and a very fast helicopter to go around (and this is due to a hilariously dead voice job). <br /> <br /> However, even the moments when one laughs only remind us of moments of absurdity in a moment of absolute crisis, and how one can not really imagine what it is like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to avoid it. keep that person as a form of guarantee in time of war. Dieter, apart from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have (and Herzog ends the movie with a wonderfully somber and elegiac note in which he flies over a large field of planes), he knows what about. You have to survive at all costs. But, nevertheless, also, as in many of Herzog's leading films, there is an almost unalterable spirit that will last if it is strong enough, even in horrible moments (Dunae's fate) and the problems until the rescue by El. helicopter (is it an American, or a spy ?, they ask the helicopter). Dieter is a man with spirit and has given him through Herzog a fantastic, tragic, creative, well shot, although perhaps too short, as a tribute to his life. And, of course, it excites me even more for the upcoming Rescue Dawn dramatization.
