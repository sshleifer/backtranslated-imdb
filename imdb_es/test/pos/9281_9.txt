I totally agree with the comments of GarryJohal from Singapore about this film. Quote: 'Yes, non-Singaporeans can not see what the problem of this film is. Some of the references in this film fly directly over the heads of foreign viewers and most Singaporeans are the ones who would really "catch" it. It is still not quite true and, as Malay-Chinese, I do understand it, although I do not speak Hokkien because we also have similar "problems" in Malaysia. I know it's really hard to understand and accept this as a REALITY, but it's definitely NOT a 'it's not a real story'. I was pleased to see this film outside of Malaysia because it will also be banned in Malaysia. Which means you can get it on 'VCD or DVD copied illegally' or hope that someone is kind enough to 'share' on the Internet. This is not a 'other violent teen drama .......' because it portrays the reality that exists in Singapore (and also in Malaysia) in an interesting way (sad + humor). It saddened me a little to know that this movie had about 20 cuts in censorship. What a waste!
