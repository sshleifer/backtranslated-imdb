Having discovered the Ring trilogy, I have been greedily devouring all the other Japanese and Korean films that are in or following the car. <br /> <br /> I do not have an easy definition of horror, but this movie I certainly pressed some of my buttons, although I can not claim that the movie makes much sense. I'm apprehensive, so there were several points in the movie when I did not want to see what was happening on the screen. The movie baffled me, so I was afraid to see things that I thought I was going to see. <br /> <br /> It is an imaginative film that offers a lot visually. It also provides food for thought. And a lot of material to discuss about when the movie is over. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined to say the least. Could you make films like this in the West? <br /> <br /> So in the end it does not make sense, but when one has an appetite for the occult, the supernatural, the strange, the otherworldly, then no. The film is going to deliver a final reward that explains everything.
