I was curious to know the name of the Tuscan village where filming was made in Italy. I know the name of the villa: Villa San Girolamo, however, would like to know the exact location in Tuscany. The cinematography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit that area. I would also be interested to know the location of the shots in the desert. Travel a lot through Europe and Africa and I would like to visit the areas that the book and the film are about. Please send me an email with any information about the sites that anyone may have. We would be very grateful. And if anyone knows if the villa in Tuscany is still habitable, that would be amazing too. I look forward to any information and thank you in advance for your time.
