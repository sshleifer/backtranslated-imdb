Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel silly. But it's a great movie. Not very entertaining, but very very intriguing. The film focuses on the wheelchair of Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein look normal, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, galaxy and black holes. Everyone, at some time or another during a really intense moment, comes to a time when they believe they have grasped the universe and that the cosmos has realized and swear that as soon as they are sober they will write everything down. Well, here is a man who really maintained that feeling for more than six hours. Here is a man who, despite suffering from Lou Gehrig's illness, has become the greatest mind the world has seen so far. Look at this and hear how he has formulated theories about black holes. Amazing. You will not be the same after seeing it.
