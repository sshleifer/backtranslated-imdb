This is one of those movies that, for whatever reason, they just clicked with me. Everything is correct. Eric Roberts laconic, good researcher, his voice-over narration, the twisted plot, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb gave good roles, adjustments, paintings in the artist's studio scenes, the final credit sequence and the beautifully themed music disturbing that perfectly encapsulates the mood of the whole movie. If I have any doubt, it is Beverly D'Angelo as the femme fatale, but she interprets her final scenes perfectly. I think that director Matthew Chapman was trying to give a feeling of "Chinatown" to all this. It did not work But as a murder-mystery is a jewel.
