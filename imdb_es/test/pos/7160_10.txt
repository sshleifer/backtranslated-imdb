I agree with the other comments of 9 and 10 stars. I saw him at the South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin. Of the 20 films I saw, 7 were really good and this was the best for me. I am a fan of movies that have plot devices where the characters go through transformations that change their lives completely. The excellent performance was made mainly by people involved in television, or it was their first film. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. This was his directorial debut. Jay's day job is apparently as permission manager for many famous movies. Forgiving the Franklins was a total delight and extremely fun in some places. This is a movie in which I would buy the DVD and I would see it again, a great complement for me. Well done, Jay, yes ... Give up your daily work!
