You can say that this is the first offer of the Director (who also wrote it), but you can also see the potential that this guy has. This is obviously a low budget movie in the spirit of Boondock Saints. Of course, Boondock Saints came out a few years after this, so you can see this as a diamond that needs some enamel. The performance was good: if you are looking for DeNiro or Michael Madsen in a criminal drama, remember that these are young guys, playing young guys who try to be criminals. They are not going to be "super brakes" (tm) like some of the veterans. I would have loved to have seen Justin Pagel (Joe, the main character) make more movies, he was great at this. Good movie - 3 stars out of 5.
