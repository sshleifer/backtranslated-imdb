Watching this show gives me respect for MTV, although I imagine that MTV sees this random and avant-garde material as its main point of sale and is much less concerned about the relevant truths it expresses. <br /> <br /> I write and play music to make a living and this show excites me a lot. For me, Wondsershowzen fulfills a function completely different from most televisions. Instead of blunting or distracting the senses (which can sometimes be really pleasant), it awakens my spirit of right and wrong. It makes me feel very uncomfortable, but in a very comforting way. <br /> <br /> I do not think many viewers absorb most of the content of this program, but if they do, congratulations to viewers around the world.
