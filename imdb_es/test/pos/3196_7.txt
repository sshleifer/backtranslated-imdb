This short film was in the fourth part of the "Short Cinema Journal", a movie that I rented from Netflix but that seems to have been originally a monthly series of films for people who like mediocre and modern short films And they love that the DVD is full of ads. . So far I have tried two of the DVDs of the Journal and I have been enraged by the horrible way in which a viewer needs to browse the disc to watch the movies. Talk about an overproduced and too complicated way of doing this! While I have seen and will continue to see all the shorts that I can, I really doubt that I will bother with the newspapers due to these factors. <br /> <br /> Now it could be that because I disliked the album, so Much that was not favorably disposed towards this Portuguese animated short. This is definitely possible. However, even if this is the case, I think the other reviews were too positive regarding this small and simple movie. Some of the illustrations were really nice: I liked how the simple black-and-white drawings suddenly became three-dimensional environments when the camera went from a boring plane and submerged in the city below. This was lovely and it took a little work. But as for the story about a cat that wants to go to the moon, it just did not do anything for me. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT UPDATE: I saw this movie again on a DVD titled "Cartoon Noir" on 5/09. It was a pretty nasty collection of art movies. However, this time I saw THE HISTORY OF THE CAT AND THE MOON with a completely different audio track and the boy made a difference. Instead of Portuguese with subtitles, he had a French-accented narrator who spoke English in a Black Cinema style. Although I normally hate dubbing, this time I really made the movie. The narration of the Portuguese version leaves much to be desired if you do not know the language or do not understand the subtleties. Unless you speak the language, try searching for the other version (as long as you understand English).
