I'm not American, but the meatballs still hit me. Maybe because it's a sweet, sweet movie. Seeing it again today made me sentimental for a time that I really can not identify and a place I can not remember. <br /> <br /> Meatballs is simply a great movie. It reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and everything was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, you probably know what I mean. <br /> <br /> All I can say above what I've already said is that Meatballs should be even more nostalgic if you're American. <br /> <br /> I guess you know what I mean by that, too.
