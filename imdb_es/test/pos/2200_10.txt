I saw "Sweeney Todd" on Broadway in 1980. It was starring George Hearn and featured most of the other cast directors who appeared in the production of the national tour company, which was recorded for television in Los Angeles in 1982. Last night I saw the new DVD. Launch of the production of Los Angeles, although I have owned the videotape for many years. The production and performances could not have been better, but the age of the original tape was shown because both the audio quality and the video quality are below modern standards, even on a newly recorded DVD. However, I still give it 10 out of 10 due to the greatness of the work and the amazingly wonderful performances of George Hearns and Angella Lansbury. Even today, my most memorable memory of a live musical theater performance has to be Hearn's version of "These are My Friends". "You are going to drip rubies", brrr.
