I feel lost, so bright is this movie. Kieslowski is a writer, a philosopher; and although an excellent filmmaker, his greatness lies in his writing; and "red" is its paradigm. This film is a metafictional study of the artist's judgment in the creation of his fictional world; of how an artist can try to remake life, even his own, through his art, even when he can not escape the knowledge that, no matter how he gets involved in his story, it is still fiction and is still out of his world. remade, still burdened with its unreality and the reality of life that it has tried to recreate artistically. And magically, all this is not in a minimum degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and destiny and the characters who live this story, this prejudiced destiny. If I had to choose, I could nominate this the best movie ever made.
