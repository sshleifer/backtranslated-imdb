We went to see Manna from heaven, my husband, two friends, me and all of us enjoyed the movie. The characters are fun, the story is funny and it looks a lot like real life. I think that's what I liked the most, just seeing something credible, no murders, no science fiction, just good, clean and fun. It is something that could lead your children or elderly parents and not worry. How many of those are already around!
