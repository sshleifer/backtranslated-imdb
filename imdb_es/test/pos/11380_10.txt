This is an absolutely masterly stroke of genius by Paul Thomas Anderson, the writer / director of this film. It really examines the advantages and disadvantages of the world of pornography and the consequences of your actions living in a world literally fueled by sex, drugs and rock and roll. Only the best actors met with Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Philip Baker Hall and others.
