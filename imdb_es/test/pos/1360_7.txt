A captivatingly silly anime, with only six episodes in length, about an unfortunate delivery boy named Kintaro (well, he is called a delivery boy, although he is destined to be more than 20 years old) and the adventures he has in his travels. Each episode sees him arrive in a new city, acquiring a new job, developing a kind of love interest before each episode ends with his departure. <br /> <br /> Being slightly sexist, youthful, very immature at times, this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> It's not one to start with if you're not an anime fan, since this will certainly not convince you about the genre, but for those who are already converted, this is fun stuff.
