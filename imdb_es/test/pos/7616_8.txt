I can not say that I embrace it like a romantic comedy, since I found it funny. I found it attractive, entertaining, comforting and, finally, sweet, and although there were some ingenious moments, I found them more bittersweet than comedians. <br /> <br /> I liked this one. Barrymore has grown as much as an actress, and it's always wonderful to see her on the big screen, but this also translates well on the small screen. In fact, in later views, I like this one more and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the Romantic Comedy, then you may be a little disappointed by the lack of comedic effect with this, but if you are in romance, it is definitely here to be found. <br /> <br /> It has a rating of 7.8 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
