If you love Japanese monster movies, you'll love this action-packed battle facing an alien invader, with the intention of conquering the Earth, and a "giant robot" with an arsenal of super armament. The extraterrestrial, "Emporer Guillotine", of the planet Gargoyle, has an army of thugs called (of course) "the gang of gargoyles", as well as an endless supply of immense hostile creatures that are routinely released on Earth to destroy buildings. , make loud noises, terrorize the population, etc. A little boy, named Johnny Sokko, has the Giant Robot at his disposal, and sends the Robot, as needed, to hit and then destroy these creatures. Johnny joins a group of "good spies" called Unicorn, and strives to help save the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the carefree nature, the dialogue with no sense of humor and the fact that the target audience was obviously children, this film has uninterrupted action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and it is very fun to watch. The battle scenes are well executed and are frequent, as history requires. Both the good guys and the bad guys made sure to have an inexhaustible supply of bombs, lasers, ammunition and plans to attack each other. Despite the fact that the film was built from episodes edited from a television series, the plot really develops and comes to a definitive conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film has a positive outlook and attracts everyone (especially children). ) desire to destroy evil in its many forms. Children may be the target audience, but it's fun for everyone to laugh at their comic stupidity; However, at the same time, encourage the good ones to prevail and "save the world." The acting is cheesy in some places, but that's the charm: there are several lines of cheesy dialogue (possibly translation errors or possibly intentional jokes from the filmmakers), and you'll find yourself quoting these absurd lines later on. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film is not high in production quality or budget. However, for what it is, campy sci-fi, it's fun for some laughs. I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that kind of thing.
