John Voight plays the title character in this film, based on the autobiography of author Pat Conroy (Prince of the Tides). An excellent film of teachers, tells the story of a naive Pat Conroy, a young English teacher whose first assignment is in a primary school on a rural island. The only white man on the island must fight internal and external pressures while trying to inculcate education and values ​​in children who have been systematically denied such things for generations. A solid performance that really makes you think.
