I do not understand why this program did not continue there could be several ways to continue in the line of Darwin and Farik after season 2, obviously, Darwin could not have been the UC agent infiltrating the cells and sabotaging from the inside, but still they should have given this program at least another season. <br /> <br /> The program is well-fused, credible and contemplates the Islamic religion from the normal and extremist point of view. He plays the controversial topics in detail and has a dramatic meaning that can be said of very few shows today. Actually I am sad because I did not know about this program until the end of 2007.
