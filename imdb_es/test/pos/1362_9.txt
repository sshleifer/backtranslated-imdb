I liked this a lot but I have friends who hated this. There is no sex, but there is very little nudity in any of the episodes, which is a good thing. In addition, Keitaro has a toilet fix that is scanned in at least half of the episodes. (Toilets are much more advanced in Japan.) Hmm, I wonder why I rated this so high ... It's certainly not that I like naked cartoon girls. Somehow, Keitaro Oe (the main character) is analogous to Johnny Bravo, except that instead of being an unpleasant and muscular sportsman, Keitaro is a hyperactive nerd. Or you can think of it as Japan's response to Leisure Suit Larry. It's easier to take if you see it subtitled instead of folded, but it grows in you anyway if you give it a try. He is the goldenboy <br /> <br /> The formula is the same for each episode. The boy knows the girl, the boy tries to win the girl's heart despite being a foolish pervert, the boy somehow succeeds against all odds. Usually, the girl does not realize that she likes Keitaro until after she is defeated by a pulp and / or achieves a spectacular trick like designing a modern operating system in a week or winning a race against a gasoline motorcycle with his bike. br /> <br /> Episode # 1 presents a rich software mogul. I think that animating her breasts made a big impact on the budget because she is the only woman who has this kind of animation. She also looks completely unprofessional. Most people who rate this negatively probably never got past the first episode. <br /> <br /> Episode # 2 has the rich and young daughter who likes to joke. She is only 16 years old, but that is the legal age in Japan (and in some states of the USA, I must add). His father is also a kind of brutal yakuzza who has a reputation for killing guys interested in his daughter. <br /> <br /> Girl # 3 is the sweet and innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner who is mixed with a bad boyfriend. Apart from the interference of Keitaro with the maid and the fact that a boy kisses her, in this episode there is almost no ecchi of any kind, a sharp drop compared to the previous two. However, Keitaro and the evil boyfriend really hit each other. <br /> <br /> Episode 4 makes Keitaro try to impress a top-notch swimming coach. Keitaro seems more "direct" about his intentions with this girl in particular than with any other ... and she is quite direct in return ... <br /> <br /> Girl # 5 is the biker girl. She is probably the highest of the 6 (although not super-buoyant as the # 1 girl) and is "stronger" in terms of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is easily the most exaggerated in terms of (lack of) realism. Keitaro should have broken all the bones of his body at least twice during the race against the baby biker, but I think the producers and writers said: "It's just a caricature! We can do anything!" This lapse in realism makes him the favorite of fans. <br /> <br /> Finally, episode # 6 introduces a new girl (who works in the animation) and the 5 previous girls help Keitaro while trying to deal with impossible time and resources. restrictions to get an OAV out of the door on the deadline. In terms of ecchi, this one is also very docile, but there is a lot of humor. The final has the 5 extremely beautiful girls of the previous team to hunt Keitaro, who escapes without being seen, apparently with the intention of raping him in a group. Yes, that-almost-happens in real life. Someone crossed Ukyo Tachibana (wing Samurai Shodown) with Steve Urkel (wing Family Matters) ... <br /> <br /> In general, there is no middle ground for this. You will hate it or you will love it. If you're new to the anime, you probably do not want to start with this. At the same time, if you can support characters like Happosai (from Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... or you like comedies that are more inclined towards nonsense but have very sexual connotations, you should try.
