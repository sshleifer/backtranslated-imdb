This completely forgotten slasher movie is one of the best horror movies ever made. Very dark sometimes reminds me of a famous thriller "Deliverance". Director Jeff Lieberman creates a tremendous atmosphere of terror and despair. All the actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable. Therefore, if you are looking for something spooky, try to find this little treasure. My personal rating: 10 out of 10.PS This is even more spooky than "Halloween."
