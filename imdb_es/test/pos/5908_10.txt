Jimmy Stewart brings to life the story of Charles Lindbergh, as he almost narrates the entire film while crossing the Atlantic. Well edited with flashbacks about the life of Lindeberghs. Franz Waxman's score is brilliant and it really gives the image a heroic feeling. One of the best roles Stewarts and this film can offer again and again. Look for the appearances of Murray Hamilton (The Mayor in the JAWS movie) as Bud Gurney. It will be presented on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of some of the classic Stewarts films. I think Jimmy Stewart is the best actor in America and I never get tired of seeing him in any movie he sees, look at this picture and you'll agree.
