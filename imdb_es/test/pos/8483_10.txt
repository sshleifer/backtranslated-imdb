Jamie Foxx did an amazing job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because from time to time there would be a flashback scene and then the current movie. When Ray Charles was small, he went blind and his mother did not take care of him. She was a strong woman who did not treat him differently because he was blind. She forced him to do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later in life. His mother also sent him to school too. Then, when Ray Charles became a man, he was able to defend himself and take care of himself, but there was a fall in narcotics, sex and betrayal. When I am discouraged by something, I can only think about this movie and it will inspire me.
