I love this movie. I just got a copy and saved it to see it on my birthday. This movie brings several questions. One is. Who are the monsters of this world? Being different is just that. Different. The real monsters hide behind ordinary masks. They are those that everyone considers "a nice and calm guy" who "did not bother anyone". Or worse are the characters like those played by Croneberg. Men who get pleasure and power to divide people and create their own Blood Books. I love shapeshifters, people with gifts and those who can be abhorrent for people to see. This movie touches and explores what IS normal. Who are 'others' and what fear does to some. Even though I gave this movie 10, I'm still sick of the women who shout or are so focused on their ways that they can not see what's happening and be a vehicle for the things that destroyed Median. My other complaint was why they never made a second movie. For my part, I would have loved to see a continuation of this story so intriguing that it keeps me captivated from beginning to end.
