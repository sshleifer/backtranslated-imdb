H.G. Cluozot had difficulty working in France after having made "Le Corbeau" in 1943, which was produced by the German company and then judged by the Frenchman as a piece of antifrance propaganda. Louis Jouvet, an admirer of Clouzot's work, invited him to direct a thriller "Quai des Orfevres", where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating a murder at the Music Hall in Paris. Without the knowledge of the other, the seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamoure (Suzy Delair) and her jealous piano accompanist, Maurice, who is madly in love with her (Bertrand Blier, father of director Bertrand Blier), trying to cover up (without knowledge on the other) What do you think your participation in the murder is? Enter the tenacious police (Louis Jouvet) who is determined to discover the truth. Jouvet practically stole the movie with a wonderfully cynical and sentimental performance. "His character, his eagle profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." "Quai des Orfevres", an ingenious and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses, was a great return of H.G. Cluozot, the excellent director, "French Hitchcock".
