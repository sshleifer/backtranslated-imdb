I just saw this movement for the fifth or sixth time and I'm still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate. <br /> <br /> I almost wrote a letter to Bonnie Hunt to tell her how much I love it. The duel scene of David Duchovny is so real! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite phrase is when Duchovny says "I miss Elizabeth but I long for Grace." Oh man! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are amazingly the perfect couple in the Chicago area !! I know them, I swear! I'm related to them, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> This movie is in my rotation three times a year! I would see him once a week, but I'm afraid I'd get used to it too! I always want it to be a special day when I see it !!
