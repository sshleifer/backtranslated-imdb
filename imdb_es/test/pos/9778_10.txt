This has to be one of the best productions in Australia. I totally disagree with the comments made by 'RamiNour101'. <br /> <br /> This series shows the depth of Australian fellowship and the efforts they made to help each other. Episode Five 'Eddies Birthday' is a great example of this and really captures the Australian spirit. <br /> <br /> The music used throughout the series only emphasized the situation men faced, their longing for home and their loved ones. The numerous and entertaining interpretations of The Road to Gundagai capture the spirit of men and the fact that they never forgot home, and that they were little elements like the song of a song that took them home for a short time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comment that is racist towards the Japanese, the only thing that can be said is that you can not change what happened. The Japanese treated the Australians very badly in Changi and represented it as otherwise it would be very deceptive. The comment about the accuracy of the script is also false. These six stories that are told in the series are composed of real experiences of P.O.W. <br /> <br /> The actors were excellent; The best being in my opinion, Matthew Newton. His performance as David in the first episode was heartbreaking. From being a city boy, to being another nameless face for his captors. We see him change dramatically in the first episode due to his violent attack in the jungle, and in more episodes we can see how that event has changed him, he is more aware of what is really happening and he is always one of the first to help the other members of The Secret Nine. <br /> <br /> Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance in 'Eddie's birthday' is amazing, going from the larrikin of the group to being sick, weak and unable to take care of themselves. The friendship shows in this episode touch him on an emotional level and he is proud to be Australian. <br /> <br /> I study World War II at the university level and have found this series, if not physically true, spiritually accurate, as it captures the true spirit of what it was like to be an Australian soldier. <br /> <br /> Well done to John Doyle for capturing the spirit of Changi.
