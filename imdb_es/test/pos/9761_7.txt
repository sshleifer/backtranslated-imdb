If you like the book, like me, stop watching the video after Jean and Joe meet in Australia. Until that moment it's a fairly faithful version of the book, and the images are great. 10 out of 10 until then and I have enjoyed it many times. After that, the story is seriously reorganized and revised in a way that really destroys the key part of the book, that is, how Jean creates a city like Alice (Springs). In the first part, the main change is to make Strachan a 40-year-old single instead of a seventy-year-old widower. This is something that distorts this love story, especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and greedy, like: in the book, he tells Joe on the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him. Australia, but in the video does not give Joe any clue about the whereabouts or intentions of Jean. The last hour of the 5-hour videos contracts and kills the last third of the book. I do not see any reason why they launched a fight between Joe and Jean: it's quite out of place and seems to be just an Australian dig at Pommies for telling them what to do. Then they bring Strachan for the wedding (instead of about three years later) - and ask him to read the toast !! Very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel as shown in the video. The entire wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. These abominations take time in the last hour, which was no longer enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how Jean recreates Willstown as a place where she and Joe can be happy.
