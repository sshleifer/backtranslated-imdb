God bless Joe D'Amato ... I love Italian horror, cheese (movie-wise;), science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> This, no doubt, was a little harder to watch, but Another funny BAD movie. <br /> <br /> I like how people comment on a negative review with "I usually enjoy bad movies, but ..." No buts, this was a bad movie FOR people who love bad movies. It's one of my best bad movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe was a Conan of poor men, but what fun! Who can not have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, a hang glider and a cheesy rubber monster? It's okay to hate this movie if you just like Hollywood movies like "Titanic" or "Pretty Woman," but if I really mean you LOVE bad movies, take a look. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beer bus or when you have a couple of friends and are looking for some nonsense fun. <br /> <br /> My rating 8/10.
