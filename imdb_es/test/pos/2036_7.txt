ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" is the story of a person who becomes a character famous, Just realize that living your dream is not the way you imagined it. We've seen all this before (in better films), but this human story captures the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. You get a recommendation for your visualization of the environment. The script, from the director of "Crazy / Beautiful" John Stockwell, portrays the hard universe with memorable images: it does not explain what it is about, it shows us. <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" originally titled "Metal God", stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris "Izzy" Cole, a Pittsburgh office salesman who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the hot singer from the heavy metal rock group, Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings for his own rock tribute group called Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on playing only those of Steel Dragon, and only in the exact way they interpret them. His group gets irritated by Chris's obsessions and gives him the boot. <br /> <br /> This devastated Chris, as well as his parents who support her and his faithful girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston from "Friends" of the TV). Then he receives a phone call. It's the steel dragon's band. They have seen the tapes of Chris and they want him to replace the recently fired singer. In an instant, Chris throws himself into the dizzying world of sudden stardom, from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it is not as rewarding as I expected. <br /> <br /> A true story inspired the concept of "Rock Star". A supply vendor from Ohio, Tim "Ripper" Owens, really replaced Rob Halford, the lead singer of Judas Priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. The rest of the movie is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. The film details the various tests of being a rock star. Explore aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of abuse and drug violence, difficult relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty and extreme measures by producers to please fans and maintain high popularity . <br /> <br /> I've seen all the Mark Wahlberg films, and this is the first one that has won my love. Wahlberg, a former singer / model, has made films such as "Fear", "Boogie Nights", "Three Kings" and, most recently, the new version of Tim Burton that lacks "Planet of the Apes". I am beginning to admire the young actor more and more. Although it has not been featured in many successful films, it has taken many opportunities and has played a variety of roles. "Rock Star" is his best movie to date. I can not think of many actors who could have played convincingly the struggles and aspirations of Chris Cole. Wahlberg really makes rock "Rock Star". <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston also illuminates the screen. She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that induces audience participation. It is tragic what happens with your relationship. We care a lot about these characters. <br /> <br /> During the film's concert scenes, director Stephen Herek (who also directed "Holy Man" and the live action version of "101 Dalmatians") creates an exciting atmosphere. Capture the scenes with an intense urgency and a raw and unmistakable energy. The musical numbers provide the film with the best scenes, more enveloping. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Herek can not keep up the energy and enthusiasm at all times. At the three-fourths mark, it loses the spark as the film becomes boring and unpleasant. I understand where the story should go to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it had before. In "Almost Famous", a much better movie about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life even in the saddest scenes. Here, it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion. <br /> <br /> The message arrives a little late and suddenly in the story. The film becomes a tale of morality that wants to give us a sad destiny. The filmmakers could also stop everything, appear on the screen and say: "Now hearing, the moral of the story is ??" We understand the subject, but it is too instantaneous. The personal discovery for Chris' must be gradual. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the movie, barely enough to completely destroy a total of eighty-five minutes in a reasonably good way. characteristic. "Rock Star" is not a great movie, see "Almost Famous" if you want an extraordinary movie about rock and roll, but for Marky Mark, it's a turning point in his career. <br /> <br />
