I expected this movie to stink, but I wanted to see it for myself, but I was surprised at how good this movie was. I know that longer films often do not work well at the box office, but the reason why they withdrew and did not allow the public to see them exceeds me. He kept my interest at all times and the landscape and photography are sometimes impressive. The plot was good and the work of morality was good. I liked the realism that was in the line of "No pardon". I had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it.
