10/10 <br /> <br /> PLAC DISCUSSION <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films that have been made and I do not say it because I'm being fooled by the seemingly pointless presentation. Those who do not like the film because they do not understand the story often criticize those who praise the film saying that they are assuming their genius because they do not understand it. I do not see this movie as very allegorical. For me, it is a story with a beginning, middle and end. People get confused with the film because they expect it to have a deep philosophical meaning that they must interpret from the supposedly meaningless scenes. I feel that they do not realize that the crypticity comes from a trimmed and reorganized plot combined with a very long and quite explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegories. Due to the limitation of duration, I will try to keep this short and to the point and I will touch on the main concepts. <br /> <br /> The general plot: Diane moves to L.A. after the jitterbug contest to enter the performance. At an audition, he meets Camilla, whom he falls in love with. Diane is infuriated with jealousy because Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) on a film and discovers the other woman (a random blonde) at Camilla's engagement party and the director. Motivated by her rage and possessiveness, Diane hires an assassin to kill Camilla. After that is done, she is overcome by loneliness and slips into a world of unconscious fantasy where she lives the life she wants. Diane wakes up then. In her conscious state, she is obsessed by what she has done. <br /> <br /> The meaning of fantasy: the film begins, after the credits, with a first person p.o.v. Shot representing someone collapsing in a bed and falling into unconsciousness. This is where Diane's fantasy begins. The accident is there as an excuse for her to "return" her dead girlfriend and justify fantasy life. She represents her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wanted him to be. Meanwhile, she acts as if everything were "like in the movies" because she has an escapist personality. She also, in a certain sense, kills herself and assumes the identity of a waitress named Betty in a restaurant. The story that revolves around the director is the direct result of her feeling that in a way she was a victim of the same reality as herself and she "convinced" herself that she was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control he felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in fantasy is actually the random blonde of the engagement party. He hated her so much that he made her Camilla and made her the ultimate antagonist. Then she took the real Camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive girlfriend out of the movies and used Rita Hayworth as inspiration. She also paints the hitman as a very clumsy person and unable to further justify Camilla's survival. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diane that ended up being herself and caused the world of dreams to die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio, who sang that "there is no band" and that the "instruments" you hear are not really there; This is a metaphor for fantasy. She begins to tremble violently because she shakes her perception of what surrounds her. The other reminder is the blue box ... Actually, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more than a Pandora box, actually), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds him of Camilla's real death because that's what the killer said when it was made. In addition to having love, all of this creation of his is an escape from reality by living in the idealized Hollywood that he expected to be part of when he arrived. <br /> <br /> This is a story that shows the psychology of a very worried woman who lost a dream. It is not a series of random things designed specifically to disturb and is not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate part of the human condition that presents itself beautifully. <br /> <br /> However, ultimately, this is all I think. It may be very far. Or it may not be meant to mean just one thing. There are many who do not agree with me. Cool! After all, why does it have to mean anything? Why can not it simply be a statement in itself? What happens if coherent and sensitive narratives are chains for artistic expression? Peter Greenaway, for example, has passed many words eloquently supporting this idea with statements such as "I would say that if you want to write stories, be an author, be a novelist, do not be a filmmaker, because I believe that the film Making is much more exciting in areas that do not have to do mainly with the narrative. " And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the film is not related to his art. "I did not understand!" So...? "Mulholland Dr.", history or not, affects viewers, harasses them, drags them, frightens them, numbs them. The way it lends itself to interpretation is incredible. It never ages. It never loses its shine. Your visuals are always effective and beautiful. It's cinematic perfection no matter what happens. Enjoy.
