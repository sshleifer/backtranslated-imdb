It is a mystery to me why I have not achieved this masterful film of the 50s Caper. I went back to thinking about noir until now, but I'm happy to report that I was not disappointed. I have not seen any of Jules Dassin's American films for several years, but based on this I will probably go back and watch "Brute Force" and "Night and the City" very soon. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais, a name unknown to me but a rather familiar face in his tired and cold world, has recently completed a long stay in prison and as is in these movies (hey, otherwise there would be a story) He is not dealing well with the righteous life. An opportunity presents itself: a simple multi-million dollar jewelry theft that can be performed at night without fear of being discovered by a few men. The tense filming of the theft, half an hour of total silence, is what most people remember about the movie, of course, and in fact it is quite remarkable; but I liked the location halfway through the final shooting, once the robbery had soured thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves; the excellent image of the sandy sides of Paris in black and white; and the channeling of Servais from both Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart in their scant but brutal performance. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a bit too sentimental at the end, but this is one of those classics that really meets your expectations. reputation as pure entertainment, even if what he has to say about the human condition is not exactly profound or stimulating; The result of George Auric in modernist, romantic and striking scores is another highlight.
