Ok, everyone agreed on what was the best season. First. And killing Boone was a bad decision. Also killing others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad guys BUT. I still think that this is the best science fiction series! Sorry guys, I can not help it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. Still, it's easy to accept Liam as the new main character, if you get past Boone. He is really ... mysterious. What surprised me the most was when Lilli was taken out of the story and how. That was something she did not deserve! And what do we get? A blonde named Renee, without any character! But these Taelons are still mysterious, and you wonder about your true plans until the end. True suspension. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant. <br /> <br /> I understand that when you enter an episode of the 3rd, 4th or 5th season, you may not understand this program. But when you look from the beginning, you just can not escape! <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, the special special effects are wonderful, the music is beautiful and the plot is intriguing. I have to see this, guys!
