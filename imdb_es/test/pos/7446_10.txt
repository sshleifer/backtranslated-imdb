Plaza really landed this one. They did not try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on fans of Final Fantasy 7. And boy, are they going to be happy fans when they see this movie? The story may not be as interesting or credible, but it is perfectly related to the story of the game and has several fun moments from honest to god. A total surprise there and a welcome too <br /> <br /> There are many cameos and fun references to the game as well. And most important of all: the fight scenes are so hard that they could go through the diamond! They are really the total wonder and would have made the movie worthwhile even if everything else stunk. I mean, they are some of the best PERIODS ever created. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Goodbye. <br /> <br /> PS: I know my criticism sounds like a teenage girl's fuss. It was, like, totally what he intended.
