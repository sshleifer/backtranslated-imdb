I myself am a student of physics, and I must say that I think this is one of the best "popular" introductions to string theory that exists. The Elegant Universe achieves that the whole subject of string theory (although it is actually M) is accessible to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Some "popular science" programs believe that the best approach is simply to throw the audience to the deep end, throwing them a technical jargon without an explanation, and presenting the theory in a boring, rancid style. . This program goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the problems that must be solved between the two so that we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe both on a large scale and on a small scale. <br /> <br /> I guess some might say it's slow and it takes too long to get to interesting things like extra dimensions and wormholes, but the thing is: that's not right. Explaining string theory from the beginning is almost impossible without mentioning at least the physics at its base, and the way it is explained in The Elegant Universe is clear and entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you will like this program really Depends on whether you are willing to be stunned at first by some of the ideas presented by Greene: the additional dimensions and the distortion of space-time are not exactly prevalent in life everyday, right? But, if you persevere with some of the most exotic concepts of this program, you will discover that it will give you an idea of ​​the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you're studying physics, well, it's great entertainment and you can follow it and appreciate it even more!
