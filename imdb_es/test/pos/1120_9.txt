One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and I'm glad to have a great movie like this to remind me why it was so wonderful. Look at it with your children (or your horse). <br /> <br /> The story of an old horse trainer with hard boots with children, and his bad luck. If you have ever had or appreciated horse racing, you will appreciate the history of rags to the rich. It may be a bit below "Seabiscuit", but not much. The story is the same, except that it is the quarter horse version. Well acted, correcting terms and racing equipment, and nice racing scenes Do not take my word, get it and decide for yourself.
