I have been a big fan of Errol Morris since I saw Thin Blue Line and I heard that he saved a life. To date, this movie is his best work. <br /> <br /> The plot is a mixture of the Book of Stephen Hawking of the same title intertwined with the life of man. The story is told through interviews with family, friends and Hawkings himself. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled; It sounds totally boring but the whole package is dynamic and stimulating. The mix of life and theories is perfectly and completely entertaining. I was particularly touched by how well they humanize this genius and the omniscient man. Although physically impotent, Hawking's greatness and shear sheen are encapsulated in a real living human being from whom we can laugh and wake up at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. Look at it and enjoy it. And if the studio that owns this image reads this, a 15-year anniversary edition would be perfect NOW ...
