One of the other reviewers mentioned that after watching only the 1 Oz episode he will be hooked. They are right, since this is exactly what happened to me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about Oz was his brutality and the scenes of unbreakable violence that came from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint of heart or timid. This show does not shoot with respect to drugs, sex or violence. It is unconditional, in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br /> It is called OZ since it is the nickname that is given to the Penitentiary of the Oswald Maximum Security State. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and look inwards, so privacy does not occupy a high priority in the agenda. Em City is home to many ... Aryans, Muslims, Gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more ... so fights, death glares, deals and shady deals are never far away. <br /> <br /> I would say that the main attraction of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows would not dare. Forget beautiful pictures painted for the general public, forget the charm, forget the romance ... OZ does not get involved. The first episode I saw never seemed so unpleasant to me that I was surreal, I could not say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz and got used to the high levels of graphic violence. Not only violence, but injustice (crooked guards that will sell for a penny, inmates who will kill in order and get away with it, educated, middle class inmates who will become bitches of prison due to their lack of street skills or experience in prison) Observing Oz, you can feel comfortable with what is uncomfortable to see ... that is if you can get in touch with your darkest side.
