This was a random rental in the video store. But it impressed me from the beginning. The wooden camera is a jewel of a second characteristic of an attractive director. The film captures deeply insightful and often frustrating and complicated social interactions that young interracial friends would experience in a modern post-apartheid South Africa. The young actors are quite good and are well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in images that provide a frame-by-frame study of deeper understanding and realization without falling into stereotypes and iconic clich√©s. The musical score of the film adds body to the film without being annoying. After watching it for the second time, I located the DVD on Amazon and I have been happy ever since.
