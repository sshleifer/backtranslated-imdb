Beautiful, emotional and subtle. I see this movie in an art center with a smaller screen in a movie theater with 95% of the elderly. I want a bigger cinema like Lowes around here to show it. Great cinematography of Wong and Christopher Doyle. As I understand Cantonese, it is much easier for me to understand the film. As simple as the story goes, many English-speaking spectators did not understand the whole story. Three old women next to me are still talking and have no clues about the movie. <br /> <br /> Spoiler; They were surprised when I mentioned that Mr. Chow had slept with Mrs. Chen and that they have a son. She went to Singapore trying to tell him, but she did not. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> The Mandarin translation of the movie title actually means a flowery moment or memory. The phrase that is usually used to describe a beautiful and wonderful memory that was brief and of short duration. The whole movie fits the title quite a bit. Not to mention the flowery "Cheung Sam". <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was definitely the corner of the street in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shines on the old and discolored wall, at night in the darkness, in the rain, a truly poetic moment. I felt a great sense of intimacy about their relationship when I saw them standing against the wall and talking in low voices. I felt terrible anguish when Mr. Chow was rehearsing his moment of departure, and Ms. Chen cried on her shoulder ... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! <br /> <br /> As much as I like it, Chungking Express still my favorite However, I will give this one a 10 too. As a point of reference, CTHD only got 7. <br /> <br /> If you like art, you will love this movie. Do not miss it
