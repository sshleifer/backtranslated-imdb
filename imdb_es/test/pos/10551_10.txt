This is one of my favorite movies NEVER ... I've seen it around a million times and would never reject the opportunity to see it again. In fact, I love it so much that I REALLY wanted to see the place where it was filmed on my next vacation ... Does anyone know the name? If so, please send me an email !!! I saw this movie for the first time when it first premiered, I was almost Nikki's age and for a long time I asked my dad to take me somewhere because, of course, I expected the same thing to happen to me! It's an incredible scenario and a love story of puppies so cute. This is a definitive DVD collection disc!
