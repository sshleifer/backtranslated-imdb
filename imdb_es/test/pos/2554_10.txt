Chop Shop is a treasure hidden in theaters! I can not begin to describe how wonderful the performances in this film are. This movie is for anyone who wants to see a powerful story and see an example of how contemporary films should look and look like. <br /> <br /> This film is about a child, Alejandro "Ale" who works and lives. with his teenage sister, Isamar "Izzie" in a small loft of a room in a car shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (which I did not even know existed, Willits Points), where there are countless junkyards and body shops. Here, Bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children who hope to sustain themselves by buying and fixing a food truck. <br /> <br /> Ale earns money by helping out at the auto shop, and Izzie helps out in a food truck; Both, however, earn extra money on the side. Ale sells pirated movies and stolen car parts; Izzie sells herself. Their lives are surrounded by guts and mournful, but although both testify, live and barely survive in their harsh world, their love for others is never marred by the filth that surrounds them. And from time to time they can laugh and enjoy the moments of their childhood that are being robbed of the reality of struggling to survive and stay together. <br /> <br /> The best comparison I have for Chop Shop is Bahrani's juxtaposition of an innocent love between family members against such a gloomy atmosphere is as powerful as Pasolini's Mama Roma combined with the struggles to grow too fast in an adverse environment like in Bresson's Mouchette. <br /> <br /> Having written, directed and edited both this film and his first film, Man Push Cart (which won awards worldwide), Bahrani is a full-packaged filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that your films are not hidden treasures for long!
