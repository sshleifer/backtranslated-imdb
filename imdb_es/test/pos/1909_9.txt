Dolemite is awesome. Rudy Ray Moore's kung fu pyramid with horrific choreographed action sequences is the closest you can get to becoming a parody of a genre without really being a parody. Citizen Kane this may not be Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly a genius in its own right. The production values ​​in this movie are so bad that they could qualify as existential special effects. The plot creeps a bit in the middle, but the power of a premise as cheap as the kung fu prostitutes is enough to make everyone, except enthusiastic movie lovers, ignore it. The infamous boom mike always present evokes the nuances of the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never grows without grace. Sometimes I wonder if the mike boom was purposely left as a comment on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general, but I am generally distracted by erotic scenes that lack eroticism to the point of high artistic worldliness. Everything is this film is alive and breathing, full of desperate longing to be loved and vilified simultaneously. Works. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
