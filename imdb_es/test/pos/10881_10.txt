Definitely the best game for N64 ever. What I say most is that I was very disappointed with tomorrow, never dies, but the world is not promising enough to be better than Goldeneye (according to the website). I love Goldeneye so much that I find something to do every time I play it. I've even done my own missions for the levels. The multiplayer is the best of all the games, and the graphics are amazing even now. The first day I received this, I remember that I wanted them to come back and turn all the bond movies into games. Can you imagine driving that live speed boat and letting it die and doing those incredible jumps, or fighting ninjas or fighting with the jaws of the spy who loved me and the Moonraker? (I think that fighting him in those games would be more fun than in the Aztecs). What about chasing Sanchez on the gas trucks or taking away St. Cerils just for you? Oh, well, let me go back to the game in question. All levels are unique and create very funny killing environments. There are many places to hide, so you can make fun of people (especially in the park of the statues). This game is not worth renting, what you really need to buy it today.
