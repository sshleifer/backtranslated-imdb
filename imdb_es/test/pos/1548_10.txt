Ken Loach showed the world the negative side of Swinging London with "Poor Cow", about the London woman Joy (Carol White) who hooks up with a thief and has a child with him, only to see the man end up in the slammer. that his friend (Terence Stamp) manages to help her, he proves to be a little better at what a loser is. It is clear to Joy that she will soon have to make a serious decision about where she is going in her life. <br /> <br /> One thing I determined: I do not know if this is correct or not. It was a use of irony in the movie. Her name is Alegr√≠a, but she does not experience joy in her life. Even if that was not thought, it's still a movie that I recommend to everyone. With songs by Donovan (one of which, "Colors", appeared in another Terence Stamp movie: "The Limey" (which, incidentally, came out in 1999, when I was as old as my parents when "Poor Cow" came out) ).
