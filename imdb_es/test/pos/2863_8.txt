My taste for movies continues to surprise me and probably infuriates the readers of my reviews, but each of them has its weaknesses and I have a weak point for the crazy horror, the slasher movies and See No Evil is exactly that and much more. I think the biggest mistake made by the producers and filmmakers of this film is that they promote it as a WWE movie and "starring" KANE. WWE may have a lot of followers, but it's a very, very specific group that follows the kind of incredibly cheesy "sport" and (sorry people) and those who do not love it. HAATTTE IT !! It would make them move away from a typical slasher sangria movie that people would come out in droves to see. See No Evil does not break ANY new horror camp, it's exactly game by game typical of horror with some horrible bloody scenes that make your screen drag. They really take him home and go for the gratuitous violence just for cause. There is no psychological aspect exactly, although being persecuted by this monster has some elements of fear. <br /> <br /> KANE (the wrestler), also known as Glen Jacobs, plays religiously and physically tortured man Jacob Goodnight. It's the last cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. He is not an original murderer and even his murders are not the only or original, with the great exception that the death of a girl drowns by forcing her to swallow her cell phone ... yes! He does a good job and man is legitimately huge! It has a height of 7 feet and without any special effect it is monstrous! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachael Taylor play in the typical group of adolescents "thinkers who are invincible" who will reluctantly fall victim to the serial killer. The story is that in exchange for a month of their prison sentence for minor offenses ranging from theft to possession of drugs, they are sent to an old hotel to do a "community service" to fix it. It turns out that a serial killer lives above and is removing the eyes of his victims to cleanse them of their sins. Luke Pegler stands out as a bag of scum that eventually becomes a kind of hero, even saving his former girlfriend who used to hit. The rest of them play their perspective roles quite well, but it is not a great acting ability. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the porn director ... yes PORN ... Gregory Dark, does a good job putting Together the modern day slasher movie. He even gets a little involved in the story with the murderer and, although his background story is not unique either, in fact it is a little stale, it is still interesting enough. And in the few shots in which the viewer is seeing through the murderer's eyes, it is interesting to hear the voices and see the distorted things as he does. He throws the obligatory soft shot to the soft core, and the grotesque and blood-soaked scenes and makes everything become a category. It fits very well and for a horror fanatic like I am entertaining. Kane's serial killer is horrifying and attacks them with brutal intelligence and silent horror. The film is being criticized and it's not anyone's fault because it's pretty bad, but is not that the point? It's a horror movie and I thought it was exactly what it should be. It made me jump, it made me tremble, it even made me reject in several parts ... impressive for all standards. It's entertaining, with a decent story, and a lot of configuration to serialize See No Evil until the 15th installment if they wanted and I say bring it. It is true that the film is full of holes of plot, details of laughter, but the deadly gore and the horror on everything mounts everything. Does it all come down to making you love horror movies? I really love them ?? If so, then you will think that this is an excellent slasher ... If not ... you will hate it ... plain and simple. 8.5 / 10
