I really do not know when the television stations started to prefer having handsome men as their reporters, regardless of the intellectual coefficients of the men, but clearly it was a problem when Broadcast News came out, and the movie did. A very good job looking at it. When portraying a love triangle between small-boy guitarist Tom Grunick (William Hurt), intelligent but nervous reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the film does not shoot. Probably the best line in the movie is when Tom says something like: "I really do not understand anything that I'm reporting." And in the era of FOX News and those things, a movie like this one becomes even more important. <br /> <br /> In short, definitely a movie that I recommend. Also starring Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson in a supporting role as the presenter.
