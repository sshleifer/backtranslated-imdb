Although the plot of this film is a bit exaggerated, it is worth watching only for the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon. The latter offers a truly wonderful Dublin accent. Caine adores him ... which is exactly what the character he plays must do. Entertaining and fun, this is an hour and a half easy observation.
