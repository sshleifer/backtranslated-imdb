Background information: the films Octopussy and Never Say Never Again were made the same year, 1983, so, of course, people compare them. Moore vs Connery. Bond vs. Bond. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people who claim that the "official movie" Octopussy is far superior. Well, I just saw Octopussy. Bond is riding a plane at 100 miles per hour (impossible --- the wind would blow it), using his feet to force the plane to land, and then jumping at about 60 miles per hour (again impossible --- try jumping from your car (you would end up with a shattered body.) How is that octopus scene supposed to be "good" in any sense of the word? Suddenly, Bond has a superhuman strength and a titanium body, and he does all these tricks at the age of 56? Full shit, Incredible, Farse. <br /> <br /> ---> Now let's contrast the previous scene with "unofficial" from Connery Never say never: it does not have the same brightness because of its independent movie status (less money), but at least you can believe that Connery is a real spy in real danger. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Bond showing his age (after all, he's 50 years) and is expelled for recovery, completely credible, but, of course, there is no " day off "for a world-famous spy, and Bond quickly finds himself on target, even inside the hospital. From that moment on, the story becomes another adventure, with Bond trying to track down his assassination attempts and, ultimately, thwarting an attempt to steal nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> As usual, Sean Connery did a brilliant job, and avoids the end. -The best acrobatics. This film feels like a natural successor to Connery's latest film, Diamonds are Forever 1971 ... the old Bond style ... before the franchise went silly. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
