I rented the video for a slow Saturday night. The first time I saw it I thought it was fun. It took a while to get used to the American cartoons (here we are more in tune with the grotesque British) but very nice. <br /> <br /> I saw it again the next night and it really warmed me up. The characters seemed more human - friendly, even. A movie that can be seen several times and get more out of it every time. However, my wife * hated * it. Without taking into account the tastes in the mood, I suppose.
