I really enjoyed this movie ... and I see it from time to time. I have used it in my music classes at the school where I teach. Children seem to enjoy it, although they want it to be in color. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is that for me, who grew up after Heifetz died, is the opportunity to really see the Master Fiddler works his craft! I was surprised at how "updated" the story is. Although, references to "school reform" are outdated. A boy, whose father had died, and is being raised by his mother and stepfather ... most of our children today are raised by their stepfathers, although the film seems that most stepfathers are cruel. I get very angry when his mother does not stand on his side and defends his actions against the stepfather. <br /> <br /> In addition, musical selections are hard to believe. I find it incredible that a girl, who seems to be around 8 years old, can play the "Minute Waltz", or that a 13-year-old girl can sing an aria from Rigoletto. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's a very funny movie, to feel good and I recommend it. I would like it to come out on DVD.
