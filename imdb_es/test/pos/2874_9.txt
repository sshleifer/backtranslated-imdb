See No Evil is the first movie in WWE movies. Yes, WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, professional wrestling. Of course, since it's a WWE movie, a fighter has to star in it, the fighter is Glenn Jacobs, aka Kane. Which is not really important, because if you did not know Kane or what WWE meant, you would never know that it has anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, since the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is gross out horror movie, it has some moments where some people can jump, but for the most part it's just saying, look how rude we can get! It's not that there's anything wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is a kind of character type Jason, his mother tortured him when he was a child with strict Christian beliefs (underestimation) and has deformed his mind. Now he is a very scary killing machine. 90% of the film takes place in an abandoned hotel where Jacob stalks six teenagers (surprised?) And a handful of adults. It could explain why they're in an old, spooky hotel, but hey, who cares? Despite its lack of originality, See No Evil is well done, for what it is supposed to be. Kane plays an incredible killer and needs little makeup to be scary. One of the flaws in the film is the most annoying possibility that people survive, I really want to be killed horribly, but, unfortunately, it's not like that. I wish the film did not have the stigma of wrestling, but as I said that the movie has nothing to do with wrestling, people still have their minds closed enough to not want to see it, given that, of course, if They are a free fight. Hate On the other hand, the movie can also earn money because Wrestling fans will want to see it. Either way, See No Evil has first class effects and little CGI, and as I said, it's pretty brutal, just like I say it's a good thing ... if you like that kind of thing.
