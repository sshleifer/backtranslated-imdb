It is not often that a television series catches me immediately; A recent opportunity to download the pilot for Surface had me stuck to my seat throughout the episode, after which I began a feverish search to learn everything I could about this wonderful series. To my dismay, I discovered that it had been canceled after only 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. It is a pity. <br /> <br /> Since then, I've acquired the remaining episodes and the first 5 or 6 are among the best television shows I've seen in my life. Simply fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, I LOVED how they ended each episode with a great ending. I imagine that seeing him every week would have been screaming with tension and simply captivated, desperately waiting for the next episode to come out. As I was growing up, I always heard that this was how the first series movies used to be, that ended with a huge jockstrap for the crowd to return to the theater for the next episode. <br /> <br /> Well, it seems that for some reason or other, the suits decided to end this, and apparently the people behind the show must have seen the writing on the wall, because after episode 6 things definitely get worse . I would not say that the episodes really turn BORED, but a lot of the elements of the plot get a bit more clich√©, and I have to say that the final episode really left me feeling cheated. I just wish the creators of the program had a fair chance. The * ONLY * other show that made me feel this way was the first season of Stargate SG-1, which simply resonated tremendously, feeling very "true", moving and made from the heart. Surface was a great series, and maybe one day, a lover of the moneyed television will see all the excitement of the cancellation of the program and will bring back this program. One can wait, at least. :)
