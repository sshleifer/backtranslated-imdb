There is really no way to compare this movie with any other movie, because nobody has done something like that and nobody will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At a minimum, it deserves to be seen with a great sound system. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie the day it opened in 1968, my last year in high school. I went because I like science fiction and I wanted to see a "space" movie. Remember that this movie was made before the landing of the first moon. <br /> <br /> There we sat, waiting for it to begin. But, SURPRISE! There were no cartoons, no upcoming attractions. The owner of the theater at the Cooper Theater, for some reason, chose to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the lights on, so we all stood up, never did it in a movie before or after and then we sat down again when finished. Then the theater turned completely DARK and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible. <br /> <br /> The overture ended and my seat began to VIBRATE when the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first depth. serious notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed to hear "Also Sprach Zarathustra" for the first time in my life. The trip had just begun. <br /> <br /> (I recommend that you see this opening, this movie, in a dark room with your subwoofer up as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that cinema). Of course, it took us quite a while to get to outer space and the movie that followed was nothing more than a science fiction movie. The INTERMISSION arrived (something good, very underestimated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in amazement, we ran out of breath, and then the trip resumed, wilder than before. <br /> <br /> Vi. It is 7 times more in the next year, always in a real theater of full size, as all the theaters were before the multiplexes. I could have been "high" once, but I did not go to see it again and again because I was "stumbling". I went because I knew I was watching a work of art. It was so damn beautiful; the sound you could feel in your bones followed by a terrifying silence; The unimaginable and unimaginable views; Affection for HAL becomes terror. And, of course, WTF was Kubrick really trying to communicate with me? Years and years and many more viewings later, I also understand it, I think, as I always will. Read the comments of someone else, if you are looking for someone to explain it or search the web, you will find "explanations", it is not my purpose to write these comments. <br /> <br /> What I hope What you should do is encourage you to see it with patience, enjoy its beauty in the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know (p. eg, Gayne Ballet Suite or Blue Danube); taste it as if it were a wonderful meal, take it as a good wine; Look and listen to the clues and the hidden symbols that ARE there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTS TO SHARE some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where. a human, he came and where you go. <br /> <br /> If that's too much work for your brain, and you can not see and hear and reflect on the beauty and mystery of the Kubrick film, then, forgive my frankness, but your life is as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith monkey. If you want to escape without thinking, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries and sensuality and you can have an open mind, this movie will add something to your life.
