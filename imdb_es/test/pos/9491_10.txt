I bought my first Zep album in 1974 (at 17) and have been hooked ever since. This DVD has now occupied a prominent place in my music collection. It is not often that a band can boast of 4 virtuosos in their lineup, but here we can. Each member made their own contribution to the band, but on stage together, the electricity they generated was greater than the 4 people. This masterpiece covers the entire career of the band, from Led Zep 1 to Coda, and this is captured magnificently on this DVD as each concert shows how the band got bigger and bigger over the years. Recently, my copy disappeared, but I'm happy to say it was found in my 17-year-old son's room when the new generation discovers how great these guys were. This is a must for anyone who has an appreciation of rock music. Long live Led Zeppelin.
