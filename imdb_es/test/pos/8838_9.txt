Ironically, what makes John Carpenter's "The Thing" such an entertaining science fiction movie are its elements of mystery, suspense, and plot structure that defy the genre.

Today, we simply push the switch and put our minds on "pause". Is "The Thing" a "good" movie?

In later views, one begins to notice a remarkable lack of depth in the performance, but the tense story is still convincing. Of course, "Citizen Kane" is not, but again, science fiction was never a genre for thinking men ...
