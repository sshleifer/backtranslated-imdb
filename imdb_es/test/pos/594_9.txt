A lot of long films have been made with the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, but "The Muppet Movie" was the first of all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also has "The Great Muppet Caper" "and" The Muppets take Manhattan. " It was released seven years before I was born, so obviously I could not see it at that time (nor could I see his two successors when they first launched). However, I saw many Muppets during my childhood, mainly after the premature death of Henson in 1990. Finally, I was able to see this movie for the first time in the mid-nineties, after listening to the soundtrack. As expected, I liked it at that time, and revisiting it in recent years has not been exactly disappointing. <br /> <br /> One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing "Rainbow Connection", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes in a boat and encourages him to pursue a career in Tinseltown . Kermit follows his advice and goes west. Soon he meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to accompany him. Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog-leg restaurant chain that wants Kermit to be his pet, also notices the frog. Like a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie. On their journey through the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's loving interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, while everyone tries to get to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become the mascot of his restaurant chain, so Kermit is in ever-increasing danger! <br /> <br /> One thing that many people praise this movie for is the songs, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated "Rainbow Connection" at the beginning, and more melodies follow, such as the catchy song by Kermit and Fozzie, "Movin 'Right Along" and "I'm going back there." Someday ", a touching ballad sung by Gonzo" Never Before, Never Again ", the song that Miss Piggy sings when she sees Kermit for the first time, is the only one that she would consider quite weak, and her romance seems very sudden. In this film they are generally adorable, just like they do on television, and some of them provide a lot of humor, including Fozzie, who makes his first appearance in the film desperately trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up And, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them.Some of the live actors that appear briefly in the film can also be fun, like Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin As the "Insolent Waiter." Also, it's not 100% comedy.There are serious parts of the movie that went well too. <br /> <br /> Seeing this original Muppet movie again this year was the first time I've seen them since I saw "Muppets from Space" (one of Muppet's films made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I felt very disappointed when I saw that movie, which had never happened before when I saw a movie or a television show with popular puppet characters. Not only that movie is not very funny, but I also think it's a bit too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I said in my review! However, I can not say that I believe the same of any of the predecessors of that film, including this, released twenty years earlier. "The movie Muppet" seems to be the most popular of the group, and since it has a lot to like, not only for children, it is understandable. I doubt there is much left to say about "The Muppet Movie" that has not been said at some point in the last thirty years, but today is still a good family entertainment.
