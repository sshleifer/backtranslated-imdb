The Merchant of Four Seasons is not what I would call a happy movie, not even one that impressed me to the point of praising it to heaven (there are other Fassbinder films for that, like Veronika Voss and the underestimated Satan.) Brewing. But it is certainly no less than a fascinating experiment to take a look at those in a society that you, me and other people we know possibly know or do not want to know. I imagine that in the early 70's in Germany, a generation that left the Second World War had a stigma to live with, but did everything possible to survive. This is a stigma that floats throughout this film, and in many cases in the work of Fassbinder in general, but especially because with Four Seasons it is fixed in the middle class and in a married couple in particular: the distant, depressed, Angry Hans The fruit seller and his long-suffering wife, that's nothing less than trying realism under the pretext of melodrama. If Cassavetes were a crazy German, he could make this movie, maybe even as a joke. <br /> <br /> The story seems rather simple, where Hans's drink gets out of control, hits his wife (this scene is one of the most difficult to take, maybe in any movie, by the way that Fassbinder's camera remains uncut since his wife is helpless and her daughter tries to stop him in her frenzy) and then she's ready to leave him. While he stands in the room, his family holds him back, she calls for a divorce and he suffers a heart attack right there. She recovers, her business begins to grow suddenly again with the help of some good (or not so good) employees, and yet this only continues with her longing for another woman and her general despair. <br /> <br /> And yet, it is in this simplicity that Fassbinder tries, and succeeds for the most part, in achieving a feeling of fear, of a tense environment in the kitchen or in the bedroom or on the street that you can cut with a knife and bleed. The weakest part of all this can be acting ... at least that was my initial impression. Hans, played by Hirschmuller, can be a forced presence, with only the slightest movements in the face and eyes, and for a time he does not seem to be a good actor. The actress who plays her wife, Irm Hermann, and her sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla) fare better, but only because they have more things to do conventionally, like crying or looking worried. It takes some time to adapt to what is, essentially, a vacuum in its Hans type, of something of its own psychological torment or self-pity that permeates itself and those around it who just want to move forward with some sense of normality . , especially once Hans succeeds. <br /> <br /> Not everything fits into The Merchant of Four Seasons, but it is enough to make me recommend it to those who are looking for a different life segment than you could use. With more modern American movies. The world of Fassbinder here is a battle between the melodrama he loves in cinema and the harsh and overwhelming sense of humanism that he personally feels and puts in characters with whom, for better or for worse, we identify. Are the Epps a family you know? Or could you even be them? Who will tell? It is a methodical study of the tragic emptiness in the human spirit, and all its objectives are achieved.
