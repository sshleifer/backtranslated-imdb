As an adventure mini-series, this is the best you can get. I saw it when it was originally shown on HBO. Sigrid is totally credible in her role as Philadelphia, and the whole production was excellent! See all 400 minutes of it if you can. I highly recommend this miniseries. It is incredible that I can not officially qualify it, but for you, readers / users, I will let you know that it is a solid 10.
