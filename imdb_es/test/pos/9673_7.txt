I own all the seasons of family pilots so far and I have to say Vol. 6 has been the biggest disappointment of all of them. There are still many laughs that can be found here, but I think Vol. 6 like the last few volumes, is slowly providing less and less laughter. At least for me. <br /> <br /> The biggest annoyance I had with the vol. 6 is that it seems to be very heavy in left politics. I'm a big believer that if you can laugh at other people, you should be able to laugh at yourself, but this Volume REALLY seems to push your political views in your throat and I think that is a far cry from the show. Insinuated, all the conservative states are horrible places, implying that we need more gun control, the insinuated school is poorly funded, the insinuated religious people are crazy, Bush is a friend of the devil. I could continue and this is just the first three episodes. br /> <br /> Sure some of that was fun, but it becomes a point where you're not doing a comedy and you're really just pushing your political views on other people.
