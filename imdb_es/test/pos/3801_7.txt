(Some spoilers included :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators have called this film surreal, the term does not fit well here. To quote from the Encyclopedia Britannica, surreal means: <br /> <br /> "Fantastic or incongruous images": One does not have to explain to the lack of imagination how many ways a brave ten year old boy in general and look for his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: the curious can read James Kincaid; but if I asked that boy how he was incongruous at the wheel of a sports car, he would surely protest: "There is NO way!" The fantasies and incongruities that the film offers appear mainly in the first fifteen minutes. From then on, we will obtain more iterations of the same, in an increasingly crude and squalid progression that, far from being incongruous, soon becomes predictable. On the other hand, it is not literally credible, but it was unfair to tax Motorama in particular with this failure, since any plausible suspension of disbelief has fallen precipitously into the scale of values ​​typical of the filmmaker and the viewer since then "Raiders of the Lost Ark "became a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> "Hallucinatory": How do we know what a hallucination is if part of having one is not knowing what we are having? In any case, some people know that they enjoy "hallucinogenic drugs", but if Motorama typifies the result of doing so, then I do not know why someone would take them more than once. There is, of course, the occasional bad trip. The movie should be one of those, play on words and everything. <br /> <br /> "Juxtaposition of words that was surprising": How many times can a ten year old child startle you by saying "Oh, my God!" when he likes something, or "Damn it!" when he's not These two interjections are on par with the course with this script. Unfortunately, any sense of the surreal in what goes through the dialogue could only reveal, in direct proportion, one's naiveté with respect to the speech patterns of the rising American generation. <br /> <br /> "A world completely defined and meticulously described, but which has no rational meaning:" The world of Motorama does not really make sense, but is as completely defined as a caricature in a newspaper of a school primary. The numerous guest stars in the cast have even less intelligent cameo roles than our little hero who exclaims "Damn!" in the blink of an eye, but it takes several seconds to invent the most useless lie. And even * his * character, despite appearing in almost every scene, has no significant development. Here is a small reward for any spectator who sympathizes, as I should, enough to want to know him better and understand "where he comes from". One vaguely perceives a much better story and a protagonist struggling to get out. <br /> <br /> "Fully recognizable and realistic images are removed from their normal contexts and reassembled within an ambiguous, paradoxical or impacting framework". No, we see a succession of stereotyped billboards and increasingly in disrepair, service stations, fat restaurants, cheap hotels and their lifestyle along the roads of the country, exactly where they belong stereotypically. <br /> <br /> "Largely responsible To perpetuate ... the traditional emphasis on content". There is little content, moment by moment, in Motorama. <br /> <br /> In short: imagine British millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates on their way to an elegant costume party, sitting serene and dumb as cautiously cautious. he advanced his Rolls-Royce like frail skeletons through a sea of ​​desperate humanity, Chinese who implored them through the windows and stained the glass with blood. Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques, limousines like the ones on top now rusted and white pianos clinked by ghosts. In this detritus they walk an exhausted child and a sick woman who clings like a mother figure who becomes a bride, who falls asleep side by side on the grass. He awakes, on the feast of the Transfiguration, "white and bright" on 1945, by a bright flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. Upon discovering that her consort has become a corpse, she first believes that she has witnessed her soul rising to heaven. Later, he explains just a little less innocently: 'I learned a new word today: atomic bomb. It is as if God took a photograph. Now, * there are * only two samples of film surrealism, surrealism whose ironies extend enough to invade the title of his film: Empire of the Sun. If you are looking for surrealism, * please * do not miss it. No matter how much you step on the accelerator to run your car through and beyond the desert, there are no scenes so exquisitely strange, rich, subtle or beautiful that you wait for the poor Gus de Motorama in your search. <br /> <br /> None of the above necessarily constitutes a thumbs down in this movie. Although somewhat disappointed, I can not rule it out, given the respectability of another genre that exemplifies: one, incidentally, influenced by surrealism, but also by the expressionism, existentialism and pessimism of Franz Kafka amid structures of power omnipotent Let's try the size: Theater of the Absurd. <br /> <br /> Moving on to EB's article on this style, I'm surprised how, to the extent that Theater of the Absurd is a valid artistic style, the Above objections to Motorama disappear like a cloud of smoke . I am tempted to quote the entire text as a support for identification. <br /> <br /> The Theater of the Absurd tries to show "that the human situation is essentially absurd, without purpose ... humanity feels desperate, bewildered and anxious": Having instantly achieved its purpose of moving away from a life depressing family among parents who fight, Gus is senseless until he passes a bright sign that reads "Motorama" and decides to win the lottery that promises. As others have already revealed, this ambition is illusory: although the game "never expires," the sponsoring corporation does not intend for anyone to win, and has ways to cheat, confuse and let any candidate get the reward. He, like others, is finally disappointed with his dream. <br /> <br /> "The absurd dramatists, therefore, eliminated most of the logical structure of traditional theater.There is little dramatic action as conventionally understood, however, frantically the characters act, their activity serves to underline the fact that nothing happens to change their existence ... a circular and timeless quality emerges. " "The language in an absurd work is full of ... repetitions ... repeating the obvious until it sounds silly." Underneath a "dazzling comic surface" sometimes, we find "an underlying message of metaphysical anguish". The obsession of Gus with a silly game, his insane language, the device of the plot in which he divines a bleak future and / or returns to a previous moment and takes a different but still somber turn ... so much fits now. While an admirer of the surreal would do better with some films, anyway, of Spielberg, the fans of Motorama as it is should actually find fellow travelers, not in place of addition, in the works of Beckett, Ionesco and Genet. br /> <br /> But one can not stop here. After his disappointment with the game, Gus returns to "Phil" (ie, to Love), the first assistant he had known and the only person who had treated him decently, although he had also scolded him: at a service station that It announced "Be full full." Under Phil's tutelage, he learns a waiting life of cars. We could point out here that the absurd dramatist Beckett had entitled his most famous work "Waiting for Godot", and that for Godot we should read "God". God is also one of Fil's concerns. In addition, as an indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus, Phil is severely maimed and advances in a cast with arms extended horizontally. In the last scene, Gus, now Phil's protege, says he wants to listen to music. We do not hear anything, but we see Phil moving his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm, signaling Gus to come closer, and Gus responds. Finally. <br /> <br /> Finally, to an author that I am currently reading, the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel lawyer is not recognized as an architect or sustainer of Liberation Theology, which is more a Roman Catholic than an Anglican movement, perhaps it should be. Police brutality and corporate greed are a cliché in film and literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and enlightens such feelings with impressive guarantees of Scripture, tradition and reason. <br /> <br /> His most significant work is an exposition of the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the Bible refers to as principalities and powers. The principalities, Stringfellow wrote, are behind our popular three: Images, institutions and ideologies. All these are entrusted to our worship making false promises. The more deeply you become involved with an image, an institution or an ideology that a person becomes, the more "impoverished" your own personality becomes and becomes a slave to them. Promising power, control and immortality, inexorably, offer helplessness, chaos and death. As essentially defeated and defeated powers, they can not do more than that. However, they seduce humans with that "dominion over the earth" promised by God in the book of Genesis, while, in fact, none of us controls an image, an institution or an ideology inevitably inclined in its own hegemony and self-preservation . They take lives of their own. It happens that "domain" is a bad translation: a more accurate representation of Hebrew would be "stewardship". But this is a question beside a more fundamental problem: most of us do not realize that God had delegated this power to Adam * before * the fall. We have no reason to suppose that we, his descendants, still exercise it: on the contrary, it should be obvious that the demonic forces have stolen it from us. <br /> <br /> One could add two observations of CS Lewis. First, that "the conquest of nature by man" is a mere illusion, and a ruse to cover the fact that one is really talking about the conquest of some men by other men with nature as an instrument; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, Satan is not a good time, Charlie. At first, he may hang on to pleasures, but he is very bad to them and will remove them from any human firmly in his slave, perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserable sorrow for himself and full of resentment. > <br /> Now, applying these points of view to Motorama, we see them reflected remarkably in the Gus experience. He is, if he is not nice, at least one pretty little boy before falling victim to the Motorama game. The first advertising posters shine with glamor. However, the longer it continues, and the more it moves to the headquarters of the sponsoring corporation, the more in poor condition they will return. He is alone, he does not know anyone else who plays the game. The stations that deliver the cards have fallen into ruins or are served by zombies. The people you meet on the road are getting uglier, more deceptive and more hostile. (The fact that the principalities respond to a common dictator does not mean that they can stand). Gus's humanity is separated from him when he not only becomes totally egocentric and oblivious to the needs of others, but he is partially blind ... disfigured ... prematurely aged while infantile in the literal sense of linguistic challenge. Finally, even your precious Mustang is taken away in a crash, and must continue in the accident of a dead man. However, finally, after having done everything that he thought was expected, he comes before the principality in his proud tower to receive his prize. Using the biblical power to confuse exercised by those who have built such monuments to their own vanity, their agents evade it, disappoint it, insult it and finally throw it from the upper floor. It falls long and hard, landing, finally in a body of water. In other words, in classical symbolism, GOD. He has found the inevitable final evil of anyone who has trusted such a deceiver. <br /> <br /> But this destiny is only a warning look towards a mutable future. He repents and returns to Phil, and seeing him perform the first generous and selfless act we've seen him for almost an hour and a half: noticing that Phil is now disabled and can barely insert a hose into a gas tank, he asks: "Can I help you with that?" Then, seeing the "help-seeking" sign, he decides to apply for the job and explains to the driver with whom he hitchhiked that he thinks he will leave here, because it does not seem like such a bad place. to work. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is conjectural, of course, and may surprise or even scandalize the "cult classics" of the film who see very different points in it. <br /> <br /> If Motorama is not my cup of tea, at least I am convinced that it is not the worst movie ever made.
