So Udo Kier won about nine dollars and free food for this, so it's a victory in itself. <br /> <br /> And most importantly, this movie tells a very interesting story about a group of saved men who meet Demeter decomposed. I should warn you, I'm doing a bullet through this review very fast, so put on your seatbelt. The first is the first. Coolio plays a guy named 187. 187 likes drugs. 187 he finds a lot of coffins on board and ... now I do not know anything about the future, but maybe they smuggle drugs into the coffins. Do not say that that was the craziest thing in this movie. Later, the vampire leaves his coffin full of fog and then the real hilarity begins. First, although this movie has the word Dracula, it is not really in this movie. Although I have a theory. Out of nowhere, you see that the rescue crew's ship is leaving without them. My theory is that Dracula was on board with his late brother Orlock. Dracula told Orlock he will be back soon. Dracula left this movie before they saw him leave Orlock to play the vampire during the six minutes he is in the movie. The best part of this movie, and for those of you who have seen this, know what I'm going to say, do not get tired, embrace whatever. He has this great monologue about ejaculation in various parts of Erika Elaniak's body and ... other super cool things. Coolio, seriously you're the best of everything EVER. <br /> <br /> Some other things happen in this movie too. As Casper Van Dean gets some work. Orlock screams a lot and loses his arm and then we lose the trace of him FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIE. And thank God really. We discovered that the character of Erika is a police robot. As the film comes to an end, we discover that the ship is on its way to ram the sun. The police robot and another surviving character are condemned. Instead of avoiding certain death, Erika's police robot reveals that she is also a whore and they decide to fuck and die. Before dying in the sun, they die without any reason, yes, it's true ... their ship explodes without any real reason. <br /> <br /> This movie got the amazing rating for a reason, Coolio. My God, if they gave academic awards to black rappers, then he would be the first to get one. The only reason why this did not get a perfect ten is because there was not a drop of nudity. Now I know what you think, how can you judge a movie in case women show their products or not? Very easy A movie like this practically requires it. It is part of the process. Gore, gore, monsters, nudity, gore, end of the end of the movie shock at the end. It is the formula. This had some blood, the monster was amazing because he sucked so hard that he actually did us the favor of staying off camera. That was considered of him and I respect him. Nudity, not a drop even though there was a long conversation about ... well, see the previous statement and as for the shock / spin ... I certainly did not see the end come. That counts. <br /> <br /> I hope that Hollywood does not think that Coolio has given this movie everything and he has nothing left. He deserves more work. Well, until Dracula 4000, I'm out.
