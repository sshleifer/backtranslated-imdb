Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the mega-bestseller by author Khaled Hosseini, the film provides us with a peak in the ugliness of the post-Russia invasion of Afghanistan and the terror of the Taliban. Director Marc Foster adds a gem to his resume, which already includes "Monster's Ball," "Finding Neverland," and "Stranger Than Fiction." <br /> <br /> The story of the young friends Amir and Hassan and the unknown link they know. share in the next generation. This is a story of honor, courage and loyalty, and it is an unusual story of coming of age. Some great scenes of the children when they are children and then a couple of really amazing scenes when Amir returns as an adult to find the imprisoned son of Hassan. <br /> <br /> This is a tight and compelling story that tells a message. The acting is solid at all times, without any actor stealing the screen. Although it is not a pleasant story to see how it develops, it is certainly significant and felt in the heart. In addition to a quick shot of Midnight Oil playing in the pool hall is a welcome gift.
