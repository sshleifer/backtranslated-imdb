Columbo is a visiting professor for a criminology class. Students invite him to go to their meeting after class. As they walk through the nearby parking lot, they discover their regular teacher, next to his car, killed by a bullet wound. (No, Columbo was not after the man's work). As a class project, Columbo engages students in their research. <br /> <br /> Two students, tentatively identified by the viewer as guilty, were in the conference room for the entire class. In addition, the tapes of the parking surveillance cameras show that no one other than the teacher entered or was It was after he was last seen unexpectedly leaving the conference room. <br /> <br /> Reversing the normal routine, Columbo is the only one harassed by the evil (?) duo, eager for progress reports and an ear for his theories. The forensic evidence is almost nonexistent. The solution of the case depends on an eventual and interesting good luck. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing him for the first time, it seemed that Columbo had swallowed all the deviation of the guilty; however, upon seeing it repeatedly, small details revealed that it was not like that at all. <br /> <br /> This critic has not yet grown tired of "Columbo Goes to College".
