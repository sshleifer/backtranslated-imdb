A visually elegant but interesting film is mainly the plot. The film shows a zigzag progress of exploring the most intimate feeling of the main actor. Max, who has lived in New York for two years and intends to marry a girl he met there, returns to Paris and, unexpectedly, meets his ex-girlfriend, whom he still likes very much, but finally discovers that more loves is your best friend The non-linear narrative, therefore, many flashbacks and each part are well articulated. The three women Max has met symbolize something we should look for, although they may not have a clear picture of the underlying motivations. Your fiancee is the one who needs more than the one you love and, therefore, we can not see any loyalty. She does not give him love either, but stability. True love can not be found in his relationship with the ex-girlfriend either. Just a fantasy for him to escape, many very romantic things he has done for her, but almost nothing seems to be enjoyable. The one that really animates Max's life, in fact, is his best friend. The balance reached at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because Max has understood much more about his most intimate feeling. The non-linear structure makes the search progress seem more complicated. It is not as witty as "Pulp Fiction" but things seem much more natural in "The Apartment". Max is not the only character undergoing a transformation and, in fact, the description of Romane Bohringer is interesting. Good photography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful. A good commentary on today's love and, without a doubt, a movie that is worth seeing. <br /> <br />
