Prepare to meet your Messiah, call him Masten Thrust. Male models have become increasingly difficult to find in today's overexposed society. Every day, an apparent model is forced to apologize with tears for a youthful indiscretion or innocently drunk some young people on his ranch. The Last Dinosaur is the story of the last big hunt of Masten Thrust, an old big game hunter who serves as the supreme model. Despite their emaciated features and bulbous nose, the females, including Joan Van Ark, are attracted to him as if he were a meat pie with cheesy lyrics. Thrust is overtly sexist and does not apologize for her elaborate lifestyle, which includes a red handkerchief and a private jet with a working fireplace. <br /> <br /> The thrust embarks on a mission to find and hunt the last dinosaur on earth when, ironically, after a full and rich life, he is truly the last dinosaur. Despite her propensity to shout at everyone in her presence, her employees and friends are unshakeable. You can act as if you were perpetually drunk, but make no mistake, if you call it "Ding Dong", it is a "Ding Dong". <br /> <br /> You can not deny him his own ballad, Thrust's song without shame. praises him and his manhood. A sample of the lyrics includes: "Few men have ever done, what he has done, or even dreamed, what he has dreamed / Few men have tried, what he has tried, most men have failed, where he has prevailed / The world holds there is nothing new in the store for him, and the things that startle you and me are just a bore for him / Few men have ever lived, as he has lived, or even walked, where he has walked. " Even the forbidden artist Clay Aiken, from BMTG, could cut those letters and become a kicking machine. <br /> <br /> Thrust and his team of scientists cling to the mini-motorcycle helmets with the 'Polar Borer', although Thrust offers the luxury of the red handkerchief. The gigantic drill full of humans digs through the earth and ice to appear in a lagoon. The dinosaurs of the air and the earth soon descend on the scientists forcing Thrust and his crew to run for their lives. After escaping for a bit of a loaded dinosaur. , Masten leans back and laughs, not so much to celebrate Faith, but to recognize that "the game is underway". <br /> <br /> Soon after, it is not surprising that we see some men slightly hunched over the cavemen who look out at their visitors. The push, not happy with simply killing a dinosaur, decides then to make his mission pocket a cave. Throughout the film, the lonely T-Rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain the size of a peanut. Despite its enormous size, the local T-Rex is able to approach its victims virtually without being seen. With the element of surprise, T-Rex simply crushes one or two scientists and loots the camp. From time to time you see the thrust swollen and with a cautious face screaming at someone, shooting something or flirting with a primitive J-Lo in a manly way. <br /> <br /> The push is like James Tiberius Kirk, not only in his loving addiction, but also when it comes to making complicated weapons using limited natural resources in a short period of time. Thrust and the remaining crew members build a very precise catapult that throws a large rock into the cunning skull of the T-Rex. Realizing that even he, Masten Thrust, can not overcome this addition to his trophy case, Thrust decides to stay in his prehistoric environment. The crew, more and more reduced, leaves Thrust to live his days with his charming, if a little cunning, and introduces him to his personal collection of sexually transmitted diseases. This is just a brief synopsis of a film so complicated and rich in the BMTG tradition that it takes several presentations to absorb its message and realize that Masten Thrust is the answer. The press conference, which is completed with a burst of shouting, murmuring to journalists and the introduction of the great Bunta, is a classic moment. Also look for a body, similar to a dead Ricky Schroeder, lying on some trunks, and the most powerful use of someone called a 'Ding-Dong' in film history.
