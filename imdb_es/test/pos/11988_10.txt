The only conceivable flaw in this movie is its title! Please, stop comparing it with the first one! I did it in my previous review just to separate it from the first one. If you have not seen the movie and you're curious, TOTALLY forget the first and invent a different name for it. There is nothing like it and it has a mood of its own. This is a great exponent of the mid-80s comedy. I seriously doubt that big names in this cast made the film because they were bankrupt or even wanted to redo the first. Anyone who wanted to kick the snobbish aristocracy should love this little work. I maintain, the only reason why this is at the bottom of IMDB 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (ie, Adam Sandler, Farrell, Farrelly Bros ...), but this movie keeps me laughing hysterically. I do not know, maybe it's like a bad relationship that I can not get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. Either way, this is the most underestimated movie of the 80s behind 'The Stunt Man'. <br /> <br /> Robert Stack- WE LOVE YOU! (1919-2003)
