Well, the film is basically about the last days of a specific Russian regiment stationed in Afghanistan, before the main withdrawal of the troops in 1985. The film accurately describes the grim realities of the Russian army that have made it infamous: "dedovshina" (officers and NCOs) physically harass, beat and humiliate the youngest recruits), the mixed character of the war (you can trade with your enemy one day and kill him the next), the lives of women in the front line, documentary traces of helicopter attacks and coffins that are soldered and shipped home in the air C-130 Hercules class Russian cargo planes with plotter to jam missiles Stinger, fatigue, boredom, feeling against war, emotional side simply. There are some action scenes, but they are badly done and often illogical, such as Commander Bandura's suicide ride and his back to a 10-year-old boy armed with AK-47, whose father has just been killed. Also the fact that in the middle of a shootout in the mountains, the heavy grenade launcher comes out of nowhere (and any bright medium knows that it's practically impossible to boast between 40 and 50 pitchers on the march). But at the same time, the films show that war is a dirty business, where murder is sometimes condoned, the free destruction of whole villages for little or no reason is normal, the indiscriminate killing of civilians is overlooked as a inevitable collateral damage during the war ... Some food to think why the war in Afghanistan was lost. It is not the best war movie made, but deep enough and smart enough to be worth watching.
