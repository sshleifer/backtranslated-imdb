I also joined IMDB with the sole purpose of commenting on this film, but to be able to sing its praises. I had never heard of this movie (it is so poorly packaged that it is easy to see why it can be overlooked), but a good friend suggested it to me and I am glad that it was done. It is a jewel of a movie. The actors are great (Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton in particular) and they seem to be really having fun. Of course, sometimes it was a little exaggerated, but I can not remember the last time I laughed so much or so many times in the course of two hours. If you like to laugh, then you deserve to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
