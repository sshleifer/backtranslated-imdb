I watched the premiere of "Path to Paradise" a long time ago and I was stunned, with a dramatic license and all. I lived in NYC (Brooklyn) for a few years and I took it into account. Today, given the links to groups like Al-Queda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, I see it as a warning not recognized by our government. That's why I blame our bureaucracy and leaders. 9.11.01 was a new tactic to behead two of our government branches and there is no excuse for our government to stop it, period. "Path to Paradise" was nothing more than a dramatic view of the '93 preview, and nobody cared. Now, almost 3,000 deaths later, and years ago, we struggle to find an answer that is decades away from solving.
