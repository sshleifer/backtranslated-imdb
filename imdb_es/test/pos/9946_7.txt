Four or five episodes of Johnnie Socko and his Flying Robot edited together. Funny giant robot that fights giant tale monsters aimed directly at children. Parents, of course, will go crazy, since the action is violent with the battles between robots and monsters that look like professional and human struggle over human violence, the kind of things you'll find in the School of the Day of Valentine of Al Capone and the Gangster Training Academy. I liked it, but then I grew back in the series. If there is a problem, apart from the variety of effects of "men in suits", the film is played as a series of episodes linked together, with a climax every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who have run out of Ultraman or Godzilla
