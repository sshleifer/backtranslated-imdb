I really liked this movie. He has John Wayne in his first stellar performance. Even then, it can be said that Wayne has a real presence, although it would not mature in the icon by which he is known until the Diligence, 9 years later, in 1939. These are settlers from all over the country who are heading to the new west to colonize it. Breck Coleman, Wayne's character, joins, but for his personal reasons. Most of the main actors were theater actors and they had never made a movie before, which The movie is even more incredible. They managed to create credible and distinctive characters, and here is a rather strange mix. Cimarron would come out a year later and had a very similar story, although I did not like it as much as this movie. . For me, The Big Trail is a strong 8/10.
