I have seen all the versions of this work that I can imagine, including several on stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> He has the most wonderful voice to act on stage, and his expressive face will take you to a rollercoaster of emotions throughout this play. The way he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. He (like Hamlet) can in an instant be affectionate, soft and gentle and in another moment be furious against the hell that is his life. You think he's suffering, you think he's angry, you think he's not a little crazy. You think HE IS Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the thanks obviously go to Shakespeare, :) but without an excellent actor to take the words from the page to the stage, it really does not matter how well written a play is. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, you should see this version. If you do not like Shakespeare, you should see this version. You will come out with a new appreciation of Shakespeare if you do. Sir Derek's nuanced performance will leave you breathless.
