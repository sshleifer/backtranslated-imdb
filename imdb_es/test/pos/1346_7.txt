I saw this last night in Fort Lauderdale. In general it was funny and I especially liked the characters of Sabrina. The acting is good and the story line was fine, except for the ending that left many chains hanging and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done like that. Better. <br /> <br /> The movie portrayed the life of the rule really well and we laughed all the time. It has flaws, that's for sure, but for the first Ash Christian movie I thought it was good. You may want to wait for the DVD in this. But if you have the opportunity to see it, give it a try.
