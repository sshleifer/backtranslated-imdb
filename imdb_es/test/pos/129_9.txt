This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study about the way people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels). <br /> <br /> All the characters feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume, and look for a way to live within those roles instead of completely discarding them. But as the story unfolds, the two wives, trapped in loveless marriages, come together. Taking advantage of the strength of their friendship and love, they give themselves the courage to abandon their roles. <br /> <br /> They have discovered that living within their traditions is not a life at all, it is a kind of death in life. : without passion, without true connection with others, without fullness. Although they know that there will be a price to pay for their rebellion and freedom, it is a much less expensive price than the sacrifice required by a comfortable and predictable existence. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful, the acting wonderful. Almost perfect!
