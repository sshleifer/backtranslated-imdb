But George and Gracie are not among them. The movie is fun and the pool table scene with WC Fields has to be among the funniest I've seen, but Gracie and George are more irritating than funny in their roles, partly because of script deficiency and partly because of their interpretation. I gave him a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, WC is a treasure of comic time and energy in this.
