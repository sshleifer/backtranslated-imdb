I had not planned to leave a review, but seeing some of the terrible criticism of this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending or anything, but I give some important points of the plot in this review, so you should be aware of it. The short (non-spoiler) version of my review: Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis are all kicking in this movie, and it's really fun. Look at it. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Geena Davis is perfect as the heroine of action, divided between her current life as a housewife and mother, and the memories that emerge from her previous life as a CIA Assassin. His performance is excellent, since he perfectly interprets both facets of this relatively complex character. <br /> <br /> The performance of Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, also excellent, as the Private Investigator that the character of Geena Davis hired to study his forgotten past. He does a great job of playing the unconscious partner of the tough character of Geena Davis. Some of the lines he pronounces in this movie are the best he has used in any movie he has ever been to. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you have not seen it, do it. It's a fantastic story with many twists and turns, and it's very well directed and performed.
