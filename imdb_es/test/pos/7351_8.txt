This, without a doubt, is the biggest turn Jackass has ever made, hell, he even blows Jackass out of the water. <br /> <br /> Imagine this: you have a group of guys who just did not want to grow up, throw in a ton of money and some really cool tricks, and you have Viva La Bam. <br /> <br /> This program, is one of family and it is not only "the gang" running as if it were a complete pull (as in Jackass). For example: Bam's parents, April and Phil, are in all episodes, with appearances of Bam's obese uncle, Don Vito! The reason why the Margera family makes us laugh is simple: someone in our family can relate. April: The woman who wants to live life according to the book and follow the tradition. Phil: The boy who tries to be a good father and, finally, Bam: That son who never grew up in high school. <br /> <br /> The jokes and jokes in each episode will give you a guaranteed laugh, and it is definitely recommended to buy the DVDs! Another thing that surprises to see, is how casual Margera is above all. He said in interviews that for most episodes, he is not acting, and is acting instinctively. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most about everything is the amount of influence that Margera has. It has about MTV. I wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did it. He wanted to join Dani Filth for a day and have a Cradle Of Filth concert in his backyard, it happened. <br /> <br /> Add to this your passion for the love-metal band (and debated as emo) HIM and the garage band of your brother CKY, and there are a lot of hits to the head. <br /> <br /> If you liked Jackass, you'll fall in love with this. I borrowed season 1 from a friend last year, and I left my legs to meet the crew of Viva La Bam. You will not be disappointed, and I can promise you that you will be in stitches at the end of it all!
