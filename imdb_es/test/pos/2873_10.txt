This horror movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in my life and there are many reasons why. The story is really good, it has a lot of action and great sequences of horror. The actors are not very good, but they are not so bad, but Kane is definitely the best actor, but he was always a good actor. The cast is very good. as Kane as Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal as Christine, Michael j. Pagan as Tye, Samantha Noble as Kira, etc. I must also warn you that the killing scenes are very disturbing, but they are very creative, but that makes it better and you can not have a horror movie without blood and blood. They look very realistic So I'm sure you will not be disappointed if you do not see the evil because it's a really good movie. So make sure you rent or buy, do not see the bad because it's great. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ********** of ********* * <br /> <br /> ***** of **** *
