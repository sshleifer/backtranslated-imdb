This is not a life-changing movie; It is not an epic, or anything like that. But it's entertaining, and it's fun. It's a movie that the whole family can see together, and right now there are very few movies that are suitable for children that do not have a love story in them. Tell a good story in a joyful way without trying to dazzle the audience with exaggerated special effects, like many movies these days. It has quite a good performance, and all the music that has been used fits quite well with the content of the film. The acting is also quite good, the actors are comfortable and believable in their environment and the most important thing is that the jokes are really fun. I would recommend it for people of all ages, it certainly made me laugh. :)
