I saw this movie on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. <br /> <br /> The Beagle is only in a couple of brief flashbacks, it's all about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he settled in Kent with his growing family, they had already written more than 200 pages of Origin and he was wondering if to complete the book. <br /> <br /> The script is based on the book by Randal Keynes, Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10 years old). It is mainly a family drama, but it includes sex scenes, however, the participants are married, both on and off the screen. Not very exciting, not much science, but a well-made movie that is nice to watch and press the right emotional buttons. A bit of a romantic whining, really. I suppose the conclusion is that you can be a free-thinking agnostic scientist with a background in the atheist family and be an emotional romantic and an excellent father. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters and Darwin himself affirm or wonder if he "killed God" but the viewer can doubt that. What is beyond doubt, given the mortal struggle for survival and the network of predation in the meadow bank (known before Darwin and completely uncontroversial) and the failure of Darwin's prayers is that the idea of ​​a god Friendly providential who loves "His" creatures are unsustainable. <br /> <br /> I really can not see many Americans who are very opposed. Some may have problems with the title, which is probably the most controversial aspect of the film, or with the fact that Bettany does not have horns, tail or hairpin.
