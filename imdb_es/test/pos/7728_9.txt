There are several ways to misinterpret this movie and some of them have been shown in some of the previous comments. This is a film to be analyzed as a free recreation of a familiar subject and, therefore, should not be compared to the opera, the book or other Carmen films that have been seen before. It simply stands out and I must say that Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because that is the first step in denying films the possibility of being autonomous creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is a master of the atmosphere and direction of art, costumes and photography are very well together to achieve a pleasant aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish clichés in the film. Well, historically the movie is very well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in each scene. Not only is it a precise portrait of the "black Spain" of knife and espadrille that Goya portrays so vividly, but it is also part of the story seen by a foreigner fascinated by the folk side of that society. Honestly, anyone who does not want to see any cliché about Spain should not buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case those clichés are presented before they become one and the way to see them is to get rid of our own prejudices. <br /> <br /> Another important requirement to understand this movie correctly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize the performance of any actor for not having understood their lines. If the rest of the audience did, the problem is likely to be elsewhere. Paz Vega has an impeccable diction with her Andalusian accent and everything she says is understandable and credible. His Argentine partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, also gives a convincing portrait of the Basque officer who became a "bandit", and his accent is very well learned. <br /> <br /> No less important is to have a minimally open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is "horrible" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had in Spain a critic in one of the most prestigious newspapers who used to recommend photos that seemed exciting to homosexuals, without mentioning it explicitly. And that was not entirely fair to the rest of us, especially to those who had not detected that the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers did not necessarily have to take care of. I am not suggesting at all that the critic has had the same motivation, but the expectations must have been different from those of those who went to see a talented and beautiful actress who plays an almost classical role, because that is what we got. Paz Vega is Carmen, and an excellent one, in the film by Vicente Aranda.
