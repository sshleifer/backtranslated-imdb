I was fortunate to see a screening of this extraordinary short film by Joshua Leonard before its premiere at the 2005 Sundance Festival. In twelve brief but exquisite minutes, Leonard takes us on a life-changing journey while investigating one of the problems social and ethical issues that our society faces. The film represents an elegant direction, moving performances and a harrowing story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate like the two lovers. And, in his first foray into dramatic narrative, Leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future. I feel that this short film should be expanded in a movie. It's hard to describe talent, but as this debut film shows, you know it when you see it!
