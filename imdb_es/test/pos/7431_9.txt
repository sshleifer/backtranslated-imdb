This movie is based on the series of games: Final Fantasy. This one in particular is about FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game and I was very happy to see it transformed into a movie, I loved the CG, it was incredible. There are many scenes of struggle, action and characters to make the film memorable. If you are a fan of the game, you will love this movie. Personally, I'm not a fan of games, but I'm starting to be. <br /> <br /> My favorite Final Fantasy VII character, besides Cloud, would have to be Cid. I love Cid, I think he's cute. I was surprised how real the CG images were, it was amazing, it is the 3D game. I had a great time watching the movie and, by the way, I love the eons, especially Bahamut, it's great! In general I gave this movie a 9, because yes, I loved it. I thought it was a really good movie, and yes, it's on my list of movies to get. The characters were incredible, they loved the CG, the story was wonderful, with lots of action and fighting scenes. In general, it is the best movie I've seen so far, based on a video game.
