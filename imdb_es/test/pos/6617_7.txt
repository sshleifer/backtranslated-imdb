First of all, let me say that I spent a total of two minutes of my life on a skateboard before I realized that I was totally uncoordinated. I've always thought it was great to see cats that know how to put on extremes with them, do their things, but I've never been a skater and I've never really followed the sport. That said, I thought this was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some critics have said that these guys were waving their own flag a little, but what the hell? It seems to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for giving a jolt to the world of skateboarding and have provided some good images of their innovations to back it up. It's great how viewers can see these guys at that moment and now, and the images they filmed when they were teenagers in California provide an interesting nostalgia that goes a little beyond the sport of skating. I never would have realized where the extreme skating came from, but this type of film joins all the pieces and gives us an informative documentary. I'm sure it's at least a little biased, but are not all the documentaries? It is worth seeing for anyone interested in sports or, as in my case, anyone who has grown up in the 70s.
