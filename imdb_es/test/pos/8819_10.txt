A wonderful little production. <br /> <br /> The filming technique is very modest, very old, from the fashion of the BBC and gives a sense of comforting realism and, at times, uncomfortable to the whole piece. <br /> <br /> The actors are very well chosen: Michael Sheen not only "has all the polari", but also has all the voices. You can really see the perfect edition guided by the references to entries in Williams' diary, not only worth seeing, but it is an extraordinarily written and realized piece. A masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life. <br /> <br /> Realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard that, instead of using the traditional techniques of "sleep" remains solid, then disappears. It is based on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes that concern Orton and Halliwell and the scenarios (particularly in his apartment with the Halliwell murals that decorate each surface) are terribly well done.
