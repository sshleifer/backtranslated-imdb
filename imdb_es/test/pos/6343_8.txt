I had my reservations about seeing The Return to Lonesome Dove after seeing and enjoying both the original. Without Tommy Lee Jones reprising his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I thought it would not be authentic enough. When I see 'return' I can honestly say that he is a worthy successor. The actors really do the show with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder and Oliver Reed, all with the best performance. I admit that the story might not be as fascinating as the first, but the 'return' definitely has its share of emotion and captures the romance of the Old West in a way that few other films have. Anyone who still has reservations can be sure that The Return to Lonesome Dove manages to capture the "feel" of the original and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and take a look, Ol 'Gus would be proud!
