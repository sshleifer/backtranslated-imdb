The eighties produced many small horror movies, most of them within the subgenre slasher, which put this film ahead of most of the rest of their ilk. Night of the Demons is a kind of cross between the last bloody film, The Evil Dead; and the enchanted movie of house-cum-slash Hell Night. Movies like this usually present a deranged / deformed madman as the main bad boy; But here we have bloodthirsty demons, which is always more interesting than a madman if you ask me. There is also a lot of comedy in this movie, and the first third of the movie could easily be the setting for a direct comedy movie. But once the characters enter the central location; A sinister funeral home known as 'Hull House' - the movie transforms into the horror movie one would expect given the title. The plot is as simple as one might expect, and we follow a group of children who decide to organize a Halloween party inside the funeral home. This turns out to be a bad idea, however, once you breathe in that the house is possessed; And the demons begin to inhabit the bodies of children! Your only salvation is on the other side of the underground stream ... but finding the gateway to the land is not as easy as it seems. <br /> <br /> The centerpiece of the film is the Gothic mansion where the action takes place. place. This old creaky house is an excellent location for the horror movie; the fact that it used to be a funeral home only adds to this. Director Kevin Tenney shoots the house well, and a particularly good job is done to establish the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and escape is difficult. The comedy towards the beginning of the film is usually very funny, and I expected it to keep up the laughter once the horror begins. The movie has its comic moments when children enter Hull House, but it's never too much fun and it's obvious that horror is the main objective of the movie. It's not that this is a problem; but the Night of the Demons could have been much better if he had merged these elements correctly. The characters are practically what you would expect from this type of film; but the acting adapts well to the film, and it is clear that the young cast had fun making this film and it translates well on the screen. The effects are good because they adapt well to the film, and as most death sequences are well executed; It's a good bet that most people will not get bored seeing this. This is not a classic or you have to watch the movie; but I highly recommend it, as it offers a good time and will attract fans of foolish horror forage.
