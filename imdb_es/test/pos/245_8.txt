Rita Hayworth is there where she should be, as "Cover Girl" in this 1944 film in Technicolor, also starring Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eve Arden, Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger. Rita plays a beautiful dancer, Rusty, who works in a small club owned by the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday they go out to look for oysters with Genius (Silvers), the club's comedian. Everyone hates oysters, but they are looking for a pearl. When they find one, the three will have good luck, they believe. <br /> <br /> Rusty auditions and win the cover girl role for a magazine: start in front of the other contestants because the owner of the magazine (Kruger) sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved, who happens to be Rusty's grandmother. Once she becomes the cover girl, the world opens for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true. Danny wants him to be successful, but at the same time he realizes that he has lost it. <br /> <br /> "Cover Girl" has dance numbers and exuberant songs by Jerome Kern, with Rita called Martha Mears. Rita is at her best, playing both Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past. For a woman so attractive, attractive and beautiful, she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of dominant men. None of this appeared on the screen, nor the fact that she did not want to be a movie star. She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life. Gene Kelly has a serious role here, but has many opportunities to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very friendly and funny as the internal comedian and the best friend. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie, with no dull spots. The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man he loves. When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg, who plays herself in the movie, talks about getting married, her boss warns her not to do it, which is too necessary for the modeling business. We're not told if Rusty continues his career or goes back to work at Danny's, but all the signs seemed to point towards the Brooklyn club. Why could not he have had both? However, you can not beat "Cover Girl" for the best entertainment, beautiful color, beautiful music, great energy, excellent performances and your most fabulous asset, the glorious Rita Hayworth.
