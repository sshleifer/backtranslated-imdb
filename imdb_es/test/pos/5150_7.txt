In addition, each scene has a mysterious jade wash that highlights the tiny nuances of the most subtle performance. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to Jessika Lundberg's exceptional purple boots. Boots that would otherwise have inspired an advertising campaign for Silk Cult. <br /> <br /> But then the difficult part. Someone asked me what it was about.
