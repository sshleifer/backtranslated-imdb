This is a very well-made film that shows the lives of international students during their "Erasmus year" in Barcelona, ​​which by the way is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and is an ideal place. <br /> <br /> The idea itself with all the different languages ​​is great and gives the film an original vibe. There are some clichés about countries, but most of them are true. The characters could not represent their different countries better. <br /> <br /> Having experienced "Erasmus" in myself during my exchange semester in Italy, I can say that the film is incredibly authentic. I had many experiences similar to the characters (except that I did not go to bed as often). The movie is also quite funny, but not like all those stupid movies of the American university. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film also touches on some important issues such as the change from student to work life. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (even if it's not very objective)
