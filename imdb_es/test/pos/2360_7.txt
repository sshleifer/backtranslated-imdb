Black Day Blue Night was actually a good modern noir. Three young nomads fleeing their own lives come together on a kind of road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere (as do most modern ones). A woman discovers that her husband is cheating on her and, after finding him in a hotel room, decides to leave and start over. Oddly enough, she travels with her husband's mistress, which is forgivable given that the bad death never told him he was married. And together, while driving in the pouring rain, they meet a third very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. While they are dizzy and free and everyone suspects one another, the city police have them marked as suspects in the death of a policeman. <br /> <br /> Black Day Blue Night begins with an immediate confrontation, and introduces a pretty good story with all its twists destined to confuse your suspicions of one character after another, which leads to a very unusual ending. That is, the movie starts with an immediate action confrontation, and once you think the story is resolved, you immediately get into another plot twist, revealing just a little more than you expected before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> But, as some viewers have written, the ending is a bit confusing and a bit disappointing. The killer is not what you would expect immediately and, once revealed, becomes a bit confusing due to a rather thinly explained flashback that reveals all the necessary reasons to solve the mystery. But in reality, there is an ending beyond that, which I think is the most interesting of the movie. Because the modern world always involves a circle of criminal suspects, almost always guilty of something, it is also a genre that always involves money. And, therefore, the question in these films is always: to what extent are the characters willing to go for money? <br /> <br /> If you like this version of modern black cinema, I suggest you see Red Rock West (it's also got JT Walsh and some accessories in the desolate desert)!
