Master Kieslowsky had an idea in 1993, the idea was to portray how human relationships are in the world of today, go from Blue (a visual masterpiece about the life of a woman) to White (a visual comedy movie about marriage ) and finally get to Red (A masterpiece that deals with human interaction). <br /> <br /> Although I'm not going to ruin the movement, I can easily say that Red is the best movie of the 90s because it has one of the strongest messages in a script I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie starts a little slow but finds its rhythm early enough to keep him hooked through the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The performances are perfect, sublime. since the characters are completely realistic and have no clich√©s in any way and you can not expect anything less from the actors and one is not disappointed ... seriously, I think Jean Louis Tringtignat deserved an Oscar at least. <br /> <br /> The music of Zbiegnew Preisner is amazing, it is one of the best musical scores in history. The cinematography of Piotr Sobocinsk is also outstanding, he received an Oscar (and deserved to win). <br /> <br /> In general, the film is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people who love foreign cinema and people who do not. t Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> How did the terrible Pulp Fiction of this masterpiece in Cannes overcome my understanding?
