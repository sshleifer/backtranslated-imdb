This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's scary. You will probably jump at some points and, in some cases, you will scratch your head to discover it. It reveals its mystery through the main character Eve and his psychotic project of the university in an asylum, Don. He needs her to find some clues to vindicate herself of murdering her mother, and once Eve agrees to help him, she opens Pandora's box completely and unties some very strange things, like Malachi. I will not go to Malachi, but I thought that the way he was developing was a complete genius. I know that movie fans will not consider this film with the same prestige as other classics because it has no one very famous (Angelina Jolie's brother was excellent, but maybe she should have asked her sister to show her face only so that so be it The film could get some recognition) but I think the way the Malachi finale works is something to talk about. I have recommended this to my friends, it is definitely worth the purchase or rental price.
