Anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not terrifying at all. Some people enjoy gorefests with mediocre story lines and character development. Personally, I enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts (for example, A Tale of Two Sisters, Kairo, etc.). Whatever kind of horror movie you like personally, there are only a few that really scare you. Noroi is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary style film, which means that the whole movie is a compilation of video clips linked by the legend of a demonic entity called Kagutaba. The premise is that a journalist filmed his own images by interviewing people related to the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba and then compiled images from other sources that are linked to his research. What results is a chilling and relentless experience that seems very real and disturbing, even though the story itself is false. <br /> <br /> Some have compared Noroi to The Blair Witch Project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. An obvious difference between the movies is that Noroi scares the viewer by linking events to each other using different sources. For example, the journalist records the outside of a house he is investigating and sees something strange on the porch. Later in the movie, a clip from another character's home video introduces that same strange occurrence. The memory of the spectator links the two incidents and the chills begin to run down his spine. Another example is a television show with a psychic child that answers all the questions correctly, except one. In fact, his answer is so wrong that the viewer can ask himself what the filmmakers thought. Later, however, that incorrect response turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event. This is an intelligent cinematographic creation. <br /> <br /> Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi provides not one, but two very long finals, the second of which is placed one minute after the credits begin to roll. and it is the biggest scary scene in the history of horror movies. I do not say those things lightly. It completely destroyed me in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of film making are well done. The legend and the ritual background of Kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. The only exaggerated action comes from a guy who is supposed to be crazy anyway, so that's what is expected. The cinematography is intentionally gritty because it is assumed that all images represent videos recorded on video cameras. Japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were impressive. In some cases, they create a feeling of another world (for example, static interference or the first end) but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (for example, the second end). <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done, Noroi falls as the most terrifying movie I've seen. I would dare to say that there is no film that offers as much terror from beginning to end as Noroi does. Watch it now.
