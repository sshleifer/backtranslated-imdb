In my analysis of "Trois couleurs: Blanc" I wrote that his tone is much clearer than that of "Trois couleurs: Bleu". I think it's the same with this movie. This time it's not because of a tragic comedy element, but a lot more because of Valentine's main character. Although her boyfriend lives abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she handles her life with lightness and optimism, I think it could be the image of Kieslowski for a carefree young woman. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who experiences great loneliness. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are quite similar to each other, the judge is much older and has experienced many more disappointments. They share a different kind of naivety and both discover that they can learn a lot from each other. Finally, I would like to emphasize the performance of Ir√®ne Jacob, she round off the series of incredible female contributions to the "Three Colors" trilogy.
