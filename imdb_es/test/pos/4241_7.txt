Chucky is back ... and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this delivery, the camp is back. This was the most frightening of this series, until now. It has some good turns and some good action scenes. <br /> <br /> This was, by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, albeit unwittingly, closes the gap between pure horror and horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Chucky's seed. It will be wild! <br /> <br /> "Jesus, the music scene has been gone since then! I've been dead!" Chucky <br /> <br /> We needed the lightness, since the doll is getting old. The added comic element and the best action scenes make this again equal the quality of the first, when the idea was new and new. <br /> <br /> 6.8 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
