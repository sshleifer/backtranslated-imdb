It's the old, old story: children have a party in an old house, demons are unleashed, death and gratuitous nudity occurs. You all know it, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Many people (well, many terror fans, to be specific) have good memories of this movie and always with a little fear, they revisit an old movie. Movie to see if it's still as good as you used to think it was. Luckily, this is it. <br /> <br /> It has something for everyone (well, all those who are men, I suppose). From a sequence of funny titles to a scam in a store that involves the astute use of Linnea Quigley's ass to the "mirror" scene to demonic fun, this is an explosion from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The girls are cute, the boys are. . . . Male, the scenes of death are well done with some good gore effects and, unlike some horrors of the time, this actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even tension. Do not get me wrong, it's still fun, but it offers some nice and strange moments that should please most fans of the genre.
