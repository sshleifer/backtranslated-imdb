Ok, where to start. Did you know that the part of the leading robots offered to the famous mime team Shields and Arnez? I bet he did not. But they rejected him complaining about the robot's makeup. Then they vanished in the darkness. Now, this movie has it all. A crazed killer robot that thinks it's dirty Harry. Many great robots. It's funny, touching, it's the perfect date for people who love science fiction and romantic comedies. It is the first romantic comedy robot. Now, of course, very few movies are perfect and there are some character problems. But they are very minor and can be overlooked. I think couples will enjoy this movie and will want to see it again and again. 9 STARS.
