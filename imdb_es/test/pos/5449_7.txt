I remember that this film received a lot of criticism from critics when it was new. Letterman and Leno also had objections. Letterman called him (paraphrasing) the biggest waste of film he had ever seen, and Leno opposed the simple interpretation of himself. But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as a guest on his show, so it seems he did not take anything personally. A re-release on DVD, with the opinions and comments of those involved, could be interesting, although I suspect that the days when the nightly talks captivated the nation have gone and do not return soon. <br /> <br /> I preferred the Letterman impersonation to Leno, but I could never buy any. They never rose above the caricature, and I never accepted them simply as actors. By way of comparison: Paul Sorvino as Kissinger in Oliver Stone's "Nixon" comes to mind as a personification that may have seemed ridiculous in the first moments, but that at least seemed plausible after the first moments of fun had passed. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the show for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams' speech to Letterman was not as good as if he remembered the entry of Alec Baldwin (and the quick start) as Blake at Glengerry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> They could have done more with the role of Johnny in all this. I know he mostly did not get involved in the events described in this film, and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation, so Johnny Carson needs no introduction. But more context on why Dave and Jay and all the comedians revere Johnny would have given this film the substance it lacks because it is a gossip movie. <br /> <br /> I guess I should read the book ... <br /> <br /> Rich Little who imitated Johnny Carson, unfortunately, was nothing more than Rich Little who imitated Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> I tell you what, after seeing this movie, then seeing the show of Letterman or Leno, all I want to do is open my Johnny Carson DVDs and see the reality.
