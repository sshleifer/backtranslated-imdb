This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful that hits you. I discovered that the film was excellent and that I was familiar with the disability of the two main characters, it was represented in a great performance by the two Michael and Rory. Whether the story is based on a true story, I think the story was intended to convey to the audience a message that, in general, the general public should respect and feel for the needs of people with disabilities and should have the same opportunity as any other. human. In general, this movie reached my soul and I was also moved by the actors and the director who sent creativity. The big picture is that some actors take the play beyond their character and only show a part of the character that is credible to the audience, but I think these two certainly made great use of their talent to represent a masterpiece of drama. Certainly, one can not miss!
