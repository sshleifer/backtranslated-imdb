No more corned beef and cabbage for her! <br /> <br /> This little romantic comedy goes from scene to scene with some exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). All this focuses on the wife of the spouse (s) who is trying to get out of the crisis, played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty years old here!). Both men leaders have a natural air that is convincing and, of course, Swanson is perfect in all sorts of moods, from frivolous to worried and hopeful. <br /> <br /> Behind all the games and the apparent carelessness is the old serious problem of staying in love and not deviating in love. There is a bit of corniness, but director DeMille lives up to keeping him agile and believable in everything. As with many films of this period, the subtitles not only say what they are saying (or thinking) but often offer a kind of philosophical vision, as if to justify tragedy (or madness). And there is a higher purpose here, probably better without the instructional text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's kind of weird. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a visual or formal astonishment, you will not find it here. But as a story, well acted and shot with precision and economy, it's really a great example. The events may not be a total surprise, but it is such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it is a gas. And I saw that Swanson was perfect?
