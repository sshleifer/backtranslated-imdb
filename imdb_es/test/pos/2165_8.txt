Although it is a good and nice caricature, later they made them much better, like Carrotblanca. This is almost like the first Star Trek feature, which would have been welcomed with open arms and joy no matter what, just to exist. This is really a mosaic of old bits with some nice touches, but nothing special. It reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in places and the end is priceless. Available and certainly worth seeing just for the novelty and good details. Recommended.
