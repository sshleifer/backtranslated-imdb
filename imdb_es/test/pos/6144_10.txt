I saw this movie on a night that I could not sleep, I loved it and I searched to know when it would turn on again, probably the best movie I've seen at that moment, and even now the cast is full of people. I had never seen it, but it seems like a real life story based in New York. This is the kind of movie that increases the pleasure of seeing it because you see it, hear it and feel it, from the moment I saw Wirey drinking a beer. watching the game, I imagined what it must be to grow up without a father, there are so many lines of this movie that I use daily, like "the time of personal solitude" in the bathroom taking a drink 7-11, GREAT MOVIE
