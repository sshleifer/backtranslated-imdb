This film moved me to 39 years of age in the same way that all the images and the coverage of Dogtown affected me when I was 13 years old. All those who criticized the self-promotion of the Z boys interviewed laugh at you. That was his complete treatment, "we're better than all of you and here's why ... (insert images of the softest pool size you can imagine)" This was a movie to tell his story and that was his story, like it or not. It was HIS opinion of his skating that it mattered ... not his or mine. I thought that the film captured its attitude and influence exactly as I remembered it in the 70s. The reality is that DID revolutionized skateboarding, WERE the impulse behind extreme sports and YES injected a cultural paradigm that reached all corners of the region American This film gave a revival to the images of Bertleman in a wave and Alva and Jay Adams broke the cap that WAS the Dream of California for a whole culture of young American teenagers who just wanted to have fun and get rad. While watching this movie, I realized that these were the images I lived with every day until I was old enough to move and return to So Cal after my family moved to Nor Cal when I was five years old. Until I could go back, my friends and I built and shook ramp after ramp, we looked for all possible empty pools and imitated everything that Stecyk covered over these guys. We are all educated and we have family and careers now, but this movie reminds me who I was at that age and why I keep surfing. This is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture, extreme sports, the 70s or even good production of documentary films will enjoy completely. Whenever it comes by cable I can not change the channel. Congratulations to Stacy Peralta for making a beautiful work of art!
