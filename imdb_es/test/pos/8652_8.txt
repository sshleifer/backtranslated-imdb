A very interesting addition to the Surrealist collection of Scandavian. Recommended visits for those who like their complicated movies. My interpretation of the 'strange' ending would be that Andreas's journey ends in hell. He does not like the insensitive emptiness directed by the purgatory consumer; a kind of 'living' but not progressing, that is, not getting anywhere, even the trains of the metro in the city do not stop at the stations. It has a Metro system, like you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but in reality you can never approach those trains. He can not reach the sensory and fragrant heaven and ends his bus journey to his final destination. The old Nordic version of hell (Hades, NOT hell, the terrestrial city) is not burning like the British version, its cold, freezing, the land of Niflheim (land of cold and fog). It seems that this is the place where Andreas ended, since he could not access Heaven through that tunnel.
