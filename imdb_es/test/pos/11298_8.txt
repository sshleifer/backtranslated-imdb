WONDERBIRD, undoubtedly an incredibly refined caricature, drawn in a traditionally ancient and sensationally ancient way in almost every respect, takes place in a kingdom ruled by a bad and atrocious monarch; Consequently, the kingdom, or at least what we see around the king's palace, seems to be empty, uninhabited. <br /> <br /> A few inhabitants are far from the Sun in the dry underground city. <br /> <br /> A tip? Call it an allegory, call it a parable, but do not call it a fable. <br /> <br /> Because IMDb promotes prolixity, and maybe for other reasons. Besides, I will add that this cartoon is the work of the great Paul Grimault.
