This was really a pleasure to see; The dialogue was, for the most part, absolutely outstanding (I thought that the roles of the women were a little better written, which is a pleasant surprise). The performances were uniformly very good, too. Frank Gorshin exaggerates a little when he has several disadvantages, but this could be an overcompensation for what I see as weaknesses in the way the character is written; He is very good otherwise. Harry Groener is doing just as well with a somewhat subscribed character (Tony), slightly exaggerating some of the character's most angry scenes. Ursula Burton is excellent as Sister Theresa, who really takes the film through some of her weaknesses. Seymour Cassel and Louise Fletcher are a bit underutilized here, although I like their work as usual. Shirley Jones, Wendie Malick, Jill Eikenberry and Faye Grant are also very good (I could not help thinking that Grant reminded me a bit of Catherine O'Hara here); Cloris Leachman, on the other hand, focuses on his role, with reasonably good results. <br /> <br /> However, I wish there had been a more secure hand behind the camera. Sometimes the framing or staging seemed a little out of place, or uncomfortable. The close-ups seemed overused (or used erratically) for me. And we do not always go from scene to scene as well as we would like. Part of the "tough guy" approach to the federal agent (music, costumes) was too exaggerated for me too. And the few fantasy sequences did not really work. But there are things that were VERY well done; The opening sequence was established in Buffalo around 1970, for example. And, frankly, all the scenes related to the work of the church of Theresa (I suspect that the writer and actress liked the character very much, which helps). The scenes between Malick and Eikenberry are VERY good. <br /> <br /> It is likely that the plot is a bit overloaded, it seems that there are too many schemes at the same time to keep them all at once, and the coincidences It has to be a bit too much. And the end bothered me a bit (should we REALLY be encouraging their biggest scam to succeed?), But the trip on the road is very enjoyable. It would be good to see more independent films like the one that was made. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
