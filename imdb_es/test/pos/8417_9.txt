After a long time, the Marathi cinema has come with a good movie. This movie is one of the best Marathi movies ever made. It shows how an old grandfather tries to save his grandson's eye. He tries everything that is possible in his hands to save the child's eye. The doctor and a family member try to help him in his attempt. <br /> <br /> The performance of the grandfather, the child and the doctor are simply excellent. They have shown the true image of a typical Marathi life. Each bit of action has some meaning in it. I would recommend watching this movie, since initially I thought it would be documentary, but it was above my expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is really going to touch your hearts. I hope more Marathi films To get to performances like this.
