If you are slightly interested in the War between the United States, it is worth watching this movie. It is a great historical narrative. Without intermittent sabers, no charges of cavalry, no killings, only the story of a pitiful group of Union soldiers stumbling on the farm of a Confederate woman and her son and taking all that the captain's conscience allows. This amount moves up and down as events unfold that affect your sense of humanity in conflict with your sense of duty towards your men and your cause. Ultimately, it reaches a compromise that any of us would be difficult to achieve. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the historical treatment of the war in Kentucky, a slave state that tried to remain neutral but ultimately chose to remain in the Union under mysterious political circumstances involving the arrest of certain lawmakers. Approximately half of the Kentucky soldiers fought for each side, but there has never been much talk about what it was like to have lived there in those days. This film makes a great contribution simply in the "appearance" of the moment and place.
