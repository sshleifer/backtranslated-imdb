Maybe I'm reading too much on this, but I wonder how much of a hand Hongsheng had in the development of the film. I mean, when you tell a story that considers the main character as himself, I think it would be a hard hand in writing, documentation, etc. and that would make it a bit biased. <br /> <br /> But. ... your family and friends may also have had a hand to get the real details about Hongsheng's life. I think the best view would have been said from the perspective of Hongsheng's family and friends. They saw their transformation and they were not so destroyed by drugs that they remember everything. <br /> <br /> As for Hongsheng being full of himself, the consistencies of the pose of Jesus Christ make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he is obviously alive because he was chosen as him same) for the happiness of his family. Hey? <br /> <br /> The viewer sees it at its lowest points while maintaining a superiority complex. He lays on the grass that descends from (during?) A tall place alone and with his father, contemplates life and has visions of dragons in his window, celebrates his freedom on a bicycle while stretching his arms, tilts his head towards the side. <br /> <br /> It's great that he no longer has drugs, but he is not a hero. He went from a high point in his acting career to his most vulnerable point while taking drugs to return somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br /> This same device is used in the "Coup" of Ted Demme, where the audience is empathetic. with the main character being shown as a defective hero. <br /> <br /> However, "Quitting" ("Zuotian") is a recommended movie, mainly because of its disturbing soundtrack, excellent acting and landscapes. But, the best part is the feeling one has when what we presume is the house of Jia Hongsheng is actually a stage for a work. It makes the viewer feel that Hongsheng's life was simply a work told in many difficult parts.
