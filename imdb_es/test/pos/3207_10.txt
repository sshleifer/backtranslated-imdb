I'm not the type of person to watch TV shows, because the performance usually stinks or is unrealistic or too dramatic. But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a bit funny. Rory Gilmore is a good model for all the girls. She is proud to want to attend Harvard and children / boyfriends are always in second place in her book. She is a loyal friend and always makes peace. There is a subtle romance that is what I like, personally. It is not the lazy romance that not many people have in their lives, but a realistic type of romance. All the characters eventually understand it, and they do not find their charming prince at first sight and not only "fall in love" with every boy that comes along. It's a realistic program, but when you look at it, it's better to review your movies, pop culture and random facts, because Lorelai Gilmore always makes references. I fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance, you too.
