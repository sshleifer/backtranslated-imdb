This film failed miserably in the United Kingdom, and it did not deserve it. The trailer for this movie is a bit misleading, and I think it tricked the critics and the public by thinking it was "Atonement: Part 2". While the film was marketed that way to capitalize on the previous success of Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning film, its tone is very different. It focuses on a kind of imagination of the life of the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas during World War II as a writer of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan's childhood sweetheart (Matthew Ryhs) Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. She was Dylan's first love in her native land, but the moment has passed, and the singer Vera just wants it as a beautiful memory. Or she? Vera unexpectedly establishes a close bond with the other woman in Dylan's life, "Queen of Ireland, love of my life, mother of my son" Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). The three form a kind of menage a trois in war-hit London, but Vera falls in love with a precipitous soldier, William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They got married quickly, with Killick leaving for the war. A scared Vera convinces the Thomas to return her to Wales, but all three face the realism of Vera's daughter's birth, William's jealousy and shock after returning home, and Caitlin realizes that she does not You can share Dylan with your best friend. <br /> <br /> Filmed on a low budget, this is more a piece of humor than anything else. It works best as the realization that some memories and feelings should be treasured but not renewed. Sienna Miller's performance is particularly extraordinary (unfortunately, the paparazzi nonsense diminishes the fact that she is a great talent), and Knightley and Murphy are, once again, very good. The disappointment is Rhys like Dylan, who, although the Welsh poet was not a bed of roses, lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in Dylan. The writing is very choppy, some beautiful moments interspersed with carelessness. However, it's worth seeing.
