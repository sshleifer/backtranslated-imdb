Where this film is true to Burroughs's vision, it is excellent; Where Burroughs comes from, it's excellent. It is a family story, of the search for a father by a real and emotional orphan. Lambert talks about one of the most anguished lines in the whole cinema: "He was my father!" It is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic. It's not a perfect moving picture - the notorious overdubbing of McDowell's voice by Glenn Close is inconceivable and can only be explained in terms of a very British mistake - but a fine, a faulty masterpiece and a noble farewell from Sir Ralph Richardson.
