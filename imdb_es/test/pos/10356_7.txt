The final entry made in the United States in the series "Blood Island" of Philippine horror films concerns Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), ruler of a fictitious country. He dies of cancer, however, has discovered how to bring him back: put his brain in a donor's body. The crazy doctor in charge (Kent Taylor) places him in a highly unlikely body: the giant scared servant named Gor (John Bloom). A doctor friend of the governor tries to remedy the issues and put an end to the plans of the angry doctors. <br /> <br /> Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) of the film make a corral to several actors. I've worked with before, including Taylor, Adamson's sexy wife, Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante. They tried to go by the sensation of the previous entries of "Island of blood", but it can be said that this was done in the United States. While it is not necessarily a "good" movie, it has a lot of fun elements that add to an entertaining and poor quality set. A malevolent dwarf (Rossitto), bloody operations, a rather unconvincing makeup job in Bloom, the secondary plot of political intrigue, caverns full of cobwebs, etc. I think it could have been cut back a bit; Some scenes drag. But it has its funny moments and an ending that people can not wait for. <br /> <br /> For this kind of thing, acting is not that bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun; the latter seems to be having a good time in his role. Steering wheel is attractive enough, and Williams is O.K. In the heroic role. In any case, it's good to see all these familiar faces in one of these movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing special, but as a joking "horror" (I use the word lightly, none of this is exactly scary) the movie, it certainly amuses. <br /> <br /> 7/10
