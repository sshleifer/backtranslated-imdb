I had no idea what I was going to see when I decided to watch this movie and, to my surprise, it's just an extremely well made horror movie that is easily one of the best of the 1970s. The movie is, of course, low budget and this is an excellent example of how the history and style of a movie create chills, no special effects! Strother Martin is one of the great actors of the characters of all time and has a rare leading role here and the film is also starring Martins' good friend, L.Q. Jones and "Green Acres" Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore also helped produce this film. TV veteran Charles Bateman is the star and beauty of "Enter the Dragon" Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the movie and is beautiful to look at! The film does an excellent job of continuing with the story and not adding a fake ending, and I really liked the way the film ends. Great atmosphere, interesting history and well directed by Bernard McEveety. Martins performance is top notch as well, as it does not stop at all and really throws himself into Doc's role. Good and underestimated movie!
