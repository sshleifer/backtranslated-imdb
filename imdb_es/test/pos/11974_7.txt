I would consider myself a fan of Dean Koontz; After reading a number of his novels and I liked them all, but unfortunately I could never read Watchers, so I have no choice but to rate this movie on its own merits instead of comparing it to the book I do not have. read. I entered into this expecting something horrible, and although I did not get exactly a brilliant horror movie; They lead me to believe that it is the fans of the book who qualify it because, as their own film, Watchers is an entertaining and original horror movie. The plot obviously takes some influence from Predator and starts with an explosion in a research lab. It is not long before a rancher is killed by a strange beast and the boyfriend of the dead man's daughter has picked up an ultra intelligent runaway dog. A secret government agency will be in the case soon, while the murders continue. The child is still fascinated by the intelligence of the dog, but somehow it is related to the murders and the agency is also on its tail. <br /> <br /> The script of this film was originally written by Paul Haggis, who later repudiated it. I do not know why writing here is not as ridiculous as your 2004 hit Crash! Anyway, the main reason why this film works is, without a doubt, that the dog, which besides being quite cute, is also the best actor in the film. Corey Haim, the success of The Lost Boys is the human protagonist and actually has a good chemistry with the dog, although it is a bit ridiculous to see him talking throughout the film. The plot is quite complicated and, as such, the movie is more than a little messy; but the ridiculousness of all this goes through during the most uncomfortable moments. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and does well as part of the "bad cop" of government agents. The monster is, of course, one of the most interesting things in the movie and the way it kills people is always entertaining and bloody; although unfortunately we can not see much and when we finally do it is quite disappointing, obviously the filmmakers had seen Bigfoot and the Henderson! Still, this is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed easily despite numerous problems and I would recommend it to any spectator of the horror of the eighties.
