First, let me review the movie. This movie scares me, and I do not even believe in aliens! However, the film has its flaws. <br /> <br /> There are three acts in this movie. The first act is perfect. Set the movie, and really build the creep factor. I must say that the score is great! Everything is configured and is perfectly configured. <br /> <br /> The second act begins when Jillian, playing Sherry Burton, shrugs. They hypnotize her, and she remembers the kidnapping. The second act ruins the movie when the aliens appear. "Screaming Mad George" made the effects for the aliens. I must say that they did a good job, except with their representation of the "gray" aliens. No offense, but the Grays seemed like inflatable rewards at the door. <br /> <br /> On a side note, I liked the way they treated hypnosis in Acts one and two. If you paid attention, you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories. In the husband's version of events, the blue light triggers them and his wife says, "Someone is here," or something like that. It makes sense. The husband is worried about his wife. "Someone" can hurt her. That's his problem. However, in her version of the events, she says: "Help me!" She does not say "Someone is here." This also makes sense. The aliens are after her. Wanting her husband to help her and save her is her problem. Now let's go back to the movie. <br /> <br /> The third act turns the film into a gore fest. Start with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. It is a typical gore festival, but it has a surprising ending. I will not ruin it because it's really an interesting development. <br /> <br /> The DVD and the comments take themselves too seriously, but if you think Wilford Brimley saying "Horsesh **" is funny, you might want to see him in the interview section of the cast. Now I congratulate Jillian McWhirter. <br /> <br /> I could only wait for Jillian to read this. I had never seen it before, but wow, what a spectacle! Let me tell the rest of you this. First of all, this is supposed to be a serious movie. The details that I will now describe may sound campy and funny, like "Humanoids From The Deep" (1980), but in reality it is not. I have it? In agreement. <br /> <br /> Jillian is sexy, naturally pretty. She's naked for a lot of the movie, something good. Unfortunately, she is usually assaulted, terrified and raped, something very bad. However, she must act in large part on this nude movie. She gets points for overcoming that. She has to act happy, sad, horny, scared and physically hurt in the space of a few moments. The turn of emotion is amazing! She has to rejoice when she finds out she is pregnant. She has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts. She has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby is not his. She has to act as if she were in denial, saying that there is nothing wrong with her baby, when her husband says otherwise. A denial, I should note, that is really forced upon her by the aliens who control her. I'm talking about an Oscar-sized performance here! <br /> <br /> Then there is the scene of the rape. It's disturbing, but since it's just an extraterrestrial rubber, it's not that bad. In this scene, the extraterrestrial is not a "gray" alien, so I will describe it. The alien has tentacles, and it's like a table. Jillian is in the part similar to a table, restricted by the tentacles. By its head is the head of the alien. The alien's head is long and moves down so that his head is now on Jillian's legs. Then, the hey-nanu-nanu of the alien comes out of his forehead. It's the forehead It sounds pretty corny, right? Well, Jillian plays it straight, and she does it! She has to act like an extraterrestrial with her hey-nanu-nanu from her forehead, she's raping her, and she succeeds! It's a very intense scene, but that's not what makes it. You see, this scene is done in a flashback. What makes the scene is Jillian's performance when remembering these events. She's just lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis remembering the alien abduction, but her performance here is more intense than the actual rape scene! How many actors can perform a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape? Not many! However, Jillian does it. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. Jillian, if you ever read this, I want you to know that I, (name withheld) aka MegamanX-1, I think you're the best actress. You are the best actress! I can only hope that you read this and take it with you always. <br /> <br /> As for everyone else, "Progeny" (1999) is an Okay to Good movie. I would recommend it.
