After the main actress of the opera dies in a car accident, her young substitute, Betty, is put in the foreground. That is very fortunate for her, with a problem: she has an admirer who has decided that she will kill all her friends and make her see. What is your connection to the opera and what is your fascination with Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan, I think. Many people, particularly critics, praise their previous work ("Suspiria" and "Deep Red") but they really frown on later films, like "Sleepless", that I liked. My favorite, "Phenomena", is usually very underestimated. "The opera" tends to fall somewhere in between. Some consider it one of their last great movies, others see it as part of their so-called decline. I loved. <br /> <br /> The image is clear, the music is great (unlike other critics, I love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is a person I can feel (not unlike Jennifer Connelly's "Phenomena"). And the images ... wonderful. Great cinematography, and some incredible scenes of killing. The concept of engraving needles in a person's eyes so they can not blink ... bright. My assistant Tina believes that this seemed false, but even if she does, the idea is more than enough to give results. And some great effects, like a blade of a knife that goes up into a man's mouth? Awesome. <br /> <br /> Jim Harper calls the film "impressive" and draws attention to "innovative cinematography, well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders." I completely agree with this: a shot follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a very interesting visual use of the crows throughout the story. Mike Mayo also calls it "visually fascinating to the eye" and praises the "crisp editing and workflow of the camera." It really is a wonder that this is not one of the most praised works of Argento. <br /> <br /> Argento returned to the opera with "Phantom of the Opera", which was a great failure despite the casting of his daughter from Asia and Julian sands. Even more interesting, this year he offered the release of "Stagefright" by Michele Soavi, who (like "Opera") has a loose assassin inside a theater killing the people involved in the presentation. Both are great movies, with Soavi more from the slasher side. (Actually, Soavi served as director of the second unit in "Opera" ... you can draw your own conclusions.) <br /> <br /> My only complaint with this movie is the length and pace. While it is very well filmed and the death scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. The first takes more than half an hour, and then we lower the times between them. The main actress must be in constant terror, but given time between deaths to calm down as if everything was normal again. It's not good, Dar√≠o. We need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high.
