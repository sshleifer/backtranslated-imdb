This is a pretty silly movie, which includes what may be the least erotic ever made to get to the big screen (the heroine pours on the V-8 and invites the hero to lick it, what a disgust!). And yet, it also presents the resplendent Lucinda Dickey in what is far from her most erotic performance. In those past days, women, even action heroines, with real muscles were a rarity, and I can still remember the way I was dumbfounded when Dickey took off his shirt, revealing the most powerfully constructed female back and biceps. never seen. The beauty and vitality of Dickey carry the film: she could have been a female Schwarzenegger if someone had had the vision to promote it.
