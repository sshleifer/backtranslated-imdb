This movie is not supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> It is not designed to be sad, but my heart felt heavy through several vignettes. <br /> <It's not written as an action adventure, but my pulse quickened more than once. <br /> <br /> As in life, this movie does not manipulate your emotions and tells you how to feel. It simply is, and you react. <br /> <br /> If you do not find it funny, sad or touching, I suspect it says more about you than about the movie. <br /> <br /> It is amazing and comforting to see a director who wholeheartedly celebrates that we are all human, and we accept that we are all stuck here, doing this "life" thing, over and over again during the time what we owe <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is another day
