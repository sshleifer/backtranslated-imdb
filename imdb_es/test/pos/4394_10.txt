The first time I saw this movie, it did not seem to go anywhere. However, when I saw it a second time, it made much more sense. Give it a try, look at it more than once, there are many key elements that shape the story that could be lost the first time and even the second time you see it. The Cohen brothers brilliantly shine the real events of the early 20th century in this story to create a credible scenario and story. The combination of the main role of Clooney is well combined with the support acts of Turturro and Nelson. The appearance of John Goodman in the movie is very funny. The soundtrack is also great. This movie has become a household favorite for my family. 10/10, of course.
