Former reporter Jacob Asch (Eric Roberts) is hired by an acquaintance (Raymond J. Barry) to find his ex-wife and son. Asch heads to Palm Springs and quickly locates the former Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) with someone he thinks is his son (a young Johnny Depp). But things get a little more complicated when Asch discovers that the old white garbage Laine has been married definitely in the form of millionaire Simon Fleischer (Dan Hedaya) and his first child is nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> The director / writer Matthew Chapman is channeling BODY HEAT here and this neo-noir of the mid-80s can be seen enough thanks to a cast of stars and good places. D'Angelo still looked good in this era, so she is a good fatal woman and is not afraid to show some skin. However, the mystery is not very convincing in the end. Co-starring Dennis Lipscomb, Emily Longstreth and Henry Gibson. Chapman made several thrillers in the 80s, but his "greatest" achievement was co-author of the screenplay of the infamous COLOR OF NIGHT.
