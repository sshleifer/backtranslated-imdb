The history of pre-unified China must be popular. The hero of Jet Li made popular the King's murder. <br /> <br /> This is another story made a few years ago. It stars the incredibly beautiful Li Gon (Memories of a Geisha, 2046, Miami Vice) as the King's mistress, who was sent to recruit an assassin so that the King could defeat him. She recruits Fengyi Zhang, but falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, he can not complete the mission anyway, since the King knew it in advance. I suspected that he knew it too, but I went anyway. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story with massive military operations and, of course, another opportunity to see Li Gong.
