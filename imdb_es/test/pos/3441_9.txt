I just finished watching the film for the first time in its entirety (although I saw some parts when it was screened for the first time in Britain in the mid-90s), I really think it's a masterpiece of cinema of the late twentieth century. Undoubtedly, a film of this scope raises many questions, such as: Why are there some narrative differences between the Hermann of the 60s in 'Heimat' and Hermann in this film? For example, in the first film, Hermann has a fairly significant relationship with his stepfather (he funds Hermann's electronic music), while in "Die Zweite ..." there is little mention of his father until the final episode. <br /> <br /> Another point interests me; When reading about Edgar Reitz, I am impressed by the historical similarities between him and Stefan's character (in the last episode it is revealed that Stefan won a prize at the Venice Film Festival) (Reitz won a prize for the best debut work there for his movie "Mahlzeiten"); The Reitz film company is called 'Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion' and Stefan's is also named after him. I'm interested in Stefan being an autobiographical character because, apart from Helga, he's probably the least sympathetic of friends. <br /> <br /> Maybe Stefan is a fake clue, I do not know, what I do know is that I loved this movie and I wish it would be more like that, with the exception of "Cache" by Michael Haneke and Werner El "grizzly man" by Herzog does not have enough ambition, audacity and passion of this kind in modern cinema. I can not wait to see number 3 now.
