Corniness warning. As many other IMDb users already know, I am not a corny and corny person. If you do not want to read this type of review, go. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, you're hearing this from a man who laughed on the Titanic and almost broke his parents' tape. Rewinding continuously the propeller scene. <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br /> <br /> One day, I went to the theaters with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Former children's star. Last year in August. The boring trailers continued until one began so calmly. It was for the radio. By the time I saw the trailer, I had to watch this movie the opening weekend. When that weekend came, Scary Movie 3 also came out, so many teenagers were waiting in line that Friday night. It turns out that the movie sold out and those teenagers were so desperate to see a movie, they went and they also sold Good Boy and Radio. I could not get a ticket and the following weeks, I was busy with more important things. About 5 months later, my friend rented Radio. He lent it to me and I saw it in my room. I'll tell you this now, this is the ONLY movie I've seen that has made me cry. When Radio's mother died, it came out automatically. The next day, I went to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> Pretty good of my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. The stars as a mentally disabled man named Nick. Ed Harris is co-star and this film is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on a true story, Radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of the day alone. He goes with a shopping cart picking up everything he can and always carries a radio. He has his own collection. At the end of each day, he goes home with his mother. He never went to school until later in the movie. One day, the radio goes through the local high school while the soccer team is practicing. A soccer ball flies over the fence and Radio picks it up and continues. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, the football coach. They meet and this is the life of Radio. <br /> <br /> Throughout the entire film, Radio and Coach Jones spend quality time together, both of them teaching each other things. It is beautiful to see how the film reaches the highest joys, to the lowest lows, and only by watching Radio live its life. You will laugh, cry, and live the life of Radio with him. This film occupies a special place in my heart together with Toy Story and others. This is a must see for the whole family, alone or if you are someone who just wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in my life. The radio will never be forgotten by me. Never. <br /> <br /> As the character of Ed Harris said to a large extent near the end of the film: <br /> <br /> "We are not teaching radio, the radio is teaching us". <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
