I've seen this movie when it came out. I thought it was a normal movie. Now I have realized that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and a great soundtrack. I've seen my share of rock movies, but although this is far from being a spine (which I did not like)> This film takes us to the life of an 80s rocker who does not want to be anything more than that. This is nothing more than our inner child who wants to grow up and be a * ROCK STAR * Yes, I said it. Everyone wants to grow and be in the light of the place (time says it or not). This movie puts you in the center of emotions and you can almost feel the emotion of Izzy. I must admit that the performance was less even, but still the music and the story were enough to keep you up to date, until the credits came out. It is worth seeing especially if you are a fan of the powerful hair bands of you.
