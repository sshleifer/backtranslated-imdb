The first time I saw this miniseries was childish and, although I'm not a child anymore, I still love it! Professional copies are hard to find, however, when it is on DVD, it is MINE! =] <br /> <br /> Great casting, wonderful storylines and lots of action, romance and even a bit of well-placed comedy. I'm not a historian by nature, but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction.
