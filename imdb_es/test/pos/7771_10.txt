I've seen Love Jones more than thirty times. It is one of the rare movies that represent a love story about people who are African-American. The dialogue was written realistically and delivered honestly. It was very nice to see a movie in which the storyline focused on young African-American professionals. This is practically an untapped market. Love Jones was visually captivating too. The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring back memories of past and present love. The sensation of the film is jazz and blues, and it brings the sensuality of a hot and creamy hot chocolate with a touch of Kahlua and Butterscotch. If you had not guessed, I loved it!
