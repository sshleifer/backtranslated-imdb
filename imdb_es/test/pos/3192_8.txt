The first time I saw Love in Limbo was late to free television about five years ago, and since then it is a film that I will always remember with pleasure as one of those movies that you see and in which you will always have influence. <br /> <br /> For the uninitiated, the Australian film has a long history of making extravagant comedies about kind losers, and Love in Limbo is an excellent example of this. Although Russel Crowe is the only known actor (although these days all you need a movie), the rest of the Australian cast is good. He still steals the show as a nervous, nerdy and virgin loser. <br /> <The general premise is very similar to American Pie. A group of friends who want to have sex and become men. As expected, the whole film focuses on this (with a secondary plot about the leader's mother and several other incidents), and is full of humorous situations that push her toward the inevitable sweet end. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed American Pie, do not expect this to be the same, but expect the same conventions to make appearances. Love in Limbo is not a romantic comedy, but it definitely has its share of laughs, punches in which the good guy wins, and situations that every man, Australian or not, can relate to. <br /> <br /> See if you liked: American Pie, Almost Famous. Strengths: good Australian cast, easy to relate, good perve value. Weaknesses: Predictable in points. My rating: 8 out of 10
