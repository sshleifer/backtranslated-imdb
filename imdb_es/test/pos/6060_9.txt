Jack Webb is fascinating as a mock instructor at Marine Corp at D.I .. Webb plays Sergeant Jim Moore, a tough but fair Marine whose job is to prepare young teenagers for possible combat. No one could have played this role better than Jack Webb. As a former Marine, I can assure you that this is the most accurate film about basic training in the Corporation. Extremely entertaining!
