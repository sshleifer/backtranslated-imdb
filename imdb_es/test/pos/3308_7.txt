A very nice screen version of Rona Jaffe's best-selling pot caldera about the trials and tribulations (and, of course, the loves) of a group of women involved in one way or another in the New York publishing business. Directed by Jean Negulesco, quite recent of the success of "Three Coins in a Fountain", and the prototype of "Sex and the City", except that here all sex takes place off the screen. <br /> <br /> The young and brilliant talents of the day (Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, Martha Hyer), are well organized while Joan Crawford appears as a Queen Bitch from an editor who could probably eat Miranda Priestly from Meryl Streep and spit it out; Without any effort at all, she steals the movie. The men include Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan, (if it was not Rossano Brazzi, it had to be Louis Jourdan), Robert Evans (before he decided, wisely, to go behind the camera) and Brian Aherne. There's more foam on display than you'll find in your regular laundry, but if, like me, you enjoy "Desperate Housewives," not to mention Carrie Bradshaw and company, then you'll probably love this. A very guilty pleasure.
