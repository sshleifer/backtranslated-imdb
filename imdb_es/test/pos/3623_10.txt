I saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London (England). I enjoyed it immensely. Although Crow and the Chinese police do not appear, Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer / Director) expressed / performed by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well. <br /> <br /> The rumor is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (like Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the movie for only a pint of beer. <br /> <br /> Spike showed up in the movie, in a video before he died and, by all accounts, enjoyed it immensely.
