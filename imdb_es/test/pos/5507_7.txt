This extravagant horror movie seems to be receiving only negative reviews. My question is; why? I think this movie is pretty good. Dee Snider did very well in his first (and only) direction. He also plays the antagonist, Captain Howdy (Carelton Hendriks). This movie seems to have a vision of the future. Although it came out in 1998, it seems to be modern issues. Internet predators seem to be the underlying plot here. Although taken to another level, this is a problem we still face today. I admit that the story fell short sometimes, but that does not make this a bad movie. Robert Englund is even in this movie, which automatically improves it. The acting was not bad, the characters were also pretty good. Hendriks was a good antagonist, I think. I give this horror a 7/10. Recommended for Saw fans.
