This movie struck me. I thought I knew a little about the prison riot in Attica. After seeing this, I see that I did not know anything. The story is told through the relationship between the lawyer and the black inmate. Both the personal history of these two men and the court drama that was developing were fascinating. The flashback sequences in the prison were impressive. It's hard to believe that it was not a documentary, it was so real. It was not just a great dramatic piece, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in the history of the United States. I'm with Ebert and Roeper. I give two thumbs up.
