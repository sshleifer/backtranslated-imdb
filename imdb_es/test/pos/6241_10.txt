This is one of my favorite horror films of all time and I used to think that I never really deserved it. That is until I read the enthusiastic reviews here. It seems that many feel the same as I did when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> It's a very spooky movie, and I've spent most of my life watching spooky movies. I've always found dolls, mannequins and so damn scary! Look at the dolls in "Beyond the door" and, of course, the great "Trilogy of terror". And what about the magnificent Twilight Zone episode "Living Doll"? Hell, the dolls are scary! And Tourist Trap has some moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck. All helped by an excellent soundtrack that only makes the performance of Connors even more moving. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the movie trailer on nightly television and something like this: "Wow, I have to see that!" It was memorable. And it's one of the few trailers I remember seeing when I was a kid that scared me. It took me years to see it, but it was a delight. <br /> <br /> Stephen King also mentions this movie in his book "Danse Macabre", and gives it a brilliant recommendation. Very good company. <br /> <br /> This movie will always be high on my list of must-see. It is a really solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves a place with the best schlockers of the 70s.
