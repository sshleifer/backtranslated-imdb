When I first heard that the theme of Checking Out was a suicide self-orchestrated party, the first thing I thought was the morbid, tasteless and then a comedy. I was skeptical. But I was very wrong. I loved it totally. The cast, the funny liners and especially the surprise ending. Suicide is a sensitive issue, but it was handled very well. Funny, yes, but tender where he should be. Checking Out also deals with other common problems that I think many families can relate to and do it with tact and humor. I highly recommend going out. YOU MUST SEE IT. I look forward to its release to the public.
