"Empire Strikes Back", "Never Say Never Again" by director Irvin Kershner, a remake of the 1965 James Bond movie "Thunderball", does not beat Terence Young's original, but this movie is not Harry Saltzman's and Albert R. Broccoli is fine. It's worth seeing if you call yourself a 007 aficionado. However, despite his shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of vibrant musical music, "Never Say Never Again" is classified as a thriller suspense above average, with first class performances from an experienced cast such as Sean Connery, Kim Basinger, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCowen and Rowan Atkinson. The film is full of surprises in abundance from the invigorating sequence of title credits throughout its exciting and long 134 minutes. Unlike the sagas of the James Bond franchise with its impressive moments of show, "Never Say Never Again" offers few of these scenes due to its prohibitive budget. In fact, the film presents only three gadgets: an explosive ballpoint pen, a wristwatch with laser and an improved motorcycle. Apart from Lani Hall's tasty opening song, the orchestral music score of "Ice Station Zebra" composer Michel Legrand leaves much to be desired. Legrand does not replicate any of those fast jazz tracks that made John Barry's music for the Bond franchise so memorable. In general, "Never Say Never Again" seems to fit more in the first two Bond films, "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" and "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" in terms of more details. approach the earth to the subject. <br /> <br /> "Never Say Never Again" features Sean Connery's James Bond as a senior 007 who has seen his day and has been retired from active duty to teach. Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than the Connery and Moore's Bond films treated with 007 as an active, young boy. Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and there are several changes to the Lorenzo Semple script that emphasize Bond's age. Initially, Connery had lobbied to play Bond without a hairpiece, but fortunately the wisest minds prevailed and Connery sported a hairpiece. He looks tanned and fit, and seems to be in better shape than twelve years before, when he was rushed to "Diamonds Are Eternal" at the last moment to replace John Gavin. Connery had been working on another film and had gained weight for the role he could not eliminate in time for "Diamonds Are Eternal". At age 52, Connery still has a youthful vigor here despite the invented demands of the script. <br /> <br /> The action unfolds with 007 on its own trying to rescue a woman kidnapped on a remote desert island. Send several guards armed with machine guns and free the woman, only to have her stab him with a knife in her side when she is not looking. It seems that all this sequence was an exercise designed by M (Edward Fox of "Day of the Jackal") to test the skill of Bond. The new M does not share the use of field agents by its predecessor. M decides that Bond needs to clean his system of all "free radicals" and has sent 007 to Shrublands. While in the clinic in the country, Bond notices a suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and it is evident that he observes them. The nurse is none other than SPECTER, the killer Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera from "The Island of Dr. Moreau") and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees the USAF official Jack Petachi (Gavan O'Herlihy of "Superman 3"). Petachi is part of a SPECTER plan by billionaire entrepreneur Maximilian Largo (Klaus Maria Brandauer of "Out of Africa") to deny world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads. The villains implant a duplicated eyeball in Captain Petachi that has access to highly sophisticated computers and can order the weapon assembly. After he steals the weapons for SPECTER, Fatima Blush pulls him out of the road throwing his pet snake into his lap and then places an explosive in his shattered car and blows it. In fact, the first part of "Never Say Never Again", apart from the SPECTER planning conference, belongs to Fatima, as it oversees Petachi's stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill Bond, one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite. with an explosive device. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Bond meets handsome blond Domino (Kim Basinger from "Mother Lode") and sneaks into Largo's charity banquet at a Monte Carlo casino where the two face off in a elaborated video game called 'Domination' to see who will rule the world. Bond defeats him and Largo hates him doubly now because 007 is his only rival for Domino and a thorn in his side that not even Fatima seems to be able to eliminate. Bond and Fatima have him out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and exploits it. His first encounter in the Bahamas when he connected a device to attract a shark after him is quite boring. As in the original "Thunderball", the villains recover the nuclear warheads sequestered in the sea, but only the warheads themselves. <br /> <br /> Bond flies to the Bahamas, where he meets his diplomatic liaison, Nigel Small-Fawcett (no less than Rowan Atkinson of "Mr. Bean", who fears that Bond could kill someone and ruin the paradisiacal island Of course, Nigel Small-Fawcett is the source of comic relief The CIA sends Felix Leiter (Bernie Casey "Guns of the Magnificent Seven") to support Bond This is the first time that an African-American played Leiter Bond meets his share of problems, like saving Domino from Arab slaves, while he and Leiter save the world. "Never Say Never Again" is a very respectable James Bond thriller with many details, but it never generates the In fact, "Never Say Never Again" looks like a worthy Masterpiece Theater in 007.
