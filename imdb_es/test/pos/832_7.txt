This movie is good in its genre and that genre is naturally action with a small / average budget. It seems that Van Damme offers much better performances when he has a good director who guides him. There is a basic bar fight, an alley scene and especially a lot of confrontations. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an action movie OK if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the program is: <br /> <br /> Scott Adkins. How is it that this guy is not an action star of caliber Arnold Schwarzenegger that I do not know? The director Isaac Florentine made a film with Scott Adkins before called Special Forces (2003) that has an incredible talent of martial arts that will satisfy the most demanding enthusiast of kungfu. Another surprising feature of Scott Adkins is Undisputed 2. Look at this guy and make a noise, this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now! <br /> <br /> What else can I say about the movie? It is Van Damme who is making some progress in his most recent work. There is no Oscar here, but you already knew it. But never less does it have a small town feel and I can find worse ways to spend my time. So I'm giving this a solid 7 out of 10 of its kind.
