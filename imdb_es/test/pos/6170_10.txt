Since I grew up in Czechoslovakia, I followed the history of the pilots and crews of the RAF in Great Britain of the Second World War, their stories and their tragic end in combat or in prisons and communist camps. This is, without a doubt, more than a dark chapter in our history, although the fact that these brave men can go through all this and recover later is amazing. To all the people who want to see a great movie ... this is the only one! During the recent visit to the Czech Republic, I saw this movie three times in three days (we're only playing it for three days ... otherwise, I'll go see it even a few more times. It's worth it!) I hope that Enjoy, although it requires a little more thought and knowledge of the background information behind the story, almost in the same way that the movie "Kolya" was. It's not a simple movie because of its deep story, and the way it will be told will probably make you cry ... it made me three times in a row ... Zdenek Sverak did as always a great script, his son Jan made a great movie and the cast? Without a doubt, all of them did a great job, I was surprised by Ondrej Vetchy, for the great role played by Oldrich Kaiser and all the other actors that made this movie simply BIG. If this is not an Oscar nomination, I think I'll be on strike in Holywood.
