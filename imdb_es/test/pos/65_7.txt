I'm an avid fan of Julie Andrews and I saw it for the first time on DVD, the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was classified as G. How did they become bedroom scenes, a story of seduction, two acts of strip tease and war / shooting / blood in a G rating? Strange. I would qualify it as PG-13. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I enjoyed the movie a lot. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The performance was great. The story was a bit weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled with a good dialogue. There were too many scenes of "not talking, just walking" ... I would have liked to see the relationship between Julie and Rock blossom, so that intense love was more credible.
