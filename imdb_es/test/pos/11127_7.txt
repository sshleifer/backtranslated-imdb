If you are looking for a movie with fantastic music, a nice cast and a story that is not difficult to understand; FAME is for you. <br /> <br /> I have several scenes that I love in this movie; Some make you laugh, others make you contemplative. I think the editing is wonderful, very fast and, often, fun. Shure, maybe there would have been something more potential in all this, the whole story would somehow stay on the surface; Maybe there are too many characters involved. But I do not care, because the real stars are ... <br /> <br /> ... the musical scenes! One of my favorites: the hot-lunch-jam sequence. That piece is so raw, funky and filmed in a special way (hand-held style in "music-hell-breaking-loose"), it's just electrifying! I miss this raw energy in today's music clips; the only similar energy that I found perhaps in Bette Midlers "the rose", all the images of the concert. It's about capturing something "wild" that is "really" happening, and not just making it perfect; take per shot. <br /> <br /> Therefore, FAME is a wonderful journey of nostalgia for when the synthesizers are not available on the heavy and the walkman. I recommend it once a year; Surely not for everyone.
