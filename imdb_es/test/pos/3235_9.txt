Do not watch this movie waiting for Jane Austen's wit, a clear dialogue or a clever social commentary. This time, the premise of the Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way. <br /> <br /> In this version, Catherine's erotic dreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality in which she peeks with her adventures in the light of day. During the day, she is very primitive and demure, and her sweet Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as your own sexual nature wakes up, your dreams subtly awaken from mild to steaming to spooky! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, Catherine's sex visions are based entirely on the gothic novels she devours in bed. It is touching, sexy and provocative to observe the way in which his dreamy image of the handsome Henry "dissolves" in a frightening dream of being snatched away by romantic villains! At the same time, it is ironic and touching to cut his bed in the morning. Catherine sleeping peacefully seems so innocent that she would never guess what really happens in that pretty little head! <br /> <br /> Later, after being invited to Henry's castle, Catherine listens to a familiar argument and fully understands its meaning. Jumping to the bed, she covers herself with the sheets and stays awake listening with fear, her striking blue eyes are the only visible sign that she is alert. Little by little, however, those pretty blue eyes tilt and close as you enter another heated dream of innocent desire. This time, Catherine dreams that she is in Elizabethan times, fearfully waiting outside the castle for the rapprochement of the "banditi". It is quite clear that she is more excited than terrified by the idea of ​​being taken by bandits. She almost shudders with excitement and anticipation! But then, after a shot of her running frantically to escape, we return to the world of daylight, where the maid scolds her for making a mess in her room before falling into a deep sleep. It's worth noting that Catherine's heavy eyes in the morning light are in themselves a pretty sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been! <br /> <br /> Ultimately, of course, Catherine's stern and unimaginative lover, Henry guesses the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern reading. It is interesting that the immediate collapse of Catherine in tears does not symbolize a retreat but an advance in adult relationships. In the next scene, she burns with tears her gothic romance and throws herself embarrassed and sobbing in bed. Significantly, this turning point is also marked by Catherine falling into a deep sleep, except that this time, there are no dreams of making the passion believe. Presumably Catherine has matured enough to be ready for reality. <br /> <br /> Although Katherine Schlesinger has beautiful blue eyes and a cheerful expression, and all her acting is charming, it must be said that outside of the environment. Dream sequences This adaptation of the film is unbearably boring. I give it 9 stars just because true romantics can enjoy it purely on a dream level. <br /> <br /> If you want to read a book about a young heroine with a genuinely strong will that overcomes the real darkness. Danger in a real Gothic setting, I highly recommend THE PERILOUS GARD by Elizabeth Marie Pope.
