This is what used to be porn, this is a true classic. I mean, it's a x musical based on a real book! There is a real plot and how many movies rated x can boast about these days? This belongs to an exclusive short list of authentic classics of pornographic films, such as Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with "pornographic films" these days is that it's about "pornography" and not "the movie." Alice in Wonderland has graphic representations of sex, of course, but she's actually telling a story at the same time. It is not one of the typical arguments of "Oh, Mr. Police, do not write me a ticket", this goes a step further and makes it a musical! Fabulous! If you want to see an example of "good" porn, this is one of the best.
