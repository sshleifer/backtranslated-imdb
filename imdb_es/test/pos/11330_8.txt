Two hours ago I was watching this brilliant film that overwhelmed me with its captivating photography. It is quite understandable how he won the award for Best Camera at Cannes 2000. The first shots dominated him. Close-ups of walls, humans and many other things. The lighting of warm colors (which is also usually the director) gave the film a warm atmosphere. Only two people can be seen in most of them. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the film almost all the time. Each of these themes represented a certain atmosphere throughout the film. Silence and slow movements characterize the film. Some scenes were extended moments or a series of close-ups. Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his excellent performance, since Maggie Cheung was also so brilliant. I wonder how many dresses he would wear in the different scenes. History was also related in some way to the history of Hong Kong and the region in the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding some details of the subject, especially at the end. In short, I would recommend fans of artistic films to watch it at the cinema.
