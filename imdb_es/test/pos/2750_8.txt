Very good "Precoder", starring Dick Barthelmess, which somehow reminded me of "Only Angels Have Wings" by Hawks (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by the teacher William Wellman, responsible for the historic milestone "Alas" of aviation. <br /> <br /> Barthelmess plays an airplane pilot who watches over demons, who is blamed for an airplane accident. Then he meets and falls in love with the beautiful Sally Eilers, who participates as part of a Law in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess's brother appears on the scene, a triangular relationship occurs. <br /> <br /> "Central Airport" has many exciting moments and some touching and touching scenes too, thanks to the great chemistry that develops between Barthelmess and Eilers (who, in my opinion, in this film is very similar to the actress Dorothy Mackaill). Tom Brown is good as Barthelmess's brother, fresh from his success in Wyler's "Tom Brown of Culver." <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying acrobatics, fast-paced movies; In short, very entertaining. Do not miss it when TCM transmits it again.
