To the eight people who considered the previous comments by FIERCE PEOPLE useful for "Psycolicious Me" and "Topdany", as well as future site visitors who see them before their authors delete them: these negative reviews are not only shorter that the guidelines of the site require, but they are completely false, not factual, incorrect and informative. For example, Blythe's father is in a coma, NOT dead. Maya and Finn even visit him in the hospital. Also, it was the deer poacher Dwayne, NOT Blythe, who stopped Jilly, the maid, etc., etc. So, if you have ADD, which makes you unable to concentrate on the simplest details, keep your condition to yourself. Posing as Siskel or Ebert. Otherwise, include a disclaimer with your comments!
