House of Dracula works from the same basic premise as House of Frankenstein the year before; that is, the three most famous monsters of Universal; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man appear together in the film. Naturally, the film is quite messy, therefore, but the fact that the three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the sixty-seven minutes of the film does not become boring. It is obvious that the idea of ​​making another mash of monsters came to the head of the writer before it did a real plot, since the thread they give us is not exactly without holes. The plot sees Count Dracula arrive at the house of Dr. Edelman asking for a cure for his vampirism. So, what can only be described as a coincidence, see Lawrence Talbot, a.k.a. The Wolf Man appears asking for a cure for his affliction! It turns out that Dracula is on the lookout for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot really is serious. When it turns out that he can not be stopped from turning into a wolf, The Wolf Man launches into the sea ... where he ends up finding the Frankenstein Monster. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not. As good as the previous House of Frankenstein. The 1944 film put together its plot better than this entry in the series, since the plot here does not give equal time to each universal monster. Dracula's plot is the largest at first, but soon vanishes only to reappear at the end. Wolf Man is the star of the show, but his story never really develops, and is essentially one more version of the plot in which he always finds himself. The Frankenstein Monster receives the coldest hand, since it appears in the film simply as a last-minute idea. , and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. The story of the doctor who unites the three is the most interesting, but this is a bit disappointing since it is not the reason why people will see this movie. The acting is good enough, with John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr., once again, making sure that his character is bathed in a tragedy. Glenn Strange has nothing to do, and Onslow Stevens proves that Dr. Edelman is the highlight. In general, this movie will not do much for anyone who is not a fan of Universal horror; But as the monster movies go, the House of Dracula is worth seeing.
