As an English teacher, I appreciate movies that do more than tell a story. Good movies, like good literature, make you think, reflect and predict. This movie made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes a risk and uses the omen, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also like the fact that, despite the choices made by the characters in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or criminal as other movies I've seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share good chemistry with each other. Excellent soundtrack, with songs that you do not listen to on the radio. It is a movie of a journey through life / spontaneous journey that deserves more than a second glance.
