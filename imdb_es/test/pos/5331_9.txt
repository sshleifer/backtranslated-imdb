Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to jail for the murder of an autistic child. When pressed with the question 'Why?' he does not have an answer While in prison, he meets Pearl (Don Cheadle), his teacher, who decides to take the matter into his own hands and helps Leland discover why he did it. Throughout this film, we learn all about the troubled life of Leland, including his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey) and all his sad life. <br /> <br /> This movie is Matthew Ryan Hoge's second film, and it's spectacular in almost every way. This is a movie that will leave you thinking at the end and wondering how everything works. The movie is quite dark, but if you can handle that, then you will realize how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is not a bad boy. There is no one you can blame for anything that happens. There are no stereotypes, and the public is not trying to prove that Leland is guilty. Instead, we sit down, relax, and observe how this boy's life unfolds throughout the movie. All the problems described in the story are very real. Drug addiction, parental expectations, overwhelming sadness; All of them exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling offers one of the best performances of his career in this film, like the depressed teenager Leland. His father lives in Europe and really does not care much about his son. The only person she loves is Becky, but she has her own problems. He knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the movie, 'you want a why, but maybe there is not one. Maybe this is something that just happened. There is a why, but we did not discover it until the end. Seeing the movie, the audience is surprised that such a young person can know a lot about the world. Leland notices things that people tend to ignore. <br /> <br /> A particular scene that provoked the reflection that really affected me was during one of Leland's conversations with Pearl. Pearl has just cheated on his wife and when Leland asks why, Pearl replies that he is only human. Then Leland says something that never occurs to anyone: "Why do people just say when they've done something wrong?" <br /> <br /> Chris Klein provided another fantastic acting job. In the film he plays Allen Harris, the boyfriend of Becky's sister, Julie (Michelle Williams). Although he is not one of the main characters, I was surprised at how deep his character was. You can relate to Allen a lot. You know how much he cares about the Pollard family. It is as if they were his own flesh and blood. At the end of the movie, you realize how far I would go to help them. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a masterpiece that has been ignored by many people. However, if you take the time to see it, you will most likely see that everything I mentioned above is true. And once you have finished seeing it, you will never see the world in the same way again. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
