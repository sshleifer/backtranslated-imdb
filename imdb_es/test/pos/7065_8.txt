I can hardly call this a great movie, but it is entertaining. In my case, by the time this movie was released, I was the same age as some of the junior campers in the movie. For me watching this movie brings back memories of my years of camping. While some of the jokes that take place in this film, such as taking the camp director to his bed and leaving him by the side of a road, hanging in the trees or on a lake, are a bit exaggerated, some of the other jokes are not. When I went to the camp, campers and counselors did similar tricks, such as running underwear to the flagpole, battles in canoes and boys raiding the girls' hut. As I grew older, I noticed that the assessors carefully orchestrated the nightly raids on the girls' cottage in which I was participating so that we would not find the girls in embarrassing situations, but at that moment I thought it was real and fun. That's what MEATBALLS (MB) is. <br /> <br /> MB captures not only the scenic beauty of the camp's surroundings, but the beauty of being young and carefree. MB gives a great example of pre-teens, teenagers and young adults who live their summer without worry, apart from the guys who relate to the girls and girls who join with the boys and the booth, and have as much fun as they can before go back to high school high school and college. The opening title song that says "Are you ready for summer? ... no more homework, no more books, no more teachers that look dirty ..." describes exactly how school children see summer. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink. What child, nerd or athlete, did not spend the whole camp trying to snuggle with a pretty girl? What kind did not want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? While these two characters are a little exaggerated, I bet that everyone who watches the movie can not help but like these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown of PEANUTS and Jack Tripper and Larry Dallas of THREE'S COMPANY. I would bet that most viewers even applaud Spaz in the egg transport competition and Fink when he tries to "beat the stomach" in the hot dog eating contest. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film had children and counselors of normal appearance. There are no super models for counselors or campers who wore fashionable clothes. It's fun to just relax and watch this movie and remember when life was as fun as this one.
