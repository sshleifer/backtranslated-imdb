I gave this show a chance because of Jaleel White, not because of his Urkel character, but mainly because of the Sonic the Hedgehog XD voice. Anyway, as I said, I gave it a try, and I really liked it. I never became interested in the character of Urkel, so I was pleased to see White in a role that was not the nerd always so annoying. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (first called Calvin, but in the second episode, they all started calling him "J") was very entertaining and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was when J was dating the former Cowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid. ("Do not talk that way about my mom!" "This is an adult conversation, stay down there!"). The only calf I have is that the program had to have 3 main characters, but Mr. White's character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two (who are married) always had the stories behind ... It's not exactly good that a story about those two pregnant women is possibly in the background for J. taking care of his girlfriend's dog ... <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I really wish that this show lasted a little longer. Unfortunately, it seems that people were not interested in Jaleel White as anything other than the annoying annoying nerd known as Urkel ... <br /> <br /> I hope they at least put it like a whole DVD box.
