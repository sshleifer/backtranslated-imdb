I really liked that movie! It is worth the long execution time. Although I need help with the end ... <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The final photo of Marie at the end: this suggests that she is still looking for Renaud? Or possibly that she was the one who wanted to revitalize the 13th? (She seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to Colin in the first place.) I do not understand it very well, but I know I really liked it. So, if someone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it, please explain the ending. <br /> <br /> Thanks
