This is really a movie you need to see twice. When I saw this movie for the first time, I felt really attracted to the story. While most of the story takes place inside a hotel room, the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake, wonderful allusion) and Daphne share take you out of your room and into your world. Through their conversations, you feel the loneliness and pain that each one feels. The soundtrack accompanies the film perfectly, darkly, lo-fi and intriguing. When you watch the movie the second time, you can pick up all the tracks that you missed the first time, which leads to one of the best finals I've seen in a long time. I hope to see this movie find a distributor for the DVD to make it more accessible. Great movie, you will not be disappointed.
