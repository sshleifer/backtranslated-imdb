My dad had this movie as an 8mm reel. I loved it when I took out the projector, stuck a sheet on the wall and played Gerald McBoing Boing. I was fascinated by the idea of ​​a child communicating through sounds. <br /> <br /> Nine years ago, my son was diagnosed as autistic. The doctors asked me questions about my son, such as "How do you communicate with you?" I would answer: "Have you ever seen the caricature, Gerald McBoing Boing?" I would love to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his educators, this is how my son sees his world. <br /> <br /> Recently, I spoke with a digital transfer specialist who indicated most of the 8mm personal movies. It did not contain sound until the mid-seventies. I think I was very lucky to experience the images and sounds of Gerald McBoing Boing in 1972.
