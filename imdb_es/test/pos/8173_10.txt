I have nothing but good things to say about this film of good taste and touching. I think the effort of the director / writer of the film is brave and inspiring. I loved this movie, not only because of the fantastic story (which needed to be told), but also because of the way the actors presented the story. This is not another superficial "gay movie" that describes stereotyped characters in humorous situations. This was a memorable and impeccable effort to show people that love really has no limits, and love is still as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. <br /> <br /> Another thing that moved me was how well I could relate to the emotion represented in this film that surrounds the departure of one of the main characters. We all have to go through similar situations living in the society in which we live and feeling that feeling of detachment for everything that is "right" and "normal". I give my most sincere praise for this fabulous and courageous story.
