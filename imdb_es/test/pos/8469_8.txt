It was on a day in 1891 when the Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss, Thomas Alva Edison, with his remarkable work in film development. After many experiments, Dickson was now able to capture real life scenes with his camera and reproduce them through his invention, the Kinetoscope, as if a fragment of time was preserved in the celluloid. Soon, the Dickson Kinetoscope would become a great success as a new form of entertainment, with many people eager to pay the nickel that was charged to see people dancing, or acrobats performing stunts through the "peepshow" of the Kinetoscope. However, the invention was not complete, so that it can capture real life in the film as we know it, the sound was necessary in the movies. So Dickson kept experimenting and this short experiment, the first Kinetophone movie, was the result. <br /> <br /> In this experiment, codenamed simply as "Dickson Experimental Sound Film," director William K.L. Dickson is standing in front of a recording cone for a cylinder of wax (the oldest method of sound recording), with his violin in his hands, playing a song called "Song of the Cabin Boy". The idea was to record the song on the cylinder at the same time the camera recorded its movements. To demonstrate that it was a film, two of Edison's "Black Maria" decided to dance a little in front of the camera. Unlike what the author Vito Russo stated in his book, "The Celluloid Closet," this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality, since it is obviously a reference to the solitude environment of the laboratory, similar to solitary sailors whom the "Song" of the Cabin Boy "was dedicated to (the title that Russo suggests," The Gay Brothers ", is actually anachronistic since" gay "had no homosexual connotations in the late 1890s). Unfortunately, Dickson could not achieve the desired effect, and the Kinetophone could never really produce the synchronized audio with the images, although it had the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images, the synchronization of the Two elements were not exactly effective, and the sudden appearance of the Cinematography of Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re caused Edison's team to focus on the projection systems and, finally, Dickson left the company ... Fortunately, in 1 In 998, Dickson's cylinder with the sound of the film was reconstructed and film editor Walter Murch did a restoration of the experiment as planned. Finally, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" could be heard with synchronized sound, as his creative inventor had thought. While it was not a successful attempt, this extraordinary film is a testament to the enormous genius of Kinetoscope's father. 8/10
