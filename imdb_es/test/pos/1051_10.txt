"Christmas In Connecticut" is a jewel of a classic Christmas movie. While it is less known than others, it is a delicious way to spend an afternoon on vacation. I see it every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is perfectly presented as, Elizabeth Lane, the single career. Long before it was popular, Stanwyck embodies the rising single girl. His apartment in New York and his friendly "uncle" restorer around the corner typify the single girl in the city. You still can not cook, but write a column of housework for a magazine! <br /> <br /> Dennis Morgan also has the perfect role of our war hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the incredible Elizabeth Lane. After getting lost in the sea, all you want is to spend Christmas in a "real" home. What configures the charming and crazy story that evolves. It's fun from start to finish. We should all have an uncle Felix too!
