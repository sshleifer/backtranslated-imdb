This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'The Hollow'. You could argue that the real mystery here is not the best of Christie's, but what makes 'The Hollow' special is the characterization and I discovered that the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. In such a uniformly good cast, it is difficult to select outstanding performances, but I must say that Sarah Miles is simply perfect as Lucy Angkatell. What is extraordinary is that it not only conveys Lucy's beauty, tactlessness and kindest qualities, but also manages to draw out the underlying truth that, in fact, Lucy is not really that good! Megan Dodds is also very good since Henrietta and Claire Price affect Gerda a lot. John Christow is really a pretty nasty character, but Jonathan Cake, however, manages to make us see what his women see in him. <br /> <br /> As I said, the script follows the story quite faithfully. The only disconcerting thing I found was that the relationship of Midge and Edward really comes out of nowhere and I think part of it must have ended up on the floor of the cutting room. However, it is a secondary story and the main story is very well done. Everything looks beautiful too, it really captures a perfect English fall. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie in all aspects and it's worth seeing.
