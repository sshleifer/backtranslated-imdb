For those of you who are still in the dark, I will not ruin this Christie, since it is definitely one of your best works, and I stress that you should see her the next time you have free time! If any of the adaptations should be observed before (or instead of) reading the book, I would suggest "After the funeral" for the following reasons. <br /> <br /> I wanted to praise the performance of Monica Dolan (Miss Gilchrist), whose partner and companion, Cora, was brutally murdered at the beginning of the film. Her portrayal of a shocked, nervous and insignificant woman is actually moving, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another person who travels alone on "the journey of life". And when the killer is revealed typically in the outcome of Poirot, Dolan's reactions to the revelation act at their best: you feel as angry with the murderer as you sympathize with Miss Gilchrist ... something unusual in history of Christie. <Br /> <br /> Although there are a couple of discrepancies between the adaptation of the novel and that of the film, as usual (the business of the will may have less sense in the film), the incredibly luxurious recreation of the Postwar England, a very high caliber of Acting and directing, and preserving (if not increasing) the mystery and intrigue of Christie make these discrepancies insignificant. <br /> <br /> Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team to elaborate this masterpiece of the murder mystery theater, and the producers that gave it the green light! Bis!
