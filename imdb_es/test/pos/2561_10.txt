I chose to watch this movie only for one reason and only one ... Samuel L. Jackson. I like it a lot, a lot. I had not seen any advances or trailers of this film that was overlooked, so I went in without any real expectation. <br /> <br /> Jackson did not disappoint LÃ¡zaro, a bluesman who does not know much luck in the depths. South, and perhaps offered his most powerful performance, including playing and singing a number of excellent blues songs. But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best a hollow head in real life, who took on the role of the victim of sexual abuse Rae and turned her into a credible, almost even nice character. Seeing the decidedly non-sexual evolution between Lazarus and Rae was simply amazing. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake, the pop star turned actor who wants to be an actor, should once again cause "performance flaws in the locker room" and dance on a pop stage. His mainly forced performance distracted, at best, from the real story here. <br /> <br /> This film is raw, gritty and sometimes quite "in your face". Not everyone will like it. Those who do, however, will move it quickly to the top of their favorites list.
