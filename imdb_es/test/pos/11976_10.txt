If you want to have a good time, this is THE movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Take advantage of the premise: there is a university that admits people with minimum qualifications from BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, BE, M.Tech and BCA. Therefore, you must take into account the time consumed and, therefore, it is obvious that all students are over 40 years old. In addition, the school admits students from a 'heavier' dispensation and has a P.Hd course in weight loss and the only student who did not. Of course it's Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in the past life. Still not convinced? OK, keep reading. <br /> <br /> Here is a scene. Akshay Kumar, a university student, is chased by Arman and he pulls out a bazooka and shoots him. Then throw grenades. Then one of the grenades hits Akshay. But he does not die and keeps fighting, Arman, the serpent, sinks a half-foot dagger into Akshay and steps on it, but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay gets on a jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman drowns Akshay under water and finally Akshay is dead. So we think that, as soon as Arman is out of the picture, Akshay is swimming towards Raj Babbar, Director of this university. Boxing Refree + Parapsychology ka teacher + muttering priest. <br /> <br /> But nobody, I repeat not one takes the cake but one Mr. Nigam. You have to look to learn more. :-)
