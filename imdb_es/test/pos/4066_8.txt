At one time, `Buddy Cop 'movies ruled the box office. It seemed like every summer flocks of aspiring Beverly Hills police descended into our nation's theaters. No longer. Lately the worm has dried to just a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a film that is a genuinely fun and entertaining example of the genre. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston is a dedicated policeman. He is not a dirty Harry guy by any means. He is an incredibly focused professional who is completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of his duties, such as a television camera. Mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and falls into the clutches of Chase Renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for his "reality V". police show She believes that Mitch will give him the "nervous" impulse he needs to be successful, but he feels that it can be too unpleasant to take the whole show alone. Enter Trey Sellars, an actor and patrolman who has seen too many repetitions of Police Story. Of course, Mitch and Trey mix like oil and water, and great chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Trey are forced to become best friends at the end of the movie. This is how the movies of friends and policemen are supposed to work. In fact, it must be said that Showtime rarely deviates from the traditional clichés written by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There is a high-tech McGuffin to roll the ball (in this case, an automatic rifle that shoots rounds large enough to stop the tanks). There is a dazzling foreign enemy with an indeterminate accent. There are persecutions, shootings and explosions. We all know this and we have a pretty clear idea of ​​how everything will turn out. You know what? There is nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know that the worn bases will be touched, but the fun here is the journey, not the destination. Showtime does not strive to be original. Instead, their energies are channeled towards their characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime does a competent job with the action sequences, but it really shines in its comedy. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is dryly funny like Mitch. In the past, I thought that De Niro was a cold and inexpressive actor given horribly to the assault when he was asked to do comedy. Lately, however, it has grown in me. It seems to be injecting more humanity into their roles. Eddie Murphy is hilarious as Trey. The best way to describe his performance is that Trey is what Murphy would be if Murphy was not so talented and had not reached the big moment. Rene Russo has a fun time playing the show with motor mouth, Shark Renzi Chase. She traverses the film chasing high ratings from Nielson with an impressive determination. In her zeal, she revalues ​​Mitch's life to make her more camera-friendly. He even asks T. J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how to be a more "authentic" cop. Shatner is fun and plays himself exactly as we expect him to be, noisy, alien and a little unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was really looking forward to seeing Showtime and it did not disappoint. Ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed success. Today he is doing moderate business at best. It's a shame, because Showtime is fun.
