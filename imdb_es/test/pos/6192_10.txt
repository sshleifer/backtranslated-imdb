The problem with this series is that it is too real. I'm seeing it on Amazon "Unbox" and I just finished episode 2 I hate, absolutely hate, Fark, the cell leader. I can not remember any television series that had this emotional impact. Remember the old label line for horror movies "Just tell yourself it's just a movie"? Well, I find myself repeatedly reminding myself that it's "just TV." But of course it's not just television, right? The possibility that a cell like the one described here that actually operates in the United States is certainly within the range of plausibility. That is what gives this program its vicious authenticity. And that's why I hate him so much.
