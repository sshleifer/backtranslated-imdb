In fact, Cynthia Watros is in this movie while Elizabeth talks to Desmond. Although I wonder how he ended up being a 'rehabilitation patient' (?) Where Hurley is also there trying to reduce his weight (as seen in previous episodes). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this The last episode is really suspended. The end is not so understandable. I think the writer expected the audience to come season 3. <br /> <br /> I just hope that next season will give birth to more unclear / pending events that occurred. <br /> <br /> I just can not wait any longer for season 3.
