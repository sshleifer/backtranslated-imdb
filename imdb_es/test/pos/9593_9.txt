I think this television movie was broadcast for the first time the same week that Manchester United played in the Champions League Final (1999), many articles related to football were published that week and this was an absolute highlight. <br /> <br /> It was played in all the clich√©s that occur every season during the FA Cup, that is, the weaker ones below, the clothes / the lucky pets, the name in the cup, etc. and it turned out to be brilliantly fun. <br /> <br /> I am Surprised, it has never been repeated before other great soccer occasions, even now that the World Cup has just started. <br /> <br /> Some previous publications of non-soccer fans have said that they still love him, but a football fan will find it very funny.
