As someone who often despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching it, I was in a hysterical attack. Yes, it is sexist, rude and extremely coarse, and I loved it. As some comedies only have one or two comic scenes, this movie was "laugh-a-thon". I have never seen such an original comedy as Ali G Indahouse. For a comedy starring Ali G, this would be worth an 8 out of 10. Absolutely Brilliant.
