A radical and deeply moving love story with powerful performances by Ralph Fiennes, Willem Defoe and Juliette Binoche. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a badly burned man (Ralph Fiennes) who is taken off a plane during World War II and tells his nurse (Juliette Binoche) his story. <br /> <br /> Just before the war, he fell in love with the beautiful Katherine Clifton (Kristen Scott Thomas). However, she is married to Jeffery Clifton (Colin Firth). ) and the two begin a passionate and forbidden adventure. <br /> <br /> A very disturbing and tragic story of love and desire in front of some absolutely beautiful places in the desert. I must especially see if you are a fan of Anthony Minghellas work, but be prepared to shed many tears is very moving, especially at the end.
