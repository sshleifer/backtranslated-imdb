Passion in the desert exemplifies larger space. It is a visual narrative, illuminated by the magnificent cinematography. Passion was filmed in locations in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia and Tunisia. <br /> <br /> We are in Egypt, 1798. Augustin, a Napolee soldier, escorts the writer and artist Jean-Michel Venture De Paradis on an official mission to document, measure, draw and paint the cultural landmarks of Egypt: his dunes, stupendous ruins, and mysterious people. <br /> <br /> But can you really "document" majestic sand landscapes, fractured buildings and wild bedouins? Can it really capture the essence of Egypt, nature, man and time? <br /> <br /> Jean and Augustin are lost in the dazzling golden golden desert, whose immensity overwhelms their senses. <br /> <br /> "You can not get lost in Egypt! There is the Nile, and there is the sea!" says the dehydrated Augustine, and soon discovers an ancient and sinuous cave that leads to a palatial ruin . <br /> <br /> Delirious and almost delirious, try to rest; a disconcerting sound wakes him up; his eyes, body and emotions become hypnotically trapped in time as he stumbles upon a sensory and sensual experience ... <br /> <br /> A wild and elegant female leopard stares at him, and begins his love relationship. ... <br /> <br /> A daring love story, a daring movie.
