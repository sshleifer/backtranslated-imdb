The first time I met Jennifer was when I was out of town when she appeared on television in the middle of the night; I fell asleep before it was over, but it stayed with me until I had to track it down. Its appeal is that, although it does not have much, it weaves an intriguing atmosphere, and because Ida Lupino and Howard Duff (the man and the wife of real life at that moment) show a seductive and discreet chemistry. Lupino plays a woman committed to accommodating a vast California property whose former caregiver, Jennifer, disappeared. (Shades of Jack Nicholson in The Shining, although in this case it is not Lupino who goes crazy). Duff is the city boy who manages the finances of the farm and gives a shine to Lupino, who decides to play hard to get it. She becomes increasingly involved, not to say obsessed, with what happened to her predecessor in the old dark house full of descending stairs and closed basements. The atmosphere and the romantic game are, by far, the best part of the film, since viewers are likely to find the resolution a little disappointing, but there is not much to do (except a small chill in the end that anticipates Brian De Palma's filmic codas, but it's well done and, again, it stays with you Extra added attraction: this is the movie that featured the song "Angel Eyes", which would become part of Ol 'Blue's standard repertoire Eyes
