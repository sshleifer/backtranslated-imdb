"Dope Sick Love" is a really remarkable documentary made for HBO about two couples of lovers addicted to heroin who walk the streets of New York. I managed to catch him one night by accident and found him absolutely fascinating. There is no narration and we never see any interview with the subjects, the camera simply follows them, like a third eye, completely distant. People in a row do not even realize they're being filmed! (Or, at least, it seems they do not care). The images are incredibly sincere. Some of the most sincere I've ever seen. This is as real as it can be. The details of what it is like to be on the street and be addicted to heroin. We see them annotate, shoot, make up, hurry up and even pass themselves off as police to steal people, and over a million other small details that less prominent documentary filmmakers would leave behind. It is really horrible. Like seeing a man desperately looking for a solution, he lost. I found myself praying for him to find him, only for his suffering to end temporarily. And when he finds it, the boy literally dances on the street. <br /> <br /> The cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very evident upon seeing this. EVERYTHING is about getting the following score for these people, but the next score is worth it for the immense problem they are going through. <br /> <br /> I would love to get a copy of this, if anyone knows where it is available. Highly recommended, if you can catch it on HBO.
