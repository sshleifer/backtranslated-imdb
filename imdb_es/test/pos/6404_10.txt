Right now I'm watching "The Big Chill" on DVD. One of his actors is Meg Tilly. I looked it up in IMDb, which led me to read the Meg biography I mentioned and it reminded me of Meg's sister, Jennifer Tilly, whose filmography included "Key West," which was one of my favorite programs for my wife. Then I read all this thread of reviews. <br /> <br /> Wow, I also loved that show and I agree with all the feelings about the rarity and uniqueness of the characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Like most others, I would like it to be on DVD or otherwise available. <br /> <br /> The last critic says he sees it in the reps, so I'd like to know what network, channel, day, time it is. <br /> <br /> So, if anyone knows how we can watch the episodes of "Key West," let us know.
