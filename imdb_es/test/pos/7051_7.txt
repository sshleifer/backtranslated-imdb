The plot is predictable. It has been done many times in other movies. You have competing summer camps: rich children versus low-performing children who compete to "boast" about rights in typical camps, while children and comforters look for jokes, sex and "a good time! " "Are you ready for summer?" Meatballs is the first (and best) summer camp movie for comedy to feel good. As others have published, it is not Citizen Kane, but this type of film is not meant to be. The movie works because of the wonderful comic timing and the classic quotes of Bill Murray. His scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the child's self-esteem are very good. The phrases of Bill throughout the film are very funny. <br /> <br /> I also like that this film is not dirty or explicit like so many other movies of "teenagers in the camp" of today. There are some slight sexual innuendos and maybe one or two vulgar words throughout the movie. But Meatballs is the kind of teen movie that is really appropriate for younger people. It was classified as PG. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you have to watch several times to get all the jokes. When Bill Murray is on the screen or doing one of his classic "PA Announcements", you are attracted to the movie. Bill seems to take the movie alone. But he does it so well, that when you see Meatballs, you will realize that this is the movie that made him a star! A side note of this review is to avoid ALL the aftermath of the movie Meatball. They are horribly bad.
