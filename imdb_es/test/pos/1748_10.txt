Normally, I am a typical "spooky and hateful" girl, but after watching this movie (on YouTube, of course), I have different perspectives. And I did not know that my favorite animation studio: Fleischer made another film about the insect community whose garden in the city is threatened by humans (lit cigarettes and cigarette butts, steps, etc.), and how a young grasshopper called Hoppity Save the day and win the heart of Honey the bee; I love the lovely Mrs. Honey. After watching the movie, the bugs reminded me of some of the "jitter bugs" of Don Bulth's Thumbelina. And outside the songs of the film, I love "We are a couple in the castle"; When I sing that song, it almost makes me cry. <br /> <br /> This wonderful movie was the second (and last) movie that came out of the Fleischer studio. Originally, the film would be released in November 1941, but since Fleischer's rival, Disney, launched Dumbo weeks earlier, Paramount changed the date to December of the same year, but Mr. Bug unfortunately fell into a trap, which then It has been made. of terrible time. Having the misfortune to open two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Bug was a financial disaster and led to the expulsion of Max and Dave Fleischer, from the studio they had established in 1919, and reorganized the company as Famous Studios. Another important factor in his departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer no longer spoke to each other due to the disputes (how sad it was). In general I love the two films of the Fleischer brothers. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
