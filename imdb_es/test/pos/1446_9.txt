Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict who returns to his Chicago neighborhood after an extended stay at a clinic. He plans to stay away from the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can not avoid meeting his old friends. He had originally been arrested not on drug charges, but because he had been caught in an illegal poker game. His skill in poker has earned him the nickname The Man with the Golden Arm, and the men who run the game, one of which is his previous heroin connection, want him to try again. Meanwhile, Frank has to take care of a woman who was injured in a car accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and recover with his former girlfriend, Molly (Kim Novak). The movie is great to put us in Sinatra's mental state. When he felt confident at the beginning of the movie, I felt good for him. But, when a promised phone call does not arrive one day, it descends to depression and returns to the slap. Later, when he finally arrives at the audition, he arrives completely tense. Your shame when you can not play the right rhythm is devastating. He had such big dreams, and the other musicians do not even pay him any attention when he runs out of the room. The film moves quickly and shows the problem of Frank's drugs from a realistic perspective without becoming an image of social message. The actors are uniformly well. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best of his time. The only thing I do not like about the movie is the ending. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I really like the Zosch character and Parker is very good at the movie, I could have done a little more to complete his background story. The ending is a little too much pat. While there will surely be a pathos that will remain with the characters after the movie closes, Zosch's death ties all the loose ends a little too neatly. Frank is free to love Molly and will not go to jail. Also, your dealer is dead, so at least the immediate threat is gone. Well, I guess in Hollywood there is always a desire to tie everything together in a small, neat package. It damages the film a bit, but, in its current form, it's still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction I can think of. 9/10.
