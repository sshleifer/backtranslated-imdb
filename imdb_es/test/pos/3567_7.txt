- A group of bandits steals from a train the shipment of gold that it carries. In their flight, the bandits separate. The only thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he can speak. Three men have a different part of the "clue" that will lead to gold. Can the banker, the bandit and the bounty hunter work together to locate the lost booty? Or, will they kill themselves first? - The plot is an obvious takeoff of The good, the bad and the ugly of Leone. Several scenes from the film are also removed from other films by Leone, Corbucci and more. But, for me, it is done in a way that shows no disrespect to the original work. On the other hand, Any Gun Can Play lovingly parodies some of the greatest films in the history of Spaghetti Western. The initial scene of three men traveling to the city and the final confrontation between the three main stars is a wonderful tribute to the SW who arrived earlier. <br /> <br /> - Castellari adds many nice touches of its own. - the reflection in the spilled wine, the entrance of the stranger with the bright red background and the playful way in which the gold is discovered at the end. Although they are incredibly incredible, many of the fight scenes are well represented and directed. Two scenes of the fight in particular (the market fight and the fight of the bathhouse) are very well done. Nor is he afraid to try different things with his camera. Tight close-ups, shots from above and shots at the corners are common in Any Gun Can Play. <br /> <br /> - Another advantage is the cast with which Castellari had to work. George Hilton is always good at these movies. Gilbert Roland is literally playing Gilbert Roland. And SW's newcomer, Edd Byrnes, has his thing with the two SW veterans. The characteristics of the cast of support, among others, the usual Gerard Herter of SW. <br /> <br /> - No weapon in play should be taken too seriously. You can find nice touches of humor throughout the film. If this is possible with a SW, it is more of a "feel good" movie, which is reminiscent of some of the Terence Hill / Bud Spencer films.
