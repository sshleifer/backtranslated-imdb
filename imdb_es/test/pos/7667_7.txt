Viva Variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody and a tribute to the programs it represented. <br /> <br /> It was more directly a model of the classic classic of the 70s, "The Sonny & Cher Show", with Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney playing a divorced couple who was forced to organize this program together. , the female of the couple that stands on the male, and the constant barrage of "insult humor" that the couple threw at each other, plus sketches of comedy and performances of what is more kindly described as acts of "specialty". <br /> <br /> The "hybrid" was the mixture of reality and fantasy. Of course, there was not a "Mr. and former Mrs. Laupin", and the program's announcer, Johnny Bluejeans, was also equally fictional. But all the acts that were performed were certainly real, and some were even entertained! But there were also some acts that clearly would have been more suitable for the old "Show de Gong" by Chuck Barris. <br /> <br /> The show itself was really more like an extended sketch of "SCTV" (it originated from the MTV series, "The State" after all), and some would suggest that it would have been better as a five-minute bit in the mix of a program like that, instead of an independent series. But "Viva Variety" should certainly get high marks for the original concepts, and although it was often weirder than fun, it was certainly worth it, especially when they traveled to Las Vegas and brought even brighter performances. It is unlikely that we will see something like that on television.
