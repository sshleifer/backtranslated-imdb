I just watched the movie, it's actually pretty good. The trailers left me the impression of another Dujardin film for a single man, turned into a movie (Ã  la _Brice de Nice_) or a stupid and expensive French comedy. Surprisingly, it is neither. Secret agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows it, whereas I've always found James Bond to be stupid, but he acted like a smart ass. The dialogue is witty with much ironic humor that one would expect from a British film instead of a French one. Women and music are beautiful. A refreshing trip to the past, when the bad guys were ex-Nazis or Soviet brutes, cars shone and France had colonies!
