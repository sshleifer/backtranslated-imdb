I do not know how I would feel if I lived in the United States. I would watch some preview scenes, announcements, I would know, Sidney Pollack directed it, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas starring. I would watch this movie as soon as possible without reading any negative reviews. Would it be a disappointment? <br /> <br /> I read many reviews that say how bad this movie was: this is a boring, long movie, without passion, and it's not interesting. Harrison is made of wood, cold. The sublots must be cut. Too serious, particularly for Harrison Ford. I'm interested in the subject, and I like Harrison Ford in films that are not actions. I also like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. So when I read the reviews on the IMDB website and then on other sites and then in the Hungarian film magazines in February, I was wondering what the movie was. Anyway, there are movies, directors, stars, what I want to see despite the criticism. <br /> <br /> I can understand people who think that this movie is boring and cold and has no passion, but I feel different. . It's true that I liked Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French movie, I do not know what its title is in English or in French). Basic of these films is the development of a love. <br /> <br /> I think Random Heart is a nice and interesting movie in its own way. <br /> <br /> It may be true that the sublots - the election of the congress and the investigation of the police after a corrupt policeman are not well written, are not elaborated in details, but add something to the main character of the woman and the man work. He will suspect and almost lose his best friend (then the woman too). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: the death and deceit of our wife / husband. One is from the woman: this is a tragedy, but life goes on. She does not want to cry forever. What she wants to know, what her husband's lover, the policeman's wife, thought of her, will never learn. She is forced to behave this way. The elections are coming, and anything about her husband can become a scandal. He wants his daughter not to be disappointed with her father. The man is a policeman. He suffers from the fact that he lived in lies. He wants to know, maybe all men would want to know in this situation, when his wife started cheating on him. How long had I had a lover? He needs the help of the woman, but she does not want to, but the man is stubborn and constant / persistent. The woman can not stand it because he always enters her life and she can not forget. Their relationship is tense at first, then slowly develops a kind of silent sympathy that prefers an alliance against the outside world, tragedy. (I said it even though they made love in bed) However, the policeman, can not stop in the investigation, can not stop and can not allow the woman to approach him, but he starts the "love", and the woman wants their relationship to continue. But he can not. The woman notices. The ending is a bit sad, but logical and enjoyable at the same time. <br /> <br /> It was nice for me to see Peter Coyote again. I like the face of this man, Sidney Pollack. I barely knew Bonnie Hunt but she was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford did a good job. His eardrop is unusual, but at first, finally, I thought that the woman liked to be in his company despite his temperament. It was a pity I had not gotten a joke. But Ford has a good sense of humor. One critic noted (in Hungary): "Ford is charismatic against his haircut and his eardrops and we are waiting for his presence and we would like him to smile and give us an ironic note, but Dr. Jones is not smiling at us" . But smile at the end and it's so good. With the rest I agree. I like it a lot in this role. He's good at acting a little harsh, great, but somewhere in his soul he's an intelligent cop. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a determined woman, sure of herself, but closed inside. an ivory tower and she stays out of her emotions. But it is really a woman who becomes indecisive and finds support in the police. The two interesting and reserved people are among each other. <br /> <br /> Maybe the script is not good. It is full of common and banal prayers, but there are some humorous prayers of women and movements particularly of man. It's a good movie, but not for everyone, not for the general audience. I saw women under 18 and men over 45 who liked this movie better. About the latter, maybe Sidney Pollack made this film for his age group that does not go to the multiplex. Anyway, I advise people who like energy frames with action scenes, who like only the action films of Ford miss this movie.
