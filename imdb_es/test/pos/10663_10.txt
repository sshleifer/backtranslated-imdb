Originally supposed to be only part of a great epic The Year 1905 that represents the Revolution of 1905, Potemkin is the story of the mutiny of the Potemkin's crew in the port of Odessa. The film begins with the crew protesting the meat of worms and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents. There is an uprising during which the revolutionary leader dies. This crewman is taken to the shore to be in state. When the townspeople gather in a huge flight of stairs that look towards the port, the tsarist troops appear and go down the steps to separate the crowd. A naval squadron is sent to retake the Potemkin, but by the time the ships enter range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass. The exact non-historical end of Eisenstein is open, indicating that it was the seed of the later Bolshevik revolution that would flourish in Russia. The film is divided into five parts: Men and Maggots, Drama on Quarterdeck, An Appeal from the Dead, The Odessa Steps and Meeting the Squadron. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but at genius level. Not wanting to make a historical drama, Eisenstein used a visual texture to give the film a news aspect, so that the viewer feels he is spying on an exciting and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used by the Battle of Algiers of Pontecorvo. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on the typography or casting of non-professionals who had surprising physical appearances. The extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers of Potemkin. This technique is later used by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe. But in Potemkin, no person is chosen as a hero or heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes that combine in a special effect known as montage: the editing and selection of short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer. D.W. Griffith also used the montage, but nobody dominated it as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic filming of the crew sleeping in their hammocks is complemented by the elegant rocking of the tables suspended from chains in the kitchen. In contrast, the confrontation between the crew and its officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses demonstrate their anger with injustice. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing an action and repeating it again but from a slightly different angle to show intensity. The breaking of a plate with the words "Give us today our daily bread" means the beginning of the end. This technique is used in the past year in Marienbad. In addition, when the ship's surgeon is thrown from the side, his penis hangs from the rigging. It was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the meat infested with worms. This sequence links the punishment to the corruption of the Tsarist era. <br /> <br /> The most notorious sequence in the film, and perhaps throughout the history of cinema, is The Odessa Steps. The wide spread of the steps is filled with hundreds of extras. Rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit, however, the visual images of the death of a few will last in the mind of the spectator forever. <br /> <br /> The angular shots of the boots and legs that run down the steps are skillfully accented with long, menacing shadows of a sun at the top of the steps. The pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the marching soldiers and a few civilians who gather courage to beg them to stop. A close-up of the face of a woman frozen in horror after being struck by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller at Bonnie on Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the tsarist regime. <br /> <br /> The death of a young mother leads to a baby stroller that goes down the steps in a sequence that has been copied by Hitchcock in a foreign correspondent, by Terry Gilliam in Brazil and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is displayed repeatedly from various angles, which explains what was probably an event of only five seconds. <br /> <br /> Potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for those who are already committed and promotes it for the unconverted. It oozes fire and roars with the senseless injustices of the decadent tsarist regime. Its biggest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved the techniques invented in Russia several generations ago.
