I recently came across this program when the ABC family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered. I remember seeing progress for the program in 2007, and I thought it would be short-lived, and not very well written, because it was on ABC Family. <br /> <br /> Never doubt a family ABC program! This show surprised me in the best way possible. The program is not only well written, but the story lines are realistic, fun and enjoyable. I expected to talk a lot about relationships, something like "this guy went out with that girl who left me for that child ... etc." But this show is anything less! The characters are attractive and you really feel a connection between them. There is a lot of chemistry between the actors, and they can really make you feel that things are happening before your eyes. <br /> <br /> Do not doubt this show, it's really nice to see ... and get hooked on;)
