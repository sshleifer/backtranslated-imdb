Easily one of the best shows that have been made, and improves with age. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the main reasons for this was the adaptation to English made by David Weir. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend once told me that the program in its original language was more capricious and less funny than the version we all know. <br /> <br /> The fact that the program resonates so strongly for I believe that its non-Japanese fans are largely due to the inspired efforts of Mr. Weir and a winning voice-over job. <br /> <br /> Well done, sir!
