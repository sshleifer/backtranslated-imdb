For a film by a director for the first time, this is a simply incredible little movie, although I have to admit that it is a bit difficult to see and probably will offend the sensibility of many of those who see it, since the film takes a definitive position in favor. of assisted suicide. However, what I loved about the film is that I had no idea what the film was about until the film was almost complete and by then I was hooked. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent The way the theme was presented, I was surprised by the professional style of the film, with some of the best films I've seen in a short film. In addition, the work of this camera combined very well with the music and images that made the film beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a controversial movie. I myself struggle with what I think about this debate, but the film managed to make a statement in such a literate and intelligent way that I really have to respect the team that made this film.
