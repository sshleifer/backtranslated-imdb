This trash version of 'Romeo and Juliet' happens in Manhattan in the current days. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a ** hole and violent member of the family Que, and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy girl (with beautiful legs and breasts) and bisexual of the Capulet family. The eschatological situations that this romantic couple will face are very funny. Although it is a cult film (included in the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended for all audiences. If the viewer is a fan of Peter Jackson's previous films (`Braindead ',` Bad Taste'), `Toxic Avenger ',` Body Melt' and other garbage movies, he will surely love this movie. Otherwise, he will hate it. As I belong to the first group, my vote is eight. <br /> <br />
