I give this movie 8/10 in general. Visually, much of this is just amazing: the dreamy mix of an art director from Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe, and a valid testimony to the power of cinema as a serious art form . The beautiful use of color, shape, images, surroundings and the fabulous decoration of the scenarios are combined with the most modern computer graphics. So, 10/10 for that! Wow! <br /> <br /> The plot line is, well, more predictable. You know they will save the girl and kill the killer, but the story is still interesting and peaceful enough to catch you and keep you there. 6/10 for that. <br /> <br /> Twisting factor ... I will not give you a grade, but the movie certainly made me writhe, and I was watching it on a video on a television screen. Of course, it would have a much greater impact on a large screen. The graphic violence of twisted and erotic nature in a surrealist landscape, although beautiful, is highly unpredictable. The world inside the murderer's head is not, thank God, my world. Because I saw this movie on video, I was able to play a couple of sequences and I found a lot to admire the second time when I was not so nervous about where the scene was going, and I suspect that the whole movie would be worth it. see a second time, only for "visual art". <br /> <br /> General suggestion: do not take children or conservative grandparents to this one, but if you are interested in the visual aspect of the movies, Like Surrealist art, you do not mind a bit of perverted drip, and I just want to do a little "mental trip", this is a winner. Oh, and if you like girls, Jennifer Lopez is very good. <br /> <br />
