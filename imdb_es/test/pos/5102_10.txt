I saw this movie when it first came out, and I did not know what to expect exactly. What followed the overture was one of the most pleasurable film experiences I've had. An exuberant score of songs and music by the British Leslie Bricusse (from Doctor Doolittle & Wilie Wonka and the fame of the chocolate factory, besides making its mark on the Broadway music scene), and scored by the incomparable John Williams. There is not a bad song in the whole movie. In addition to some of the most exquisite filming, costume design and filming locations I've seen in a single movie. Not to mention the performance nominated for the Academy Award by Peter O'Toole, and the equally strong performance, in my opinion, by the wonderful Petula Clark. Now, since Peter is not the same caliber as a singer as Petula, he still manages to sell his songs to the audience, and that, after all, is what it is all about. This is a faithful adaptation of James Hilton's excellent book, and it deserves to be treasured by generations to come. I recommend this movie for families to see, although most men consider it a "girl" movie. But if you like a great musical movie, this movie is for you. But keep in mind that a Kleenex reserve box is just as important as popcorn for your visual pleasure.
