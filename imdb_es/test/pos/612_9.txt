The sadness and nostalgia extend to Late Chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by Japanese author Mikio Naruse, which is now in a retrospective of his films unavailable thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi, Late Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geisha, now middle-aged, whose lives have been filled with disappointments and regrets. The performance is exceptionally outstanding, particularly that of Haruko Sugimura, who starred in the films of Ozu Late Spring, Floating Weeds and Tokyo Story among others. Sugimura portrays Kin, a former geisha who has no children and lives alone with her young maiden who can not speak. <br /> <br /> She has become cynical with men and has focused her attention on money, especially real estate speculation. and lending money to his friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa), and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), all ancient geishas. Kin's friends live in rare circumstances and complain about how Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends a lot of time playing to try to make ends meet. Both Tomi and Tamae are in the process of losing their children. Tamae's son goes to work in the coal mines in Hokkaido, and Tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. Both resist change in their circumstances, but come to accept it as inevitable. <br /> <br /> Two male friends visit Kin, Seki, a former lover with whom he once thought of double suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover. Who do you expect to see again after many years? His mood is optimistic, but soon turns to resentment when he discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. Naruse cuts between two perfectly extended sequences when Kin confronts Tabe, Tomi and Tamae console each other for the loss of their children. The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are strong women who, although their future does not seem bright, refuse to see themselves. simply as victims. Late Chrysanthemums have the simplicity, humor and stoic acceptance of life prominent in Ozu's films and are a bittersweet reminder of the slow passage of time and comfort that memory and company can bring along the way.
