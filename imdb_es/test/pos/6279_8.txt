This is like something I have NEVER seen before. I had cracked all the time, I do not think there is a scene where I have not laughed. It's about a girl from the country in the south who goes to a big city to go to college. At school she becomes friends with the RA on the other side of the aisle. When she realizes she has no family to go to Thanksgiving, she invites him to come home with her. Rabecca and her family and her serious boyfriend go out to dinner one night and Becca realizes what her boyfriend is about to do ... Propose. She asks Cral to do something for him to get up and shout something like ... Sorry friend, but it's already too late. I already asked Becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago at school and she said yes. All that turns into chaos. Please, look at this classic, it's worth it ... I swear.
