I have to hold Barney by piercing my head every day; Well ... I guess there must be reasons. First, I am convinced that our children are not stupid, they are only children, but they know that (my 1 and a half year old "selects" what to see) what is nice or disgusting. Did you see the news? Do you think your children HAVE TO KNOW reality as it is? Maybe or maybe not; We (the adults) have responsibility for what we want for our children and what we should teach them. A movie of drug traffickers? News about massacres in the Middle East? Of course, children should know that there is a real life, but ... they are children; Let's give them a little mercy. What do you want for them? If you want to have children trained in weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, import them Lethal Weapon, Kill Bill, any manga anime, tell them that Santa is a depraved man who enters the fireplace directly to rape them. I want illusions for my son (do not get me wrong, I do not say that Barney and his friends are the best, in fact, the program has many flaws, I read other comments and I agree with the majority); Maybe happiness is made of dreams, or illusions. At least, I want to teach you to grow WITHOUT FEAR BUT CAUCIDO, that learns to think and believe that not everything is serial killers or kidnappers, who are worth it to grow. That, at least, can be a little happy with your own dreams. So, parents, do not underestimate your children; They know what they want.
