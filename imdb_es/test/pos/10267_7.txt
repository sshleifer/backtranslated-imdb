As with FOOTPRINTS (1975), I realized this purely by chance: it was mentioned in a review of THE LIBERTINE (1969), that I investigated when that film appeared on Italian television late at night, as in a similar scene . come to; By the way, I missed the screening of THE LIBERTINE (although I acquired it through the same channel later), but I managed to see the movie through a rental of the R1 DVD nicknamed in English during my stay in Hollywood at the end of 2005. / At the beginning of 2006. Actually, in view of the enthusiastic critics, THE LIBERTINE disappointed me: I am too carefree in the nature for what was essentially a serious subject (the sadomasochistic relationship between a young couple)! to be honest, most of the time I feared that THE ASSOCIATED WOMAN would follow exactly the same route ... but later it was widely redeemed by a perverse final turn (if not exactly unpredictable). <br /> <br /> The film is about the social reflections and the dazzling creative arts that prevail in this era: an eminent philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a journalist (Dagmar Lassander) to his elegant home for the weekend . however, it turns out that he is a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and prefers to dominate them (or even kill them)! Therefore, during the first half of the narrative, we see the heroine who suffers the pain and humiliation in the hands of Leroy (even when forced to make love to a mannequin in his own image!) .. until the tables are subtly, but, as expected, she turned: she not only emancipates herself from her control, but teaches that Man and Woman can coexist harmoniously, except that Lassander is following her own agenda staff too! <br /> <br /> The cables are perfectly fused, and the movie itself is often comical for those in the mood; in addition, it is greatly encouraged by a typically effervescent "Euro-Cult" score (from the always reliable Stelvio Cipriani) and the imaginative, even exaggerated aspect (the giant structure representing the lower section of the female form, with a steel trap where should be his sexual organ, seems to emanate from Freud: by the way, this pillar figured prominently in the frames that had previously seen of THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN ... but hardly recorded in the film itself!). Other strange touches include the absurd radio program "Sexual aberrations and the stars", and an idyll in a castle that belongs to the family of Leroy, with a secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarf servant. One of the highlights, then, is Lassander's erotic dance practically naked, an episode that actually leads the "humanization" of Leroy; Eventually, the two characters have a "showdown" in the latter's group, amusingly settled on a theme of the Spaghetti Western type! <br /> <br /> In the long run, with all its style, the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporary Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally, it is worth noting that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the USA. UU For the film company Radley Metzger, Audubon Films; He would even hire his production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To get to the edition I saw: apart from the usual deficiencies in the English dubbing department, the presentation here was marred by a rather faded appearance and brief examples of distraction from strange sounds in the soundtrack. By the way, there seems to be some confusion regarding the time of execution of the film: its duration given in various sources varies from 84 to 108 minutes; All I can say, however, is that the copy I have was published for 87 minutes. !
