I have to admit that when I first saw Madonna perform Holiday on Top of the Pops many years ago, I told my wife "another American who was surprised that everything was wrong!" Well, she was wearing a frightening wig and she was dressed horribly. I've never grown to love her like my daughter does, but I have to eat my words. I like some of his things and, sometimes, I enjoy his filmed concerts. This movie from the Confessions tour is great, even if the music is not (and it is not). I was impressed with the staging and the concepts. Madonna's performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she chose to support her. My daughter was at the concerts in London and I was crazy about that. Mrs. (Madge) has shown that my initial evaluation of her is very wrong!
