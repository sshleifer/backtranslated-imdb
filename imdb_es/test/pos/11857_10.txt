Why this movie was released in 4 states only surpasses me. I thought that this movie was a divine story. The name says it all: see other people. This movie has more logic than laughter, and I guess that's why it works so well. Common sense also appears in what appears to be another puerile sexual comedy. Alice is freezing from the cold, when she feels irrational about the way she could act for her fianc√©, not only sexually, but as a couple, and friend, etc. This begins what seems to be an almost archetypal journey for both. from them. One adventure after another leads to problems, as if it was not a bad idea from the beginning. Ingenious dialogue and comic configurations make this as fun as hell! Nicholson and Mohr set the tone of the film from the beginning and keep the promise they anticipate. Other highlights are Lauren Graham, Andy Richter and Helen Slater (in his first theatrical movie in 10 years!). Climax starts to take an insane turn, but a simple ending makes it much more enjoyable than most movies today. Mohr fans will see something different in their character Ed, and Helen Slater fans will enjoy their brilliant moments of a quick but excellent comeback. Any Richter takes home the prize for the most moralistic character. Romantic and fun, or just fun. Seeing other people is a gem, which should be noticed.
