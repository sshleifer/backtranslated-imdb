It's quite simple that those who call this film something below "decent" do not know their movies. "The Doll Master" creates a sense of fear and suspense that is rarely seen in films outside of Asia. <br /> <br /> Think of a mixture of "Manga" and "Ringu" in one, and that is what it is all about. . <br /> <br /> First-order action, first-order address, series and first-order effects. <br /> <br /> This is at the height of the best of Asian horror cinema; Ringu, Dark Water and A Tale of Two Sisters. <br /> <br /> An absolute necessity. <br /> <br /> Take it from a guy who knows his movies.
