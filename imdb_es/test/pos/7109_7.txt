This has one of the most unusual plots I've seen in a horror movie, but it's based on Universal Studios' good and solid fare: lots of monsters, beautiful heroines, villagers carrying torches. But my favorite part is Larry Talbot (The werewolf) in search of the cure for his lycanthropy. After dying in the original "Werewolf", he resuscitates and roams around "Frankenstein meets the werewolf" and "Frankenstein's House" in search of a way to end his affliction. I think the first-time viewers will find your search in this particular movie very interesting. <br /> <br />
