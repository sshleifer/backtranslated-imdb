I really wanted to write a title for this review that was not so corny or that it came out, but I still described my feelings for this program. Now I can see that it is not possible. "American Family" is one of the best programs I've had the pleasure of watching on television. Several critics here in IMDb have mentioned the word "beautiful" when describing this show. Never a word has been more appropriate. The cinematography of this show is impressive. Each scene and shot seems like a masterpiece. The lighting, the movements of the camera, the composition of the scene and the colors ... I have to remind myself that I am watching a television program and not a masterpiece of films. The score of Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang brings tears to my eyes. And most importantly, the amazing cast's performance is honest and sincere. I do not feel like I'm watching performances ... I feel like I'm seeing real life. If only real life could be so beautiful. <br /> <br /> "American Family" has raised the bar for quality entertainment on television. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to see it. I could easily reproach CBS for broadcasting this program, but I must say that I do not care who broadcasts it. I'm glad it's there for everyone to see. So I thank PBS for not allowing this show to disappear into nothingness. <br /> <br /> I have to especially recognize the end of each season. The first was pure creative brilliance and moved me to tears. I was waiting to see if the second season would also end in a creative way, and indeed it did. Again, tears. <br /> <br /> My thanks to everyone involved. You have really made a special work of art with this show, and I say it sincerely. It's a pity we only have two seasons, but a miracle we have something.
