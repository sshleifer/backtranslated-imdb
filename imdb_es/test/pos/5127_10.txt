I saw the movie "Hoot" and immediately decided to comment on it. The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant species on this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want, which is probably the case, but if they think more about the future and then think about themselves, they would do something useful! This movie is not just for children, this movie shows us that children are the ones who care more about that than adults. When I was twelve years old, I saw some water lilies and I knew that they were protected by the law and I did not even dare to touch them for fear of the law, but for fear that I might harm them. (I am currently 15 years old). The performance was excellent, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. I hope everyone thinks about what they saw in that movie! and enjoy!
