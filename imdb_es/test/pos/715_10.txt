I saw him the other night at a local station because he did not want to see guts like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'Rain' Murphy who keeps himself. He admits his crime and says nothing that he is not ashamed of it. His cell lacks all the comforts that other inmates have as books and images. The only time you feel in another area is in running. He does it often and can run a mile in less than four minutes. When a college coach finds out about this, he wants to prepare him for an opportunity in the Olympics. At first, 'Rain' does not want to be part of this, but when his best friend dies, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, period. Strauss is very good (What did you expect, something less?) And Michael Mann shows signs of greatness that would flourish years later. This movie had a bit of realism (probably because it was filmed between convicts). It almost feels like this is a true story. The additional casting is good. There are many notable names such as Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley and Richard Moll as well. <br /> <br /> My heart sank when a pompous board of directors did not let it run because it did not. Feel bad for your crime. His final act made me get up and cheer up. When they took their dreams, he recovered them strongly. This was when the television movies were really good. 'The Jericho Mile' is a jewel of a movie. ESPN Classic, please, show this movie!
