As a fan of Dan Aykroyd, I saw this movie when it was shown recently in the middle of the night on television. I did not expect much, so it was a great surprise that I liked it so much. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie Dan Aykroyd loves to make. An opportunity for him to "ruin" him and not take things too seriously. If you loved him in The Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters you'll know what I mean, and it would be wise to visit The Couch Trip. <br /> <br /> Enthusiastic fans of Aykroyd will also have fun watching all the little links to their other movies in the script! <br /> <br /> I can not describe this movie without spoiling it, so all I can do is ask you to review it. I can not praise this movie enough, and surely it should be time to release a DVD!
