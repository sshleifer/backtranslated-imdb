This was a very funny movie, which was soon forgotten, probably because there are so many comedies for teenagers and young adults, like this one. The movie is not as predictable as one might think. Crawl is an unattractive friend, but fun and loving and, most importantly, very devoted. Still, an unlikely pairing for Rebecca, who has an attractive and apparently friendly boyfriend at home. When he helps to feel more comfortable in school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become friends, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes that her boyfriend might propose it, she does not feel ready, it seems that he likes her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her relaxed partying life in college that is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. You learn what a good Crawl friend is when he tells her that he will help her out of her marriage. When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him in the place. He tells the whole family that he proposes to him, and gives him his diamond ring, which is lost all the time (it must have come out of the money or something like that ... Well, they never really show a close-up of the ring). The message of the film seemed to be not to judge people by their appearance and not to judge people before they know them. Rebecca's boyfriend, who loved his parents, became mean when we discovered that he drugged his new girlfriend after Rebecca (Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca had broken up with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was angry with him, which when you think about it is a bit unfair, since they are not a couple, but I think they started to like each other. And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed that they really became a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. They did not even kiss at any time, although there was a part where they almost did. That was one thing that most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said that it would be a nightmare for parents to see their daughters take home or a surprise, but that they were just friends all the time, even towards the end. And she did not present him as her boyfriend; even so they never told their parents that they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did it. Even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have been friends. In the 90s, for some reason, the female men were there, and there was a great type of stereo that the woman liked female men (not that there is anything wrong with that), I think it's because fact that women like the sensitive guy, who creeps It turned out to be, through his friendship with Rebecca. But when I saw the movie, I must admit that if I looked for looks, I thought I would have chosen the first boyfriend. Still it was a creative film, which tried to teach a lesson about friendship and to judge others.
