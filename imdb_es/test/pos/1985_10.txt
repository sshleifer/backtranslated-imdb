So let's start!))) <br /> <br /> The film itself is as original as the Cronenberg films would normally appear ... <br /> <br /> My intention to see that it was certainly JJL being one of my favorite actresses She is as beautiful as ever, she is beautiful! <br /> <br /> I would not say it was my favorite movie of her. Still it is quite interesting and entertaining to follow. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive, but it's not a kind of poorly made star matrix. ;) <br /> <br /> Recommend with confidence!))))
