I grew up in New York City and every afternoon ABC showed the 4:30 movie, Saratoga Trunk was one of the first movies I remember seeing as a child. I loved this movie and it has stayed with me for years. I recently saw it again and I still thought it was great, maybe I'm just a romantic, but I thought it was well done. I do not want to say that this movie was good only for the main actors. I really did not know who they were when I first saw them. I guess I knew how he acted as a quality child. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I especially loved seeing old New Orleans during the period of this movie. If you ever have the opportunity to visit New Orleans, you should see movies that show the city during that period of time, when you see some of the old houses in the French Quarter (not only on Bourbon Street) or in the residential area, you can Imagine life as it was 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I love old movies, this is a good movie for me!
