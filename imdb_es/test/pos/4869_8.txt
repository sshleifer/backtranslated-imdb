This cartoon documents the second meeting between Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner, and is definitely better than their first meeting in Fast and Furry-ous (1949). <br /> <br /> If measured by aesthetic value, this caricature would not be placed between the 5 or 6 major of the year 1952. In any case, this is a very funny short. Coyote (Vulgaris carnivore) chases the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the way and tires completely. The ingenious "Latin" scientific names of the characters are very original and have been imitated previously in other unrelated cartoons. The coyote collapses and puts a wonderful expression of ... I do not know, of freedom. These jesus-like expressions make this caricature more than its share of laughter in seven minutes. Then he has an idea, and another laughable expression is used. The slapstick jokes are all hilarious, and they mask the fact that it is really bad to inflict such pain on a poor, helpless, GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows, but who cares? <br /> <br /> The old rocket is also present. Coyote is attached to a rocket, which should produce enough momentum for him to reach Roadrunner and grab him. Instead, the rocket fires in the air and becomes a firework in the distance: eat in Joe's. This classic gag originates in this caricature; Although it is obvious, it still makes people laugh. <br /> <br /> The highlight is the pursuit through the extraction well. Both carry helmet lights, and we see the tunnel through which the two go, with only the visible lights. Here, comedy reaches a peak. A sequence that must be seen, maybe even the best sequence in the first days of Roadrunner. The final touch is provided by the writing of Michael Maltese, when the light of Coyote goes out and, without knowing it, lights a match in a room full of explosives, the surface is shown where a group of cactus jumps and spells the letters "YIPE ! " after the explosion. These small things make you laugh for only seven minutes, and as soon as the fun begins, everything ends. Rocket skates are another good idea, as is the free drink of water and the anvil on the tightrope (a sequence that appears in Space Jam [1996]). Giving the results of those out would be useless. The free drink proves to be a problem for Wile E. at the end of the second last sequence: the rocket skates. <br /> <br /> This classic cartoon is full of animations, except for the characters. Although they are very well animated, the two characters are very primitive; what could be an underestimate. Although at first it may seem strange, the humor of the subsequent sequences makes one forget. <br /> <br /> If you like classic Jones, look at this. If you LOVE Roadrunner, put this on video. Excellent entertainment (Score: 8/10).
