Incredible, one of my favorite movies at the bottom. I suppose I can take pride in not liking what "the general population" tends to pursue. Jackie Mason is hilarious in this movie, and also Randy Quaid. I never tire of his "strong arm" tactics, as in Move. It was also notable in the Christmas holidays of National Lampoon. Love that boy
