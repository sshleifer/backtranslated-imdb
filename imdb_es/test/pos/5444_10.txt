When taken together for their ideas and dissection of the current bipartisan system and the political process, I think this is a great movie. Okay, the movie was not the comedy I expected, but once I got over this, this movie really made me think. Much of what we see and hear about any choice is a joke. In particular, there is a scene of debate in this film that I felt was a masterful critique of our political debates and how they "discuss" the policies in them. I encourage anyone who thinks our process is fine to go see this movie. However, if you want to laugh at something, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not what they usually are. In this movie, they show us that the truth hurts, not that the truth is funny.
