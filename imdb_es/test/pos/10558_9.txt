This is a funny, intelligent and, in a certain sense, realistic comedy about a 14 year old girl who tries to live her first love while on vacation, and also about the complex, sometimes funny, sometimes moving, relationship between a divorced father and her. growing daughter ... and how far a woman can go (not just Nicole, the teenager) to get the man she loves. I laughed a lot with this animated scene that never drags.
