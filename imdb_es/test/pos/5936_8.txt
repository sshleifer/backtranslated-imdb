The 2005 edition of the Royal Rumble was launched live from the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. The two best WWE Championships were being defended, The Undertaker was fighting Heidenreich in a Casket game, Shawn Michaels was facing Edge in a rancor game that had been building up since last October and, of course, that each of the men was at the top Rope Royal Rumble coincides with it. Who was going to take the price this year? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerrero? Edge? John Cena? Cambric? Edge? Shawn Michaels? There was no lack of contenders. <br /> <br /> It was Batista who picked up the popular victory in the battle of the main event, but not without controversy, or should I say, a failed end. Batista and John Cena were the last two men in the ring. Batista was supposed to leave the young Smackdown! Star on the top rope but everything went wrong and both fell to the ground. The referees acted on their feet, as we had an arm raising contest similar to that of Bret Hart and Lex Luger in 1994. This made clear to the chairman of the board. Vinnie Mac walked into the ring in the manner that only he can, but was seriously injured when entering the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting with his legs spread, telling the two men to restart the fight. Batista then did what he was supposed to do for the first time and threw Cena to the ground sealing his own future with a match for the Championship at WrestleMania 21. <br /> <br /> The billboard for this year Royal Rumble had a line Very solid up, with many of the biggest stars in the WWE competing in games. Each brand had two large parties each. <br /> <br /> Raw opened the night with the match between Shawn Michaels and Edge. This was a good technical contest. Back and fourth all the way until Edge got the pinfall. This was an intelligent reserve decision and kept Edge as a contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The second match of the night was the final showdown between Casket and The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match was not a classic, but, again, have they been classic Casket matches? It was entertaining. Especially when Snitsky got involved and then Kane pulled the coffin out to a big pop. The Undertaker did not surprise anyone when he got the victory, closing the lid on Heidenreich and this mediocre enmity. <br /> <br /> The first of the two Championship games of the night was the John Bradshaw Layfields defense of the WWE Championship in a Triple Combat Threat against Kurt Angle and Big Show. This match was very good. Once again, it is not a classic but entertaining. JBL took the victory after fixing Kurt Angle. His celebration was short-lived, however, when Tststong, in the backstage, informed him that in No Way Out, he would defend the WWE Championship in a Big Steel match with a barbed steel cage. It is not a very pleasant way to spend a Sunday night. <br /> <br /> And, of course, there is no show without Punch. Of course, Punch was the current heavyweight world champion Triple H. His rematch of Unforgiven 2004 with Randy Orton was much better than the original match. It's a shame because it seems that they do not fit well in the ring and this would be an excellent fight if they did. Orton played the role of concussion very well and was defeated in The Game. <br /> <br /> So the first big one of 2005 was good. He achieved his goals. The fights ended and new ones began. Now we were officially on the road to WrestleMania 21.
