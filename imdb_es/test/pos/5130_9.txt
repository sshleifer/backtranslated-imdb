Hoot is a good simple movie with a simple message. It seemed that this movie was for small children, but I know that adults will like this movie. The plot is quite simple. A child who moved to Florida must help a soccer athlete and an outcast to save the owls from the construction of a pancake house. The message in this movie is great, especially for activists and animal lovers. The message tries to do everything possible to save animals in danger of extinction. The acting in this movie is decent. The three children seemed to have good chemistry. The music is not so bad. I liked the Jimmy Buffet songs in this movie. In general this is a good family movie. I rate this movie a 9/10.
