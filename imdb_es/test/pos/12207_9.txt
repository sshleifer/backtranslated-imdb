Surface, from the day his teaser first appeared in the summer of 2005, was a tossup. On the one hand, it seemed a concept and a plot so high that, for the passer-by, it seemed that it would work better as a moving image (or several). Also, it felt like NBC's attempt at a "lost killer". On the other hand, one may have realized that the story was too long to tell in one or two movies, and the Lost fans seemed intrigued. <br /> <br /> Then, after one (and possibly only) season on NBC, the show is in an indefinite pause that could put it in the vault, in science fiction, or fill a gap in the lineup of NBC in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond. His ratings were some of the best on the net (which does not say much), but the program has been removed from the air without a real official announcement of his future. <br /> <br /> So, is it worth it? Yes. <br /> <br /> Surface follows a continuous story format, driven by a plot with almost unfilled episodes. Almost everything that happens in the program is important to the plot, like a moving image. There are no filler episodes, which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode. However, the double edge of the program helped compensate for that; It seems that great things happen in each episode, but since it looks like a movie, you end each episode feeling that little happened and you're left wanting more. That feature of the show, although it shows how good it is. The cast is solid; The three main tracks, including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery, put into practice a solid performance in each episode, each based on their own reasons to find / study the creatures. The cast of support, including Ian Anthony Dale and the brief performance of Rade Serbedzija complete the cast well. The story begins slowly (the only thing I regret is that it does not really last until 3-4 episodes in the short season of 15 episodes), but the second half of the season makes up for it. The visual effects are impressive (the jaw will open when you see an aerial view of one of the creatures that "attacks" a ship), too. <br /> <br /> Many of the program's problems can be remedied by buying the complete first season and you do not have to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you've missed the first season and you're curious, come back and look at it. It is not Twin Peaks in terms of extravagance, but the high concept nature is combined with that, Lost and other similar programs, with a talent for action and adventure. Enjoy it.
