I Sell the Dead is a large and careless horror comedy that refuses to be taken too seriously. This has advantages and disadvantages. The 85 minutes of the film pass quickly and the film is full of sometimes funny bits, sometimes frightening, sometimes bloody, occasionally all three at once, but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the parts of the film . <br /> <The story, as it is, follows the professional grave robber Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan). The partner in Arthur's crime, Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) has just been cut off for murder and has one night left for Arthur before he loses his mind for the same crime. Arthur insists that he is innocent of murder, but there are many other crimes he is willing to confess when a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman) bribed with Irish Whiskey. <br /> <br /> Since the film is a series of anecdotes of theft of tombs confessed by Arthur, it becomes a kind of horror anthology, a series of unconnected stories, all linked by a similar cast (Arthur and Willie ) and a similar theme (grave robbery). Like most anthologies of terror, there is no consistent mythology, because all mythologies are true and occur simultaneously even when they contradict each other. <br /> <br /> It probably did not help that I saw this movie the same night as Trick 'Treat, an anthology of terror that avoids all the traps in which I Sell The Dead falls. In fact, Trick 'r Treat, designed as an anthology, tells a more unified and coherent story than I Sell The Dead, which claims to be a united narrative. <br /> <br /> The other problem with the movie (and I recognize that this is a crazy selection of nits) is the way the movie plays fast and loose with the story. Grimes kills himself with a guillotine. We might be able to stretch a point and say that he is killed by a Scottish Maiden, forerunner of the French Guillotine, but the Scottish Maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film is set one hundred years after Burke and Hare are mentioned. and were executed for murder in 1829. The robbery of tombs as an industry became obsolete with the approval of the Law of Anatomy (1832), so the film must take place before that date. <br /> <br /> I know that mentioning this is the ultimate in historical nerdiness and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all kinds of dead, undead and legendary are possible, but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy, to convince the audience that suspends their disbelief is to use something real and authentic. bounce the fantasy out of. And it's not like the story of grave robbers or body snatchers or resurrection (call it what you want) is a boring story. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is that writer and director Glenn McQuaid clearly knows the story, especially the good bits. As an example, when Grimes first takes Arthur as his apprentice, he correctly explains to Arthur that as resurrectionists, they do not steal clothes from the dead, because stealing corpses is a misdemeanor, punishable by a small fine, while stealing clothes is a serious crime, punishable by deportation or even death. So I would expect Wille and Arthur to strip the corpse at this point (and for the rest of the movie) but, of course, they do not. He could accuse the director of ignoring his writer's script, but not when the writer and director are the same person. <br /> <br /> My point is not that there should be many naked bodies in the film, what I mean is that if you are going to raise this peculiarity in the law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law, without No matter how silly it is, then you have to follow that thought to its logical conclusion. even if it means that Willie and Arthur end up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to rip off his clothes and putting them in the empty coffin, so they are not deported for stealing the clothes of the traveling corpse, otherwise do not mention the subject at all. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the historical nerdiness, I Sell The Dead is worth renting as a mild but fun horror movie that could have been much more.
