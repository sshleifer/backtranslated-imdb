The war of the hunters in everything. 5 words that I love to see. The hunters of the war against everything is an excellent Australian comedy. As the name implies, they make war on everything. It seems that they love to hit the police, especially. <br /> <br /> The Chaser is one of the best comedies I've seen and is the highest in Australia. It's in the Australian Broadcasting Corparation (ABC), which is where some of the best comedies are. <br /> <br /> He has won the awards from the Australian film industry (AFI) but he did not win the best comedy in the logies. <br /> <br /> Last year (2006) the hunter aired on ABC on Friday nights when everyone was outside so no one could see him. Well, they have moved to Wednesday nights at 9pm (a lot of better time) and the best thing is that if I miss an episode or if I just want to see it again, I can download it from www.ABC.net.au / chaser.
