I've seen this movie several times and with each display I still feel the thrill of embarking on a trip and the frustration of trying to overcome the barriers that impede the way. It is more than a simple desire to find a home; it is about the very basic human spirit of finding the way in the world, of overcoming despair, of facing the weaknesses of the characters that impede our goals. Behind these human efforts is the challenge of reconsidering the origin of life. While this film is imbued with serious ideas, it has enough comic lines to leave the viewer hopeful. It's surprisingly funny. The execution of the story is excellent! All this is packaged with a visually appealing animation. A must see <br /> <br />
