Leonard Maltin gave this movie a feared BOMBA rating in his 1995 Movie and Video Guide. What movie was he watching? Kid Vengeance or God Gun are bombs. This movie is a delight. It's fantastic. He is literate. It is well mounted. It is beautiful photographed, making brilliant use of colors. From the initial scene, the film catches your attention and warns you that this movie is a well-made satire of the entire genre of Spaghetti Western. The film is played to laugh from beginning to end with tributes to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, and the famous showdown between the good, the bad and the ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make satire work. It is a pity that Mr. Maltin has described this film as badly as he does not deserve it. You can only guess its reason. I suspect that the point of the film was completely lost and I expected something more serious than this movie should be. Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. This movie is a little gem that awaits discovery by people who care about films that can read and write and appreciate satire.
