No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest critic for Entertainment Weekly and gave this film a positive rating. And who can blame him? This is a lovely, fun and quite funny Disney movie. Who does not love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody wants to be a cat is getting stuck. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only a few years later, when I left Cats Do not Dance, I saw a movie that was very fun musically. What Aristocats lacks animation and history, it makes up for with charm. Also, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain is not that scary. It's perfect for the younger group, without being so stupid that adults do not like it. If Snoop were here, I'm sure he would say the same. Yes. Dig those CRAZY cats, man.
