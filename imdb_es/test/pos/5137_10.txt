HOOT is about these three teenage children trying to save a group of buried owls. Now, for me, I think that, in agreement, they face what is right and what is wrong. In this film, a boy named Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) moved from Montana to Florida. and once he gets on the bus, a thug Dana Matherson begins to harass him, finally, the next day, Roy hits the thug and leaves the bus chasing the mysterious boy who runs. After all, Roy finally meets the Running boy, whose name is Mullet Fingers (Cody linley) and actually his nickname that his stepsister Beatrice (Brie Larson) gave him because he can catch Mullets with his own hands. Anyway, Mullet Fingers and Roy become friends and join with Beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is the one behind all the vandalism that happened there and also later, is bitten by one of the dogs that they put there to protect the construction site. so they faced the muckle that was driving the bulldozer and everyone could see the owls that turned out to be a great movie because it showed that children can make a difference in life by facing what is right and what is wrong. that's what's great about this movie. It teaches everyone about wildlife and how important it is.
