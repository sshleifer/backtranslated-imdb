I just went to YouTube and finally saw this Oscar-nominated short film directed by Richard Condie. Previously he had seen his fun How to start there. In this, a couple is playing Scrabble. The wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but E on her side. The wife goes for a while to suck her bed and her bathtub (!) Before her husband looks at her sideways. Briefly before this, the husband sees a television program called "Sawing for Teens" with the stars that see something and the husband gets his own saw. That program is interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war that is taking place (the journalist is a skeleton here) since everyone panics outside, although the husband fell asleep during this time and thinks that a parade is taking place while he and his wife are still arguing about the game ... There are many other strange things happening before the touching end arrives. Quite hilarious and well worth watching for any animation enthusiast there is. I can not wait to see more animated shorts from Mr. Condie ...
