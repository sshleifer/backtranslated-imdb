This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really did not understand the guests. I knew they were not serious, but if they were not really they were not clear because ... I guess I'm so stupid. I do not know if this is a spoiler class, but the guests are not real like in Ali g or anything that a man has played or I think so. I love the serious look he has. It's like that program that was on a Sunday morning that I forgot the name of lol. I also really like the suit and mustache he has. It's hot enough It's insensitive, which is one of the funniest qualities. I also like the way he has subsections of the program. It makes it seem more authentic.
