This is, without a doubt, one of the most successful debut films for any director. The movie lasts only 90 minutes, but he manages to say almost everything about life and death. There is not much action, and the dialogue is minimal, but the film flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the wonderfully natural feeling of everything that happens. The performances of the drivers are perfect, and even some secondary characters get strong emotional scenes. The movie will be lost somehow in today's modern audience, but this is one that everyone should see. With sincerity, without sentimental and honest, this is on a par with the works of Ozu. <br /> <br /> Scratch my title, this is perfect!
