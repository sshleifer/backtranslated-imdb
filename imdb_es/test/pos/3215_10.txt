Woohoo! I just have to say that this show is super great! I fell in love with the show from the beginning! The idea of ​​the show is very original and very relaxing. It is also a pleasure to see the performance of the two beautiful and outstanding ladies, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! They are simply wonderful! I am especially a great admirer of Lauren Graham! It's not just a pretty face, it's also a "monstrous" actress! I'm not saying that Alexis is not a wonderful actress too ... I just like Lauren better! Anyway, it's a real pleasure to see them on the screen, "saving" words. in the words of the immortal Jim Carrey "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
