Internet is a wonderful thing, is not it? I'm watching an episode of one of my favorite documentaries of all time, "Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Days War", from my DVR in Florida, USA. UU., Up to my laptop in Kuwait; I am writing a review about this series and I just read another review of someone who really lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I would like to say that for Minh Nguyen to make the statement that the United States took the war to Vietnam is unilateral. I know that the United States was the main player in the west, but two parts are needed to wage war. The Soviets and the Chinese were the main suppliers of arms in the North, so the reason why Mr. Nguyen does not mention them as part of the blame is to show ignorance (well, I think we all know why he does not mention them). either the ignorance of being lifted up in a communist system and its political dogma, or because it is afraid to tell the truth for fear of being arrested.In addition, Mr. Nguyen, I believe that the parties on the North as the main aggressor of all The war was not shown in his country, so blaming the United States again shows ignorance, but despite that, it is interesting to read a review of Vietnam (of course you can also recover it, but I will take it as real), minus the communist this is something open, as for the mini series, because I love it, it does not focus solely on American participation, this was a war that started 15 years before the United States got involved and the series covers all the facets of history, so it is a real advantage. The footage used is first rate, all the programs of the Vietnam War that you see now will use the same material, so you will not miss anything to see this previous series. The date this series was made is another advantage. It has all the main players interviewed, what can not be done now because they are dead since old age, it is an important historical reference. In the third place, Richard Basehart adds a very distinctive narrative voice, his voice sounds as distinguished as the voice of James Earl Jones, and I think it is a very pronounced eulogy. I do not think you can find a better war documentary ever made, it's like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and transplanting it to the year 1950 and interviewing all the generals and politicians on both sides of World War II, it does so for the war of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Well, I see a certain bias, it's subtle, a subtle bias of the style of the seventies and eighties, like the NPR bias "All Things Considered", where everything seems so simple but when Blinking you end up shaking your head. In this case sample, the subsequent episodes do not shed much light on the role of the media and propaganda in general, all useful tools to influence the outcome of a war, DO NOT YOU THINK ???? <br /> <br /> From an OIF war veteran who went through the same thing 30 years later.
