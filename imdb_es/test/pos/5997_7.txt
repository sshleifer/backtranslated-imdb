This version of Gulliver's stories is definitely strange. The production adds a story of framing (for what is becoming famous) that Gulliver returned with his wife and son. In a view, unbelievably too long and, sometimes, it does not manage to maintain the attention, but the strange images and the diverse cast will keep you in search. Mary Steenburgen does the best work of the cast. Danson seems a bit out of place with his American accent. The whole asylum issue is terribly disturbing often, but nevertheless it is interesting and keeps Gulliver's travels together. The character of Danson really seems crazy, however ... in my opinion, I should have worked on being a little more believable for everyone. Also confusing goes from present to past. Does anyone else think that yhoos are the ugliest things that have adorned a television screen (or online for that)? Confusing, sometimes boring, but still highlighted by a good performance, wonderful visual effects in general and some nice parts. The first of many event films by Robert Halmi, Sr. of NBC. See for yourself to decide how it's going, but I give it * * * 1/2 (of 5 stars).
