This is the best 3-D experience that Disney has in its brands. This is certainly better than his original 1960 film, which was instead, is much better than "Honey I Shrunk The Audience" (and much more fun), just squeaking by the movie MuppetVision 3-D at Disney-MGM and even You can beat the original 3-D "Movie Experience" Captain EO. This film relives some of the best Disney music hits from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and others, and it made me smile throughout the show. This is a totally friendly movie for children too, unlike "Honey ..." and has more effects than the spectacular "MuppetVision"
