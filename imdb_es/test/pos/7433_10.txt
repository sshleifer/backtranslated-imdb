OMG!!! Did you ever think you would make a movie about it? Well, I knew they would, but I did not know when! and now he is here at last !!! when I received it yesterday through the publication, I put it on my (evil) stereo that plays DVD and instantly I had this smile huuuuuuuuuuge on my face when the cloud appeared (it looked good ... beautiful!) and followed all the others Fascinating characters of the final fantasy of the game! Including tifa and aeris, my favorites ... (they are also pretty in this) the graphics left me amazed !!!! They were really amazing so real until the last hair !!! The story is quite confusing, especially because my version of the film was in Japanese, but of course, being a fan of the final fantasy for a long time, I did not mind at all, I just read the subtitles !!! All the characters talk as they would in the game, and Reno and Rude are still ridiculous. The dragon scene is also perverse. It only looks so good !!! anyway ... the graphics were, amazing ... the plot, fantastic ... and the basic idea of ​​even having a movie ff7 ....... genius !!!
