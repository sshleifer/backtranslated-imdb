Well, let me put it this way: I've always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; I've always liked rock music, and especially heavy metal! That's why this movie is like a gift from God! I think this movie is one of the best movies in history (well, except for Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's great to listen to all the classics, like "Long live rock and roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold (Ted Nugent), songs by Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and many other legendary rock bands. Absolutely gorgeous! WONDERFUL! I hope you make more movies like this (otherwise, they are just fucking movies, like "AC in da USA" or as they call it, and "8 miles." Bulls ***!) Well, I recommend it a lot anyway! All I need is a couple of Stratovarius songs! But, except for that, it's one of the best movies in history! Ten out of ten!
