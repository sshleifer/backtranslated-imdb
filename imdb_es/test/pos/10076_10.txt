I really liked that movie. You can not buy it, rent it or find it ... but it is a guardian. <br /> <br /> A wonderful chemistry between Braccho and Walken ... and Ferrar ... <br /> <br /> Fantastic action and reactions without stopping .... I loved it. <br /> <br /> I've seen my pirated copy maybe 6 times in the last decade ... every time I show it to someone who has never heard of <br /> <br /> Find this movie and look at her. <br /> <br /> There are so many movies on TV over and over again, without the wit and style of this little movie. <br /> <br /> I did not know it was made for TV. .. my copy is a track 8 that I pirated years ago ... I hope it lasts.
