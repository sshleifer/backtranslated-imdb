In the ever-growing cinematic genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the most well-known and most faithful materials (in general) to the source ... since the character has almost 30 years of history in comics since his debut as a backup figure in the Tomb of Dracula of Marvel, the writer took almost ALL the characters and elements of the plot of the history of the comic. While the changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film were thrown on any criticism. Do not let any of your friends tell you otherwise: Blade is a good movie. If it feels too "funny" for you, Stanley Kubrick sneaks around, it's because he's supposed to. Treat it, but do not dismiss it for that.
