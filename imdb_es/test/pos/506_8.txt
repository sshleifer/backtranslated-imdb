Blade is a dark, somber but significant vampire movie and is one of the best. A little blood, but nothing really that bad. Wesley snipes played an important role in eliminating vampires. I really do not like it that much, because that's too docile, but Blade offers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie you'd probably want to see on a dark and stormy night ... that's the best to see! <br /> <br /> 87%
