With everything there is, this is a soft movie about young love. Yes, it is true that young love often does more than it deserves, but why do not people get sad with "Romeo and Juliet"? Paul and Michelle are models of good behavior compared to them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they run away and establish an ideal life, but this is a movie, not a real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been mistreated. Eventually, they have sex, but nobody is forced to do so. The film allows children to know that sex can cause babies. <br /> <br /> One thing, there is nudity in the movies. The camera does not focus on it, but it is there. <br /> <br /> The end of the film has Paul with many possibilities to be discovered. In "Paul and Michelle", they separate for a while. If you do not like the end of a movie, think of yourself. Alternative endings are not just for DVDs.
