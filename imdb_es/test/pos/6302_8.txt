The first shot of Consequences of Love perfectly configures this fascinating and absorbing film. A travellator slowly brings a lonely and unfocused figure to the camera, dragging a huge suitcase behind him. Like the central character of the film, we know nothing about him and our initial interpretation of him, his profession, the contents of the suitcase could be out of place. <br /> <br /> Consequences of love is that kind of movie. From the title one can expect a dissection of Bergmanesq from a relationship. What we have instead is a main character, Titta, who lives life in emotional exile, and apparently chooses to separate himself from those around him. If the film can be classified in any way, I would call it a mystery, since we are committed to finding out who Titta is and what it is about. What we know from the beginning is that he is 50 years old, he is great, he is composed and he is very well dressed. He has lived for the past eight years in a luxurious Swiss hotel, always paying his room rate on time, but rarely shows interest in staff or other guests. <br /> <br /> Your only real companions are a couple that plays occasional card games with. It turns out that the couple used to own the hotel, but now he has bet everything and only has the room where he lives. His love for money, antiquities and each other were his downfall and Titta seems to identify with his situation. Once he had everything, but now he is living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. His brother, a long-haired surf instructor, comes to see him occasionally, but he sees his visits as more an intrusion than a pleasure. They talk about the person Titta considers his best friend, even though he has not seen him for 25 years. This long lost friend is now a telephone engineer, who repairs the communication network that brings together so many. Meanwhile, Tittas' phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to talk to him. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, Titta makes an uncharacteristic movement and begins to make his way to a young hotel waitress. With his judgment marred by emotion, he puts himself in a course of actions that will finally seal his destiny forever. <br /> <br /> The slow development of Tittas falls out of grace and is beautifully written, filmed and annotated. The soundtrack of techno does much to increase tension as more and more secrets are revealed, the final half hour becomes a thriller taught when Titta lets his mask escape and must once again face the consequences of his actions. The finale, with a visual nod to Felini, is dramatic but ambiguous and leaves the audience questioning their motives once again. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 06/01/06
