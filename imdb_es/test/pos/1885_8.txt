Ah, the classic comedy. At the point of the movie where the brains get messed up, a two-minute scene with Bruce Campbell partially overcoming, reminds me how movies and simplistic ideas can catch him and wrap him in a full movie. <br /> <br /> For years and years, Bruce Campbell knows what kind of movies we want from him. We want to see rare movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see the cameo roles in Sam Raimi's films, and we want to see 'Man with the Screaming Brain'. Just with the title, you know you're going to surround that kind of completely silly movie, like Army of Darkness, just with more fools and less monsters. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is simple. Bruce sees the doctor. The doctor has a new idea. Bruce gets bad things happening in the way of seeing the doctor. Coincidentally, it is what the doctor wanted to show him what saves him. Hilarity occurs. <br /> <br /> With the addition of Ted Raimi as a strange Russian man, and traveling salesman Stacy Keach as Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, it's funny, that makes this movie. Full funny. Never a point of fear. <br /> <br /> If you like the fool Bruce Campbell, you will like this. So, again, why would you be watching this if you did not like Bruce Campbell?
