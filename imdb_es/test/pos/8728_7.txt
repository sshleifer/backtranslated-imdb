Anyone who has doubted the ability of Ingrid Bergman to interpret comedy should only look at "The Bells of Santa Maria." Well, she is a nun with tuberculosis who is probably in love with her father. O'Malley, (think what Luis Bunuel could have done with that), but he also showed a wonderfully clever sense of fun that made you wish the directors had put her in comedies more often. In "Cactus Flower", she is the nurse of a starched dentist, (Walter Matthau is the dentist), in love with her boss but keeping him buttoned. When she is forced to act as her 'wife' to cheat on her lover, (do not ask), she lets go and the buttons open. And it is a pleasure to contemplate it. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a harder than usual translation to the screen of a Broadway hit (you can see it's three acts). It is a French farce (it was originally taken from the play 'Fleur de Cactas' by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy), and it reaches all the right places. Matthau uses his big chin expression with a wonderful effect and a newcomer blonde actress, as it was called Goldie Hawn, almost steals the film as the dizzy lover who decides to give up his food ticket because he feels sorry for "the wife" . even though 'the wife' is having a ball. Hawn made such an impression on the part that what she stole was the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
