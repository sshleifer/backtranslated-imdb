This is a very strange little short film that initially did not impress me. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation here is certainly not pretty, although after a while, you realize that the simple and silly drawings have a certain strange charm. Probably this is because with the script as crazy as this, the animation works. <br /> <br /> The film shows an older couple sitting at the table playing Scrabble. At the same time, they are obsessed with this game or other strange activities (such as the husband's compulsion to see things, including the chair and the table). And all this happens when television warns about pending atomic annihilation: Armageddon is definitely here! Naturally, the neighbors scream and go crazy, during which time the couple unconsciously continues with this idiotic game. Wow, even your cat knows that the end is coming when the couple starts arguing about who may or may not have cheated, which leads to a very surreal ending indeed! The film deserves congratulations for being unique and very funny. Although he did not win the Oscar, he was nominated for Best Animation Short Film, which he deserved.
