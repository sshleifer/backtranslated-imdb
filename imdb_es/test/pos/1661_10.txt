There are not many movies that I would describe as perfect, but Rififi definitely fits perfectly. No other theft movie has approached her, before or after. The plot is simple, but it absorbs you. It never ceases to amaze me how fascinating the film is every time you see it. You take care of all the characters, even if they are bank robbers, because they present themselves as human beings with all their problems and failures. It is difficult to imagine another actor besides Jean Servais in the role of Tony le St√©phanois. When the crew members each talk about what they are going to do with their money and finally reach Tony, his response and the expression on his face says it all. While the 30 minute theft sequence is the most famous part of the movie (and rightly so) the movie really improves afterwards. Director Jules Dassin knew what he was doing when he decided not to have music during the robbery or the final scene. shooting, but instead inserted a great climate score during Tony's final trip to his destination. To think that if Dassin, an American director, had not been included in the Hollywood blacklist and had been forced to work in France, this masterpiece of cinema would never have been done the way it was. Certainly, it would not have been so good if it had been done like an American movie during that time. It was absolutely horrible what Dassin had to go through, but he achieved his best job thanks to it, for the benefit of all of us. I'm just shrinking at the thought of the next version of Al Pacino. Most of the theft movies since Rififi have already taken from him in some way or another. There is no reason to remake this masterpiece more than money. Leave the classics alone!
