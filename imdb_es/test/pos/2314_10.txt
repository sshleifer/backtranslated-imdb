As a former submarine officer (nuclear), I must admit that this is my favorite underwater movie (even superior to the red October hunt). Someone knew something about the submarines when they wrote the movie. Okay, it's not realistic, but it's a comedy, and it has all the "inside jokes" of the underwater force. A great cast with stereotyped underwater dudes in the "Orlando" and our heroes in the diesel boat. Definitely "DBF" by the way = that means diesel boats forever. But they want ten lines to publish this: jees is the Admiral in charge here? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
