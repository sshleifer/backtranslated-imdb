To suppose, this film involves two actors (Caine and Moran) who try to cheat a gangster. The plot is weak at best as several holes in the plot occur throughout. However, this normally should not matter since the comedy should carry a movie like this. There are some genuinely funny fragments (mostly provided by Dylan Moran). However, other times, there are long melodramatic scenes that do not add anything to the movie. The character of Caine seemed to me exaggerated. Especially at the beginning, he continually quotes Shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor. You could say that I was playing the role correctly, but the character seemed flat and without grace. In general, I would say to see only if a fan of the actors involved. Otherwise, wait for the video or television.
