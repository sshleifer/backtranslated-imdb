(The revision is from the original 1950 version, not from the restored 1980) In a land where the king does not like anyone and nobody likes the king, a shepherdess and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings come alive and run away . A portrait of the king, who loves the shepherdess, kills the true king and takes his place. A great bird, the wonder of the title, acts as a kind of hero and helps our two lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a strange and strange movie ... not surreal, very, very surreal. <Br /> <br /> The style of the background is very European, while the characters are Fliescher meet Warner, but Warner of the non-main characters. They move with realistic manners and with cartoons. <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie and it takes a bit to get into it, but Peter Ustinov as the bird is a riot, his children and the puppy are wonderful. There are policemen in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile. <br /> <br /> And there is a deep philosophy in the film, about the existence of a world out there ... beyond an underground city of Metropolis. <br /> <br /> This is a really great movie. There is something so strange and unique that it rewards you if you stay with him during the whole trip. It's not perfect, but what the heck. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to look for. If your local DVD tray has the capcom version (paired with Alice in Paris), buy. It should cost you less than ten dollars, probably around five and the price is worth it, especially when you realize that it comes with two complete cartoons, two short cartoons and several ordered commercials and other fun things.
