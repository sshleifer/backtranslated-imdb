It has cost me several visits to fully appreciate this movie. Initially, I was impressed by the stylized sets, but the rest seemed slow and boring. I thought that such a sensational topic needed the treatment of Ken Russell to overcome it. Now I find that the forced restriction (put into production by the widow of Mishima) is an asset. Some of the most gruesome aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by the corresponding themes of his novels. I think it's useful to be familiar with the novels, that's what finally made the difference for me. I still feel that the film in general could be a bit more tense and warm, but it is really unique and deserves serious attention. I love the fact that Japanese characters speak Japanese, not English. Philip Glass's score is fascinating.
