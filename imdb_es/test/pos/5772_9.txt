This bizarre movie competes with the Phantom and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's best film performances. Knotts is an accountant for a town hall in Podunk that is good at cheating citizens. They dismiss the "three competent accountants and keep the mute" (Knotts, of course, is the mute). When his cohort of garbage collection accidentally empties the wrong trash can, Knotts finds himself wrapped in a strange trap set by the town hall for him. The fun moments of the movie include the bowling alley scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely fun. Typical of Knot, the act of nervous ninny is well used, and as usual is surrounded by many crazy characters of the sixties. Actors such as Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert add to the chaos. As expected, Knotts is armed with a big car, a pretty girl and has no idea what he is doing. Fun for anyone, especially for lovers of nostalgia, but almost everyone will love it.
