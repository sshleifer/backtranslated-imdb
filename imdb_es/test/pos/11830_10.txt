A rich young man, raised as a SON OF THE GODS, must face his Chinese heritage while living in a white world. <br /> <br /> Although the premise on which this movie is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when it was revealed at the conclusion of the film makes everything that has preceded it become slightly ridiculous , the story still offers decent entertainment and a good performance. <br /> <br /> Richard Barthelmess has the main role as the sweet oriental character whose life is terribly complicated because he looks Caucasian. Barthelmess maintains the tone of his performance seriously, carefully observing the average distance (a mannerism that he developed during the Silent Days) each time his character is badly used indecently. He does not attempt to replicate his classical interpretation in BROKEN BLOSSOMS (1919) by D. W. Griffith and this is to his credit. The beautiful Constance Bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes Barthelmess miserable. She is beautiful as always, but her behavior does not attract her to the viewer and her terrible illness on the final reel is fortunately kept off the screen. <br /> <br /> The multi talented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess' unpredictable friend. Serene E. Alyn Warren and windy Anders Randolf play the very different parents of the main stars, while Claude King distinguishes his brief appearance as the English author who befriends Barthelmess. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize little Dickie Moore, uncredited, playing Barthelmess as a little boy. <br /> <br /> The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded over time to a reddish tinge. The shot that claims to be the south of France resembles Avalon on the island of Santa Catalina, off the coast of southern California.
