This is an adaptation of a book by Dirk Wittenborn, which I did not read. The young Finn Earl lives with his mom Liz (Diane Lane) in an apartment in East Side New York, crowded. He dreams of joining his anthropologist father who studies a fierce tribe in South America. Liz has boyfriends and makes coke. when they catch him scoring coca for her, one of his clients (Liz is a legitimate masseuse) a rich Mr. Osborne rescues her in exchange for being his full-time personal masseuse on his huge property in New Jersey. They are driven there in a limousine with their strings stretched out in the back seat with their dress hooked and panties. (This and some sketchy dress scenes are the only exploitation of Mrs. Lane.) Some may be disappointed, but I'm sorry I had to do all those things in "Unfaithful" to do List A. That lady has more Talent on her finger little finger that Streep, Roberts and Sally Field do in all their BODIES, and it's time to give it to them. "When they arrive, Finn makes friends with Osbornes' grandson, Bryce, and is coming of age with his new girlfriend. Mayan granddaughter Meanwhile, Liz joins AA and goes out with an AA doctor She miraculously cleans up instantly However, Finn does a lot of drugs along with sex with his new friends Bryce seems fine, but he gets jealous when Osborne takes Finn to a hot air balloon race instead of him, and this leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> The genius of the story (and the movie) is that cutting violent acts from the Blysdale tribe of the Fierce, dirty and rich, to the Yanomano warriors. However, it is a bit unlikely that when Liz discovers what happens to her son, she simply asks Osborne to act and not get in touch with the authorities or solve it in the style of Thelma and Louise. There are elements of a Gothic romance with a revelation of the town idiot. In addition, they do almost no plot or character development before moving to Blysdale. Liz, for example, as Lane Kantrowitz in "Walk on the Moon," had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at age 18 and felt trapped. This is in the book but not in the movie. However, these are minor flaws. The film will be released on January 31, 2001, more than a year after the original release date, and I could not wait. <br /> <br /> There were many red carpet moments in the cinema that I saw Film in, with almost all the cast ... except Diane Lane !! $ #% # Q $ Principal Dunne said he was out of filming a movie. I know she did not promise to be there, but I came from out of town and it would have been very exciting to see her in person. The film is a clear candidate for the Best Film, in terms of acting? Sutherland was pretty good, and so was the child Finn played. Lane was magnificent as always, but I only remember one or two emotional scenes, when he traps Finn with drugs "let's get together mother and son" and with Osborne "your twisted grandson ...". It would be better with a gesture from the supporting actress, but it will not work that way. Unless they give it to her for a "body of work".
