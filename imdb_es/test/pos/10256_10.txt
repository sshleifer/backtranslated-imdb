Cooley High is such a great movie that even with the soundtrack, the urban landscape, the costumes and the slang of the time ... it still does not feel old-fashioned. The sound track, by the way, is a timeless classic in itself. <br /> <br /> Instead, it absorbs you directly into it. That is a basic element of a good movie. From beginning to end, he does not lose the rhythm and I never tire of seeing him. <br /> <br /> Its ending is unique in the sense that it is one of the saddest and at the same time edifying of all the films. Endings There may have been some since (Backdraft comes to mind) but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.
