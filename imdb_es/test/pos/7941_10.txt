When I saw this film for the first time about 6 months ago, I considered it interesting, but little else. But he stayed with me. That interest grew and grew, and I wondered if my initial boredom and response had more to do with the real quality of VHS than with the film itself. I bought the Criterion DVD set, and it turned out that I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great movie. He is waking up, and I am sure he succeeded in his main goal: the propaganda against the Germans. <br /> <br /> That is the most common criticism against this film, and against Eisenstein, who is merely propagandist and nothing. plus. It is false. He is an incredible film artist, one of the most important that he has ever lived. At this point, the world is far enough away that Joseph Stalin can see Eisenstein's films as art.
