Greetings again from the darkness. The director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds based on a true story version of a man's struggle to control his destiny. It is fascinating to see the great Javier Bardem in his role as Ramón. His eyes and head movements leave little doubt of what is going on in his mind. The sequences of dream and fantasy are not used in excess, so it is very effective to explain why you want what you want. Instead of forcing us to answer the question of euthanasia, the real question that arises is: What is love? At each step we see people in love, seeking love or dying to be loved. The script is tight and keeps the film moving even though it was filmed mainly in a room. The cast of support is wonderful and we really feel their pain and how each member of the family deals with Ramón's decision. This is a jewel and it deserves to be seen.
