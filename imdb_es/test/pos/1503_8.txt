Honestly, I have to say that A CAT IN THE BRAIN is one of the most fun and funny movies without any intention I've ever seen. This film is full of stupid dialogues, ridiculous scenes and a plot with its own participation, starring the legendary horror director Lucio Fulci. <br /> <br /> The story is about an old director (Fulci, who also named Lucio Fulci in the movie ...) who is starting to go crazy and hallucinate because of all the vicious things he has put into the movie in the last years. He goes to a psychiatrist who hypnotizes Fulci, and tells him that he will believe he is a murderer, but that in reality it will be the bully who will do it. The rest of the film consists of shots of the "film" that Fulci directs during all this action, scenes of the reduction that kills people all the time smiling like an imbecile, and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences. Oh, and a few tits too, to a large extent ... <br /> <br /> A CAT IN THE BRAIN is completely exaggerated and ridiculous in every way. The gore is a classic Fulci, unpleasant and strong with some really decent scenes. The chain saw cut of a female corpse is pretty good, like the chain saw of a small child. A lot of stabbings, assaults and other great killing scenes make this a non-stop bloodbath. The ridiculous dialogue (LICK IT !!!! LICK IT !!!), as well as some of the incredibly silly scenes (the Nazi orgy, the opera singing slap-fest and the running over of an innocent hippy are easy to remember ... ) make this fun as hell. It's not as dark as some of Fulci's other films: CAT is more of a horror / indulgent comedy than, if it were not for being funny, it's actually a sad thing. I say take a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle into it. I saw CAT with some friends and we laughed all the time. THIS is the movie to feel good about summer ... Recommended 8/10
