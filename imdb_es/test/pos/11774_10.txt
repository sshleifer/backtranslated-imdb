Hardware Wars is a hilarious parody of 12-minute short of the original Star Wars movie, which premiered a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This movie uses household appliances such as space ships and Star Wars-looking actors to send you Rolling through the floor with uncontrollable laughter. This film has won many awards at film festivals and was the movie that inspired Mel Brooks to write his parody movie Star Wars called "Spaceballs". <br /> <br /> This is my favorite parody movie and I recommend it to anyone who does. He is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
