L'Homme Blesse is not for an impatient audience looking for adventures. There are no explosions or direct drama. Like the films of Lynne Ramsey, the director is working more deeply with the mood than with telling stories in an effective and incredibly moving way. Because it is not based on gratuitous nudity or superficial pop cult. lines of history, this is frankly one of the best gay foreign films I've seen (also, see Francois Ozon, Pedro Almod√≥var). "Do not Look Now" by Nicolas Roeg gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror movie. That movie, like L'Homme, is more than the box could make you believe. If you want to sit down and be absorbed by the subtle and transformed powers of cinema, you will love this movie.
