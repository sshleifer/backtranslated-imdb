This movie is totally amazing. He manages to be stimulating, funny, tragic and cinematic, but claustrophobic. <br /> <br /> Although the flashbacks are unnecessary, the film maintains a relentless grip and the performances are excellent, in particular Alec Baldwin. and the fascinating Eric Bogosian as the antihero of the film, Barry Champlain.
