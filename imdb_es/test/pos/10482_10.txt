The dead spots and the superficiality of an "Out of Africa" ​​postcard image almost buried any interest Isak Dinesen might have had to read. So when my brother bought me "Babette's Feast", and knowing that it was based on a Dinesen story, I did not run exactly to the VCR. But as the titles progressed, it became clear that it was not a normal movie. Jutland (where it is established) is not Africa; The cold fog that accumulates in the camera jacks is not attractive. The cold sea, closed; the heavy gray clouds; The cliffs of pale green color, frozen, are translated into difficulties that are shown on the faces on which the director Gabriel Axel draws the curtain. The rudest is Bodil Kjer as Philippa; In the midst of the innumerable merits of this film, the most memorable is that face. It resembles a map that presents us with the precious wonder of the apostolate of the father of his minister; like a labyrinth of fjords long overlooked, where the complications of perseverance and commitment of your congregation hang like gleaming shields. <br /> <br /> I guess it is Dinesen's point how the world is inexplicably attracted to Christian dedication, when Philippa is rejected by her only serious suitor (because she fears she will never live up to the rules and rigors from his little religious clique), and returns to find his lover, whom he considers the best chef on the continent. I imagine that it is also his point that Christ responds to the doubts and regrets of those who renounce worldly success (Philippa's sister, Martina, rejects the efforts of a visiting baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont, whose joy creates an edifying counterpoint to the lack of spirit that surrounds her discovery) to turn her into an opera star, the main character leaves France and has an enviable reputation and seeks refuge as a servant of two single sisters) to pursue artistic triumphs so that only God and those closest to him to Him be witnesses. But it is Axel who weaves the harshness of these people's lives with the richness of Martina's voice and the table of Babette Hersant, and produces a sumptuousness you would never have expected from a film about sacrifice, faith and religious conviction. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes this movie from other religious films is its cunning humor. "La Fiesta de Babette", that is, the banquet itself, a posthumous commemoration of the minister's hundredth birthday, is a beautifully orchestrated clash of sensibilities that offers comic moments to a set of actors that have no parallel in its subtlety. It is only this skillful comedy that enriches the solemn feelings at closing. Together they do something pious that movies rarely do. They leave a believer tremendously hopeful and unexpectedly resolute and humble.
