The main role of this western is played by Robert Walker, Jr. It is a young weapon that, with his partner David Carradine, separates after making a contract with a Mexican general. By eluding their pursuers, Carradine and Walker separate. Walker appears in the camp of the man of the law Robert Mitchum, who falls in love with Walker and makes it a protected and recovery project. <br /> <br /> This is the first of the two films that Robert Mitchum made with writer / director Burt Kennedy. . The second was the funniest The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. <br /> <br /> It's not like Young Billy Young does not have his moments of hilarity. But it is a tripartite story that involves the recovery of Walker, the search for Mitchum for the evil that killed his son and a romantic triangle involving Mitchum, Angie Dickinson and the head of the city, Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> The movie abounds in nepotism. David Carradine is the son of John. The daughter of Dean Martin Deana is in this, Walker is the son of Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and the son of Mitchum, Chris, plays the son of Mitchum in some silent flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum had his start in the westerns and always looks good. house in them. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in Rio Bravo. Walker had a brief career playing young rebels and doing a good job at it. I have often wondered what happened to him. He looks disturbingly like his father. Maybe he did not want to reach an end as tragic as his father. <br /> <br /> And that was not enough, Mitchum fans can hear the old chant eyes at the beginning of the main song. the movie.
