The movie Jennifer with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is a magnificence of black cinema. This is a mostly unknown film that all black movie fans should see. Jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles of that time, which made the film surreal quality. sometimes. I love rigid black and white movies. The film noir in color is not so good. The cast and script are excellent. Pretty spooky music is fun to listen to. Ida Lupino is one of the most talented and talented actresses. The screen. I had never seen a production in which she did not like me. Not only was she incredibly beautiful, she was a good actress. The first movie I remember seeing Ida Lupino was in Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde. . I never forgot the movie, or her. I saw her latest films as Food Of The Gods and Women In Chains, and although movies were not her usual style, she was still a delight as an actress. Hardar to Duff is always great to watch. I recommend this masterpiece. Everyone. I have this movie on VHS tape.
