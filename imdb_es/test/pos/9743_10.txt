As indicated above in one of my excellent reviews, the FLASH GORDON Universal Pictures trilogy should not be classified with the other serial publications. Because, in fact, the three have made a kind of celluloid-electronic mythology for a world of the mid-twentieth century, with a phobia of war. They remain alone in the minds of many people as THE example of what a cliff hanger was. <br /> <br /> We can remember seeing Buster Crabbhe as a guest on the NBC night talk show, TOMORROW, presented by Tom Snyder. This was around 1979-80. During the interview, Mr. Crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits. He recognized weight training and swimming, along with some healthy dietary habits, which included vitamin and protein supplements. (And he would believe it, he smoked several cigarettes!) <br /> <br /> When asked about his career, Mr. Snyder, of course, addressed the issue of his interpretation (and his strong identification with) the character of Flash. Buster said he had read and enjoyed the show in its original medium, which is a comic strip owned by Hearst's King Features Syndicate. He said he had thought it would not work once it was transferred to the screen! Luckily, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> As for the first series, it was a very good adaptation of the original continuity of Sunday Color Comics. The world is about to end due to the impending collision with the planet Mongo. It depends on Dr. Zarkov, who works independently, to launch a rocket to the wild planet to change its course. Recruit the help of Flash and Miss Dale Arden, newly familiar paratroopers from the plane landing on Zarkov's property. <br /> <br /> The Serial has enthusiasm and manages to make you feel that there is always another danger lurking. just outside the frame of the movie. The costumes and decoration are varied, from Romanesque to Oriental and Art Decco. It would be easy to assume that this was due to the frugality on the part of Universal, but once again it was faithful to the creator, the visual concepts of the cartoonist Alex Raymond (just look at the old strips as they are printed in many collections) The rockets were used before in JUST IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), a science fiction musical comedy. The other scientific laboratory equipment was provided by the Universal props department, being the main Hollywood company that makes Horror and SciFi. <br /> <br /> The cast features Jean Rogers (Dale Arden) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura) who get into a good girl vs. bad girl battle for Flash. Charles Middleton plays Emperor Ming in a kind of overly melodramatic villain, but he makes it work. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) is tempered by the sheer madness he suffered in his appearance in the newspaper. (By the way, have you ever wondered how Zar-KOV has a brogue?) Richard Alexander is an excellent and powerful Prince Barin, always so useful and so noble. <br /> <br /> The comic actor Jack "Tiny" Lipson is the surprise of the cast, stealing scene after scene as a lustful, Henry VIII as the scoundrel became allied, King Vultan, ruler of the Hawkmen. Among the others, the most notable is Jim Pierce as Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Pierce, like Crabbe, also played Tarzan in a movie, but later married the Creator of Tarzan, the daughter of Edgar Rice Bourroughs, Joan. <br /> <br /> FLASH GORDON and the two sequels, TRASH TO MARS by FLASH GORDON (1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE (1940), have been a basic youthful meal for generations, first in movie theaters and then at the premiere of Television. Like good wine, it is seen that they improve with age. <br /> <br /> We are all very happy that Mr. Crabbe was wrong.
