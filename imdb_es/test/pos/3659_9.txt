The opening night of the 'South Asian International Film Festival' (SAIFF) in New York was an event that many of us were waiting for. <br /> <br /> Would I finally see 'Hari Om'? I was tired of seeing the "promo" in a loop and the lingering taste of Nitin Sawhney's Angel song in the promo, left me begging to listen to the rest. I was impressed by the visuals? And tremendously curious about how the rugged-looking rickshaw driver would win the hearts of this stunning, sophisticated-looking French tourist! I remember that I was quite intrigued by the subject, when I read a line or two about it in the newspapers, centuries ago! Especially so, since I personally had been very fascinated a few years ago, so extravagant were the rickshaws in Jodhpur. The snow and the crowds outside the theater only increased my anxiety. <br /> <br /> Once inside the theater, I discovered that the SAIFF organizers only presented a disaster. I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about how badly the event was organized and I found myself in a difficult place, trying to explain and offer excuses to my friends (of mixed nationalities) whom I had invited on the VIP guest list. I hoped to show them that Indian cinema was not always about Bollywood. Finally, and FINALLY, the movie began to send some fresh air on our way. Or that I thought? Hari Om ?? It started with chaos and noise. Autorickshaws honking, traffic and a lot of chaos. I found myself smiling as I felt a sense of "home" filling inside me. <br /> <br /> This is how Hari Om's journey began? An automatic rickshaw driver in Jaipur? The director could not have done a better casting with this character. From the monsoon wedding to Hari Om? Vijay Raaz, despite his non-heroic appearance, takes this film solely on his acting skills and his version of the character, replete with all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in Rajasthan. He is a winner all the way. But how and where did you learn to speak English even fluently, is that the question? However, his character portrays beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity. I love his innocent portrait of a simple guy from a town? Who has great aspirations to be famous someday? and yet, he knows when to cut reality. <br /> <br /> Camille, on the other hand, enters the movie with clothes that nobody would dare to wear in a place like that. It's funny, though, that nobody seems to care too much about her dress like that. Although it looks very dazzling! Especially in the second half of the movie, when she switches to Indian attire. Her relationship with her boyfriend, however, seems very vague. It probably adds to the reality touch of certain types of relationships. <br /> <br /> Does the film take us through the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan? The amazing thing is that none of the places have been portrayed more than they REALLY are. Do you see the earth, do you see the primitive houses? You see Rajasthan exactly as it is! Still ?? There is only one adjective that leaves you with ?? 'beautiful'. <br /> <br /> This is the first director who probably knows how to portray India as it is: with the dirt, noise and all the negative aspects to which India is linked. However, make it look like one of the most beautiful places to be. <br /> <br /> Congratulations! for him because of that. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the movie that I can see, is it the rhythm? I found it quite slow in certain parts? but rest assured that you will never get bored. <br /> <br /> Nitin Sawhney's background ratings add an international flavor with class, but very Indian to the film. The song "Angel", which plays at a crucial moment in the film, combines perfectly with the images. <br /> <br /> I have also heard that, in addition to the main characters, all the other actors are actually normal people. Who had never faced a camera before? That is worthy of consideration, most of our so-called established actors? I still can not represent realistic characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> In short, was watching this movie a beautiful experience? It is a pot of emotions. Do you have romance, humor? realism?? Beautiful images and places ... good music, a great cast? A PACKAGE TREATMENT! When I left the theater, I felt proud to be Indian. A few days later, I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who had seen the movie with me, if I wanted to see another Indian movie. and his answer was ?? "Is it better than Hari Om? If it is, then I'll go, if not, I think I'll approve." From now on, Hari Om will be the point of reference for every Indian movie he sees. Mr. Bala, are you reading?
