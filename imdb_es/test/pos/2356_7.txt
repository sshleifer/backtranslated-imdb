Warner Brothers produced this extravaganza in 3D that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953. Guy Madison leads a band of guard soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women held by the Indians, which essentially are all there in this film. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood trick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. Rescuers leave with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men stand on an island in a stream bed. The Indian armament reaches the audience without stopping at all times, and throws a sprinkling of tobacco juice aimed at a rattle in good measure. Madison was very popular as Wild Bill Hickock of television and is a good rancher of displaced livestock to whom the army has assigned his ungrateful task. For all the presentation and the enamel of the film, the film was made in only three days.
