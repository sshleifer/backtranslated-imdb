STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low budget movies I've seen in a long time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-author, director of photography and editor) definitely shows his love for 80's horror films underappreciated with this movie! Anyone who loves cheese, absurd situations, extravagant and stereotyped characters from the horror films of the 80s will definitely adore this tribute to the past. <br /> <br /> STMD! It is definitely up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the "excessive violence" and the "gratuitous nudity" that remind us of those entertaining horror movies of the 80s that we all love. I had a great time watching STMD! From the outfits of the 80s that use the stereotyped characters to the blood spatter and silly tone, I could not get enough!
