Watching the debut film by John Cassavetes is a strange experience, even if you've seen improvisational films before. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is harshness. Immediately, it is obvious that some of the characters are ruining their lines. But then you move away from the situation, as you sink deeper into the intimate exchanges of these people and you ask yourself: "Have I ever stumbled upon MY words?" The answer, of course, is safe, we all do it. It is unfortunate that most errors in this regard appear at the beginning of the image, because, like twenty minutes, you have sunk so deeply that you would not know if a bomb exploded behind you. <br /> <br /> The next thing you notice ... or maybe you notice it hours or days after the movie ends, it's that you never saw any substantial plot, however, the themes and the poetry of the dialogue and the characters they never leave it. In fact, the treatment of the role that race plays in the daily life of these characters is always there, but it is so ephemeral that even they are not aware of how they report their opinions about themselves, their self-awareness, their state of perception, or the fate of their relationships. <br /> <br /> The title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks, whites and grays ... and not just in the skin pigmentation of the characters. Leila Goldoni (really remarkable here) is an African American / Caucasian, her two brothers are white and dark African-American. The irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the most "tolerant" and most tolerant atmosphere of the time ... driven by the beats from east to west of Manhatten ... and there are still conflicts in and around them. same. /> I do not think I've seen a movie with such subtle delivery or technique. It is very much like absorbing a great work of art from the gallery and then simply falling asleep in happiness by remembering the images you evoked days later. <br /> <br /> Great mastering and extras on the Criterion disk. It could be said that the first truly experimental independent film ever made.
