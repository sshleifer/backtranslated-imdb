This is a great movie for television with a good story and many funny moments thanks to the excellent cast. <br /> <br /> The only problem with this movie is that it has not stood the test of time as well as it could. Despite this, it's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of Alan Alda or Ruth Gordon.
