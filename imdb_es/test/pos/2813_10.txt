When I saw the preview of this film, I thought, "Here is another silly television movie written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera," but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves she can act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love and marries a man (Eric Close of Now and Again) but begins to lose confidence in him when a series begins of violations. to be made in your community. At first, she is blinded by the assurances that he is innocent and his love for him, but as time goes by she continues to suspect him. <br /> <br /> Although this sounds like setting up another boring TV melodramatic movie, it's really much better than that, because the characters are well played by Thiessen and Close, and the script of the movie allows them to be much more complicated and intelligent than one would expect; these are not just caricatures or cardboard characters that exist only to advance the plot, but real and three-dimensional people, and we find ourselves really caring for them. And the film is smart enough to provide an exciting, involving the climax of the story without resorting to silly action scenes, meaningless clichés or cheap melodrama. Instead, we share the inner conflicts and fears of the main character, and we are given a realistic description of how she could solve them and do the right thing. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to give this one a look, please do it. Your production values ​​are not exactly top-notch (it's a television movie, after all), but if you can see beyond of that, there is an excellent story to enjoy.
