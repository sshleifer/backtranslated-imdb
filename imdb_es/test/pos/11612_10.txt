When you have waited years to see a movie you heard on the vine of the grape, obviously your expectations are high, right? f ** k, yes! But when this baby fell through my door, I did not know what visual effects improved my TV and my fragile mind. First of all, Karim Hussein is a film fan like all of us who grew up on a diet of Argento / Fulci / lynch, etc ... and it is shown in this film, but in a good way. Although I really did not know what the hell was happening on my first watch of this gem, I was surprised by the images, the lighting and, of course, the performances of everyone involved. Karim must have really believed that he was going to push the limits in the making of films (which he trusts me) and that he would have a difficult job to convince the actors to do the same ........ < br /> <br /> So, what can you do? I tell you about "subconscious cruelty". Well, without spoiling it ... it is a deep vision of the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness that go crazy ... a truly unforgettable experience ... .. <br /> <br /> do not lose sight of it to Karim Hussein, I can only go towards better things ... <br /> <br /> I saw the complete impression without subconscious cruelty cuts on a double disc DVD of the Infliction movies that are loaded with extras .. Keep in mind that there is a censored version of Hong Kong that avoids this version.
