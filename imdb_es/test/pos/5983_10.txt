In the Belarus of 1942, two Soviet soldiers are captured by friendly Belarusians with the Nazis. In captivity, the attitude of the two men towards their destiny is very different. One of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and spirituality, incomprehensible to the other man. Larisa Shepitko's latest film is one of the most beautiful war movies in the history of cinema. The photograph, by Vladimir Chuchnov, is amazing, especially in the opening sequence, where long and slow tracking shots representing the loneliness and almost desperate nature of the winter landscape in rural Belarus create the perfect environment. It is easy to make a comparison with Tarkovsky's films, especially since Tarkovsky's alter ego, Anatoli Solonitsyn, has a small but important part in The Ascent. The performance is generally bright, especially by Boris Plotnikov, in the part of Sotnikov. The film reveals an ancient belief in the strength of religious passion, which is related to characters such as Prince Myshkin of Dostoevsky or Tarkovsky Stalker. However, this is not a weakness of the film, but one of its greatest strengths. The religious content seems so honest, and human, that it is impossible not to be moved. The emotional richness of the film can not be overstated; The answer is not as simplified as a brief summary of the plot would suggest. The slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their complicated relationships with each other remind the Commissar, another great Soviet film. The Ascent deserves a second observation, as well as a third and a tenth. It continues to provide interesting ideas, beautiful images and emotional complexity.
