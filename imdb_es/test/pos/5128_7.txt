This is a good family movie with some laughs. I wish he did not have too many things from school like the stalker to fill the movie. In addition, it seems a little too easy to avoid the construction of a piece of land. I mean, he flowed too easily. It makes you aware of wildlife. I had a nice way to present the piece of land that the runner quickly, but a little too slow for me. A little too silly for me and it reminded me to go back to school. Oh, the DVD is full of goodies, so do not miss it. 7 out of 10 for the movie 10 out of 10 for the DVD with the extras that are worth seeing. Well worth your time to see this!
