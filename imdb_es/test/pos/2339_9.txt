All budding filmmakers should see this movie, it's like a master class in digital cinema itself. Some of the scenes seem to have been shot at much higher production values ​​than they really have been. It is very encouraging that such a well-designed job can be done with a low budget. The acting is very good, and the characters are very interesting, particularly the main guy (John Kielty), who manages to play a teenager who experiences difficulties while still very nice. Her beautiful but discolored mother was also very well represented, and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing. This is a very peculiar and interesting piece, and I will look for anything else made by the same team. The director is definitely one to see.
