Anthony Wong plays Lok, a husband whose wife is seriously ill. Poor Lok, due to his illness, has not had sex for a long time. That is why he is plagued by a series of deaf nightmares with nurses and schoolchildren. "Erotic Nightmare" is a funny Cat III movie loaded with sleaze and voyeurism. There is also some blood because the first part of the film shows some unpleasant murders committed by the character of Wong under the influence of the monk's mystic powers. The sequences of the dreams are quite erotic and sordid, so I do not complain. Of course, those who expect a dreadful horror of Cat III in the tradition of "Diary of a Serial Killer" or "Red to Kill" will be disappointed, but the sleazy exploitation film fans should give this a look.7 of 10 .
