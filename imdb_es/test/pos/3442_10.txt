In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised film lovers from all over the world with his epic work Heimat: a chronicle of Germany. Eight years later, he came up with a sequel, The Second Heimat: Chronicle of a Youth, which is even more surprising than its predecessor. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's not really a sequel. It is more of a "midquel", since it covers the events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episodes of the first Heimat cycle. <br /> <br /> The second Heimat begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold was separated from his first love, Klarchen, courtesy of his intolerant mother and his older brother (the controversy had to do with he was underage, while she was about 25 years old.) Still angry at these events, the young man swears never to fall in love again (a great scene, if it is creepy), and decides to move to Munich (as he did the own director in about the same period), hoping to become a professional composer.After a few years he spent in the music academy.He stays in Munich for ten years, and the thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat 2 cover that time frame, each one focused on a different person among Hermann's fellow students, people who, like him, are looking for a "second home." Country, "be it music, film or something else, in which finally they can live in peace. <b r /> <br /> Like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a perfect union of film and television: the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it look like a telenovela, in fact, The Second Heimat needs to be seen in its entirety to be accepted successfully, while some chapters of Heimat 1 could be seen as separate stories (in particular, that of Hermann's teenage years). ). The style and content, however, is pure auteur cinema, with the known transitions in black and white / color (actually, a little more predictable this time) and ambiguous characters, this last element is underlined by the relationship between Hermann and the cello Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome Kammer): they clearly love each other, but they continue to embark on matters with other people, delaying the inevitable until it is too late. This time, Reitz seems to be more pessimistic about his characters (at one point, Hermann is so disillusioned that he says: "The Beatles are so much better than us!"), Constructing complete episodes around obscure and controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. The decade he is exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are dramatically marked by the fundamental events of the 60s (especially the '68 revolution). <br /> <br /> Reitz also seems to have made this mini-series specifically for film fans, given the numerous cinematic references (including a brilliant Casablanca quote) and intelligent jokes (an episode takes place in Venice, whose festival of cinema played an important role in the success of the Heimat saga). And since 1992, movie lovers have never ceased to thank him for having given 26 of the most attractive hours ever committed to celluloid.
