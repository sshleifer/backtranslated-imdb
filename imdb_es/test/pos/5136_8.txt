I recommend this movie to everyone. My son and I read the book first and then we watched the movie. While the book was better (in my opinion) the movie was still great. My son and I agree that, although we like the version of the book more, we liked the end of the film more than the end of the book. The landscape is simply tremendous and the soundtrack is a must. The fact that Jimmy Buffett has a small role and offers music is an additional advantage. Luke Wilson does decent work in his role as Officer Delinko and is pretty much what I had mentally imagined Delinko would look like when I read the book. I'm surprised that this has not worked better in theaters, and I'll be waiting for the DVD to come out.
