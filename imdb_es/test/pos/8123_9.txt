When acting in this film, it is sometimes difficult NOT to imagine that the cast is what they themselves represent. Unbridled passion and acting sometimes make this a very nice and attractive movie. I would not even have known it except for HBO late at night. And the main reason why I like UK films much better than American films is that the actors do not fear acting what is needed.
