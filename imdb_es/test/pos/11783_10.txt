I have not seen "hardware wars" in years, but I remember it as one of the most hilarious events of the human experience, and it ended too soon. All aspects of this movie were fun, and even better than "Star Wars." I laughed. I cried. After seeing it, I asked a member of the family for a moment with three dollars just to be able to say goodbye (I'm joking about the last one). I love when the partner / co-pilot of Ham Salad tries to eat the cinnamon buns of Princess Anne Droid, and the character of Darph Nader is simply funny! It would be great to see this movie in a row with "Thumb Wars", and I sincerely wish there had been an "Episode II: Hardware Wars, Episode: The Referee Strikes." (It was there?)
