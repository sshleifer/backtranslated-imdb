1956 was the 20th Congress of the Communist Party and Soviet Prime Minister Krushchev delivered a speech in which he denounced Stalin, the Stalinist purges and the labor systems of the gulag, revealing information that was previously forbidden, publicly revealing new horrible truths that opened the doors to a new soviet The cinema directed by Mikhail Kalatozov, who was once the director of Stalin's film production. This film presents a Red Army that is NOT victorious, in fact, they are surrounded, in withdrawal mode, with many people dying, including the hero, in a film set after 06-02-41, the German invasion of Russia when Germany was presented. The Barbarian Plan, a blitzkrieg invasion that aimed to achieve a quick victory and the slavery of the slaves, and almost succeeded, reaching less than 20 miles from Moscow in what was a demolition of the Red Army, a devastation of human losses, 15 To 20 million Russians died, or 20% of the entire population. Historically, this was a time of great trauma and suffering, a psychological blow for the Russian people, but the Red Army sustained and prolonged the war for 4 more years until they were finally victorious. <br /> <br /> During the war, Stalin used the genre of war in films to improve morale, introducing female heroines who were ultra-patriotic, strong and idealistic, suggesting that if women could be so successful and patriotic , then Russia could expect at least as much of its soldiers. Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced him with an individual and daring leader who succeeded in killing many enemies, an obvious reference to Stalin himself, who was always represented in the film as a bold, wise and victorious leader. But Kalatozov changed this description, since THE CRANES ARE FLYING was made after the death of Stalin, causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation, winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or, as well as the Best Director and Best Actress (Tatyana Samoilova), re-awakening the Soviet cinema of the West for the first time since IVAN THE TERRIBLE by Eisenstein in the 40s. <br /> <br /> This film had a brilliant, impressive and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary director of photography, Sergei Uresevsky, with spectacular cranes and tracking shots, wartime images, battlefields, Moscow and busy streets that are extremely vivid and real. . Another brilliant scene shows the main heroine, Veronica, who has not heard from her lover, Boris, in the 4 years of war, so he is presumed dead, but she continues to love him, expressed in a scene in which She runs to a bridge with a train behind her, a moment when the viewer wondered if she could throw herself in front of that train, instead she saves a 3-year-old boy named Boris who was about to be run over by a car. Another scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield, who dies senseless, and his thoughts spin and spin in a beautiful montage of trees, sky, leaves, all spinning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams, including a wedding imaginary with Veronica. This film presents the famous phrase: "You can dream when the war is over". In the final sequence, when the war ends, the soldiers return in a massive scene in the streets, Veronica learns that Boris died, everyone is happy and excited with the return of the soldier, but Veronica is desperate, delivering flowers to the soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and disinterest that reveals "white and gray cranes floating in the sky." <br /> <br /> The film premiered in Russia in 1957 and, according to some comments, "the silence in the theater was profound, the wall between art and life had fallen ... and tears opened the doors. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
