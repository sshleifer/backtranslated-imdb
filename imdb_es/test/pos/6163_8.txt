A romantic war story of good rhythm that should have had more exposure. The Czech pilot who played the piano gives a soft touch to the story. It is possible that flight images have not been enough for aviation fans like me, but, again, this really is not an action movie. Although it has nothing in common with James Salter's novel "The Hunters" which became the film about the F86 Sable pilots of the Korean War, Dark Blue World had a similar but more romantic element. Better in some way than the Battle of Britain, since it does not depend on renowned actors. Suggest to see this movie with a little Czech beer and some Czech meatballs called kneldniky (sp).
