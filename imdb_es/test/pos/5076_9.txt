The film tackles the here and now the horror of "interpretation" with a trans-global recount of various actors. No one is silent lightly because we see the blindness of the players when they forge their own portion of the world game accumulating hatred and misery in their "enemies" and in themselves in equal measure. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the sympathetic Senator's Aide (played in a brilliant style by Peter Sarsgaard) and the real Washington power brokers is electrifying. Meanwhile, in the countryside, the new CIA man (Jake Gyllenhaal) undergoes a radical change in his attitude towards the new intimacy found in the United States with torture. Suddenly, despite his rejection of what was initially tacitly condoned, one has to wonder why the hell someone who calls himself civilized would rise up and observe someone being humiliated and mistreated in this way. The film has few heroes, perhaps the CIA man with faults and failures of Gyllenhaal is the exception and a necessary indulgence to make the film offer a bit of hope. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that this movie is not. Fiction at all, but a wake-up call for those with a bit of decency left in them. The terrible truth is that we, in the United Kingdom and the United States, have lost the moral fabric and this film shows how low we are prepared to arrive. All this in the name of freedom! There is a wonderful line in the script that says torture is a sure way to increase the number of our enemies. This is already happening in real life and we must listen to the message that this film transmits and start using our strength and our money in a much smarter way! The message seems to be that any of us who claim that the surrender, torture and abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are just as stupid and stupidly stupid as jihadists and suicide bombers. <br /> <All the praise for the sensitivity of a talented South African director who looks at the great injustice of how power is exercised, and at a cast of dominant actors in the United States and beyond. Oh, and by the way, the movie has a sting in the tail with the end of an intelligent and provocative surprise (which I will not give up). <br /> <br /> I watched the movie in an early London preview, so it has not yet been written extensively, but I am pleased to say that the tide of less than brilliant comments seems to be changing. The BBC review has been a great support and (and I) suspect that many of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specs of Hollywood, where good and bad are cardboard cutouts. Hence the reason why many of the truly great films of the year are increasingly independent and / or non-American.
