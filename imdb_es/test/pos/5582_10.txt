I know there are youngsters and over 30/40 years old; Both male and female fans in as many different countries as you can imagine, who love this TV. mini series. It has elements that can be found in almost all other television programs on television, character drama that could be from an Australian soap opera; However, in the same episode he has scientific and fictional data that would give the most difficult "Trekkie" a race for his money in the world of brains! Theory of the wormhole, travel in time in a true form of equation ... Magnificent. It encompasses cultures throughout the map, since the possibilities are endless by having multiple stars and, therefore, thousands of planets to choose from. <br /> <br /> With such a broad scope; you would expect nothing to be able to maintain the illusion for a long time, but this is where "Farscape" really enters into its own element ... It succeeds where everyone else has failed, especially those similar to Star Trek (a universe with practically zero elements of Kaos!) They ran out of ideas very quickly + they kept repeating them! Throughout 4 seasons, they manage to maintain the attention of the audience using a good continuity and a constant evolution of the character with multiple threads in each episode with personal touches unique to the camera that are specific for certain groups of characters within the set. This structure allows an extremely wide area of ​​topics, since loyalties are forged and break in many ways on many issues. I happened to see the pilot (Premiere) and I had to keep tuning in later to see if Crichton would ever "get the girl". After watching them all on television, I loved seeing them available on DVD. admit that it was the only thing that kept me healthy while I had to do a 12-hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia ... Farscape was the only thing that helped me spend those extremely long nights ... <br /> <br / > Do yourself a favor; Look at the pilot and see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> Farscape Comet
