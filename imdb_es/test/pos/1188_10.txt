The first time I saw this movie in the theater. Was 10. I saw it a second time and I must say it was amazing. Music, dance, acting. It's a great story and told extremely well. I completely fell in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mother yelled at him to give him his pants and finally said "how much do you need?" (money). That was classic. ; ). <br /> <br /> Moms are the best. If you have not seen this movie since it came out, I say see it again. It is timeless. It will do what all the great movies do; Make you laugh, cry and think.
