This movie has the guts to suggest that it might be better to just accept your life as it is and keep smiling anyway. As someone who is more excited about the idea of ​​taking charge of life and moving on, I felt slapped, but it's okay: I do not have to agree with a movie to love and respect it. Great performance of Streep and Hurt, and of all the others, and some wonderfully extravagant scenes. A serious movie. And take a handkerchief.
