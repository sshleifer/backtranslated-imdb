This Roscoe comedy "Fatty" Arbuckle is best remembered for the performance of a young Buster Keaton, fresh out of his Vaudeville family's acting division, in his film debut. Buster has a pretty important part in this movie and it's pretty funny in general. "The Butcher Boy" has a lot of laughs and is an example of an old-fashioned and well-made slapstick, although it seems it comes from the brief era of two-reel comedies when filmmakers still imagined themselves in segments of a roll as a matter of course . <br /> <br /> The first half of the film takes place in a general store, with Arbuckle as the title butcher. It's an excuse to explore the many possibilities of quick physical humor offered by a general store, and Arbuckle really shows up as a 300 pound acrobat, demonstrating subtlety, skill and grace in his performance of what might have been little slapstick routines remarkable that raise them to a different level. A moving jaw makes him flip a large butcher's knife casually so that it rotates precisely in its correct position stuck on the cutting board, and I'm still surprised that Arbuckle really seems to do it every time. There is also a very nice joke that sees him leaning on his scale and confused about why his cuts of meat weigh so much. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is a child who comes to buy some molasses and plays with dexterity. In a routine standing next to the ground. Apart from the strange and almost unsettling half smile, his idiosyncratic attitude and body language make him instantly recognizable as the Buster we know. He even has his hat flattened with the trademark time: here it is destroyed for the first time when it is full, of course, with molasses. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie becomes a more situational-based comedy, and Arbuckle and his rival, Al St. John, dressed in drag-out clothes to infiltrate the boarding school. Fatty's girlfriend. Much of the humor also comes from the generally surrealistic and mysteriously provocative view of the laughter of these two strange guys who use resistance and try to "be girls". The destroyer is also in this segment, but mostly it stays somewhere, helping St. John. <br /> <br /> The end of "The Butcher Boy" becomes a little frantic, but in general and beyond its historical interest out of curiosity, it's a well-made comedy that only gets the laughs you're looking for.
