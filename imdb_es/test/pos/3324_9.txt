I am convinced that this film was like Waiting to Exhale with white females in the fifties. As in Waiting to Exhale, all the female characters mixed with men who were married or were not good. The only difference, besides the obvious, was that there was not much humor in this movie. I would even say it was tragic. Only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere (Hope Lange's boy), but even then there was a conflict in this relationship. <br /> <br /> The story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success. Unfortunately for them, romance did not seem easy, although they were young, intelligent and attractive. This movie could be called a tear-drop with the saddest part that involves the character of Suzy Parker whose obsession with an ex-boyfriend leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> This is something you should see.
