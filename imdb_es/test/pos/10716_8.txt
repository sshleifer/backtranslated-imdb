'Kramer vs. Kramer ', an Academy Award winner, follows an elegant businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day, Ted's wife leaves him and his son in search of a better life, forcing Ted to be closer to his son (Justin Henry). The two come together and become very close (but only after some friction), and just when everything is perfect, Ted's wife returns to the city and wants sole custody of his son. Then, Ted has the mission of not letting his son be taken away, and he fights with his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives a great performance along with Meryl Streep, and young Justin Henry is impressive. It's a sad emotional roller coaster from a movie, but it's a very well made and inspiring movie. The film won the Oscar for Best Picture at the 1979 Academy Awards, along with Best Actor for Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for Streep. If you do not mind a shred of tears, 'Kramer vs. Kramer 'is a great movie to watch. Grade: B +
