Victor Mature, as a mountain man and trapper barely civilized and mostly out of control, may be on the billboard, but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to be cut by the Confederation of artillery in Shiloh, sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence, has the most interesting part, married to a young and hard-to-recognize Anne Bancroft at the beginning. The uncomfortable MILF coveted the colonel's wife, which gave the film an interesting and even obscure secondary plot that goes so far as to refer to the greed of another man's wife by James Whitmore, who plays the father figure of the mountain man, older and wiser, of Mature. Directed by Anthony Mann, this film is lost among its most famous westerns with James Stewart, but still you do not need the Indian threat to make this a movie worth seeing, although Preston demonstrates his bad judgment as commanding officer. again in a failed expedition to finally subdue the Indians, in a well-organized attack between the forest that quickly becomes a defeat.
