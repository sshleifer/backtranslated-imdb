Unlike some movies where you can walk around and do other things, this movie kept me in front of the screen for the full two hours. I loved every minute. <br /> <br /> However, I have to say that the story is not very credible. Especially when the foreigner was expelled by the government, and then, in reality, he sent a package to the guy who helped him. Xiao Liu is a very good actor, shows his emotions and shows his stupidity and his love towards that girl.
