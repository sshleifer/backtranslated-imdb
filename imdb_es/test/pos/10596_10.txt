This movie had everything I needed in a movie: Women, Skateboard, Violence, Music by H.I.M and Tony Hawk! The artwork and the effects of the camera in this movie is incredible. The music in this movie is the best I've heard in any other movie. Each track goes very well with its scene. I think the acting was really good considering that none of the members of the Bams team has been in movies with a script before. Although the whole concept of the film is the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glauren) who is sleeping with Hellboy behind him, it is a predictable and ancient story. His way of acting is very unpredictable, for example: Falcone and the gas tank, Raab himself, Dunn breaking bottles behind the wawa and all the scenes of Don Vito. This movie is a must!
