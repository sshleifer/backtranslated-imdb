My summary of a line implies that this is not a good movie, but this is not true. I enjoyed the movie a lot, but I probably expected too much. <br /> <br /> Adele, who is solidly played by Susan Sarandon, did not seem like a very nice character. She is fleeting and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. This is the only thing she knows how to do without fail. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's deficiencies that she does not seem to be 14-17 years old. This, of course, makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna, since she does not seem to be between 14 and 17 years old either. Portman plays this role so easily that you almost forget that he has not been making films for 20 years. However, even with the two solid tracks, Wayne Wang never seems to attract the audience as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more so with Smoke. Although I have not read the book, the film feels as if it has made the necessary changes in the story to bring it to the big screen, changes that can drain the emotional pungency of the story. I enjoyed the movie for the fun of seeing two wonderful actresses doing their job, but I never got lost in the experience and I never related to their difficult situation.
