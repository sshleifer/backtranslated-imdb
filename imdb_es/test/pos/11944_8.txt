Usually, I find it hard to watch a TV movie, the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and I give up and find a good book. This, however, made me endure the aggregates and stay with him until the end. I realize that the movie was based on a true story, but it was not revealed why it took so long to find Denny. They had his name and I would assume his social security number. Although he moved a lot, it seems that they would find him as soon as they enter his number for a job, etc. The actors seemed a bit old for the part and a metal object buried when unearthed had no rust. These were only technical failures and were not taken from the file. For a LifeTime movie it was better than most.
