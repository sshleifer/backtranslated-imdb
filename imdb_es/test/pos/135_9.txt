Cinematography is the bright feature of the film. Park really knows what he does when it comes to shooting memorable scenes behind a camera. Each shot is full of vibrant colors that jump off the screen. Each frame of the film seems to tell a story on its own. I hope there is a Blu-ray version of this movie because it will look fantastic. It is quite intriguing to see what elements of vampire mythology Park used for his vision. Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and stay impeccable, has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight. However, it does not have fangs and it also has a reflection in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Although I have never seen the film, I could not help but feel that this was the version of Chan-wook Park. of the twilight. The whole central part of the film is dedicated to the love of Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. It felt like the adult version of Twilight, really. There is a lot of blood, nudes, sex and even some obscenities thrown to a large extent. Maybe it's the Chan-Wook Park fan in me, but I honestly feel I can guarantee that this is the best movie of the two. The psychological aspect that I love about Park's previous films is also in Thirst. That is an important factor for me, since any movie that makes me think or that is unusual in some way ends up becoming a fan favorite. The soundtracks of Park's films always seem to fit into their respective film like a glove. Thirst is no exception. While the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time, it fits the overall atmosphere of the movie effortlessly. <br /> <br /> The central part of the film seemed to last longer than anything else in the movie. Although it is rare that the scenes during that time are crucial for the history of the film and it is difficult to imagine that Sed is the same movie if any of those scenes were cut. However, it is my only point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park bites the mythology of vampires with Thirst and gives him his own dark and psychological touch. Park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: good writing, beautiful cinematography, a solid cast, some kind of psychological turn that will affect your head and a memorable ending. The thirst meets on all fronts and we hope you receive the most attention you deserved during your theatrical performance on DVD (and eventually on Blu-ray, hopefully).
