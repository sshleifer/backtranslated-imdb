This is one of the many technophobic films that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid-1990s, after the Internet became widespread. <br /> <br /> Hollywood movies have always managed to "embellish" the behaviors described, to make them look better and more attractive. The same happens when Hollywood tries to show us something of high technology. The result of such attempts varies from being very preposterous and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.) to being quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> "The Network" is somewhere between these extremes. When analyzing things, one can end up with many technical inconsistencies and many cases in which behaviors seem to be much more "attractive" and graphic than the way things are in real life (as often happens in movies). br /> <br /> However, by simply missing them, the viewer ends up with a fairly solid and entertaining movie. The characters and the acting are convincing, and the film does a good job of keeping you in your seat until the end. The plot is fine (a fairly standard, really - based on good paranoid design, but with a touch of high tech this time), and quite convincing (again, by not taking into account the technical problems). However, the development of the plot is a little slow, and from time to time you can anticipate some supposedly surprising twists in the plot. <br /> <br /> The bonus here is Sandra Bullock's cake, which besides being cute (something she does quite easily, apparently), also portrays a solid act. You can really feel his character, his desperation, his emotions. <br /> <br /> In the bottom line, the film is entertaining and interesting, qualifies 7 to 10 on my scale. It's worth renting it in the video library, or even watching it at the cinema. Whether to buy it or not, it's up to you.
