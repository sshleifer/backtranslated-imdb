Now, I'm a bit partial, since I'm a big fan of nightly television. I've been a loyal Jay Leno fan for about 6 or 7 years, and I think he's one of the funniest and most talented comedians in the world. And David Letterman is also a great comedian, though I only watch his show (unless Jay is a repeat) during commercials or when he has a better guest than Jay on the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are good actors and they looked a lot like Jay and Dave, but did they disappear in the characters? No Roebuck barely jams Jay's voice and expression, muttering loudly, sounding like Marlon Brando castrati. Higgins nails David's facial expressions (for example, his characteristic twisting), but does not hide Dave's voice. Those who are not big fans of television late at night could be much less biased. There are a couple of comedians who can do Jay imitations. Why could not they have selected one of them for the part? And the same goes for Dave. I would prefer that you play the role of Norm McDonald. Norm does not look much like Dave, but he made a great personification of him in SNL. "Hey ... do you have gum?" That was so hilarious! <br /> <br /> However, I learned a lot about the wars of the night, of which I had very little knowledge at first. I never saw "The Tonight Show" before Jay Leno was the host, so I did not know about the fight to finally replace Johnny Carson and the innumerable negotiations that finally convinced Dave to move to CBS. I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and the film seemed very enlightening to me. And Kathy Bates gives a spectacular performance as the former executive producer of "The Tonight Show." She basically steals the movie. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
