I loved this movie ... so much excitement in such a short time. I loved the beginning and how it takes you off guard completely. I love the history and the deer that are brought. I know that when I think of deer I think of innocence and prosperity. In addition, in Psalm 42: 2 of the Bible, it says: "As the deer run through the water, my soul for you, O God." What could even connect the last moment when the woman says she will be fine. As if she knew she was going with God. Maybe I'm thinking a lot about it. But sometimes it's interesting to see what goes through people's minds. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece with the viewers from all over the world. I live in Texas and I had it playing on cable ... I immediately went on the computer to find out more about this movie and this incredible director! I really liked the music that was used in the background. Music can sometimes make or break a movie. It definitely sets the mood perfectly. Very good choice! <br /> <br /> Thanks again. <br /> <br /> Laetitia
