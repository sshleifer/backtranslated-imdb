Mon Oncle Antoine watches the steep face of a home community from various angles, slowly, taking his time to the beginning, as it should, until we come out of shattered (but banal) hopes and expectations, in eddies of ecstasy of dreams and hearts. Stopping the revelation about the terrible enigma of mortality. <br /> <br /> Pans and juices aimlessly through the snowy mountain comfort the mind and hypnotize the viewer. This restless camera work is personified in a marginal character who is also the vagabond, who leaves his job in the coal mine and leaves his family to cut wood, then abandons again and returns to the raw humanity of his dead son. <br /> <br /> An attractive old woman cheats on her husband and a child dies. Old things become new and new things die. Along is the snowy whiteness, as astonished as the history of cinema.
