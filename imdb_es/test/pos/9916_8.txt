I rate OPERA as one of the best films of Argento. Draw holes and inconsistencies? Sure, but I do not think they affect this movie as much as many other critics seem. Many of the elements found in many of Argento's films are a bit "extravagant", but that is part of the drawing of his films ... <br /> <br /> Short story: the psychopath stalks the new protagonism of the opera lady. The typical twists and turns of Argento are produced, which lead to a decent reward of a climax. He is not the best Argento, but I keep taking him from time to time. Definitely worth checking out if you like his other things, but do not confuse this with the abysmal remake of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA that Argento did, that is really horrible ... 8/10
