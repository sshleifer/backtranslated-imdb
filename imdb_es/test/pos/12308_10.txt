The poet of Argentine music, Atahualpa Yupanqui, once said that popular music repeats itself in a similar way in any country in the world. They look the same, but all consider them as their own folk music ... <br /> <br /> This film, as I feel it, is about the same music that is repeated throughout the world at some point in history Of each country. . First, a few people listen to it and try to make others listen to it. Then some, they think they hear it, but they do not. Then, nobody says anything and some people seem to hear it. And others recognize that they have heard it, but they did not think that others could be listening. Finally, everyone listens to the same music, and suddenly it does not sound anymore ... <br /> <br /> Love and poetry, like a true nationalism and the legacy of a father for his children ... <br /> <br /> Why would I call the movie The Dead when nobody dies? The Spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it Dubliners, following the title of James Joyce ... <br /> <br /> A beautiful Irish postcard filmed in 1900!
