This movie was certainly not very sophisticated. No, the humor was actually pretty silly now that I think about it. But, although I think about it, I laughed, showing that a decent comedy does not need to be very deep. <br /> <br /> Fatty Arbuckle is the definitive star of this short, even though Buster Keaton appears in the film as well. He is the butcher in a grocery store of yesteryear. There were many silly things in the store and I think I laughed more at the sequence of the coffee grinder: you will only have to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Anyway, later, Fatty's girlfriend will be forced to go to a girls' school and, as she can not separate, she dresses in clothes and infiltrates the school. Arbuckle is an ugly woman! Then, for silly and unsophisticated fun, watch this movie. It will not change your life and it is a very light image, but it is also fun.
