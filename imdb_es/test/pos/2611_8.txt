Assy McGee is an out-of-control and tough detective based on the countless examples of police dramas of the late twentieth century. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttock. <br /> <br /> The cheap and low-brow facade of the show contrasts with its intelligence and hidden satire. That does not mean that Assy lacks jokes, only that the bathroom humor is used with enough restraint to provoke consistent laughter, not grunts or shots of the eyes. The sequence of the program title demonstrates the intelligent and subtle humor that is used everywhere. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city configured for a police theme of the 70s. In a photo, a police cruiser is shown and the "camera" approaches the support of the faceplate, which is vacant. The senseless zoom satirizes the production of the typical police drama of the 70s and 80s and, by the way, makes me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> All the typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who can not control Assy, the loyal and minority partner who acts as an obstacle to Assy's imprudence; The regular cops who detest Assy's media ... all are responsible and all are hilarious satires of the typical police drama. <br /> <br /> The voice acting, mainly played by Larry Murphy, is nothing short of spectacular. Assy's voice, choppy and abrupt with a bit of drunken insult, is so smart and unique that it stands next to the greats of all time as Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Although the voice is unintelligible, the diction is something clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from other Adult Swim voices that often require subtitles to understand. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fantastic production and voice acting, the script is also very funny. The direct meaning of Assy feeds most of the humor, particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force. <br /> <br /> If you have access to the Adult Swim comedies, Assy McGee is definitely worth it. Each episode is recorded in only 8-9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.
