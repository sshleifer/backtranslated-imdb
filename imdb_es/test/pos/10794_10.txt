"Talk Radio" is my favorite movie by Oliver Stone, although he has done many excellent ones, such as "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of "Talk Radio," a cinematic expansion of Eric Bogosian's spectacular play that was based on a real-life narrative from an interview host in Dallas. Working with cinematographer Robert Richardson, Stone turns what could have been a very limited exercise into a visually striking ideological battle that presents a radio station as a stage of war. Bogosian is devastating as a torturer in the air of Barry Champlain's abuse and conveys the conflicting and destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-esteem. Alec Baldwin, like his alpha male boss, hits the perfect note like a man crazy for a man whose monstrosity helped nourish him. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry's sweet ex-wife who ends up becoming another target of her vicious personal vitriol. Stone and Bogosian fill each painting with interest and each line of dialogue with sweet poison and sharp ambiguity. John C. McGinley, as the experienced producer / technician of Barry, Stu, presents a hilarious and sharp performance, as does the great Michael Wincott. The film is an impeccable and underestimated masterpiece of excellent writing, impressive acting and brutal and intransigent direction. Stewart Copeland's score is also brilliant.
