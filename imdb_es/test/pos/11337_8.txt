"In the Mood for Love", a mocking allegory of loneliness and longing. Here is a movie without sex, not even kisses, and is undoubtedly one of the sexiest romantics and, without a doubt, the most stimulating and stimulating I've seen. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of two people who coincidentally live in the same apartment, and are at one door from each other. The movie, as and unlike "Random Hearts," is about how two people come together through the matter of their two lovers. Only once they receive this news, do they take the time to reflect on the consequences of an adventure and the feelings of others for having broken up, and if the two people are willing enough to fall in love again. <Br /> <br /> The wonderful thing about the film is the way in which director Wong Kar-Wai presents each character's way of dealing with loneliness. With the character of Maggie Cheung, he will show you, in a repeated montage: leave work, go home, watch his neighbors play, go to the noodle shop, leave the noodle shop and find his equal appeal. age, played by Tony Leung This is an intelligent technique, if not subtle and wise, to present loneliness. Because it's when you're alone, when you find yourself falling into a loop. This movie worked for me because I can identify with that feeling.
