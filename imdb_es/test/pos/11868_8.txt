One night, barman Randy (Matt Dillon) rescues Jewel (Liv Tyler) from his jealous boyfriend Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). He takes Jewel to his house. But Utah comes back and wants Randy to open the safe at Mc Cool's. Suddenly a shot - Utah is dead. Then ... ... I'd better stop here to tell the plot. That's like explaining the story of "wild things". What I found so interesting was the fact that the plot (written by Stan Seidel, his first and last job, which died in July last year ...) was counted from 3 perspectives: the 3 men who fall in love with Jewel . Everyone sees her with different eyes, like John Goodman as the detective, who falls in love with her with tenderness for being remembered of his dead wife ... <br /> <br /> No wonder the boys fall in love with her . ! Liv Tyler - she is a true gem. She made the big screen shine! She played her role as if she were in a 1940s crime novel. Sweet, but at the same time she was the cool vampire who walks on a corpse and uses men for her needs. And, of course, Michael Douglas. How could I forget it? Mr. Burmeister, the killer of the bingo games, was great! <br /> <br /> But in the last 10 minutes there was too much slap for my taste, that weakened the atmosphere. That part started when Paul Reiser (as Randys Carl's cousin) put on his leather dress for Jewel. The song "YMCA" did not fit so much here ... ... but, all in all, "Una noche en Mc Cool's" is a nice parody of black cinema by COOL. <br /> <br />
