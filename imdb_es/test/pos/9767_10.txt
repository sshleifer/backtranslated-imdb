I remember seeing this series with avidity and being so disappointed when it came to an end. Over the years since then, I've tried to find out if I could get a copy on video or d.v.d, without success. However, I loved finding this website with details, only to disappoint me again at the time of purchase, that the available videos will not be played on English recorders. This production was wonderful, being absolutely accurate with the Nevil Shute novel, reviewing the story after the end of the war, with the subsequent life of Joe and Jean together, absolutely wonderful, and I just wish I could see it again, since it's a original projection, there have been no repetitions on British television.
