This is the best movie if you want inspiration to follow your heart and never give up your dream. Elizabeth Taylor is Velvet and at her best (from her childhood, at least), Mickey Rooney is a cynical friend who eventually becomes her trainer and they go to Grand National's obstacle course with her beloved horse "the Pi" . Pirate "- only for Velvet to become the rider and have the chance to win, for those of you who have not yet seen it, I will not reveal the end, but you should see it and once you do, you will love it. Look at a very young woman, Angela Lansbury, as Velvet's older sister.
