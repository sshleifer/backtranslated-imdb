Well, we definitely saw it and I and many other people expected something worse. It also had some good parts, but I did not expect it to still fail in other areas. <br /> <br /> First, the performance was above average. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the glue of this movie. If it were not for him, this movie would have collapsed and hit rock bottom. His performance was not at all surprising, but absolutely necessary. He gave a clever and cynical performance in which most of the other actors could easily have turned their character into a clich√©. Tom Hanks really gave a good performance loose and did not disappoint, but he certainly did not impress. What I could not stand was that Julia Roberts was involved in this movie. She was as bad as I've ever seen her. On the one hand, she is a bad actress, at least for me, she was too young for her character and false even for the character she was playing. <br /> <br /> The address was normal for me. I'm not really a big fan of Mike Nichols' recent films and I'm not exactly impressed by it either. It was made with a cartoon hat so Hollywood that I could not stand. Worst of all was that he tried to make it a really meaningful film in the end. I love movies with meaning, but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and shows something that tries to justify the rest of the trash throughout the film. That's something Mike Nichols seems to have done a lot in his recent history. <br /> <br /> The only impressive part of this movie was the writing. The dialogue was well put together and he was able to let the story unfold. The writing was what really could take this film to a level above the average. In so many scenes I found myself laughing in part because of the writing. <br /> <br /> Well, that's something we saw at least. A lot of the stage was good in the movie, if you understand what I mean, but not much more than that. I liked that this movie did not glorify everything the United States had done. It is obvious that throughout this war in Afghanistan, the United States gave arms to the people who are now against us. This type of film shows us the guilt. It shows that what may seem good in the short term can become horribly bad in the future. This movie had a good original message, but it just did not deliver it correctly. In general, although it was entertaining.
