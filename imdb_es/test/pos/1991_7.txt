"We are both stumbling together in this unformed world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable or even possibly non-existent, always on the verge of being killed by forces we do not understand." This is what Ted Pikul says in the movie. What for some people sums up life and 'eXistenZ' is probably a movie about existence. What is real and what is unreal and how the difference is noticed. Or not. The last line of the film is highly ambiguous. <br /> <br /> The film looks like a story about furry dogs (in fact, it has a very hairy dog) but it takes you on an interesting journey, full of provocations. The touches of Cronenberg that will make you see the amphibians, the pods of the games, the fish, the thorns and the bones from a new perspective. Some bits are quite icky It takes place in a rural setting where the service station is called 'GAS STATION' and a Chinese restaurant is called 'CHINESE RESTAURANT'. The film has a fascinating texture that is many leagues from your usual big-budget science fiction movie. You can read There are many things in the movie and you pay watching more than once. <br /> <br /> The main actors are Jude Law, who is well, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is great. Some roles do not adapt to this talented actor, but when she has a good role like this, it is unmatched. Its unconventional beauty and fascinating voice adapt to the part of Allegra. (It looks great with a short black skirt too). There are other known actors, but they are not given much to do. It looks good, sounds good and a score by Howard Shore complements the film very well. Cronenberg is possibly the Alfred Hitchcock of the science fiction / horror genre. No matter what movie you make, it's always worth seeing.
