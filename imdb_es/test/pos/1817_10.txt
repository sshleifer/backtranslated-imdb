I remember seeing this movie when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the movie and the characters that I loved. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker), because she made me laugh when she did not show any interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her and hoped that they would eventually get together and then her bored boyfriend, Ralphie (Christopher Murray) because the He ignored and went out with his friends. I love the cast and the story. I always love the part when Fred tries to meet with Stacey, and I always remember when I chased her through the car. But it was so good. I will always remember to appreciate it in my adolescence. Now that I'm 33 years old, I picked up my copy on DVD and I hope to see it.
