The Closer She Gets ... is an ingenious documentary about the death of a person I really knew. It allows to glimpse the private moments of the family involved in the most difficult moment of their lives. Parents tend to support the work of their children, in this case, the theme of the documentary went further. She was willing to share her death experience as an act of love for her son. It is a very moving work of art that weaves the serious, serene and light aspects of the life of this family. History can make you laugh, but also cry, because it addresses the problems we all have to face. I strongly recommend this documentary to those who are not afraid to cry, and are willing to deal with the issue of mortality in the most humane way. This movie will touch you.
