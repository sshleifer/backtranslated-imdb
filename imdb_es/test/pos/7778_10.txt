This film presents some of the best ensemble work I've seen in film or on stage. The actors confront each other with a skill and a vivacity that in no way can be achieved through editing. <br /> <br /> "Love Jones" is a good story, period. But it is also an excellent portrait of the African-American urban middle-aged, middle-income group that is not often seen.
