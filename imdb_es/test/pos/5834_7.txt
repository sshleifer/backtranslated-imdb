This is a difficult sight to watch. It is not something to sit down and relax. He kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People are ruined, raped, tortured and die like flies. There are male organs everywhere, there is excrement, vomit and blood. Oz is a brave show. It addresses issues such as racism, homosexuality, the reality of prisoners and, above all, problems; -capital punishment. In my opinion, it is also successful in doing so, unlike, for example, the "Medium" of a single track. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I got bored. I had some strange stories and spent a lot of time in characters that just did not interest me. Interestingly, I thought that season 1 was pretty boring. If I had seen it while it was broadcast, I think I would not have continued watching it. I love seasons 2 to 4. Seasons 5 and 6 can be seen (although I think you should not be allowed to pronounce the words "Cyril" and "Death Row" in the same sentence). <br /> <br /> There Are so many wonderful characters to encourage. The old Bob and Busmalis, whom I fell in love with from the first day. They said, Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, whose monologues linked the episodes so efficiently. The staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada are also brilliant. Also secondary characters that were only in a couple of episodes or some seasons, but also left a good impression. <br /> <br /> My favorites are the O'Reily brothers. Their relationship was the most heartrending and warm I've seen on television. If there is something that I will always remember about this show, it is them. There will never be another "pairing" or what to call it, which will make me hurt so much. That is why, when the ends also come for them, it almost hurts a lot. I wish it had never happened. I wish I had never seen it. <br /> <br /> But hey, Fontana. I recommend it.
