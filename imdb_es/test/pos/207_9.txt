Love and war happened on the other side of the iron curtain and, looking at them with misery, love was as strong as in the West and war was often more moving (should I say more realistic?). <br /> <br /> This movie is about both war and love and about the Soviet thaw of Mr. K.'s era. It also reminds us that the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990s with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of dollars spent on special effects and commercialized actors. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic of Soviet cinema and an outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies: war. <br /> <br />
