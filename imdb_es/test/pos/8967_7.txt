Mike Nichols' film "Charlie Wilson's War", set in the 1980s, tells the story of how the main character (played by Tom Hanks) managed to wage a secret war with the Russians to help the Afghan forces. Of course, we know how well it turned out in the long term, but, fortunately, the film does not overlook the unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> The cast is full of stars, with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts among the most profitable stars in Hollywood. As an added benefit, he has the versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role, one for which he received a non-unjustified Oscar nomination. I'm not a big fan of Roberts, but Hanks is always reliable. However, I can not believe him as a womanizer who uses drugs, although the real Charlie Wilson seems as nice as Hanks. However, apart from the big three, it's not worth commenting on, even with a recognizable name like Amy Adams. <br /> <br /> The story is attractive and is backed by an excellent screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interaction between the main characters is excellent and is full of memorable lines. The later events initiated by the war are not ignored, although the scenes in the bookstore that honor Wilson seem too serious for me to achieve the bittersweet feeling that was probably intended. In general, the management of Nichols is professional and admirably follows the action of the script. <br /> <br /> This is a film that, like Charlie Wilson himself, has flaws but, nevertheless, it is very nice. Undoubtedly, recommended for fans of the three stars and for those who seek an attractive political drama with a happy feeling.
