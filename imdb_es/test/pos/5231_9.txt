The details in The Big Trail were so incredible that I felt that the film was made at the moment it represents. I've never seen wagons that were so real! They were large, laden with accessories, and they even felt as if they had been full of details under the canvas covers that should never have been seen. Every speck of dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there. Modern computer technology could never recreate the scenes of the numerous wagons as they move through the land or the circle to defend themselves against the Indians. The cars were all real and individual vehicles, each with its own real team of horses or oxen. <br /> <br /> The actors' clothing could not have felt more genuine. With the exception of John Wayne's leather outfit and the pretty Marguerite Churchill dress, the clothes were very common, tattered or dirty in an authentic way. Many of the actors and actresses were born before electricity and indoor plumbing were common, and they should feel comfortable with the environment. All the Indians were real Indians instead of extra white painted tan. <br /> <br /> The women of the old west had to be tough because there was a lot of work. In each scene showing the work done by the people in the car train, women are shown cutting wood, hauling logs, etc. This realism was so natural that it did not seem like a statement about the role of women of the day, rather than a fact of survival. <br /> <br /> The plot of revenge and romance is played well. Nothing is exaggerated or exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Something got lost along the way in the 1930s in Hollywood. As much as I love the fake scenarios and the controlled environment of old movies, The Big Trail manages to feel real above all else. The more I watch big-budget movies from the silent era, the more I like them. I can think of some films from the 1930s that I've seen that match the greatness of the best of the 1920s. If you made home movies in wagon days, The Big Trail is what they would look like.
