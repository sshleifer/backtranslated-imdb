Greystoke is undoubtedly the best Tarzan movie I've ever seen. Christopher Lambert plays a very credible man who tries to return to the world of humanity along with the fantastic Ian Holm. John's struggle to leave the jungle and the monkeys that raised him is quite exciting. Some very memorable scenes, among them, where Lambert makes the sounds of the jungle at romantic interest, and the scene in which he witnesses the death of his ape father. Tarzan's feelings for both worlds are well developed and really make you feel for him. <br /> <br /> An excellent and underestimated film.
