There was a recent documentary about the making of films, which featured a long list of actors and directors who talked about making movies. A common theme was that you can have a great script, a great cast, the best director and a lot of money, and still create a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The periscope of Down is a proof of the corollary of that theory. It is not an original script or terribly well written. A few solid actors, but mostly unknown, and this movie just makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to say that Kelsey Grammar took this movie, but that is not really the case. Other actors of the characters, such as Rob Schneider and the hilarious Harland Williams, contributed significantly to the fun of the film. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the cast, or that mysterious "magic movie" are really what happened here, creating a film that flows smoothly, has incredibly well executed transitions and line after line of well-written dialogs and well executed. <br /> <br /> An absurd premise, many technical inaccuracies and only plan silly things that could not happen in the real world, or the real navy, but you just do not care. As a marine trader, I discovered that the general feeling of the film, although it is not plausible, was not so far from reality when it comes to life at sea. <br /> <br /> This is a VERY funny movie. , a good family movie, and, particularly if you're a fan, a lot of Kelsey Grammar's wit, sarcasm and damn fun.
