I saw this mini-movie when it aired for the first time, and I loved it! It's kind of funny to see how far people will go for money. It is also funny to see how much a boyfriend can "whip". "Beat" enough to kill. I think the cast was great, especially the character Kristin. Without his soft talk and his deceptive image, the film would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I never used to see EE. UU., But now it's one of my stations. <br /> <br />
