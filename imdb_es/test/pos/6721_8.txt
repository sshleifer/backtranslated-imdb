** and 1/2 stars out of **** Lifeforce is one of the strangest movies I've seen, so ridiculous, but at that moment it's strangely compelling and not at all boring. Whether due to nonstop nonstop, to the great amount of violence and action, everything comes together to make 2 hours of movies entertaining. <br /> <br /> The Churchill space caravan has been sent to investigate Halley's comet when they detect it. Something hidden inside the coma of the giant rock. A small team, led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback), has been sent to search the area. What they discover includes hundreds of frozen bat-like creatures and three naked and apparently unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline containers, two men and one woman (Mathilda May). They decide to take all three with them, resulting in a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> When London does not receive a response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what is happening. When they dock with the Churchill, they find the remains of the crew, all dried out beyond recognition. The humanoids are still in perfect condition, and they take them back to London. <br /> <br /> After several tests, scientists still do not know what these beings really are. Then, one night, at the last minute, a security guard in the complex feels obligated to enter the room where the woman is being held. He touches her shoulder, and she wakes up, stands up and smiles at him in a seductive and perverse way. She approaches him and begins to kiss him, when it becomes clear that he is actually taking his life force, sucking all his energy (the effect is a bit corny). <br /> <br /> Escape the complex and start to leave a trail behind. They bring another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), to trace her. Then men discover that there is a pattern in the process of the life force. The corpse of the security guard wakes up in 2 hours and takes the life force of a doctor. It seems that every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. With the help of Churchill's only survivor, Carlsen, they try to track the girl before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is good nightly entertainment. It has all the elements that one could look for in a movie of this type, a lot of nudity, blood / blood and many special effects. This is certainly better than a similarly plotted film, Species, thanks in large part to a more fascinating ending. <br /> <br /> The performance varies from decent to terrible. Facing the worst is easily Steve Railsback, who has an endless exaggerated behavior. Much better are Peter Firth, who appears and is convincing, and the beautiful Mathilda May (she is as beautiful as the French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). She may pass through almost all the paper without wearing clothes, and there were reports that it was difficult for her while filming, so it is impressive that she can go through each scene without fussing and looking uncomfortable. There are times when it can be quite spooky, just seductive. Most of the film manages to work thanks to her. <br /> <br />
