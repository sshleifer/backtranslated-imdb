Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" immerses the viewer in the lowest depths of life during much of his execution time, with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages include the mythical image of death itself. Here Death is incarnated as a ghostly horse drawn carriage, led by a miserable sinner who was the last person to die on the eve of the previous New Year. For a year, the unfortunate must pick up the souls of the newly parties, and after twelve months of this horrible servitude, the soul of the driver is finally released when the last person who dies on December 31 becomes the new driver. <br /> <br /> The scenes that involve this car (the film was known as "The Phantom Carriage" or "The Phantom Chariot" in the English-speaking countries) are spooky and fascinating, and they use a double-exposure cinematography which was quite sophisticated for its time and is still effective when seen today. The most surprising thing is that the carriage travels to the bottom of the ocean to pick up the soul of a person who drowned. However, in spite of how fascinating these scenes are, most of the film is related to the downward spiral of David Holm, played by the director himself, in a sober description of a man who has renounced the possibility of living a dignified life. In the flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a nice day at the beach with his wife, his children and his brother, and he seems to be a perfectly normal guy. Abruptly, without segue or explanation, we see Holm as an alcoholic accident, in trouble with the law and away from his family. In general, this leap from Before to After may seem a deficiency in storytelling, but in this case the filmmakers rely on us to complete the familiar and sordid details on our own. It is suggested that Holm has gone astray by his friendly friend Georges, the drinking companion who first tells the story of the Phantom Carriage, but whatever the cause of his fall, Holm seems to be a lost cause, an evil drunkard who takes perverse . pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reform. <br /> <br /> While David Holm is our central figure, the real catalyst of the story is a young Salvation Army nurse who is interested in his case and believes stubbornly in his case. He despite his odious behavior. When the nurse herself is dying, indirectly due to her ministrations on behalf of Holm, she demands to see him and, therefore, inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will allow her to recover. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this film resembles Dickens's story about Scrooge in the use of ghostly visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life, suffer from his bad behavior and reform . I also remembered Sjöström's drama, "Terje Vigen", from 1917, in which a man returns from prison to find his empty house and his missing family (a sequence is repeated here). The director also reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore, found earlier in his "Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru" (a.k.a. "The Outlaw and His Wife", 1918) that no man can overcome his destiny. This time, however, it could be argued that David Holm really manages to evade his seemingly inevitable fate, since he has an unexpected second chance to repair the damage. <br /> <br /> Viewers hoping for a dive into the supernatural will appreciate the footage with the title Ghost Cart, but may not be prepared for the painful examination of this movie of the alcoholic fall of a troubled man. But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate "Körkarlen" in its entirety. It is the best serious cinema of its time and is undoubtedly one of the most successful works of Sjöström.
