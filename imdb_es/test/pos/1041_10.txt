This is the best work I've seen on television. The story is convincing, all the more because it is true. The writers did their homework: the accuracy of the events is well documented. The acting is great. This has to be the best role that Sam Waterston has had. And the cinematography in black and white was exceptional. The only thing I regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago I contacted someone involved with the production (either with PBS or in England) and they told me they had no plans to release it on VHS (at that time). This was a production of the BBC and was made in the USA. in American Playhouse. There is so much interest in seeing this, but it is hard to believe that anyone can make it available.
