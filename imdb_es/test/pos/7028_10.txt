The first time I saw this movie with my girlfriend, many years after its premiere. I thought I'd hate it, but to my surprise it's so cheesy that it's great. We have spent many hours representing parts of the movie ("Sylvia? Yes, Mickey?" Or "I'm sorry you had to see that baby. Sometimes in this world we see things we do not want"). . My financier laughs every time I imitate Neil. The music is also classic and fun to sing, especially on road trips. Of course I do not admit any of this to my male friends. It's like a guilty pleasure. Seriously, I see Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it's always so good. Jennifer Gray is also very cute in this movie. It is a pity that his career never took off.
