"Live Together, Die Alone" is divided into three main story lines, and each of them alone would have been enough for a big episode. So when we put them all together, they have a great episode of ^ 3. It was a bold move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his background story It is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about Isla's past and the Swan station itself and honestly on the move. Desmond and Penny seem to be magically connected to each other, even when they are at opposite ends of the world, and both characters are beautifully acted (it's hard not to cry when Desmond reads Penny's letter). The action inside the hatch is tense at the edge of his seat, since Locke is determined not to allow the button to be pressed again, convinced that it was all just a psychological experiment, Desmond gradually realizes the consequences of This decision, and Eko is blocked outside and tries desperately to re-enter. The melting of the clock and "I was wrong" by Locke are unforgettable moments. The external action has Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley captured by the Others due to Michael's betrayal (after they made a surprising discovery connected to the Pearl), and Henry Gale's exchange change as the leader of the Others . Even the least important plot line, Sayid, Jin and Sun sailing towards the beach where the Others are supposed to camp, contains one of the greatest mythological mysteries of the show, the giant statue that is almost not found, except for a foot with four fingers. In short: emotion + history + mythology + adventure + suspense + the threat of annihilation + a ray of hope = a classic LOST episode. *** 1/2 of 4.
