Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico were without a doubt the weakest of the modern animated characters of Scooby Doo. Loch Ness Monster is a considerable improvement. <br /> <br /> This time the gang went to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visit Blake Castle, the ancestral home of Daphne. And, if you do not know, the castle is located in the picturesque fishing village of Drumnadrochit, on the shores of Loch Ness. <br /> <br /> During your stay, you meet some interesting people. First there is Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has drowned all her money to find the Loch Ness monster. <br /> <br /> Sir Ian Locksley, the head of the Scottish National Heritage Museum, is a staunch non-believer of Nessie. <br /> <br /> The Haggarts have a cozy inn on the shores of the lake. The children are a couple of local jokers, always with malice. <br /> <br /> Del Chilman, a wild and paranoid hippie who is convinced that the monster is out there and will not stop at anything when he finds it. <Br /> <br /> And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the springmaster who has seen Nessie too many times to tell. <br /> <br /> Most of these characters are stereotypes, which becomes a bit annoying because this is to teach younger audiences. A lot of garbage and giving the wrong impression. However, if you can be immune to it, you will be fine. Being from Scotland, I can not help but grimace at the terribly imitated Scottish accents. Fact: We do not sound like that. <br /> <br /> Very soon, Nessie, with a more demonic than 'usual' aspect, appears and wreaks havoc. It seems that the gang has another mystery in their hands. They follow Shaggy's usual chase scenes, clues and extravagant costumes. There are many laughs. The animation is splendid, with some atmospheric scenes and locations. And the plot is much better than Monster of Mexico. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing this time is the music. I miss the Louis Febre marker and the songs here are also pretty rotten. Where are the Hex Girls when you need them? <br /> <br /> The region 2 DVD is in 1.78: 1 crystalline anamorphic widescreen (region 1 is not) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some good extras are included. Definitely worth getting it.
