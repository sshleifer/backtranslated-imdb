I thought that this movie was written intelligently and very well acted. It is a film that far surpasses other films in terms of originality and fun. Rupert Grint played the role in a wonderful way, and has a general ability for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added a lot to the plot, and was a character who could almost hate instantly. This reminded me, in a way, of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Brotherhood. Not by the actual content of the film, but the premises and the overall tone of the film. "Driving Lessons" is a story of coming of age, which many may find very easy to relate due to the overwhelming mother, the lack of freedom and the discovery of oneself.
