This is a truly hilarious movie and I've seen it many times. Drew Barrymore is brilliant as Josie Geller, as is David Arquette as his brother. You're ashamed of the idea of ​​going back to high school because the movie is a reminder of what high school really was! Their outfits are extravagant and strange, and it brings back memories of those who dressed a little differently! The great Michael Vartan was adorable as a teacher (I wish there had been teachers like that when he was in high school!) And Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a movie that you can watch again and again, with a fabulous soundtrack! One for all those at school in the 90's to see!
