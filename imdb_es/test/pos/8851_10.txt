People with an aversion to gore can find some difficult scenes, but The Thing is far from simply a horror classic. The fact that extraordinary special effects confront most CGIs today is only a small part of why this film is ultimately considered a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in his camera work and editing, with excellent writing and acting, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia sustained in everything (with innumerable presentations), an excellent soundtrack and open to multiple readings and analogies There just are not enough superlatives to do justice to this movie. Absolutely essential visualization.
