A fascinating piece of documentary life about a husband and his wife and their marriage counted through the eyes of their son. We all like to think that our parents lived happy lives, that their marriages were full of satisfaction, love and happy memories. Unfortunately, many of us know that this is not the case with their own families and their parents. This wonderful little documentary is told through the lens of the camera and the emotional perspective of the son of a family who has just experienced the death of his mother. The son, being a documentary maker, has filmed his older family for many years, since as he says "posterity". Three months after his mother's death, his father remarries his former secretary. The suddenness of this happens to stuns the family and pushes the child to delve into the past lives of his mother and father. What he reveals is a fascinating look at the lives of two very ordinary people who, like many of the generations, got married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves trapped in a family life where they discovered that they only had to "get by". A wife who sometimes found herself bitterly alone and without love and a husband who buries himself in his work. She and her intellectual at heart, he is a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet solitude of work. Obviously they are wrong for each other, this is clear. However, they stay, for what? Well, that's part of the mystery, they clearly show affection for each other sometimes, if not always a lot of love. Here you will not find really shocking revelations, apart from the infidelity on both sides, which is what really makes this jewel. You really feel that these could be your own parents if the circumstances were different and, in fact, make you question the lives of the parents themselves.
