The recent history of Hollywood ghost / horror movie remakes has been discouraging. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy in e-bay or similar. <br /> <br /> It is well photographed and the sound is excellent. It is recommended to see on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS sound system. Obviously it's subtitled, so if that discourages you, then I would not bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and I simply would not do it here. <br /> <br /> It is also genuinely scary, with excellent performances by a cast that will not be familiar to Western audiences. Particularly I would highlight the character of the stepmother, who was absolutely brilliant. The end will have to want to see it again, if it can cope. The plot is relentless, and does not offer comforting release moments along the way. <br /> <br /> If I have a small criticism, there may be a detectable influence in certain scenes of the Japanese version of The Ring. However, we have accepted direct copies of other people's ideas for Western films for years, so my point of view is limited and it did not stop me from giving 10/10. I think that most of the fans of this genre will get a great "pleasure" from this movie that, on the one hand, I hope is a classic.
