Excellent and moving story of the end of an intimately unique affair. Then, again, the point of the film, paraphrasing another comment, is that each relationship can be unique and intimate. A truly quality film that caught me in my greatest activity, but that had the power to throw me on the sofa and watch, fixed and silent, all the time. Bobby and Tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love story will find this film a cathartic exercise. Beyond that, the idea of ​​'film inside a film' develops very well with this cast and is quite fascinating, although in a somewhat melancholic way.
