Michael Jackson is the best singer and the best dancer that ever existed and this movie proves it. It's great to see and the dance is fantastic. When Michael becomes a werewolf it is a bit like a part on the edge of your seat the first time you see him. and the rap of vincent price adds to the fear when all the zombies rise from their graves. If you like this, I suggest you buy 'Making Michael Jackson's Thriller', which has the movie and then take it later. The performance shows an incredible performance of 'Billie Jean' by michael, which is when he did it for the first time on television, the moonwalk. Look at it.
