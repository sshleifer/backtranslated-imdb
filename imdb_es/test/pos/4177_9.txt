Head should have been a proud moment not only for his stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or his director / co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also for his other co-writer (and short cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it is, most of them seem to avoid it, and for those outside, the film is considered, at best, as a curiosity. <br /> <br /> While the television series was based on the Beatles' antics. Help! ', This movie is also judged by the same agreement. However, far from the trivial and painfully overrated films of the Beatles, and even from the last series Monkees T.V., Head has a depth layer. Here is a hidden stream of man's darker nature, and while this may sound like a strange thing to say about a fabricated pop band, the use of certain themes and images (hitting women, laughing at cripples and the real life images of a Vietcong). POW shot to point-blank range) gives the film an advantage that many "serious" films would not dare to aspire to. <br /> <br /> There are also fun moments, ranging from the parodies of James Bond to 'Big Victor' and my personal favorite, Mickey Dolenz, under the merit of the Arab soldiers on horseback. (One of them turns to Mickey and whispers' pssst! ', Just so that' pssst! 'Appears in subtitles!) The group is aware of its image made in the movie (' I'm the dummy, Mickey ?? I "I'm always the doll", says Tork, carefully summarizing his one-dimensional role in the series), which means his characters? Do they play 'themselves' acting and not acting here? they open up more and, therefore, are less generic and irritating than they were in the series. This level of parody and self-awareness even acquires its four fabulous origins, with more subtle shots in the Maharishi and direct recognitions with a waitress who asks: "Well, if it is not God's gift for the eight". year old?? Are you still paying homage to Ringo Starr? Also listen to Tork whistle 'Strawberry Fields Forever' while in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Then there are the songs, of course. Six of them here, a little more psychedelic than usual, which may have alienated their fan base, and even a cameo by Frank Zappa would not have become an adult audience for their charms at this time. Probably the best is the charming "As we move forward", although the first, a "Porpoise Song", written by Carol King, speaks interestingly about the desire to live while time runs ruthlessly and death is getting closer and closer. On a lighter note, his chorus of "the porpoise is laughing" seems to be a direct mickey of "I am the Walrus". <br /> <br /> Always inventive with direct references to the silent film and the culture of the drug, Perhaps the best feature of Head is its narrative structure. It's not the only one? but the most important ?? So it improves with multiple visualizations, the story goes to the left, to the right, forward, backward, circular and through various levels of reality. In essence, a series of sketches hanging loosely, its cohesion is reinforced by the defiant plot of space-time that holds together its internal logic through flashback, dream sequence, mental prison and remote control channel changer. <br /> <With a perfect beginning and end, this intelligent, written knowledge film was not what the preteen audience of The Monkees expected and subsequently suffered a negative critical reception. Now that those expectations are gone, it has a great need for serious reassessment.
