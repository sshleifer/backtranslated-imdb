It's okay, it's too long and he's very pleased with himself. Still, "The Great Dictator" is a fascinating movie. Chaplin does an excellent job of satirizing Hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the Jews in Nazi Germany (this was before the concentration camps were of common knowledge). It's not a masterpiece by Chaplin, but it's worth seeing. <br /> <br />
