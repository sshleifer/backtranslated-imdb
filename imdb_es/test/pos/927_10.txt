The trilogies are very interesting. Some come out with an explosion (The Lord of the Rings), others weaken progressively (The Matrix), others are lost in the dark (Blade, Back to the Future), but some maintain the genius, that bright light that seems to be every greater time. It floats beyond the surface of its impeccable exterior. Case and point: "Trilogy of three colors". This chapter of the trilogy, being the last, is the most philosophical and stimulating. In "Blue" we had a plot more visually striking and more character-based, in "White" it was more than a happy and narrative story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything else. "Red", however, focuses on the "what if" and "how it comes". It questions our own destiny and focuses mainly on the past and the future that in the present. <br /> <br /> This chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and takes it back to its owner. He soon discovers that the owner of the dog is actually a retired cynical judge who spies on his neighbors' phone calls through advanced espionage equipment. The three films in the trilogies have very basic arguments, but they contribute much more to the story. Consider in "Blue," the story of a woman who deals with the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly shown ideas about contemporary French society and how that reflects the behavior of the character. "Red" is not only about a young woman who finds refuge in the life of an older man, but also about luck, hope and destiny. <br /> <br /> Irene Jacob plays Valentine Dussaut, who at first finds the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), from whom we never find the name, extremely egocentric and disgusting. Although through self-reflective analysis and voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her, if only 40 years younger. Irene lives in front of another younger judge, who looks a lot like the old man. This is the "what if" that continues to circulate in the film. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old man would have been his perfect match. But, what if the youngest judge is actually your perfect match, since he looks a lot like the old one? Valentine does not know, only we know, and Krzysztof Kieslowski suggests it subtly in almost all the paintings in which Irene finds herself. His presence hits us constantly, almost as a suggestion of Irene's fate. <br /> <br /> I mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason. That reason is because it is very symbolic for the general theme of the story. We must compare the previous judge with Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the youngest judge, in more than one way. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved, but she ran away. In another scene, we see Auguste disconsolate when the love of his life comes out with another man. There are constant reminders of whether Valentine will meet this man or not. Although they pass each other without realizing it every day. There is also the reason for the telephone, for Valentine is a way to keep healthy and update his life, for Auguste is what leads to his anguish, and for the old man, it is the only thing that remains. These three elements serve to overshadow the psychology of the characters. It is a kind of statement about who they are and who they are. <br /> <br /> The three "Colors" films represent a certain beginning, the most common in France. "Blue" means Freedom (the personal being), "White" means Equality (being accepted by more than one), and "Red" means Fraternity (to socialize, to learn). And although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the principle of the Fraternity, Kieslowski makes sure that he also includes the other two, to connect the three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to approach Valentine and illuminate her with his spy team, which is a reflection of the principle of Equality. We also see near the end that Valentine is doing an examination of conscience and that she is more concerned with herself than with others (she does not answer the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And with the three established principles, Kieslowski connects all the characters very well, in the final and most sincere scene. <br /> <br /> "Network" is where you could have been if you were older or younger. It is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone, and whether a person can change your life or not. The last chapter of the most impressive trilogy ever made, this film breaks down barriers in both direction and narration. It is not just about our modern life, but about where life could and should be in our modern age. And although the film is more subtle than "Blue" and "White," it boldly exclaims a declaration of love and compassion. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that "Red" was Kieslowski's last film, and that died at such a young age. However, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that aligns with Bergman, Fellini and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who has never been awarded an Oscar. Kieslowski, we missed you!
