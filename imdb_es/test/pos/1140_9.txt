This is the kind of film that may need to be seen several times to capture all its beauty and intelligence (like Curse of Frankenstein of 1957). If you do not like strange, unconventional movies, stay away from this masterpiece. For me, only the artistic work in this film is worth the purchase price of the videocassette. The story is a bit fantastic, but it seems to become reality in our current world. To be produced in the 1980s, this film is proving to be a prophetic vision of what will come with the big government and the big brother who want to control us and watch over us. <br /> <br /> There are many slow sections and dialogue can be very difficult to capture in many scenes (that's why I've seen it 6 times) but if you can digest everything, it might be worth it. <br /> <br /> The film is basically about a world where people have become robotic machines that have lost their individualism. They only worry about accumulating and procreating. The hero of the film has not succumbed to this disease and has not been "labeled" and supervised by his older brother. Its mission is to launch a secret drug in the water supply that will change the way human robots think and allow individualism to become part of humanity again. <br /> <br /> Yes, its very low budget, but for it is the time when computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are absolutely fascinating. If you have an open mind, this movie should impress and your prophetic visions are chilling.
