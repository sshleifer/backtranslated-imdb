Hell to Pay is a bit bloody for my taste, although it is not worse than many movies. However, I enjoyed the parade of seasoned stars and the western landscape and everything; but, the story line was very weak and I really could not see the point of everything. However, the music that accompanies the movie more than makes up for the mediocre movie. <br /> <br /> Where did the kids -Nate & Noah Cryns- who wrote this music come from? They are impressive !! From the moment the music starts, it's much better than anything else I've heard in years. I think it may be the best thing I've heard! Even though I was not thrilled with the action that took place in the film, the music evoked the exact emotion that was needed for each scene. I was transported back in time to the old west during the opening credits and I really felt that I was reliving those old times through music. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a purchase and a visit to the beautiful Music and a trip down the path of memory to see the old western stars once again.
