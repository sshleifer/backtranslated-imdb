I have not seen this movie in many years. He arrived at the Disney Channel late at night. I stayed up to see it and found it even more entertaining than the first time. The history, the landscape and the characters are as good as they come. I know that if someone takes the time to see this movie, it will definitely be worth it to see it a second time. It is very memorable in more ways than one. I would recommend this movie to anyone because it is entertaining and educational for all concerned. <br /> <br /> s
