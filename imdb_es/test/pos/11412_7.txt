When A Stranger Calls is actually a pretty good movie. I had never seen the original and when I saw it, I thought it was unique. When it was announced on TV When A Stranger Calls, the trailer revealed the ending. Well, I never saw the trailer, so when I saw this movie, I was surprised at how good it turned out to be. I went there one day and decided that I would buy it and now I'm lucky I did it, because I thought it was a very nice movie that is a very nice little movie to own. You are receiving unfair treatment and, if you are interested in this movie, do not listen to all the negativity. Camille Belle is not an actress as bad as everyone else does, and she did a great job in this movie, so everyone who hates them gets over it, they rejoice and really try to enjoy this movie for what it is; A fun, tiny bopper, popcorn movie. If you have not seen it, do it because it's so much more fun than many of the other slashers that have been created recently ...
