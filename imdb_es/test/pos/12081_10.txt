I saw this movie when it aired on television in February 1983. I was in the hospital, and I had just given birth to my first and only child. I will refrain from telling you how much I was moved. Suffice to say that the memory of the film has remained with me until today, almost 23 years later. I hope I can find a copy of this movie, if ever something like this was done. This film should be remembered fondly by anyone who has seen it. However, I must admit that the fact that it is still something dark is fine for me. In this way, it will always be a little secret to me and to those who were also moved. I never saw Mrs. Margaret perform a better part. Nor have I seen her in a more convincing role. I will always respect her just for accepting such a beautiful part.
