The decade of the 80s is considered largely the decade in which the horror decided to have fun. Sometimes, there were some definite brains behind everything ("Evil Dead II", "The Night of the Creeps" and "The Return of the Living Dead" for example) and then there were those movies that did not make sense but that had a charm definitive low income. and they were perfect for a night out with beer and friends. Films like "Pieces" and "Blood Diner" stacked rental shelves in the 80s and 90s, offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship, but lots of silent fun. Kevin Tenney's film "The Night of the Demons" of 1988 is part of this tradition: stupid, badly acted and not an original bone in his body, but damn if you do not have a good time. <br /> <br /> The plot is so simplistic that it only had to come from the 80s: a group of silly teenagers played by a group of actors from the mid to late 20s decide to go to a party at Hull House thrown by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Legend of the screaming queen, Linnea Quigley.) Well, Angela and company. Decide to launch a session. This turns out to be how Will Arnett's "Arrested Development" character would call it "Big Error", because a demonic force soon possesses Angela, and also begins to reach out to others. <br /> <br /> Take "The Evil Dead", "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and your average movie of dumb teenagers, move them in a blender, and "Night of the Demons" is what you get. The film is anything but original and, in reality, it is not a good movie. Everything is incredibly derivative, the acting is terrible, the jokes are often discouraged, the characters are annoying (especially the character of Stooge) and the holes in the plot are numerous. That out of the way, it's still a lot of fun. Then why? <br /> <br /> Well, for starters, the make-up and gore effects are first class, with some really memorable moments (especially a little weird and a little flat with a lipstick tube) that really stand out. Also rarely, if ever, he takes himself too seriously, however, with the exception of some terrible wordplay, he plays with clarity and never wastes the audience's time with a nod to self-awareness. In addition, there is a defined energy and enthusiasm for the entire company that is almost impossible to resist. Yes, it's nothing special, but you know it, and I could not be more proud of that fact. It's a ridiculous party horror movie, and it never claims to be anything else. <br /> <br /> It may not be a classic, but "Night of the Demons" is a good example of horror junk food made correctly. It may not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you do not want an elegant beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.
