Mas Oyama was the most successful master of karate at the end of the 20th century. He rejected the "training" of the karate clubs of the time, focusing on an intense form of training. Finally, he turned his system into a great business empire with hundreds of schools around the world, without compromising his teachings. Tests at Kyokushin schools are still some of the most physically challenging tests that any martial arts school requires. One of the non-physical difficulties that Oyama faced was prejudice due to his Korean ancestry and he spent time demonstrating that the loyalties were for Japan and Japanese Karate. This series of films was part of that effort, although anyone who had the opportunity to meet Oyama (I did) would never question their loyalty to Japan. In this series, the most famous student of Oyama, Sonny Chiba, is called to represent his teacher. <br /> <br /> Oyama arrives from the field where he has been training alone. He challenges and shortens the work of the established schools of Karate he finds. Disgusted by the state of karate, Oyama returns to his solitary training. Finally, pick up a student, fall in love and get in the way of the gangsters who are allied with the established karate schools. In the middle of this is the legendary bullfight with an angry bull. It is questionable how much of the film is true. <br /> <br /> That Oyama can kill a bull with his own hands is true. He was called to repeat this feat several times. There are filmed examples of Oyama that really does this, although sometimes the bulls seemed to be tied as Oyama did in years. Sonny Chiba portrays his teacher with conviction and karate is pretty good. Chiba may not have been the best karate practitioner but, at this time, he was certainly above average. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is good, much better than most martial arts movies in the drama department. I always wondered why he is not better known. Possibly it is the very realistic representation of martial arts. People are tired and wounded unlike 99% of the action movie where the hero is an unlimited source of energy and each hit instantly sends an opponent to death. Chiba seems so exhausted at a point that it hurts to look. Perhaps viewers prefer that their entertainment does not reflect reality so closely. <br /> <br /> Recommended especially for martial artists.
