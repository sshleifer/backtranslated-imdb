Located in Venice mainly in the Lido, "Death in Venice" by Visconti is a triumph of cinema that combines the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterization and the expert photography of the tourist area in all its different daily environments. For those who love Venice, this is a movie to appreciate. <br /> <br /> Mahler's music that is frequently heard throughout the film enhances the drama. The mood you create is not always happy. But then, what else would you expect with a title like that? <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the movie. Rather scarce indeed. It's mainly background noises and chats and laughter among the hotel guests. The interesting part is interpreting the exchange of glances between Gustav von Aschenbach, a renowned composer and a slim young teenager Tadzio who are seen from time to time through the tables of the hotel dining room, on the beach and in strange unexpected places. around venice They seem to recognize the presence of the other timidly at the beginning with little more than the suggestion of a smile, but then with a strong, captivating and urgent look. <br /> <br /> Each viewer will have their own interpretation. The composer has lost a child of his own. Is this behavior an expression of longing for the child he loved? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction to this fragile young woman with her dazed look as a child? Could I be discovering some new inspiration for a musical masterpiece not yet written? Who knows? <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, this film captures the true spirit of nineteenth-century Venice. The elegance of the ladies, the chairs on the sand, the children playing with their swimsuits from neck to knee, the brightness of the sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world. While some may think that the pace is quite slow at times, the film has a smooth quality in general, but with an indecision simmering between two repressed humans. Prepare for a sad and beautiful ending.
