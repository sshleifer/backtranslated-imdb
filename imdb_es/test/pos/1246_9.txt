I really enjoy this movie. Yes, there was lack of respect throughout the film, but Bruce Willis discovered, from The Kid, that there is more value in correcting others and that his life of disrespect should change. This movie was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to push through our throats. There are some very good lessons to learn in this movie. I really think that this was one of the best of Disney, even though a couple of things could have been omitted. I was impressed by the lack of insults and the lack of sexual inuendos. It is not perfect, but it is much better than everything else.
