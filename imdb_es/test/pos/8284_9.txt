When I saw this movie for the first time, I was just a child and I fell in love with it, they do not make films like this anymore, I only see this again a little older and I still love it. <br /> <br /> The humor is perfect and fits very well in the film, all the gags are a bit childish, but they will also make adults laugh, and in a children's movie it is really very rare. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing and watching the hand-drawn animation is a true breath of fresh air to all the computer animation we see today. The backgrounds are stunning and the colors are incredible. <br /> <br /> The characters are exactly the kind of characters you fall in love with the moment you start seeing the girls they will think that the Chipmunks are adorable and the Boys will think that the Chipettes are really a bit sexy . <br /> <br /> The songs are also fun to listen to and some really make you want to cry or get up and dance, it's also fun to see the visual humor to accompany them. <br /> <br /> The voice acting is excellent, no doubt, even if most of the voice acting is high-pitched, but something interesting appeared and it was one of the songs in this movie, but it slowed down to show the real voices Behind them and it's really fun to see them. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a store or somewhere to rent, I tell you to check that it really is worth seeing and that it is a perfect family movie. It's absolutely amazing, words can not express this movie.
