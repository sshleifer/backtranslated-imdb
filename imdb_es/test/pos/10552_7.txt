This is another case of the arrogance of Hollywood that supposes eclipsing the French style. The original, Mon Pere ce heros, was one of the most charming films of 1991, so naturally, the Hollywood accountants thought they could hire Depardieu and telephone the rest. However, they took the precaution of hiring Francis Veber to write an English. Version although one that uses virtually every word of the original. Depardieu brings his Gallic charm and Katherine Heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off. What happens is that when the French make a kind of Lolita-lite they get away with it because the thought of the "dirty French postcard" works in their favor; here, the Hollywood idea of ​​lightweight subtlety is to have Depardieu (totally unaware that his daughter has made him known that he is actually her lover), won to play the song 'something French', thrown into an animated version by Thank Heaven For Little Girls.
