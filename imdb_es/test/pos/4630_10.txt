I think this movie has to be one of the most moving and heartbreaking films of recent times. <br /> <br /> The movie basically starts with a suicide in a school bathroom. U does not see who it is, hence it goes at the beginning of the day, and we meet 6 characters, and they are going through some pretty heavy things, anyway, eventually one of them will commit suicide. <Br /> <br /> I have been teaching physical education in schools for 8 years, and never in a movie have I seen such a precise description of what "really" happens in school life. <br /> <br /> The film is shot perfectly and sounds incredible. <br /> <br /> The end is so shocking, and what you do not expect is something that will haunt me in the coming days. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one to see. <br /> <br /> I think that the fact that the Director / Writer has been in school only a few years ago is an important factor that contributes to the expressed honesty. in the film. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded in two separate 'modes' if desired. First of all, there is the gentle observation style in which we know the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama, but the most impressive part of the film is in the interview sections, where we know stories of characters and their stories. The deepest and darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> You keep wondering who it is going to be (who commits suicide) and, as the drama unfolds, you keep changing your mind, until, bam, it hits your face in the face. Five final minutes I'm everywhere in my writing, but I just saw it in a Media screening in Australia, and I'm still a bit in shock. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best Australian films I've seen in recent years.
