Deep Water examines the pressures and ambitions of an ordinary man in a compelling documentary. The testimony and archive images are a fascinating insight into the late sixties and an innovative yacht race around the world. The personal conflicts of duty with family, self and reputation are presented in one of the most memorable and emotional films I have seen. I was not familiar with the history of this story and the drama was directed successfully and clearly. The story is mostly respectful with the participants, with implicit heroes and villains instead of being exposed mercilessly. Most of the interpretation is left open to the viewer, which allows the space to be personally related to situations and characters. This film is a bitter and sweet experience with an entertaining mix of reflective suspense, joy and drama.
