I have felt a little disappointed by Tarantino since the test of death. But I insist that it was only a little, because I can appreciate the amount of work in producing a tribute to people. Inglorious Basterds has definitely propelled Tarantino to the first places in my universe. This film can be summarized (although inadequately) in one word: "RAW". <br /> <br /> There is an intense emotion in each scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main issues. From the beginning of the film, one feels compassion for the victims of the Nazis and is located in the fictional dimension of Tarantino of the historical context of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> The characters are unpredictable, funny, frightening, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives that I'm sure escape my mind, which are just as appropriate and positive. I will not appreciate each character, but the other comments from other users summarize the appreciation of the different performances. <br /> <br /> The dialogue has evolved from the classic provocative style of Tarantino's "bad ass" as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino is making more open references to other films. In fact, many dialogues were close to film lessons for the public, the stage is developed in part at a movie premiere; A reference to a movie is near each corner. <br /> <br /> It is good to see that each language presented (German, French and English) is used quite equally and naturally. I speak French and English fluently, and I am often disappointed that English-speaking characters in French films act badly, and how French-speaking characters in English and American films act poorly. Surprisingly, Tarantino managed to get his actors to achieve a natural and elegant performance of their actors. It helps to put the audience in the context of the historical context. Indeed ; Soldiers, spies and civilians rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> The images / photography are beautiful, with landscapes that convey convincingly a Europe of the Second World War of the forties. The outfits are perfect, and violence is transmitted orgasmically / realistically. Punching is not stopped, and it is often shown that the Nazis are tortured. This makes the film not open to all audiences; Graphic violence can impact the most sensitive demographics. <br /> <br /> You can write volumes about this movie. But the film is so good, that during the premiere of Basterds Inglorious in North America at the Festival Fantasia in Montreal, I had to pee, but I refused to go so as not to miss a single scene. I hope that image conveys how strong I feel about this film, and I am a difficult audience to please.
