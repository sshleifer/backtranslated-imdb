I did not have many expectations regarding Just Before Dawn. I do not know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's always the same. Maybe I'm a little masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, everything is the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it is a small group of teenagers who go to the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, he kills them one by one for a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic! It's one of the best experiences I had when watching a Slasher movie. The places where you shoot are so wonderful. You see mountains, waterfalls, rocky mountains. It is simply amazing. It takes a long time (except in the initial scene) before the killer starts killing, but I did not care! It was nice to look long enough not to care. What I mean is that you will not be sitting there waiting for the killings to start because everything that happens is nice because of the beauty of the movie itself. The ending is a little weird, but I will not tell you anything else about it. You will know what I mean. Another thing that I enjoyed: you care about the characters. They are not just a group of idiots who spend their time annoying each other. Of course, they are pure stereotypes of the usual slasher characters, but there is something special about them. Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you have a great time watching it, because I really did.
