After a couple of years of searching for Humphrey Bogart's film, "Two Against the World", it unexpectedly appeared as an MTC offer under the title "One Fatal Hour", a first national film from 1936. The character of Bogey is Sherry Scott, the man who runs WUBC, a radio station whose programming is losing listeners. The owner, Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass), is a pathetic executive who attacks the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by making pawns on Scott. <br /> <br /> In an effort to increase the base of audience and income, Reynolds has the idea of ​​reviving a twenty-year murder case and offering it as a radio play of fifteen chapters. Scott asks for help from Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) to write the play and present it on the air. <br /> <br /> The case of Pembroke Murder involved a woman who was acquitted of murdering her husband, the circumstances of which are not clarified. However, Gloria Pembroke has married and now lives as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and her daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is about to get married (the same day, not less). As the radio work is to reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke). About to face the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs embark on a crusade to stop the program. Simultaneously, Edith's future in-laws respond by demanding that the marriage not be celebrated. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the final result, the film takes a devastating turn to shake the viewer. Edith Carstairs confronts the directors of the radio station, vigorously admonishing Scott and Reynolds. While accepting his share of the blame for the result, Scott is partially redeemed by quitting his job, firing his secretary and taking her out of the office, recognizing her for the conscience he once had. With a completely abrupt ending, the film leaves one as disoriented and unstable as any film that does not have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> With around a dozen films under his belt, Humphrey Bogart has the opportunity to be the center of attention here with interesting results. Without a name to support the players, Bogey prepares for the occasion by taking over the confines of the radio offices, and runs the program as if it were his. In an interesting characterization, he expresses his exasperation when crossing his hands on his bowed head, preceding half a dozen years, a similar effect that we will see in "Casablanca". For Bogart fans, it's a real pleasure to capture an unexpected nuance like this.
