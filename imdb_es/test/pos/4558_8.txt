I saw this movie without knowing absolutely anything about it and its stars, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I have to say that this movie is a classic comic. It is so stupid at times that it can only be hilarious. Farley is brilliant as the clumsy idiot who hits the road with the right hand of his father (the equally excellent Spade) to find funding to save the family's "car parts" business. Relax, put your brain on autopilot and enjoy the fun. An excellent cast features the likes of Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (Wayne's World) and Bo Derek ("10"). Highly recommended for a good laugh.
