So little time to plan a future that I would not share ... For the sake of it! 10 children who must succeed! "<br /> <br /> Lucile Fray (Ann-Margret), is the caring mother of 10 small children. She is the loving wife of Ivan (Frederic Forrest), a man almost paralyzed by arthritis. She is also dying. Affected by a terminal illness, she only has a few months to live. Her husband, tormented by the painful truth, turns to the bottle and, with a broken heart, Lucile is forced to accept that she will never be able to face herself as a father alone. <br /> <br /> And so, for the sake of the children you love so much, the young mother must make an anguished decision. <br /> <br /> Inspired by real-life events, "Who will love my children" is a tribute to the courage and strength of a woman: a story of sacrifice and the eternal love of a dying mother. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies I've seen.
