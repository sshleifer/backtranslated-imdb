I discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a pleasant surprise. A Christmas classic, it is also one of the best comedies of the 40s. The story is simple: Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) earns a living writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas, his boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks him to invite a young weakened sailor on the farm in Connecticut on which he writes. The only problem is: she has no farm and can not cook. To get out of the jam, Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner, who has a farm) and flies to Connecticut with her wonderful cook, Uncle Felix. <br /> <br /> There is a good direction from Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful: Stanwyck has never been as good as this witty and yet romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall are fun and human support characters. The only weak point is the leader, Dennis Morgan. It starts well, but as the movie progresses, it becomes really boring. One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to end up with him instead of Gary Cooper or David Niven, both of whom would have been better suited for the role. Anyway, this is a cheery Christmas movie with a refreshing score and I advise it to everyone who enjoys a fun and sweet vacation ... in Connecticut.
