It takes a lot for a film to reach the already dormant particles of my brain that have not yet been eliminated due to the overload and redoing of the copy to the world of movies. But this movie has reached my list of 'Magic Movies'. To become a 'magic movie', you must leave every chain of my tremor in what I can only define as 'happiness' and 'complete satisfaction'. This movie has taken advantage of the fibers of how my mind thinks and, if it were not for the personal bond, my head and the one who did this share, would look like another 'dead rave scene' movie from when the 90s exploded with his Ecstasy of madness. This is not how the movie came out. He reached me and took out something that I thought was dead for a long time and pushed me to make a criticism on my own. I forgot how much time has passed since I saw something that left me feeling so good inside. I highly recommend watching this movie.
