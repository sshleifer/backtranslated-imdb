I caught this movie on local television. Around 4:30 am I had no expectations, but after the opening credits I knew I liked something good. <br /> <br /> There are situations that remain for your interpretation to "discover" what really happened, so your attention is a key factor. <br /> <br /> The whole situation of the psychological thriller has a lot to do with the development of the character and the way in which things are executed by the main character. <br /> <br /> Your sub-The conscience also plays an important role because through a series of events and dialogues you can make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are very good. Really good indeed. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and is sweet to the eye, although most of the time she is dressed in white. <br /> <br /> The fear factor is almost nonexistent, but there is a lot of mystery and tension to dig. <Br /> <br /> I would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers.
