I captured this film at an OutFest show in Los Angeles in July 2006. It's rough around the edges (in particular, the sound recording is unstable) and, often, very funny. The script is quite episodic and ends abruptly, but Ash Christian infuses the film with a genuine heart. It's also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay movie that does not star underwear models obsessed with partying and chasing heterosexuals. Donate to Jonathan Caouette, a nice friend, like Mr. Cox, a spirit similar to Rodney (Ash Christian), to Ashley Finke as Rodney's best friend, and to Deborah Theaker as Rodney's mother, who receives the best quotes from a Script and steal each scene. The film is like its writer / director / star with bulges and a little strange, but also very sweet.
