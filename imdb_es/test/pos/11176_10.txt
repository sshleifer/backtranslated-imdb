What can I say? The curse of Monkey Island is fantastic. The story is good and solid, but appropriately silly, the jokes are fun, the puzzles are disconcerting ... you can not ask for more in an adventure game. The bit "You do not need to see my ID" is worth buying the game, not to mention Murray, who has become the hot topic among many of my friends (only some of whom have played the game). You will love this game. And if not, what a pity!
