Below is a little known British film from 1998, which was made with a budget of Â£ 8000 and has a run time of 70 minutes. When you see it, you never expect its director to go to Hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century. Well, everyone has to start somewhere, I suppose. <br /> <br /> The Following director, as you probably already know, is the Englishman Christopher Nolan, who immediately after Follow would continue directing the acclaimed independent film Memento; A few years later he would be hired by Warner Bros. to direct the new Batman series, which made him more acclaimed, and so on. My point is, does everyone have to start somewhere? Even if it's not in the most amazing debut? and Christopher Nolan appears to the world in 1998 with "Follow". <br /> <br /> Upon seeing it, I could not help but look like another directorial debut, Eraserhead, the avant-garde author David Lynch. The following is not a surrealistic psychological horror movie in that sense, but the similarities are remarkable; The most remarkable thing is that it is filmed in black and white granulated and has an atmosphere that makes it unique. It's hard to describe with words, but it resembles the smoky atmosphere you would find in the cinema of antiquity. Therefore, it can be said that the next one is a contemporary black cinema, or a neo-noir. In general, it is an amalgam of that and a psychological thriller, and the story is more appropriate for these two genres. <br /> <br /> The main character has no name, and the title of the film comes from an early, obsessive-compulsive trait he possessed ?? Choose random people on the street and follow them, sometimes even for hours and hours. During one of these 'stalking expeditions', the main character is noticed by one of the people he is following and facing. It turns out that the 'confrontador' is a man who is willing to make friends with our narrator, and introduces himself; His name is Cobb, and he is a small thief who invites the narrator to follow him in his robberies. <br /> <br /> From there, the main character is dragged by the world of Cobb, and is involved in crime, passion. and violence as it becomes more and more intimate with Cobb. The following is not so much a study of the character, but a film that follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator. Nolan manages to make the film look like a black film, and emulates the respective atmosphere well. <br /> <br /> Like a thriller, the following is tense and atmospheric; However, as a movie in general, it is somewhat disappointing. If not, then one could definitely call it disappointing. The entire film was filmed in a non-chronological and non-linear way, and makes the story and the cinematic experience unique, up to a point. This style has been done so many times, now it is an almost common technique. and the story itself is unique up to a point. <br /> <br /> However, Following is, ultimately, disappointing for the entire movie, and disappointingly unspectacular. Does history demand more? More action, more suspense and more emotions? but he becomes too wrapped up in his own story, and instead focuses on creating a complex story. The following is achieved, but without any other element is a black cinema that does not work; It has a feeling of emptiness that is not huge, but it is still remarkable. Also, the shocking revelation of the movie at the end? Almost a mandatory convention in film noirs? it is one that makes us feel cheated; It is unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, but in relation to the story it is disappointing, as it essentially makes the previous scenes, and the whole movie, seem like a huge waste of time. <br /> <br /> But the positive aspects are much more They overcome the negatives and, in the end, the following turn out to be a defective but satisfactory film. Yes, everyone has to start somewhere. Christopher Nolan does it with the next, and does it in a fine way. A calm, gentle but fine way. It's not the most amazing movie, and it's not entirely worth the praise that the director would receive in the next decade, but it's still a good movie. When selected Next, there is a well-done thriller, tense and atmospheric, lacking any notable nuances or an innovative style, but which nevertheless manages to capture the audience.
