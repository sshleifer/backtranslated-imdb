I know what most people will think about this movie without even seeing it ... "The typical movie of a famous singer ... It will be a pink movie, a movie for teenagers, it will be stupid ..." and those things. so ... And yes, it's ... I mean, it's a pink movie ... But, you know what? ... I loved. Seriously ... It's a very romantic movie ... I think all the girls in this world have dreamed of something similar to the plot of 'Popstar' ... He met his favorite singer, I know him as a person ... He even has an affair with him ... right? ^^ I really enjoyed watching that ... Besides, it's really fun ... <br /> <br /> I think the actors did a great job ... There are many loving characters ... And, Aaron Carter (JD) is not the exception ... To be honest, in the first five minutes of watching him perform, I thought "this would be horrible" ... But then, he surprised me in a very nice way ... <br /> <br /> Also, I must say that the musical performances in the movie are great. I especially loved the part when JD (Aaron) sings without music, (only with a guitar) a very beautiful song ... This boy is very talented ... Time will tell ... <br /> <br /> My A tip for you? ... Look at it! Do not make a prejudice ;-)
