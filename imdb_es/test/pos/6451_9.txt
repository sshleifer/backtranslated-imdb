If it had been done 2 years later, it would have been PROHIBITED! The number one MUST SEE the recommendation of the day! The best film by Rouben Mamoulian that I have seen so far (I have but have not yet seen J + H). <br /> <br /> It's no wonder why this movie got less than 200 votes. A bigger greyzone that could not worry about what is right would not be seen until the 60s. As morally ambiguous and dark as the sand of the 70s, but also with a certain charm. Of course, this had to end in the last 30 years and, unfortunately, it does not seem to have been rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Seriously. This I have everything. Great actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and, this time, he's not so nice, Guy Kibbee. And a good director. So far I have not been the biggest fan of RM, but I liked his films a lot and with this he enters a new league. One of the best movies of the 30 I've seen! This is something I never thought existed! 9.5 / 10
