This is probably the best film filmed in at least the last five years. I have always believed that making people cry is much more difficult than making her laugh. If you want to see 400 adults screaming aloud in the same room, go see this movie. It is impressive Javier Bardem plays the role of his life. You will cry, laugh, smile ... The most meritorious fact is that in Spain everyone knows about Ram√≥n Sampedro. Personally I knew the full story and even the end of it. So, the excellence of the film is in the way the story is told. And in this field, Amenabar is a teacher. <br /> <br /> This movie is a MUST.
