Extremely entertaining in the mid-1950s, it accumulates a lot in just 96 minutes of operation time. Most viewers will be quickly attracted by this story and will find the experience quite pleasurable. Despite being a B-Western, but not really an epic, the budget was modest and the cast affordable despite several important names. Glenn Ford was the only box office draw at that time. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck had passed their heyday and looking for work, Stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in "The Big Valley". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster were just beginning. <br /> <br /> Ford plays John Parrish, a small rancher who decides to sell when the friendly sheriff is killed by the gunman hired by the great rancher (Robinson). Parrish is a former Confederate official who only moved west for health reasons. <br /> <br /> Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and intends to get the rest, fulfilling the promise he made to his wife Martha (Stanwyck). Lee was paralyzed in a land war with which he fought 12 years before; his brother Cole (Keith) has come from Texas to help him handle the great spread. Lee has been turning a blind eye to the obvious connections between Stanwyck and Keith, but the sensitive daughter Judith (Foster) is understandably upset by what is happening at home. <br /> <br /> John Parrish has promised his girlfriend Caroline (May Winn) that he will return east. Caroline, who is based on Grace Kelly's "High Noon" character, breaks the commitment at the first sign of trouble and simply disappears from the movie. This leaves the way open for a romance between John and Judith to develop. <br /> <br /> The violence begins early and continues throughout the film, with Parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. He has a very original confrontation with the main gunman halfway through the movie. Ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest man who disarms everyone in a self-critical way, who is slow to be offended but brutal when he is finally provoked (much like his role in "The Sheepman"). <br /> <br /> Robinson is also excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though physically he is only a shadow of his old self. And get enough lines and screen time to properly develop your character. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck has the most difficult role and she simply is not convincing as the classic two-faced woman, a seemingly loyal wife who is planning to replace her husband with her brother. In part, this is because he is not given enough time to do more than superficially convey any side of the character. Having said that, a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations. <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. She must remind viewers of a lot of Carroll Baker, both physically and in performance style. Although she is required to play Judith in accordance with the 1950s convention (she is allowed to be tough but is then required to become hysterical after each major confrontation), Foster shows a good variety. She conveys a growing attraction for Parrish, but she does it so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues fit into place. <br /> <br /> The real problem with "The Violent Men" is that it tries to be a western action and a character study moral work. Because so much has to happen on the screen, much of the action is rushed and many of the characters receive only a superficial treatment. This is not a fatal flaw or a reason to avoid the movie, but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of runtime or the absence of unnecessary characters like Caroline. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I do? to know? I'm just a boy
