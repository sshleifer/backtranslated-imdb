I have sat in several films by Pauly Shore, but this is the only one that I liked. Of course, it helps that it is much less irritating than usual, perhaps even a little pleasant. The rest of the cast does a good job, especially the undervalued Carla Gugino. The film itself is basically a silly and harmless comedy, and although some of the jokes are especially funny, the film is quite entertaining in general.
