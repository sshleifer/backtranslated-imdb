I returned from Morocco then, where my father was linked to the German embassy, ​​when the film came out in Europe; I took all my friends to see him, showed them the beauty of the country, where Jimi had played and stayed; where the hippies stopped after leaving Ibiza and before joining Goa. Sean Combs just celebrated in a friend's restaurant in Marrakech recently, the Djema el Fna was much wilder in those days than now; the Stones went there before, Brian recorded in Tangier; So it's family memories and entertainment, and I'm glad my son knew about North Africa watching this movie. Candice Bergen looks beautiful and Oo7 / Connery is pretty funny; and Teddy Roosevelt played by Brian Keith quite impressive.
