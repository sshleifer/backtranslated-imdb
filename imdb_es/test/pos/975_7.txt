Much better than expected. Good family movie - catch it in the reps. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti chews the stage: he has much more talent than he deserves the role. A pleasure to see Inspector Uhl from "The Illusionist" pass over. The scenes of the blue man were at 11 years old in points. The cameos were particularly fun for the parents: it was a pleasure to see Lee Majors and Urkel (umm, Jaleel) again. It's going to be hard to think of 10 lines for this movie, but let's listen to it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and his parents! Amanda Bynes does a good job when she becomes part of the trap. Normally I can not stand Frankie Muniz but he is fine here. Congratulations to the casting director, if only for hiring Giamatti!
