Located in and near a poor working-class city in the mountains of rural Italy, it's a crazy story. The landscape can be quite picturesque, but here there is madness, hidden behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal. This person kills small children. <br /> <br /> In style and tone, this film resembles the famous Italian giallos by Dario Argento, those fascinating horror movies in which you can only see, but Argento's films are much more attractive. Even so, the visuals in Fulci's "Do not Torture A Duckling" are competent, with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night increase the suspense in a sequence in which one of the "ducklings" is vulnerable alone. <br /> <br /> In a sequence, the gore is a bit exaggerated. But this is not a slasher movie. A legitimate theme sustains the story. And that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic. <br /> <br /> A lot of false clues make solving the puzzle difficult if the viewer does not believe. An agenda by the director. Do not fire someone who does not look suspicious. The turn near the end provides a good wrong direction. However, in a midway scene, a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of which is the killer. The end of the film takes place on a beautiful mountain with the wind whistling in the background. We see flashbacks to clues and get information about the murderer's mentality. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the widescreen projection of the movie. But the background music is effective, ranging from a creepy chill at first to low-key jazz, to indigenous Italian songs. The performance is generally average, although in a couple of cases, it is a little exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Although it is not as visually brilliant as Argento's giallos, "Do not Torture A Duckling" is a good movie, one that contains a thematic story and enough of a riddle to interest most people. the spectators who like thrillers and murderous mysteries.
