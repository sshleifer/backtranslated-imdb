it's not a masterpiece by Larry Mcmurty, but it stands alone as a good western, any of the lonely doves do. Whoever takes on the role of Woodrow, makes a great portrait in his own style. It is also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a springboard for the television series (both versions) and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive. William Peterson was amazing in this, the CSI geek guy is not the character he plays in this, this guy can do everything that seems <br /> <br /> that deserves to be enjoyed by those who enjoy westerns <br /> <br /> 4out5 stars
