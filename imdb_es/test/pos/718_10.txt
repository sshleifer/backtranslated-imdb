The "Art for Children's Teachers" by Jennifer Montgomery is an amazing and disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's camera work and cinematography, along with the brilliant emotionless performances he evokes from his cast, heighten the sense of shocking and raw realism in this autobiographical story of the seduction of Jennifer, 14, of her marriage counselor. The scenes between the amazing actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've seen captured in the film. The lesson finally learned here? "There is nothing more dangerous than a bored man who creates bad art." Well, I would highly recommend this extraordinary piece of "Art" for anyone interested in independent cinema that makes you think.
