"Zen and the art of Lanscaping", written and directed by David Kartch, is a short film about a young man named David (his friends call him Zen) and what happens on a strange day in his life. Zen works as a lanscaper for a middle-upper class family. The lady of the house tries Zen to help her deceive her husband. Unfortunately, her son approaches them instead of her husband. From this point, the film begins to accelerate through many revelations between the characters along with the eventual participation of the man of the house. "Zen and the art of landscaping" is ingenious, intelligent and in general is very well written. The comic moment of the actors is also very strong. It is a fun and light film that I highly recommend.
