In the first place, there is a detective story: "légitime défense", by the Belgian Stanislas André Steeman, whose "l'assassin habite au 21" Clouzot had already transferred to the screen in 1942, with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair. about the adaptation of Clouzot for both films. The 1942 film was excellent, but the side of the "detective story" remained, so why complain? As for "Quai des orfèvres", Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career. After having directed "le corbeau" and having been included in the blacklist, he had much more to say than a simple whodunit. Steeman essentially complained about the poor detective's ending, which I will not disclose, of course, but Clouzot focused on social cartoons, on his characters' cartoons. Psychology did not care about the Agatha Christie puzzle. In doing so, he becomes the true predecessor of CLaude Chabrol, who has always been closer to him than Alfred Hitchcock, whom he greatly admires. Suzy Delair has a great presence on the screen, and you'll love the song she really sings (she was also a singer) "avec son tralala". Bernard Blier offers, as always, a saving of gestures and word performance, and really achieves it. Two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing: the first, Dora, the photographer: takes photos of female models, and Clouzot, by subtle touches, reveals that she is a lesbian. Of course, the word is never pronounced (How could he be in 1947?) The police chief (the fabulous Louis Jouvet) tells him: "You and I, WE have no luck with women". The portrait of this policeman is very detailed: we learn many things about him, it is not necessary to connect him with the argument of Delair / Blier: he is a widower, with a son who loves and who faces school difficulties, especially in geometry. Thus we know all the characters in depth. One of the most important manifestos of postwar French cinema. .
