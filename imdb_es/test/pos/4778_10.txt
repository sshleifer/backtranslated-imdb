STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an incredibly important film for our film history. This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY at the beginning of the year) is probably his most famous film, mainly because it was very innovative. This is because it was the first sound caricature. While you still do not hear Mickey speak, there are a lot of sound effects and music throughout the film, something we take for granted now, but which in 1928 pleased the crowd. <br /> <br /> Now if this would be worth seeing, especially for animation lovers. However, after seeing the short film again after about 25 years, I was surprised at how timeless the film is. While Mickey and Minnie behave somewhat oddly compared to the characters we have fallen in love with (thanks mainly to the madness and talent of animator Ub Iwerks), the film has a contagious charm. It's just lovely to see Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (though occasionally cruel) way. Intelligent and a real pleasure for the crowd: this movie is still among the best Mickey movies even after 80 wonderful years.
