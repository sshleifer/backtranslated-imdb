Good description of the situation in the USA UU., Explains different types of Islam, not just terrorists and extremists. Islam can be anything other than killing, they show why some people become terrorists and how to be Muslims without being extremists. It is a great series that Muslims and non-Muslims should see. Now we hope that other series or films will be made to change the idea that all Muslims are terrorists and that all Americans want to destroy Islam. It gave me the interest to discover what exactly is Islam and what the United States do and also the European government to help the coexistence between people of different religions.
