It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It reminds us of the mentality of the city of New York at the time, a wonderfully strange man with a strange plan, raised by his own firecracker and, finally, retiring to the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, it is the life that one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as "they really are" ... I think that it is no longer displayed. If so, surely someone would do it and put it there. A kidnapping goes wrong: mixed in a rainstorm, coming and going or store fronts, our hero throws a raincoat over his prey and throws it into his ice cream cart for bicycles, takes it to his apartment in the basement of the village. He is surprised, surprised, and incredibly disappointed when the wrappings are removed: instead of a seductive lady, he captures a suburban housewife of the Middle Ages who speaks and talks and talks. The film is full of vignettes of the life of travelers, suburban life, city officials and all the attitudes so affectionate. It pushes the limits of comedy, as the magical reality could drive a drama, just as Daffy Duck is able to draw imaginative scenes to demonstrate his situation or desires, all on the verge of plausibility. Everything is humorous, nobody is bad.
