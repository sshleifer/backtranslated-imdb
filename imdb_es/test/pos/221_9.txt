Police squad! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon. But I suppose it had already been executed before it was too repetitive and not as funny as in many American television programs. The geniuses behind this fun show were the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. From his direct act in the comedy, AIRPLANE!, Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short life t.v. In the series he had the opportunity to play the heterosexual man in a crazy comedy once again. The strange titles of each episode gave the final. But Lieutenant Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) got involved in so many strange cases that you have to see them to believe them. <br /> <br /> Too bad they never posted this in D.V.D. If a program needed to be re-launched, it would have to be this one. A whole new generation is waiting to see this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
