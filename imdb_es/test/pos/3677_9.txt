I quote below the words of my favorite writer, Paulo Coelho, as the comment of this film. <br /> <br /> "When you really want something, the whole universe conspires to help you achieve it" <br /> <br /> It is all too easy to forget who we really are and what we want to do in life. Because there are always too many comments and advice to surround us with security. I had almost forgotten how passion feels. Even though the adventure will take me out of the security zone, I really believe that fear is the price I need to pay for the new trip in life. <br /> <br /> Thank you for inspiring me with this beautiful person. history. It is a blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is. That is the most valuable love of the light of the soul.
