I have always loved Brenda Blethyn and "Undertaking Betty" was not a disappointment. I saw it on Satellite on Sunday morning. Life has been stressful and this movie made me laugh and see things that we generally consider terrible in a joyful way. I would like him to make more movies like this one and "Saving Grace". Brenda Blethyn is a great girl for us that we approach the age of 60 to see in action. She is beautiful, beautiful and full of life without appearing plastic and false. There are not many actresses to relate in a realistic way, although comical and / or serious. Brenda, if you see this, continue with gems like this one. We need more Mrs. Bennetts, Bettys and Gracias.
