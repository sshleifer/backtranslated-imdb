I must say: of all the modern Korean martial arts movies, it's worth taking a look. He was not as epic as Musa-The Warriors and he did not develop the characters either, but he had many nice ideas. Simple story: an elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to finish the reign of the Japanese in Korea in the medieval days. His counterpart was before the best friend he had and now he is willing to stop him. The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. The motifs of the figures are first discovered near the end. You may need to see it again so all the connections are correct. And I personally ... I loved the end. I could see it again and again. Maybe a little pathetic, but a true story of freedom fighters ... People can be killed, but not the ideas they represent ...
