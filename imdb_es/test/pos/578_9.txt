First of all, before starting my review, I read all the reviews of 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can not believe that anyone can give a negative review to a movie like this one. (Fortunately there was only one) I mean, I can understand that someone does not like the "Star Wars" because of the whole science fiction genre, but not like a movie starring some of the most adorable puppets in the history of mankind. It's almost sad <br /> <br /> Ok, now I'll get out of my soap box and check this movie. <br /> <br /> "The movie Muppet" came out when I was seven years old. All my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie, so I think I saw it about four times in the first month in theaters. <br /> <br /> As a child, many things attracted me to this and to all the others. Muppet movies and television shows. The song was probably the main one. Most of the songs in 'The Muppet Movie' are classic. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'll go back there someday", they are entertaining and stimulating. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I watch 'The Muppet Movie' in almost a different light whole. Yes, the things that moved me when I was a kid are still there, but they are jokes and that is just hilarious. <br /> <br /> I mean, when you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick man. <br /> <br /> Kermit is a frog and is in love with a sweet pig wearing purple gloves and could make karate split it in two. Fozzie is a comedian bear. Gonzo is a 'whatever' that is in love with chickens. Then you have two old guys who bother you, a dog who plays the piano, a rock band with a maniac drummer, a Swedish chef you can not understand and many other characters who are simply eccentric. <br /> <br /> However, for these reasons and more, Henson has entertained millions of children and adults, giving us all something special to see and remember. <br /> <br /> 'The Muppet Movie' will always be in my heart for many reasons, but I think the biggest one is because it is a movie, unlike many recent children's films, which I feel comfortable having My children watch Also, I do not get bored with the jokes that are left without words at the level of my children. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie that will surely be remembered forever.
