The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I have loved. I love almost all the shorts that they have made. I love the six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are fun and also star many other great actors and actresses, many of them in many of the shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the best actors in history and is the funniest comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of the most entertaining Three Stooges shorts is Men in Black. In this short film are Bud Jamison, Jeanie Roberts, Phyllis Crane, Dell Henderson, 'Little Billy' Rhodes, Billy Gilbert and Ruth Hiatt. The acting of these actors is good, especially Jamison and Roberts. There are many funny scenes here that I think most Three Stooges fans will adore! In my opinion this is one of the most different Three Stooges shorts. I recommend it to everyone!
