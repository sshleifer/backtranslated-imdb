"What is your name?" "Loudon." "Loudon what?" "Clear". <br /> <br /> That gag still traps me, TWENTY years after the film was released. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie back then and I love it today. I must have seen this hundreds of times in the day, and when I bought the DVD recently I could still remember some of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman imprisoned for a crime she committed. He did not commit When he leaves, he decides to seek revenge. <br /> <br /> Griffin Dunne (what happened to him?), plays a lawyer for his girlfriend's father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposedly new public relations program. A seemingly easy task, but there are complications in abundance, some funny dialogues and some scenes of stupidity but, no doubt, fun on the way. <br /> <br /> Madonna has a stupid voice in this movie, which until I could see with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible to me (hence only 8/10), but on the other hand I can imagine that he does it with his normal voice. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the comedic side of Madonna (too lame these days, maybe), and she really is funny on paper. Dunne makes a great movie, while Haviland Morris is perfect as the fiancee of luxury. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think this is a great movie and I'll be happy to sit down. And look at it 100 times more.
