NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they currently have. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene of the film until its last embrace. The location, the beauty of their mutual attraction when it unfolds when they meet for the first time, and the story that follows, and when they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards themselves is real, it is a romance that is projected to an audience with tender care James Franco in another micro role is just the right casting, and the elegance of Lane in combination with the beach house, is a true fall film of 2008 to remember, like THE NOTEBOOK.
