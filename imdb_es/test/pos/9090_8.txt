Flatliners has all the ingredients of a good Joel Schumacher film: intelligent, youthful characters, impressive cinematography, an exciting story and excellent performances. It is fun escapist, but it is very good and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the disconcerting precedents. <br /> <br /> Schumacher has a special ability to detect talented young actors, and the top five here have gone further. things (see the cast list). His credible performances help raise this film far above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his selfish role as a middle student. <br /> <br /> Filmmaking really stimulates the right side of the brain, which is what I love about Schumacher; Your use of light and location create images that stick together. It creates a disturbing nightmare environment that baffles you as you watch the movie and chase you when you go to bed. It reminded me of The Lost Boys. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has an incredible premise: the curious students I want to know what there is after death, and it follows it successfully through a terrifying and exciting story of redemption. One of Schumacher's best; highly recommended
