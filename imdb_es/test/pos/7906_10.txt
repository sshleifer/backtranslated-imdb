It's really a pity that nobody knows about this movie. I think if it had been fixed a bit and if it was not so low budget, I think one of the main film companies would like to accept it. The first time I saw this movie was when I was 11, and I thought it was so powerful with the many great, but illegal distances that Mitchell goes to to keep his family together. It inspired me then and it surprises me now. If you are lucky enough to find a copy of this movie, do not miss it!
