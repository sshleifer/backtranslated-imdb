Based on the hit novel "The Dismissal", The Missing Star, the latest film by acclaimed Italian director Gianni Amelio, is the story of the growing friendship between an old maintenance Italian and a young interpreter who hires in Shanghai to be his guide to through China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the maintenance manager of a steel factory in Italy that has been closed and the blast furnace sold to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that a control unit in the furnace is defective and potentially dangerous, he travels to China to find the steel factory where the piece was sold in the hope of avoiding a fatal accident. <br /> <br /> The film, of course, is about the trip, it is not the destination to use a familiar clich√© and, in that trip, we are aware of an attractive vision of China with all its immense beauty and complexity , through the exceptional photography of Luca Bigazzi. The film takes us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongquing, Baotou and a trip along the Yangtze River that shows us the coastal areas that are scheduled to be flooded when the Three Gorges Dam is fully operational, a Chinese mega project that has caused the displacement of 1.2 million people. The trip confronts travelers face to face with poverty, overcrowded housing and children who must fend for themselves. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and the translator Liu Hua (Tai Ling), who met for the first time in Italy, where their impatience with their translations at dinner makes her lose his work. When he finds her in Shanghai, she is working in a library and resists Vincenzo's approach. Looking at her offer to help her travel to China as little more than a well-paid job, she reluctantly agrees to accompany him. However, their relationship grows as they move from one city to another, their interpretive skills are very evident to help the bewildered Vincenzo who does not own a cell phone. <br /> <br /> As they slowly open up to each other, they are exposed to the vulnerability of each one and the film delves into their past and present life and how they arrived at their current situation. We meet Liu's son (Lin Wang) at his grandmother's house. In China's one-child policy, he is one of the unwanted children who have been "hidden" since the boy's father abandoned the family. Although the encounter between Vincenzo and the child is casual, their relationship becomes fundamental to the way in which the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Castellitto is an excellent actor (although one yearns for a younger Enrico Lo Verso in this role). However, he is emotionally distant throughout the film, his expression rarely changing from a distant hanged expression. Although Tai Ling gives a lot of presence to the role, his relationship with Vincenzo, which is much older, never seemed real to me and the ending seemed to exist only in a reality known as the movies. Even though Amelio is one of my favorite directors, after the brilliant "Keys to the House", Missing Star is a disappointment.
