One of my favorites. As a child, growing up in the New York metropolitan area in the late '60s and early' 70s, I was often given the opportunity to visit New York with my grandfather or my father, since they were doing business there. The harsh, boisterous and human reality of that city, especially in winter, has stayed with me. <br /> <br /> This film captures very well the raw and cold feeling of the New York winter season, while sharply exposing the most vulnerable part of the region's infamous underworld, crime and police. A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture. <br /> <br /> And the pursuit of the car is simply amazing. At least on par with the "Bullitt", and overcoming the chase in "The French Connection." I can see, again and again, that the suspension is off the Plymouth Fury police cruiser that is heading towards the GW Bridge in its pursuit, as it launches into that sharp curve to the right, bouncing and scraping in the traffic that approximates. The trick coordinator for that scene did "Bullitt" and "The French Connection", as well as many other noble movie chases. Good acting, too, and a decent plot. The musical score is avant-garde and convincing, and the cinematography and direction are first class. A great, though underestimated, police drama of the seventies. A caregiver However, it is not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> Comparable in style and content to: The French Connection and Super Fly. The police dramas of the early 1970s developed in the gloomy winter months of New York.
