The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was going to be a terrible annoyance, directed by the first director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes changed my mind completely and completely. Based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, Everything is Illuminated tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector (played brilliantly by Elijah Wood) who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in World War II . He travels to Germany and enlists with the help of a translator from twenty-some clubs and his grandfather. This results in a rigid search throughout the country, and they are determined to find what they are looking for. Filmed in one of the most beautiful fields in the world, Everything Is Illuminated frees the tension between the translator and his grandfather and the help that Jonathan needs to find his prey. There are also many religious issues, since the grandfather refers to Jonathan as "the Jew". In short, this is a movie that tries to find yourself and love your family. I give this wonderful, if not illuminated movie, a 10 out of 10. Arjun
