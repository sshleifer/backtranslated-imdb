This is the final episode we deserve. At the end of last season, things were left in a state of mind of "life goes on", which was hardly the summary that deserved this realistic series. While it is not a happy program, this series was always one that made you think (something weird on TV), and this is no exception. 'Is death justified by reasoning?' 'Is morality a reflection of society, or is society formed by morals that are selected by a few in power?' 'What is a just death, and can it exist?' All these questions, and more, are raised by the writers of this program every week, and this is their final thesis. Good acting, great writing, wonderful camera work, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you have seen the series and missed this when it was first run, then retain a copy in some way. If you never saw the series when it was run, then this will stand on its own, but it can be hard to try to keep track of who all the characters are and what they mean in their varied past. For those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons, this is a very satisfying vision.
