I do not cry easily for movies, but I must admit that it made me cry. Although I'm not a fan of Mrs. Streep, her performance was excellent. The title defines in a sentence what is the love of a mother. During the first hour I did not like any of the characters, but that changed as the movie progressed. The film also explains why certain marriages last even though there are obstacles. You have to see the movie.
