'Hitch' is a pleasant surprise: a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy. Most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not fun or romantic. 'Hitch' takes actors like Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes on a fun and lightweight journey that really made me laugh and, yes, a little "aww, how sweet!". <br /> <br /> Meet Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), also known as Hitch. He is a self-proclaimed 'Date Doctor'; he helps desperate men like Albert (Kevin James) to win guys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch has to deal with Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist who insists on breaking with Date Doctor ... <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is pretty funny, and even makes scenes work standard slapstick simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly having fun. I have to wonder why Will Smith has not made more movies like this. His sharp and fast delivery is perfect for this genre, and his chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a true discovery; I have never seen his program 'The King of Queens', but it is fun and sincere, and proves once again that white and fat men can not dance hip-hop (Smith's responses to his attempts are very funny). Mendes is hot and spirited (not in that way, wow) as Smith's perfect partner, and Amber Valletta is sweet as Allegra. <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is not perfect; it's a bit too long, and things get too "dramatic" near the end (although this is redeemed by the happy ending full of funny dances). But it is a great review of the romantic comedies that continue to fill the theaters.
