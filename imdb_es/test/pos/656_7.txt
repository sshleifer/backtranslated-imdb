This is an interesting and hard to find film from the early 70s, starring Jan Michael Vincent when he was a young man who does not play the role of a marine. Dressed in "baby blue" suits to humiliate them when they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and meets a young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a 'Raider' marine. The character of Gere is already tired and contemplating the desertion, and takes advantage of the innocence of Vincent, stealing the uniform "blue baby" after getting drunk and hit him in an alley. The character of Vincent, whose name is Marion, takes Gere's outfit and suddenly becomes a Marine Raider. Marion goes into Wyoming and stops in a small town similar to Norman Rockwell. At the local coffee shop he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his attention. By staying with Hudkins' parents, Marion attracts all kinds of attention from the people of the cities. Mr. Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a "Raider" of the Marines could be so innocent. The story also shows the Japanese internment camps, since the people of the city are going to "hunt" 3 fugitives. Marion is accidentally shot during this hunt. But there is still a happy ending, which puzzled me a little. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, this captures MVP at the peak of their 70s performances. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70s were amazingly good performances by JMV. It was both an action star and a heartbeat at the same time !!! He made many quality films during his career, and continued to do so until the mid-1980s with the great television show Airwolf. He does a very good job in this as 'Coverage', silently observing the way people treat him (with his uniform) while traveling around the country. He must have done some of the tricks too, at the end of the film there is a distressing scene in the river, and it seems he is the guy that is throwing me down the river! But really, at the height of its popularity, this film could have done much more with the MVP talent and its appearance. Innocence can only be so interesting. The evil, as explored in "Buster and Billie", is much more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is a delight like Rose. The whole look of the film is like a painting by Norman Rockwell. The outdoor scenes are beautiful, they must have been filmed in Canada.
