When the gilmore girls started in Germany I did not want to see them because for me it was something that was not unique. It was a series and he did not even know anyone in it. Later, I realized that Edward Hermann is part of the cast of Overboard (a movie I adore). I had to see him once with a friend and I never stopped since then. it's just fun you have the feeling that it's okay to have sex before you get married and it's okay to be a coffee addict and eat unhealthy things all the time. I do not do these things all the time, but when I do these things I feel a little like a gilmore girl. Even my boyfriend started looking at them and that says something. From season to season he improved with scripts and stories. They have an open mind and, being different from any other program, you want to be like them.
