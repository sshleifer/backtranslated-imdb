I just came out of an advanced screening, and wow was this hilarious movie. Possibly better than the first, but at least it's the same. If you do not like disgusting, or really unnecessary amounts of male nudes (much more than in the first), stay far, far away. But if you dig the whole Jackass thing, then this movie will not disappoint you. Toro Totter is the best invention of all. IN AGREEMENT. so my criticism was not long enough ... Everything else I have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really miss him in this. So, if you enjoy masochistic humor and prolific male nudity and, by far, the most disgusting female nudity (John Waters is involved, do I need to say more?), Then this movie will keep you up to date with everything. I never stopped laughing, and actually came out drenched in sweat.
