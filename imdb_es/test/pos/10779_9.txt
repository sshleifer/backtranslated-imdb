Eric Bogosian offers the best performance you've ever seen in an Oliver Stone movie. His character Barry is an assault rifle disguised as a man and blows away at anyone, on or off the air, who offends him. Adapted from Bogosian's play, "Talk Radio" is a vicious and terrifying journey that will not let you go until it's too late. By then, you've become familiar with the fringe of racists, rapists, paranoids, aspiring murderers and mere pranksters who listen, talk and hide in the darkness of Dallas nights. <br /> <br /> Stone behaves, if that is possible, by allowing Bogosian to dominate every scene, from the humble beginnings of Barry to the point of change or break when his radio program can reach national syndication. The rest of the cast are uniformly excellent as lovers and / or co-workers that have all been used and discarded by Barry in common. <br /> <br /> The only thing that would change is the recurring theme of the music, "Bad To The Bone". I would have used "Not Fragile" by Bachman-Turner Overdrive. A better song, one that I have not heard in a movie so far and a relentless and implacable melody whose sinister riff is like the true soundtrack of Barry's life. <br /> <br /> Listen if you dare!
