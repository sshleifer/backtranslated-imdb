In writing, this is one of the best short stories ever written, presented brilliantly and poetically by this team of parents and children, working together, unfortunately, for the first and last time. It's fitting that John Huston ends his career on a high note by taking the work of one of his favorite authors to the screen, in what is easily Joyce's best screen adaptation. Huston made a career of adapting great works of literature to the cinema, generally with enough success. It is sad, and somewhat disconcerting, that Tony Huston began and ended his film career adapting his father's final project and earning a deserved Oscar nomination in the process. <br /> <br /> Once I had the privilege of sitting in the company of the great screenwriter and playwright Horton Foote, who cited this film as one of his favorites in recent years (at that time it was still a fairly recent release) . As a fairly prolific screenwriter (and a brilliant screen adapter of his own works, as well as great authors such as Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee), he was obviously impressed with Tony Huston's first effort, and possibly equally baffled by his lack of Departure since then. If someone has ideas to share on the subject, I would like to know more.
