I'm a fan of horror movies, and this has to be one of the most phenomenal horror movies I've seen. The plot is totally original (who else would think of a city that is totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and madness?), The special effects are incredible and the cinematography could not be better. Some may find it annoying, but that does not mean it's a bad movie. It also makes a good point. The symbol of the spiral is a little ubiquitous. The spiral notebook, snail snails, spirals on cakes. Of all the shapes that could have been used (square, triangle, trapezoid, rectangle), this was one of the best options. If you can find this movie, definitely see it. It is certainly unique, and quite unforgettable.
