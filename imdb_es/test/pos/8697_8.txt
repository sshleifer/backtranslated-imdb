Absolute engraver of a movie, and given his age, years ahead of his time. The first time I saw it was the week my dad came home with a neighbor's television, which the guy had thrown in the scrap heap. A bungler with all the electrical things, dad had him running in two days. This was in July of 1955 ... and then probably only the third house on the street to have television! Almost the first thing we saw on that old, blinking 12-inch screen was THIS movie. "He's pretty old, dear," I remember that my mom had told me! <br /> <br /> Almost 50 years later, and it does not seem to have aged, like the First World War in that sense! Fantastic and small fantasy about a London bus carrying thirteen passengers, which crashes and kills one of them. Then, in a flashback, we take up the lives of these people and what led them to be on this bus that same day. <br /> <br /> Upon returning to the accident at the end of the film, the identity of the victim is revealed. , perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 film THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER. <br /> <br /> If you ever find this little gem, I suggest you see it!
