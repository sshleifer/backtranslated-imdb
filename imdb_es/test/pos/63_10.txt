It really is a great movie (after being able to ignore the references of Blake Edwards Pink Panther with which he seems to be obsessed and without much grace). Julie is, as always, wonderful, she sings and acts brilliantly. I remember seeing it at the Odeon cinema in the Haymarket, London, at its launch. However, Julie did not show up at the STAR premiere in the UK. It was very unfortunate and (apparently!) due to the filming of Darling Lili's aerial shots over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots, but she did not. Two box office failures in a row ruined his film career for several years. But Darling Lili, like STAR !, deserves a much more public appreciation.
