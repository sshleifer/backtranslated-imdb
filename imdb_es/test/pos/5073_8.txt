The cast of power attracts the crowd in the theater, despite the ominous title. Jake Gyllenhaal invited Conan O'Brien to promote the film and explained that 'Rendition' was a euphemism for information through torture. Since September 11, the "extraordinary rendition" allowed the government intelligence agency to remove people without questioning without due process and use any necessary means in exchange for information. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaal plays rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (notice the irony) who is torn by his assignment, making him a simple observer of unorthodox interrogation procedures in a detention center underground outside the US UU <br /> <br /> Omar Metwally plays the alleged terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, her husband of Egyptian nationality and green card of the American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son wait for Anwar to return home after a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifesto. She seeks the help of her friend from the university who works in the government and learns that the Head of Intelligence, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind everything. <br /> <br /> Rendition is directed by Hollywood rookie Gavin Hood (who is programmed to do X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and raises the question of whether such an "extraordinary performance" is exercised in real life. The film premiered locally in the wake of the Glorietta explosion (bombing / mishap?), And a pivotal scene in the film is when a bomb explodes in a public square, so it must have sent shivers down the spine of everyone. the spectators. See the explosive picture with a red and yellow sign Aajala (Â¿Ayala?) In the upper right part of the screen, the effect of silence and slow motion images magnified the impact of the real life coincidence of the scene. <br /> <br /> There are lessons to be learned from this film and it all comes down to personal decisions that we make every day. We all have options that we can exercise at will, and often not always (we want) to see how they affect others, who may end up being unfortunate victims of the circumstances. What 'the greater good' should not be a forced choice that our leaders should take if each one of us already decided correctly at the source. Now that is a utopia that is worth building.
