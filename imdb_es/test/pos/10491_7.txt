In the post-civil war in the United States, the president, (Van Johnson), travels to Dallas and is killed by corrupt officials and businessmen interested in installing the vice president, whom they can blackmail because of incriminating documents. An armed man (Guiliano Gemma), convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of murder, aims to discover the truth. Tonino Valeri directed this fascinating film, although defective, which is obviously an allegory of Kennedy's assassination. The film may misrepresent blacks as slaves working on plantations in Texas, but the film is pleasant and presents an interesting interpretation: that Kennedy's death was the result of a coup that many Americans could not accept at that time . Oswald's murder is repeated here when the black man accused of the murder is murdered by the responsible men en route to Fort Worth prison. This moment in the film is more melodramatic than the death of Oswald with his different escorts taken down before his scene of superior death. However, this is definitely one of the most interesting and valuable spaghetti westerns. Worth a look!
