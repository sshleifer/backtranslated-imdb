If you want to see a real thriller, rent this !!! It is not from the director or screenwriter of "Scream", it does not present the overdone and overpaid "TV" actors who pose as "stars", and it is not a bonanza of special effects. Instead, you will get an excellent, exciting, very strong (with violence) but exciting.
