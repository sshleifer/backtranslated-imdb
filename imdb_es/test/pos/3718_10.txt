This is an example of what the professors of a film school would call a good debut movie. Follow all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap, guerrilla footage, no scenes (only disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. In addition, even the black and white film was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low cost instead of the film effect, but it worked. <br /> <br /> Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's performance was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and there were no loose pieces to distract you. A tight budget film, well elaborated and profitable. <br /> <br /> Launched in 1983, this would have been done just before the art of spectacular action shows was refined with the Hollywood engine. , and the making of films was more exclusive and, therefore, more difficult and most needed of the right people in the right places than the current world with Internet access, so Luc Besson would have had to do some negotiation and promise to achieve this result, which makes the final product even more remarkable. <br /> <br /> But, again, the French film industry has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, I know that Luc Besson is Belgian, but the film is a French production) and has been the source of many Hollywood remakes . <br /> <br /> If I have a criticism, it is that the cover on the DVD (and possibly the original sales poster) does not carry It looks a lot like the movie and it seems to be a rather strange image instead of representative of any of the movements. The themes of e - at first glance, it seems to be a man with post-apocalyptic armor on a swing, but on the second inspection reveals a man in armor with a spear on an office chair with his legs on a reclining desk, a self-confidence posture This never happens in the movie once. <br /> <br /> It's a black and white film, without dialogue, physical performance, tight scenes and brilliant actors makes it worthwhile to add this film to your private movie collection. An excellent movie
