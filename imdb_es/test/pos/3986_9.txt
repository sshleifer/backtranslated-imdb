This is a brilliant movie. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal plays an agent who can convince anyone to do anything. Here is a very funny scene, where Crystal is a boy, and he tells his father, that he is a rabbi who eats pig (it is possible that philosophers know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is primarily a talent scout, and is trying to find a suitable villain for his latest film. After discovering that the entire movie has a terrible crew, it accidentally falls into a small river. Believing he is dead, some huge hands come out to reach him. He later thinks he is in heaven. Discover that he is not, but that he is in a monastery. Believing that God saved him, he becomes a monk, looking for who saved him. Later he finds a 7 feet 7 in the man, whom he interprets as the perfect villain (he also recites Shakespeare!). Watch the movie and discover the rest!
