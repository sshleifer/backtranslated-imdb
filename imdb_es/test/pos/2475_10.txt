Opera of the death camp: Right here, right now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, I read that a very special film about the polarization of our society had been directed. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His photo was interpreted by some non-professional actors, citizens like you and me. and others. Violence from the environment was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both really. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I realized how difficult it was to find it. Maybe he would, by chance? Anyway, it's still an old story. I saw it a while ago. Totally impressive My favorite place is Peace of Art: Punishment Park is his name. I love this "docu-fiction", this "truecastmovie", this "realityshowfictionnal", whatever. After all the shocking movies that I saw, I reach the best with this strong and intense film experience. I found a masterpiece. There is enough on the net to know many things about the movie. It's even buying on DVD, with additional things. The only words I want to add are about my own experience with this movie. I can only trust a peace of art so sincere and committed to the people and people who direct, act or observe. A cinema that is simply a real human experience within an artistic adventure? or the opposite. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I am not talking about all the 'mucs' we can see on television, especially in the 'reality show', to whom the concepts of people that are interpreted are interesting, but they are used. In a stupid and perverse way. In Punishment Park, we can see some real people living as they are. We only place them in a very specific context, with some lines to follow, and we let them be what they want to be. It is a kind of therapy, a form of "individuation" for those who are inside the film and also for the active spectators in front of the screens. Then, to finish, the director's touch edits a short and sweet film of apocalypse, a desperate cry, an 'Opera of the death camp', where some people flee after virulent tests. Punishment Park is for those who want to grow. Watch this movie and have the opportunity to choose your own morality. Grow and harmonize with him! If you can feel it! If you can see it !! In my case, Punishment Park is stuck in me forever, with all my love, conscience and will.
