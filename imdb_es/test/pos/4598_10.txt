I'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this movie because I just saw it and thought it was AWESOME. I guess it is not for everyone because it is basically that "The Trial" of Kafka meets "Beevis and Butt-Head", which is a very difficult combination to swallow. Still, I thought it was great. If you're going to watch it because you want a sequel to Office Space, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal looks, acid language and hilariously honest about where our society is heading, a surprise awaits you. I just watched the opening night of the show at 8pm in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means the movie will probably be gone in a week. That's really a shame because, in its own way, Idiocracy is one of the best satires that have appeared in a long time. But, again, they basically make fun of the people that make up 99% of the audience that goes to the movies, so I guess it's no wonder the studio got scared and tried to get rid of it.
