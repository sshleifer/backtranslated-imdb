George Hilton never really catches me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, but this is a great outlet for him. Basically, leave Django / man With No Name and do a good job. The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat and mouse games that follow are a delight to watch. The fans of the genre will be in heaven.
