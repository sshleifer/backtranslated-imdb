At the time of writing this article (January 25, 2006), I am sad to hear about Chris Penn's late death. Apart from Footloose, The Wild Life is the movie that I remember most about Chris. <br /> <br /> I still remember in the movie, with a little fondness, the wrestling character of Chris and his teammates sitting in their favorite restaurant with a huge plate of French fries in front of them, drowned in a whole bottle of tomato sauce. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my comment is in relation to the title song sung by Bananarama. After so many years, I still remember the rumor (Canadian spelling, hahaha) that Bananarama was called at the VERY LATEST time to compose the song for the film and they wrote the song on the plane that went to the recording studio to record the song and right after recording the song, they went to record the low-cost video for their main song. I heard that this whole process (from beginning to end) took 4 hours to do it! If this is true, then they really are worthy to be the most successful female band of all time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is just a rumor I had heard in the past and I still remember a generation later. Maybe someone who reads this can comment and clarify. Thank you.
