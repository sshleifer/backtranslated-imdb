They went with the wind and Scarlett are two different movies that should never have been compared. Obviously, all the original GWTW actors have passed away and deserved their own prize and praise separately. Up to half the compliments of GWTW, but, to my surprise, Scarlett was so well written, directed and acted as GWTW Scarlett in her own right. It deserves equal prize. Now I can honestly say that I do not know which one I like the most, I think the script Scarlett was a perfect number 1 sequel. Bravo! Writer producer director and all the actors Bravo! As the sequels rarely live up to their name, it runs the same as its predecessor. Those who do not like it, they lack the point and a great end to a phenomenal start.
