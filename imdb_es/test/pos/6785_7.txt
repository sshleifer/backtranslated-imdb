A teenage girl gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by an ex-jockey to participate in the Grand National Steeplechase in London. An excellent adaptation of the classic book for children, with an excellent interpretation of Taylor as the energetic but educated young woman. Rooney is fine as his coach, although he has some melodramatic moments. Crisp and Revere are pretty good as Taylor's loving parents. Filmed in Technicolor, it looks beautiful. The problem is that there are corny elements, nothing very interesting happens and it lasts a little. The race is exciting but it could have been much more.
