Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three ex-geisha singles in constant spite in post-war Japan is a wonderful piece. They used to be friends in the old days, but now their relationship is tense because one of the women has become a successful lender and the other two owe her. Although the lender is the only one who has been successful in this reconstruction economy, she is the only one of the three who has no children. The other two have a child they depend on for income, because none of them works. Complications occur when the children decide to marry (though not between them) and leave the home. This leads the bitter and grumbling old ladies to become even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and lamenting their rotten children and disregarding the lender friend. Meanwhile, the lender is herself unhappy, despite her fortune. She has no one besides her deaf young servant to accompany her and casual encounters with two former geisha lovers do not lead anywhere, all they really want is to borrow money. The three characters are up to their sands in their own boring lives and are too tired to fight much, usually choose to resign themselves to the futility of all this or, at most, throw complaints from one place to another other. <br /> <br /> "Late Chrysanthemums" are very slow and in reality it does not happen much, but Naruse, like all great directors, has the capacity to do a lot with very little. I have not seen much of his work, but I suspect that this is not the best, although it is very good. The problem, I think, is that it does not seem that everything is much. But the movie is full of good points. Although it is cynical, it is not too much. Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even noble in the misery of their own misery. While the film is not a must-see, it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known director (outside of his own country), of which a small video is available in the United States.
