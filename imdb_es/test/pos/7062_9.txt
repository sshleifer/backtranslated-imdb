I caught this on television one day when I was young and I loved it. In the 1970s, there were a lot of unconvincing comedies that tried to be funny, so it was a pleasant surprise. It is one of the best comedies of the 1970s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to the excellent comedy performance of Murrary, which remains one of the best. This is the movie that really made Ivan Reitman a director. Reitman demonstrates with this film that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. While this movie is very funny and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it's fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely terrible. Recommended for those who enjoyed RAYAS and PHANTASMS.
