I felt that way when I saw the episode in his original career and I still agree when I see him in the replays. You made the culprits totally mock Columbo throughout the episode and treat him as if he had Down syndrome. And in the end you see their shock when Columbo kills them and arrests them. You also get a realistic reaction from arrogant preppy killers. They still could not give Columbo his support and say he was lucky. I like the formula where there is an elaborate crime, the murderers totally underestimate Columbo and then realize that Columbo was playing criminals. I remember that in the first episodes of the episodes after 1989 they were not following that formula and this was the first episode that I was satisfied with.
