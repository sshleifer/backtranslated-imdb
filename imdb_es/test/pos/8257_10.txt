I have seen this movie about 4 times and each time I am impressed by the work of the Assistant for the Second Chamber. It seems trivial, but there is something very professional, well informed and talented. The film as a whole suffers from other problems, as indicated by other comments. The importance so the issues that are addressed are as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. The acting is a little tense, but the Second Chamber Assistant's work is stellar! Does this person need to go back to business, maybe directing? What is this person waiting for? I'll be watching and waiting and cheering from the sidelines - Bob
