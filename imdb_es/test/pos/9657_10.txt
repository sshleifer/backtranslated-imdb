I saw this movie for the first time on the science fiction channel and I must say that it was simply amazing. For those of you who love 'The Never Ending Story', this is one of those that will bring back memories of that movie. Although it is a 1996 film, it has a nebulous stage and appearance that make it feel like it's a fantasy. The performance was brilliant and the music was excellent, especially the song of beginning of battle and the final song. For those of you who have not seen it yet, LOOK AT IT! I recommended it completely!
