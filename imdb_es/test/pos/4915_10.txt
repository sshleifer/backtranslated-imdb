When this was shown at the Seattle Int'l Film Fest, I was the only person standing, clapping and shouting. The rest of the crowd booed or was silent. It is a well-played small film that delves into the reality of the humanity of a young gay man. It is a real man; and it does not play with the insipid hyperactive "gay paositive" that goes through the non-pornographic gay film genre (and that's why many of the contemporary gay movies are so boring). This film is intense passion and great tragedy. The acting and directing and cinematography is fantastic; Everything keeps the film clastrophobic and tense and passionate. Do not miss it if you can find it.
