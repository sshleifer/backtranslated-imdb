If you had a mother who described you that way, you might be trying to hit her. It's what Danny DeVito feels for Anne Ramsey, is how to implement the plan. <br /> <br /> And his creative writing class taught by Professor Billy Crystal gives him the idea. That and a vision of the classic Strangers On A Train by Alfred Hitchcock that gives DeVito the idea of ​​changing the murders with Crystal who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrew, who is not only cheating him for an idea of ​​a book he wanted to write , but also also continues with the sturdy Tony Ciccone. <br /> <br /> Launch Momma From The Train with games like Strangers on a train, since DeVito seems to have carried out his end of the murder plan. But Crystal is having a small problem to bring Ramsey down even with Danny's help. That woman may need to kill, but she will accept a lot. <br /> <br /> The only recognition of the Academy that obtained Throw Momma From The Train was an Oscar nomination by Anne Ramsey for Best Supporting Actress. Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck, but the film proved to be his best moment. Ramsey already had throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year, but look at the list of credits she managed to accumulate even after Throw Momma From The Train, she worked until the end. <br /> <br /> I have seen interviews with the two stars of Throw Momma From The Train, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both have warmly admitted that Anne Ramsey's performance as the mother of hell made the film It was a success and it was stolen. below them. His recognition of Ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute. <br /> <br /> If Marion Lorne in Strangers On A Train had been like Anne Ramsey here, Farley Granger would have joined Robert Walker to get rid of her. Throw Momma From A Train is one of the best black comedies, it should not be missed.
