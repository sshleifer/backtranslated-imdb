For those with access to the BBC or the CBC, this has proven to be spectacular. Like Battlestar Gallactica, this is a show reconstructed from scratch. But in the case of Dr. Who, they saved the best parts. I can not believe I'm saying this, but ... this is by far the best Dr. Who. This has none of the cheap production values ​​and, sometimes, the slow work of the old show. The acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history. The new Doctor is easily equal to the great Tom Baker, and the writer (former leader of QAF) seems to have made even the minor characters come alive. <br /> <br /> I know ... I'm complaining. .but this should be on everyone's list of science fiction geeks. I just do not know why he has not made his way here ... Whatever you do ... if you ever loved Dr. Who or science fiction ... see this!
