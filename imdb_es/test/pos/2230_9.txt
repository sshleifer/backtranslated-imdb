I can not understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video company, but that is the unfortunate obscurity of this Peter Sellers classic (the Leonard Maltin Film Guide continues to give him the same review of the BOMB that he gave him in the 70s). With so many scene thieves on display, Sellers comes across what is perhaps his most hilarious role. It all begins with the discovery of a patient who died at 11:15 AM, but Sellers argues that the body still lives due to the fact. May the new day not begin until noon! The last straw for the embattled commissioner of the hospital arrives in that same room, the DO NOT DISTURB sign still on the door; once he leaves the room (a handkerchief that holds his nose), there is a brief conversation with the doctor who accompanies him- MEDICAL: "We can not save them all! That man was at least 85 years old!" COMMISSIONER: " How old was he? He died, 63? "Harold Gould plays an inept surgeon who closes his eyes when the knife is stuck, Richard Lenz (whose reporter of" pomoso ass "in" The Shootist "was thrown in the back by John Wayne) plays the patient who exposes Keith Allison , former guitarist of Paul Revere and the Raiders, made a fraud (he only received a chest x-ray, until they discovered that he owns a house.) Keith Allison, former guitarist of Paul Revere and the Raiders, who also worked with Michael Nesmith in some recordings of Monkees (and co-wrote "Auntie's Municipal Court" with Nesmith in 1968 "The Birds, The Bees and the Monkees"). Unfortunately, some images of this impression are missing, including a topless sequence with Uschi Digard near the end, also a scene with the actress Kathleen Freeman (who wants to use green stamps to finance her operation), who stays locked up by Sellers in her office, so that she never sees her again (in the version s In cuts, return to your office to find that she has written in large letters on the wall "UNFAIR PRICK"; your answer? "You have written the price wrong!").
