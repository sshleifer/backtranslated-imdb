I own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. I have seen a lot of them and I love all the great information there is. Only a small handful, even if you come to offer information as important as this. I've been reading other people's reviews about this movie and I can not help noticing that the main things that people criticize are irrelevant. As "It is very unilateral". Such a pathetic criticism, everywhere in the society where you look, you will see the other side, and if you still need help, visit globalpublicmedia.com. "It's the same people over and over again" Uh, one might be led to believe that these people are the experts, so they may be the best people to interview. "The shooting style is all the same, shots to the head with few exceptions" If you want to flash and dazzle look at Micheal Moore if you want information, look at real documents like this one. As you can see clearly, none of these complaints has relevance to the information contained. My guess is that these people simply lack the point and do not want to leave the SUV. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: Look at it. Learn from it and continue your education on such topics. It is a very important thing for ALL.
