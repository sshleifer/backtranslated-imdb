The main reason why I loved this movie is because IMx (previously immature) was in it. They were in House Party 3 when they were 11 years old, but now they have all grown up! I was a little surprised by some of the things they were doing in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair out), but I had to realize that they were not my little children anymore. I think Chris Stokes did a good job, considering that was his first movie.
