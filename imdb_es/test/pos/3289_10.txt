I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical premiere. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie with the spirit of 'Benji' although much better and more focused on the actors than on the dogs. The simple portrayal of the difficulties of life in a humorous way, followed by the thugs and villains who obtain their just deserts, is both sympathetic and moving. It is also stimulating. With a subtle dexterity, this film affects the awareness of cruelty, personal behavior and intimidation. Movies have different genres and different purposes. This film, which is a delight for all ages, offers an interesting humorous look at our own experiences. Everyone will recognize personality types and behaviors of their own and others. Everyone will see the humor. Humor makes movement pleasant and brings the understanding of life situations to a new level. <br /> <br /> For a happy laugh and a "feel good" movie, Chomps is an excellent choice. Memorable.
