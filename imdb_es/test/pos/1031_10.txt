'Oppenheimer' with Sam Waterston in the lead role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of the docudrama at its best. Well written, well acted by actors who have a credible resemblance to their historical characters, highly informative and very entertaining. Designs and costumes capture the feeling of the USA. UU During the Second World War, the layout and the dialogue make the spectator feel as if he were really present in Los Alamos and caught in the excitement of the Manhattan Project. The only drawback is that this is a British production, and some of the actors lack the ability to affect a compelling American accent. (The ability of the current Australian and Irish actors who acquire non-native dialects is amazing). The story is totally consistent with the definitive story of Richard Rhodes on the development of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, the miniseries was only shown a couple of times on PBS in the early 1980s and then apparently disappeared into oblivion. <br /> <br /> 'Oppenheimer' compares favorably with the more recent 'Fat Man & Little Boy's Feature' with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (the chronically overweight and rather familiar general would be completely flattered) and Dwight Schultz (former student of 'A-Team' of television) as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, 'Oppenheimer' is approximately 4 times longer than the Newman feature, but uses all the additional time completely in its favor.
