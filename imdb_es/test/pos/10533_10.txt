I had so much hope that Teletoon Retro would broadcast this, but instead of having programs like this one, that do not get the treatment they deserve, they broadcast things that I may have seen dozens of times before. <br /> <br /> The Centurions was the high point of my preadolescence years. I know it may seem a bit clich√© but it's true. After Duke of G.I. Joe, Jake Rockewell is another one of those cartoon characters that I really liked. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Teletoon Retro does not see it in the same way as the people of my generation. Otherwise, Retro Teletoon would be much better than it is.
