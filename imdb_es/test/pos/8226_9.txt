This film directed by George Fitzmaurice, who made so many excellent films, lives up to his excellent level. He is sharp, witty, with some wonderful lines, and has the inimitable Ronald Colman in romantic leadership. Colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a rich Englishman. He is financially irresponsible (spending, for example, £ 15 of his last £ 20 in the world on a cute little terrier whom he calls George), but open, wildly generous, disdainful of profits, irreverent in the most polite way possible, and desperately sentimental. He is so handsome that all women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of the music rooms, and therefore, in 1930, a young girl from the demi-monde, played with her typical slender and narrow-eyed silkiness by the young Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a big user of the close-ups, and the girls of that day had their faces half-hidden with those horrible hats attached anyway, so we can not glimpse the faces of the two heroines as well as we would like. The director seems more interested in the charming Colman, anyway. The romantic female protagonist is the young and fresh Loretta Young, who had not yet become the proto-Julie Andrews that we generally know as her, but who was still a blushing girl who gave off all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughed happily and with desire. all the time. It is obvious that a character with his fantastic sense of humor was needed to appreciate the social anarchism that represses the snob of the refreshing aristocratic character that Colman interprets. The plot hardly matters, as is often the case with these light and funny movies. This is so fun
