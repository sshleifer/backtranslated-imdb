When I first saw it on tape, about 10 years after its release, I thought it was one of the best James Bond movies. However, after seeing it again at the turn of the century, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think he's a little overrated just because the critics were so happy to see Sean Connery finish his 12-year parenthesis of playing against Bond. That they did not dare to criticize the movie. I guess what disappointed me was the ending. After investing two hours in the movie, you expect a less attractive and more satisfying ending. And, it may not be easy, but I was disappointed not to see the usual actors in supporting roles like Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there were a lot of unique action scenes, particularly at the beginning, and the two villains were interesting. I thought that Klaus Maria Brandauer was the most intriguing of the two because he was very discreet and seemed like the "good guy next door". He was not your normal Bond villain. <br /> <br /> I had a lot of "skin" for a PG movie, especially with the performance of Kim Basinger, never being an actress known for hiding her figure. The language was very docile, but most of the Bond movies are pretty good in that department. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a "fair" Bond and nothing else. Just because Connery is in that, does not mean it's automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have shown that they could also play the role.
