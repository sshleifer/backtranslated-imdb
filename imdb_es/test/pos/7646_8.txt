I like Armand Assante and the summary of my cable company sounded interesting, so I saw it twice and probably will do it again. <br /> <br /> The first part is difficult to follow, but then it becomes clear. I think the scriptwriter did a good job tying up the loose ends. <br /> <br /> Part of the performance is not convincing, but maybe it's because I always expected some kind of double cross. In that case, the bad performance would be the lack of sincerity of the characters that interact with each other, so it fits very well. <br /> <br /> The important issue is that the owner of the carnival (Assante) is laundering money for a local casino and his charming wife (Dagmara Dominczyk) wants to steal it. She complains to "Archie" (Reedus) about how terrible her life is and how he could help her get out of it. <br /> <br /> There are 3 or 4 turns in the plot (which is probably the reason for all this). those loose ends), and just when you think you've solved the mystery, something else will happen. <br /> <br /> My score of 8/10 is mainly for the plot. <br /> <br /> I won Do not say more: I do not like spoilers, so I do not want to be one, but I think this movie is worth it.
