These movies made me suffer and I LOVED! I LOVED! He persecuted me for days. I think Erika is the kind of character you simultaneously hate and regret. The most terrifying sex scene ever captured in the movie. This is Haneke's best work so far. He is the only director in life who redefines the rhythm since Kubrick. The violence in this movie is beautiful. In a word, the film is about self-hatred. In one sentence, the film tries to find love to stop hating you and discover that it is a hope without hope.
