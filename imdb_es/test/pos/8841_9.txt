The first time I saw this movie was accidental when it was shown on TV and I woke up too late ... although I was very lucky. It's really amazing; From the place (as isolated as it is possible to be on this planet, he made "the abyss" resemble ET in the council pool), through the interesting characters (Keith David is especially good as the reactionary Childs - " And if you're wrong with him? "-" Then we're wrong "and the effects (more disgusting than Alien). <br /> <br /> In addition, however, the real tension and fear in the movie have nothing what to do with seeing the effects, it's the people you start to be afraid of, knowing that one of them can, or can not be, "everything they seem to be." He certainly has the feeling of "who goes there? ". <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great, it really improves the isolation, the fear and the seriousness of the situation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the epilogue scene really cuts in. Even more than "But then, who does?" Bladerunner punchline. Enough talk.
