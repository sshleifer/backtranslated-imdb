Wow. We watched this movie with the hope that it would have at least some decent scenes of rock climbing. We were disappointed there, but it was still a great movie! It was so cheesy it was great! I have not laughed so much about a movie in a long time. If you like climbing and you like corny movies, this is absolutely for you!
