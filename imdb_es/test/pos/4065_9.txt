"Showtime" is a fun movie starring Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents, A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story goes like this: At the beginning of the movie, Detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective enter a TV store trying to stop some criminals. When the police arrive, Tray (Eddie Murphy), a policeman, tries to arrest Mitch without knowing he is a policeman. During this scene many fun things happen that catch the attention of television producer Chase Ritz. She is so excited about their adventures together that she decides to make a television show called "Showtime," starring Tray (the cop) and Mitch (the detective). But that's just the fun part. The rest is strictly suspense and action. There is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous weapons. While playing LAPD on the show and doing it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have a great adventure in this story. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a seven or eight.
