George Scott gave the performance of a lifetime in THE HOSPITAL, by Paddy Chayefsky, a very dark drama about an old city hospital and a middle-aged doctor on the verge of suicide. Throughout comes Diana Rigg as a free spirit determined to save him from himself. Their dialogues crack, and it is clear that they are made for each other from the beginning. But will she save him? His only sex scene is graphic and memorable for his passion and fury. Meanwhile, the hospital is under siege from a group of agitators who do not want it to turn a condemned building into a cancer center. And a serial killer is loose in the hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. However, a good part of the film is directly focused on Scott. As it should be. What a difference a few years ago when this movie was made. 1962 had given us THE INTERNS, an old-fashioned rework of DR. KILDARE with a terrible performance and a cardboard script. Along came 1971 and THE HOSPITAL. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood did something right for a change. Seeing the HOSPITAL today is a reminder of the number of medical programs like ST. Elsewhere and SCRUBS we owe it to this enduring classic. And if THE HOSPITAL reminds you of RED, you should do it. Same screenwriter
