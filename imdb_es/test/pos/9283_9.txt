Yes, non-Singaporeans can not see what the problem of this movie is. Some of the references in this film fly directly over the heads of foreign viewers and most of Singapore are the ones that really "capture" it. But I beg of you, foreigner, look at the other shit that has been produced in Singapore and compare it to this movie. It's like comparing the pieces of diarrhea from a mule with a small diamond. This film is the first to really show some of the sordid squalid Singaporeans, something that the forces they simulate do not exist. And there is a part in the movie where a gangster (ah-beng in our single colloquial 'ingris') curses in 4 languages, namely, Tamil English Malay and Hokkien. Well, the truth is that most of us can do it and we do it all the time. The sad thing is that viewers from foreign countries will find it easier to get their little oily claws on this gem, in their country of origin, it was initially banned, only to receive an R rating, and that too with about 20 cuts. the. It is good to know that one of the best creative, avant-garde and original films that has been created would be easier to obtain without adultery, without censorship; Halfway around the world than in your own nation.
