I think the Crewes did their evil part very well, she should have won a prize. Anything that Dunne is in. It can be saved because Dunne is a great actress and can get anything out, even a weak script. Therefore, I would recommend it for this reason alone. This film may have been a bit ahead of its time, the plot could be more acceptable these days. <br /> <br /> During Hollywood's golden age, movies were meant to entertain or teach, mainly to make us feel good or to cope with the times. This plot seems to deviate from that profile. However, once again I must say what Irene Dunne always was, at least, was "good" because she made things so believable. The only other actress I can say made me think that this was maybe, Deborah Kerr. Look at Silver Cord if you have the opportunity to "act" if nothing else.
