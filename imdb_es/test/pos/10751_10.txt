I really enjoyed this old black and white talkie. At first I did not recognize Harold Lloyd as Mr. Cobb, a missionary in China who was returning home to look for a wife. There were many twists and turns in Mr. Cobb's attempts to clean up the town hall. Their methods of making punishment fit the crime would probably be illegal, but this is not a reality-based movie. This would be a perfect movie for children, except that there are women close to nudity (only for pastors in Grace Bradley)! The old phones are lovely. The only flaw is a typical problem of the day: Caucasians are used to represent Chinese men. This is compensated for by the positive way in which the Chinese are portrayed. They are wise, good and friendly guys. Trivia: a Bekins truck appears in the movie when the police runs out of Black Marias.
