I was introduced to John Waters' films for the first time when I saw "Problems of women" at the IFC. I was disgusted but for some bad reason I enjoyed it. Then, I picked up the Pink Flamingos DVD on the set of John Waters Boxed Set. The film is about Babs Johnson "The Filthiest Person Alive", who lives in a trailer in Maryland with his mother obsessed with the obese egg, and his crazy son "Crackers". In the film you'll see sick visions like sex with chickens, drag-queens, people eating feces, tortures and all kinds of random humiliations. The film has a soundtrack of the rock and roll artists of the 60s. The only problem is that some parts of the film seem to crawl and can get a little boring. I found the "female problem" a little more fun. Classification NC-17 by explicit sex, violence and disturbing images. Enjoy.
