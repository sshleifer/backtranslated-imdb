Pat Conroy's autobiographical book "The Water Is Wide" proves to be a kind of "Up The Down Staircase" from the south, but despite the "go against the odds" formula, "Conrack" really moves the audience with each small advance. and creative flash. These students (uneducated black children on an island in South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective innocence with their eyes open is remarkably sweet. The only actress in the group (Tina Andrews, an incredible artist) plays the "crazy hard" Conrack has to break, and once she falls under his charms, everything seems to be a breeze. But the story is not ready for a happy ending, and I was not prepared for the quiet simplicity of the ending. It is very well done. The script deviates from the course from time to time, but director Martin Ritt is very intelligent and always resorts to the strong presence of Jon Voight. Scenes like the one you drive in your van venting your frustrations through a speaker do not add up much, but the whole movie is full of emotion-provoking episodes, and the real ending is your reward. ** 1/2 of ****
