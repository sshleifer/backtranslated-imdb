I decided to see this on FearNet on request for free because I realized that nothing else looked nice. And it turned out to be a good surprise of terror! The film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from the point of view of four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. After they decide to make a campfire in the forest, they begin to tell their spooky stories and transitions from the movie to the events in the stories. <br /> <br /> The honeymoon, a newlywed couple traveling across the country in an RV for Las Vegas is terrified when they are parked in a wooded area by evil beings who hunt on the full moon . (I will not spoil that for you!) The Hook-Amy Smart and James Marsden, (probably the most famous people in the film, besides the beautiful Christine Taylor) play the young couple who come face to face with the maniac who has a hook On the one hand, in this most recognizable short. <br /> <br /> People can Lick Too: this is probably the most terrifying and dark of the stories. A young girl talks to another girl on the Internet, but it turns out that she is actually a man who is obsessed with her and who enters the house when she is alone. This was really creepy. <br /> <br /> The Locket- This is also a great story with Glen Quinn and Jacinda Barrett, who play a motorcyclist and a beautiful mute girl who are terrified by ghosts from a previous century in a mysterious country house. This was good, but it was the weakest of the entries. <br /> <br /> The group around the campfire slowly develops its own frightening experience in its segments between stories, and the end of this film is surprising and truly amazing! In general, this is not scary, but it is certainly a great guilty pleasure that fans of horror would definitely be worth it.
