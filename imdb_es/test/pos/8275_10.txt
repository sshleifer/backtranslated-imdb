PLOT IN A NUMBER: Dave Seville, father and manager of the Chipmunk Alvin brothers, Simon & Theodore, went to Europe on a business trip, leaving the children at home with Miss Miller as his observer, much to Alvin's annoyance , who wanted to go to Europe. While playing against his female counterpart, Brittany, the leader of the Chipettes, was composed of her younger sisters, Jeanette (Simon's female counterpart) and Eleanor (Theodore's female counterpart) in a fierce arcade game of Around the World. in 30 days. They attract the attention of two evil alien brothers who need to smuggle money and diamonds around the world, but they need a way to do it that does not catch the attention of their arch-enemy, Jamal. The 2 evil brothers, Claudia and Klaus, listen to the jokes between Alvin and Brittany and decide to use them as deliverymen for their booty (more an idea of ​​Claudia than Klaus's, the latter initially opposes the feeling that it is too dangerous for the children). The 2 brothers make an offer to the boys and girls: they travel in hot air balloons to 12 points to leave dolls (that look like children) that contain diamonds and / or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that whoever wins the career. You will get an obscene amount of money. But as the two talking animal brothers talk, they are harassed by Jamal's henchmen, but who is Jamal? Is he friend or enemy? <br /> <br /> GLOBAL: Nice and cheerful farce based on the version of the 80s television series by Alvin & the Chipmunks. The beauty of animation is a highlight, it lacks the raw humor that keeps crawling in today's family movies and attractive songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll stand out). Eagle Eyed fans will probably notice that Brittany's character design has been modified from the animated series, which gives her a less round face while adding a seemingly permanent blush to her cheeks (which also show Jeanette and Eleanor). <br /> <br /> Keep an ear for Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson.
