Well ... I would not like to give a lecture to anyone, but I do feel the need to say some things that I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL movie. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14 years old) and then again one year later. That was it. The rest was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack, which deepens more and more the music and the story inside my heart. So deep? A week ago, my cousin gave me a copy of VHS. (No DVD yet). Chico ... I was surprised! Poets have always maintained that deep childhood and adolescent experiences of beauty, love, God, idealistic pursuits, remain with you forever. Since they occur mainly at the level of the heart (there is no intellect yet!), They define the contours of their soul as a sculptor would with a stone. If sometimes we do not tend to forget how successful they are, maybe we would do better to understand the meaning of each minute, each decision, each crucial moment of our lives. <br /> <br /> Then, I confess that I feel nostalgic. But the fascinating part of this is watching the movie again, and through this journey through time, enriching that understanding of why we, the people of the 60s, grew up as we did. The spirit of those times is here: a Genesis created far from the official world of economic and economic success, making love, not war, the beautiful pop ballads, the poetry of letters, a totally romantic view of the teenage rebellion with the awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in tender and chaste love, these two lonely spirits still filled with the innocence of childhood grow together as they learn mutual commitment and become "adults". <br /> <br /> I showed the film to a group of young people from the school and they abounded in comments so simplistic and cynical that they consider it naive and silly. Guys, be serious! The cinema is an art and as an art it reflects not only human emotions but also historical moments. And this is exactly what "Amigos" does masterfully. It reflects an idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and a new beginning with which we all dreamed when we were 15 years old. Now I am a musician and I feel that some of us, the artists, still dream of that! How else could we live? That's "Friends", that's "Brother Sun Sister Moon", that's "Hair". Those were the times, still alien to AIDS, oblivious to the explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs without melody, to the pornography presented as "sexuality", to this new barbaric "world order" that grows after September 11th. <br /> <br /> What a comforting experience to see Paul and Michelle again, timidly and tenderly exploring the new fantasies of their romantic world. What a trip to the heart of our hearts: to Paris, to Elton John in all its splendor, to that urban scenario surrounded by 2 CV Citroëns and the VW Beetles. What fresh air of the quiet country house in Camargue, surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses. They made us who we are, like Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, the Beatles, the first Bee Gees, the spirituals of Belafonte, Gandhi, the Gospel of Elvis. <br /> <br /> People are still waiting: take this picture. It starts with innocence and grows from there. You will discover what it is about. And from there you will have a solid and more truthful base; Some ideals to look for in life, a way of handling personal and world affairs. We need a lot of this today! Give yourself the opportunity and perhaps someday the time of the cynics will end. (I have an extra VHS copy) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zuleta. Bogota Colombia.
