As I recall, my family made a point to stay at home the night that "Nichols" was turned on (Monday, Tuesday, NBC?). It was an excellent vehicle for James Garner, very well written, with an excellent cast. His character is very similar to the films "Support Your Local ...": a retired player with a mysterious past settles in the city and has adventures every week. In fact, it seemed pretty obvious that it was the same character. He was simply a charmer of a television show. A sleeper, like "My world and welcome to him", which may have been his contemporary, I forget. I want these programs to be available on DVD. It was just good television. Maybe "Briscoe County Jr." Approach, but only for a mile.
