Immediately a question arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy? <br /> <br /> The answer becomes less clear as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger loses the dour note. her voice and, while her voice is still high, is incredibly effective like the surprised Betty. In fact, she is so effective that she almost wanted me to be a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable. <br /> <br /> This is the first time that Ms. Zellweger has been called to take a film and She is more than equal to the task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock? although as badly spoken as usual? It's quite tenuous like Wesley. He is able to sublimate his manic energy and only occasionally emerges and whenever it is needed most. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting allusions: the first time you see Betty, she is dressed almost exactly like Dorothy Gale from The 'Wizard of Oz'? then, later in the film, they compare her to Dorothy when she says that she had never been outside of Kansas before. At one point, the song for which Doris Day was best known, "Que Sera Sera" is on the soundtrack and then Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes it as having "a whole Doris Day theme". <Br / > <br /> This is an extremely peculiar film with good performances by everyone, including the cast of support. <br /> <br /> It has a surprising ending that, quite the opposite as it may seem, is quite predictable. <br / > <br /> If for no other reason, watch this movie just to listen to the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.
