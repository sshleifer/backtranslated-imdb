If you have a box of tissues, a comfortable sofa, a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on Friday night, this is definitely your movie! It's romantic, it's hot and it's challenging. For most of us, gays, religion is just one of those things we did when we were kids and probably only starred the alter boy and how cute he was! But in recent days, you see the struggle to be gay when your whole world revolves around beliefs that totally contradict being gay. The two main cast members were totally hot, but at the same time they managed to capture your heart and even made me "almost" cry (I've never cried in a movie!), Which I thought was quite impressive for a B-grade movie. I highly recommend this movie, you will laugh, you will cry (unless you are me) and you will definitely drool! I love it so much that I even bought the DVD for my collection. It's really the most beautiful movie in history.
