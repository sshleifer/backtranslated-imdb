Yes. Bam cried a couple of times and so did Englund. And most likely, you will do it too. The whole cast is back in action and Knoxville has become the true leader of this gang of retarded (I say it in the best possible way). The first thing I thought was that Bam or Steve-O were the main men ... no, the main man is now Johnny. Do not get me wrong, everyone, and I want to say that everyone is great in this movie. From the beginning you're laughing, and believe me, do not think about resting that smile of yours. Personally I think that the film definitely has better moments than the first one. You know when you enter a theater, and you do not want to have high expectations ... well, this film puts aside all expectations. If you love Jackass, you can enter this with gigantic expectations. It does not matter what you laugh at your ass. If you're not laughing, chances are someone has a gun in your face telling you that if you laugh you die or maybe you're embarrassed by the sound of your laughter or if you're more likely to be eating Jack Sh! T For breakfast and Jack left the city. All I have to say is, get ready to have a sore face after the movie. :)
