"Cherry" talks about a naive and single virgin who decides to have a baby, but is not sure how to do it. This small and quiet sleeper is full of extravagant characters and ironic situational humor. New things, fun, that break molds, I really enjoyed this movie ... for whatever it is worth. Recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different.
