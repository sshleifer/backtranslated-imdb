Crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone at Bowlo has seen it and they all say the same thing. The cheese wheel was a big part of the film, also the speaker "dear sir, and thus you have left the correct indicator on". Or when Jack goes home and lies on the couch and breaks a beer, "the bowls are hard work" they broke me. And when your roommate shows interest by joining the club and calling the bingo number. Jack buying all the raffle tickets to win the meat tray. Great bloody film if you like bowls of turf, since you can relate to them, if you're not a bowler, forget it, I think. The Evans Head Bowlo would qualify it as the best club in Aus, friendly people, great company. Hello to Evans Head Bowlo Steve
