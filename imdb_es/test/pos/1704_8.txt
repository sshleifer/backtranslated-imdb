Three American boys travel through Europe, challenging each other to accumulate as many reckless stunts and as Hot Babe puts as they can, but Andy seeks true love. He finds this during his bungee jump attempt at the Eiffel Tower, when he meets him and amazingly saves a beautiful and suicidal Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the secret he discovers lead him and his friends to a fast-paced adventure filled with action, romance, blood and inspired humor, never taking himself seriously or striving to be anything other than it is a tremendously entertaining diversion. 90 minute walk I have seen this movie several times and it seemed a much more rewarding experience than the original 'London', although both films are so different that it is not fair to compare the two or even consider this as a continuation.
