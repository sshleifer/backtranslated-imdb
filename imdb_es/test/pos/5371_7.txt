Not everyone likes this movie. It's still one of the best "you have to be thinking" movies about Satanism. The fact that it does not have cuts or jumps of the MTV era every seven minutes is irrelevant. Also, speaking as someone who really KNOWS the Satanists, the part (spoiler warning!) Of the film in which the Brotherhood exchanges its old bodies for those of preadolescent children, has some really terrifying scenes. The section where (second spoiler alert) Strother Martin organizes the change is almost hyperreal, since it uses very few special effects, a stamp of this movie. McEveety rarely received a large budget, but it was often effective. It worked in this case, too.
