I think the dirty dance was a great movie, they tried to do another night in Havana that was good, but it was nothing like dirty dancing. I would like to see another dirty dance with the same people. Without them I think it would be a disaster. films are often made and, when they try to add more, they start to change people and make films go downhill. I would love to see dirty dance, have another to see what happened after they could be together. Patrick and Jennifer did it so well together. This movie was made in 1997, it's time to make another one. but this time it starts where you left off and kept the same people in it.
