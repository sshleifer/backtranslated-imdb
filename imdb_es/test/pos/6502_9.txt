Wow: most of the audience seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary in pure magic that is shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> The shift from the early days as a black-American phenomenon based in New York to the present day as a racially diverse subculture (and largely based on the West Coast) is shaping up well. <br /> <br /> The humble record player does not receive the respect of any traditional musical instrument, but it can be much more versatile and technically complex. These DJs take the skills required for any musical instrument (dexterity, rhythm and rhythm, among others) and apply them to a new technology with several more variables. <br /> <br /> DJ Qbert's comment that he imagines what "music" is should sound like advanced planets and then it works, seemingly silly at first, it makes more and more sense to see these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no traditional instrument could create! <br /> <br /> Some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and wastes the opportunity to profile the broader hip-hop culture. One movie at a time, people!
