I have 2 complete series of Time Life, this is my favorite movie of all time. Love all the actors and actresses. Awesome pic. I love Patrick Swazy. This is the movie that showed his true talent. But, nevertheless, he does not get credit for the exhibition he did! A lot of credit has been lost in these movies. I love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty monologues of the Civil War. Turning it into one of the best love stories of all time, and showing through all the obstacles of life, what true friendship means. ... How were the two countries divided? But, nevertheless, all and all the friendships remained solid, in spite of the fact that the war divided the kinships and the friendships. You can still stay to this day! Simply the best ... What the wind does not compare to this movie. Patrick Swazy at his best. After watching this movie for a hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swazy ... and I have followed his career since then ... I have all his films after he has made the North and the South!
