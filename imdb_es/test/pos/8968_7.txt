Consistency is perhaps this movie your biggest problem. The film begins as a quick, elegant and simply amusing political satire, but in its second half, the film becomes more serious in tone, almost like Oliver Stone's. Of course, it is also a very serious subject, but I would say that the film would have been much better and also more effective if it had been done completely in the same style in which the first half of the film was filmed. <br /> <br /> For a biography and a film on the subject of this film, the film is also quite short with its just 102 minutes long. The film because of this does not seem to tell the whole story. Of course, the follow-up of the events after the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is insinuated into the film, but the film does not go into that and does not explain much about it, which seems like a cheap way to glorify Charlie. Wilson, without showing the other side of the medal. In addition, the actual events of the film itself are greatly simplified, even though the story is still (unnecessarily) sometimes complex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie would have been much better if I was not trying to do it. Be so serious sometimes and in general more light with your style and atmosphere. The film should have been, for example, more like "Wag the Dog," which managed to find an appropriate combination of satire and sensitive political themes. <br /> <br /> Because of this incoherent style and way of telling stories, performances act. They also mix. When Tom Hanks plays his character more fun and more comically, it's excellent. But this makes it difficult to take your character seriously in the most serious and sensitive / shocking moments of the movie. However, Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent, as he is in any movie he plays. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Most of the other actors seem to walk in this movie, just to be in the movie. This applies mainly to Julia Roberts, whose character I found too mysterious to have a clear enough purpose for the film. She caused me a redundant impression and, therefore, is also really forgettable in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie is a bad watch, it's actually quite good and nice, but if the film had dared to be a little more aggressive, the film would have been better and, above all, more effective in what he obviously tried to achieve. <br /> <br /> 7/10
