When the movie started, I thought corny. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow start and some of the antics of the soap opera, I started to like it. The plot was different from anything I had ever seen. Now, was it a horror? Not really. It should not have been classified as a horror or the producers should have put more money in the movie to scare it. As it was, the creatures were only there for a short time. I can only assume that this was for money reasons. <br /> <br /> The good side was that the movie was very entertaining. I kept my interest (after the start) and it made me wonder about creatures from another dimension. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this was the first film for the director, but there were a couple of highlights. In the end, I was hooked. Too bad Hollywood did not put more money behind this.
