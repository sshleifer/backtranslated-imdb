Wow, this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends. If you've had a shitty day, just sit down with a beer (if you're old enough, that is, if you do not have to do it with a root beer) and watch a couple of episodes, it's the perfect recipe for happiness. <Br /> <br /> What I like the most is that everyone who participates in the program is very funny and everyone has fantastic comedy timing. After a while you get attached to the characters and really care about them. I think the secret to the success of the shows is that they have an enviable life. Doug is fat but still happy with him, he loves his wife, his job and his friends. The father-in-law is the fly in the ointment, but nothing is perfect.
