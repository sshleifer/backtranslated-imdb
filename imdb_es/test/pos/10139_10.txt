Spoilers !!! To understand what really happened first, you have to be a warrior, stay alive in real war, think offline, analytically, critically and non-linearly. Otherwise, you will come to false conclusions that Maj.Gray was a foolish or unstable person. The truth is something completely different. He was a seasoned hardened veteran and the only way he could be killed by Captain O'Malley was that he wanted her to kill him. It was his exit. He chose it. It was not the man who will retire. If you've never been on the front line, you can not understand it. He intentionally prepares his own suicide. First he seduced Mary Jane, and then acted intentionally like a fool, then argued: he closed the incident before witnesses (to protect her later after she did what he wants her to do if it is a trial), and then gave him a bullet to his son. he assured that he could charge his weapon later), he came that night, loaded his gun, woke her up, put his gun in his hands, acted as he was attacking her, after firing the first time he raised a knife and shouted "One kill "so she shot him again and before he died, he left the knife as if trying to retrieve it after the first shot. He also gave him a message with his last scream. "After killing for the first time, everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life, this is the only way to die as a man, but being killed by someone I love is my choice and my only prerogative, war and army It's not what you thought until now, it grows finally and saves your life until you can. " She left the military life at the end. She understood it. And he did not die in vain. The man who helped him prepare all of that and after conducting the trial and the outcome of that trial was Colonel Sam Doran with the help of Lieutenant Tim Macy. Macy did not know what is really happening and what the outcome will be, but she did what she was expected to do. He took pictures of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray by order of Colonel Sam Doran, who gave that order because Maj.Gray asked him to do it. After she refused to leave the army (what the Colonel asked her to do), Col. Doran convinced the prosecutor to accuse her of a premeditated murder (she knew that she could not be found guilty) instead of involuntary manslaughter (there was some chance of being found guilty) With the photos taken. Colonel Doror also suppresses the closing of arguments incident to avoid that the public prosecutor has doubts on the charges of premeditated homicide, but it revealed during the trial what influenced the jury the most. I have no doubt about the outcome of that trial. Why did Colonel Doran do that? Because he will do whatever Maj.Gray asks him to do. Why? Because he saved his life on a battlefield. Why does Mary Jane choose to go to trial? Because she was a person who has integrity, principles. And that's why Maj.Gray chooses it. It has to be someone who deserves it, someone honorable. Keeping her secret about what really happened that night, she also demonstrates her honor. <br /> <br /> Miroslav
