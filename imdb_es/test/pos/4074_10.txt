I do not care what some of the reviews said, this movie was fun. What happens with this movie is that you can not expect anything else, except to be entertained. This is not an intellectual comedy, this is a smart popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the cast of support as himself, a former television policeman, brought by the character of Russo to train the cops on how to be "television cops". Those are, by far, the funniest scenes. If you want to entertain yourself and just relax to laugh, watch this movie.
