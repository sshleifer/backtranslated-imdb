Where the hell is Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Sky? Hell? A parallel universe? When the annoying man gets off the subway platform and encounters a train at full speed, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; ride alone, the most recent arrival, in a dead underworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the moment of his sudden departure from the bodily biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the annoying man from the barren plains to a city, if the eyeballs work, it is a dead end for the type of urban landscapes that once inhabited, if memory serves you well. Andreas retains the appearance of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man separated from people and objects, struggling to find his orientation; at home, or rather, your assigned apartment; or at work, where the annoying man is designated at random as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard (Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him: "You'll get used to it," which covers more than just numbers, we suspect, in this world, just like in the old world. <br /> <br /> If life does not make sense, as the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said about death. The subculture of office life could be heaven for one man, but to us it seems like hell, in the context in which "Den Brysomme Mannen" operates. Working in the other life, in essence, is working for the rest of your life. The social relationship between the companions of Andreas' office can happen as is normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates a distancing in the viewer, since now he recognizes the monotony of white-collar work done by workers of white neck, those who kill the hours with their inconsequential talks and the designated jobs they perform over the course of a day as automotive, every day, seem irrational in their obvious absurdity. To see everyday life replicated in a speculative light, "Den Brysomme mannen" makes normal human interaction look like an inexpressive comedy, while everyday life becomes a performance, which transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word "alienation" ", because here, men and women in the office, the" yes "identifies with their work, like the actors of a work that conspire to make their fictitious beings seem real. But the annoying man never fully participates in the fa√ßade. He is always aware of the cracks. <br /> <br /> From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while the people who rest at lunch go by, indifferent to his intestines that escape . They create red splashes on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity of his own co-workers after he deliberately cut his own finger, hoping to feel the pain, in a paper cutter. He does not do it. It's just another sensation, besides being able to taste and smell what the annoying man has lost. This inability to console oneself with simple pleasures amplifies man's annoying need for love, where simple pleasures compensate for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, organized by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt (Petonella Barker). They beat him. He takes her home. She invites him to enter. They become a couple. He moves. However, when they have sex, it is not good for Andreas or for Anne, who seems to enjoy more interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that is unattainable in this world, but love is important for the annoying man, so try again with Ingeborg (Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. "Den Brysomme mannen" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances by both men and women. When Ingeborg does not provoke the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-atomic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but strange city, with an open ending that is solvable and offers multiple interpretations. <br /> <br /> Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his declaration of love for her, the annoying man wanders in the same subway station, stands on the same platform, read the same couple kissing aggressively, and jumps . This time, he can not die. How can you die when you are already dead? Battered repeatedly in train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; His body contorts in angles that were only seen previously in art. When the annoying man realizes that love and death are beyond his reach, he looks for the club man, who was willing to say what is not said in this city of the undead. What it is: death, not life, has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind the whereabouts of Andreas drives the narrative and, to the credit of the filmmaker, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in one scene. that reminds of "Being John Malkovich" by Spike Jonze, when Andreas crawls through a tunnel to cross into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz makes people drag. The attempt of Andreas to cross the great division presents a seductive paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheist belief that "heaven is a place on Earth." But at the same time, heaven is tested by the reality of a hell; the place where he is sent to Andreas after being expelled from the city of his destination.
