This movie was anything but boring. It is about reality. For people who think that this movie was boring, open your eyes to the real problems of our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse should not be ignored. I work in a correctional institution as a chemical dependency counselor, and I treat these problems every day. People of all ages and all walks of life are affected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people and causes serious brain damage, all kinds of health problems and death. Everything is preventable. This film must be shown in all the secondary schools of the world. If someone owns this movie and wants to sell it or sell me a copy, send me an email to: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net thanks
