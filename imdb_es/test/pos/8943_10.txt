I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 because it's very funny from beginning to end. The plot is simple and direct, but it keeps you watching and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it. When I went to see this movie, I had not heard much about it and I did not know what to expect. I thought it was going to be a kind of movie for old ladies like Calendar Girls or something like that, but it surprised me completely. Even though I am still a teenager and the film was probably not aimed at my age group, I still found it excellent and I think people of all ages would like it. I think it is a pity that he is not so famous and that he deserves more publicity so that more people go to see him and realize the great movie he is.
