I am impressed by the actress Bobbie Phillips and her excellent ability as an action star! This movie is driven by his wonderful acting and his extraordinary dexterity of action. I'm a fan of science fiction, but I must say that this film surpasses most sci-fi movies in its photography and, for the most part, it's the use of an actress whose presence replaces the plot, which is fine but not It is nothing new. Even though it seems that this movie was made for television, in my opinion it is better than most premiere movies of this type.
