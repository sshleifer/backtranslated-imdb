Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. It really shows up in this, making jokes to the left and to the right like the comedian of the television show Tom Dobbs. For the above, it seemed that it would be a festival of laughter that was divided on the sides. And it was fun. But there were many serious parts in the movie that I did not expect. I would describe it as a drama / comedy. But it's still worth seeing, and yet I found that it was almost everything I expected. Robin Williams is at his best, along with the famous Christopher Walken. They play in a very good team in this film and I was surprised to see how well they could work together. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a happy movie.
