This movie is remarkable for how bland it is. This is the true story of a woman and a man and her search for happiness in the midst of the boring and routine life of a housewife and "the man of the house". It could be any couple, any family, in any city ... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I could not stop thinking about that ... and what more could you ask for from a movie, really? Especially a documentary. This is an excellent movie and I recommend it to all those who enjoy documentaries, stories about families like yours, stories about love, the life of parents, loss, expectations, soul searching, longing, wandering around life and find your way or not. .
