This movie is great ... It starts very slow and boring, but as the movie progresses ... the fun keeps coming. The power of the film is perhaps in its subtle references to many (and I mean many) of other films. For me, the best part was perhaps the scene of Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The way in which the two actors went from French to Chinese or to the Asian language that was, was incredible. Then jokes with names are fun, but maybe you will not understand them all when you're American (no offense). In general a great movie
