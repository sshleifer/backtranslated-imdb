In "Hoot", Mullet Fingers is participating in a sabotage to stop the pancake house. The problem is that the builders simply start over, and he has to take more drastic measures. When he confronts dogs, he scares them with snakes, not before a dog bites him and he has to go to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Roy at bedtime asks his father, who works with the Department. Of justice, how it treats criminals. His father says that it involves the tedious steps of reviewing the documents, because sooner or later, everyone is wrong. You can see this with Enron and WorldCom. Roy looks at the documents related to the pancake house and finds a suppressed document (he has to break into the company's trailer), so when the police see him, he has the law on his side. Unlike when he evaded the police. <br /> <br /> Note that, as mentioned above, Roy does not always respect the law, and when the company man is killing owls (illegally), Mullet Fingers takes direct action. Can not wait for the law (Mullet Fingers is hidden). The film suggests that one should work in the system.
