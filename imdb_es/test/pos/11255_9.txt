Spoiler begin The film focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl) and Owen (Aaron Paul). The film begins with Sam and Owen as drug addicts, and Chris, the star of the track, as the one who takes care of them. As things get worse and worse at home for Chris, he asks Sam what the drug is like. Sam is out of rehab and sober at this point and tells him that it makes everything better. Chris then catches up with Owen and they start using. Chris takes it twice until he is a "full time member". After some problems with a merchant and a confession to Sam, she re-enters. Thus begins the downward spiral for them. Chris hates when he breaks a promise to Sam (I want part of the movie to be a surprise). He dies, Sam enters the university to become an architect and Owen is arrested. that's how the story ends <br /> <br /> Spoiler ends. minor spoilers throughout <br /> <br /> Nick stahl is amazing. He will have an Oscar one day. His interpretation of Chris was heartbreaking. He was the only one who felt real in the movie about the use of drugs. Aaron Paul, who played Owen, acted as if he was accelerating, not heroin. Summer Phoenix was fine, she has talent, but what can I say? Nick Stahl stole the movie. His drugged eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. <br /> <br /> The writers needed to show retreats in the movie. That is the main reason why people do not want to quit smoking. Apart from that there are funny scenes (the scene of the mall and the Backstreet boy scene, the man Stahl detected the reactions directly in the head), touching and sad scenes (like the scene between Sam and Chris in his room after receiving a beating , I shouted, and the park scene.). It was realistic too. As I am using again when Chris wanted to throw the drug into the toilet, and Chris used it again after going to Own's house, although he had been clean for two weeks, the pull was too strong. Everything is realistic. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie in search of a great cast, great music and a semi-narrative narrative of drug addiction.
