While my children enjoyed the movie (and then announced that they want to buy it later), I think I got more than they did. The scene in the airport store at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cut comment aloud, but I thought about it). It's a middle-aged feeling film, a bit sad and some scenes do not work as well as others (why does the child stay with Bruce Willis after learning that his mother is dying?), But in general, it's a good moment. He also gave our family something to talk about. Did my children think that my life was boring? What do you expect at 40? How is it possible that you do not like a movie that has a good conversation with your children?
