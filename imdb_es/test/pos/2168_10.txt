Black Scorpion is a funny movie about a super feminine super heroine who wears leather stockings and drives a car that can transform into her elegant Scorpion Mobile. She fights against the evil Breathtaker and all this is an excellent recipe to have a good time in my humble opinion. I loved the part about her having to say "I" so that the car's computer would take orders! The breath is so evil that he wants to give asthma to the whole city! Everything is so exaggerated and that is the beauty of it! The scene where Black Scorpion "attacks" his partner steals the show. You will know when you see it. This DVD also has a fun interview with Joan Severance. She is a doll Black Scorpion is a funny DVD. I loved!
