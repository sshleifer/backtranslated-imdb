The film by Nuri Bilge Ceylan in 2002, Distant (Uzak), his third feature film (his first film in 1997 was The Small Town-Kasaba, in black and white), is an important step in comparison with his good but defective film, Clouds Of May (Mayis Sikintisi). The previous film had potential, but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst forms: plot holes and amateur wood performances. That Clouds Of May succeeded at any level was a testament to Ceylan's talent as a budding filmmaker. However, Distant is the arrival of Ceylan to the international stage as a great artist, one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (although his screenplay is not as heavy as a dialogue, it is just as melancholic, and he lacks Bergman's ability to love close-ups: his shots are usually long shots for outdoors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of Ceylan's contemplation reconfigure). Most of the film takes place in the snow-covered hibernal of Istanbul (the fact that it snows in Turkey will probably surprise some), which gives the film a definite Bergmanian feel, in addition to remembering one of the gloomy snowy urban images by Krzysztof Kieslowski The decalogue. Natural images invoke the best of Werner Herzog, as they tend to go beyond what standard film theory would dictate, which is what makes them even more memorable, while urban landscapes range from the almost precise compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni . For the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen, a photo of a bank overlooking the water is a direct quote (read from theft) of Manhattan, except for the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan similarly cites a famous photo of a ship in the Tokyo Story port of Ozu. However, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his own art his own, modifying them slightly and keeping them tailored to the needs of his own film. Distante is a film whose title reflects the characterization within the film and the feeling that some viewers will have towards them, but it does not describe the film itself, since the scenes remain a long time after the film ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when Mahmut stalks his ex-wife at the Istanbul airport and watches her with her new husband as they head to the plane that will take her out of his life forever. While watching her, from a distance, we see her catching only a glimpse of him watching her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He backs up behind a column, and Nazan simply turns his head towards his future. Mahmut is her past, and she knows how to move better, just keep moving. Mahmut will never get it. More rarely do they get such moments of self-understanding from life. That some viewers will get the movie and that Ceylan gets his own creation powers, shows that ignorance can teach, as long as one moves about it. Distant does it, even in the correct length.
