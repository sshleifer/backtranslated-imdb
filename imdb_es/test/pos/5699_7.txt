This exploration of a unique decade in the US cinema UU It begins with the fall of an ill and out of touch empire and culminates with the unstoppable rise of another, also associated with escapism and box office receipts. Meet the new boss, just like the old boss. Or, as Peter Fonda observed in Easy Rider, "We ruined it." In the middle, from Bonnie and Clyde to Star Wars, the young Turks (some under the tutelage of Roger Corman's guerrillas) crawled under the cables to produce some of the best works of art of the 20th century. While the story is already known by Peter Biskind's Easy Riders, the directors of Raging Bulls, Demme and LaGravenese are less concerned with muckraking than with offering a platform for filmmakers and stars. <br /> <br /> Everyone, from Martin Scorsese to Francis Ford. Coppola and Julie Christie are interviewed and a list of well-edited clips puts the decade in a socio-cultural and economic context. If your answers are self-congratulating (to say the least), they are also highly quotable, fun and revealing, making this something a wet dream of a movie buff. The director William Friedkin reveals how the original poster of The Exorcist presented the hand of a girl holding a bloody crucifix and the legend "For God's sake, help her," before she complained. Former Warner Bros. boss John Calley recalls that when he first saw Robert De Niro on Mean Streets, he assumed that Scorsese had secured the release of a psychopath for the shoot. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a certain amount of difficult perspectives have slipped into the mix, as might be expected from a generation with political motivation and expansion of consciousness; Hopper emphasizes that "there is also a lot of real garbage". Julie Christie observes that American cinema of the 1970s "was not a good time for women." But if Demme responds with a spoonful of sandwiches for women's movies: brief Alice clips no longer live here, Shoot horses, Do not They and Klute - they'll soon drag us back to the usual pissing competitions on the male walls. <br /> <br /> The change from a hard and socially conscious film to people who please people without risk as Jaws for the tired public of Nam, eager for fantasy is also documented, albeit a bit hasty. But also congratulations for the inclusion of less sung but equally relevant films like Panic In Needle Park and Joe. "We were not handsome," Bruce Dern reflects on his contemporaries. "But we were very interesting."
