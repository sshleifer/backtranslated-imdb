From the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black I was hooked. I had entered this movie thinking that it would be just another corny science fiction movie. Instead, I found a very entertaining action movie, on the edge of your seat, that makes you think. The movie goes beyond your basic special effects film. The actors are incredible, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and others ...), since Fry is really a pleasure to see him on the screen, while Vin Diesel like Riddeck is so captivating that you die just listening to him speak again. <Br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is impressive, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges because of the three different suns is incredible. Followed by the complete darkness of nightfall. I would really recommend any movie lover ALIEN or Radha Mitchell (so I went to see him) to watch this movie. I am sure that in the end you will see darkness in a completely new way.
