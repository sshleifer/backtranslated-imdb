This is the first-class Washington thriller, superbly designed, directed by the talented Wolfgang Petersen with screenwriter Jeff Maguire (who seems to have done very little over the years, so maybe he'll take care of his roses). The film features Clint Eastwood as an aging secret service agent and John Malkovich as a vengeful assassin confronting each other in a massive test of wills and ingenuity, where the life of the President is at stake. The unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost condemn the President, which is an authentic touch. This film was made when Eastwood and Malkovich were at their best. Probably Eastwood has never done a better job than him here, and everything is so easy for the old professional. There are some wonderful sound effects of him huffing and puffing as he runs next to the President's car as a bodyguard, so he's too old. I wonder if anyone else noticed the humor of those noises that were added. My 'guardian angel', whose name is Vigil, enjoyed this film even more than me, but bodyguard movies are his thing. Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the agent who falls in love with Eastwood, as she is so obvious but so talented, and shines. The tension is tense every inch of the way in this story, and Eastwood's psychological struggles to redeem himself from a previous protective failure are beautifully displayed in his sober and typical performance. With Eastwood, if you raise one eyebrow by a millimeter, be careful! Of course, he is the master of the super-cool. Malkovich has the opportunity to indulge in all the chills he could wish for in the paranoid character he portrays, and captures man's central vanity to perfection. How nice 'a.
