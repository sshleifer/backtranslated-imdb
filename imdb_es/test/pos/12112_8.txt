"Buffalo Bash, Hero of the Far West", the nasty Spaghetti western "The Beast" by director Mario Costa, with Klaus Kinski, could only have been produced in Europe. Hollywood would never have dared to make a western about a sexual predator lurking as the protagonist of a movie. It does not matter that Kinski is ideal for the role of Johnny "Crazy". Play a completely sympathetic individual who ironically dresses from head to toe in a white suit, pants and hat. This low budget oater has nothing appetizing. The typically impressive Spanish landscape around Almeria is nowhere in evidence. Instead, Costa and his director of photography Luciano Trasatti, who shot another Kinski western "And God said to Cain," directed this horse opera in a fairly mundane setting around Tor Caldara, Lazio, Italy and Mount Gelato Falls, Rio Treja, Lazio, Italy. However, "The Beast" qualifies as a continental western because it deals with totally unscrupulous characters and the action could be classified as film noir because the hero and the heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that force them to resort to criminal activities. As expected, their well-established plans are counterproductive due in large part to the Kinski character. In fact, Kinski's licentious character resembles a character of the Wily E. Coyote type. Consistently, he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women, but lawyers or outlaws frustrate each of his efforts. Ultimately, "The Beast" amounts to a tragic study of characters overflowing with irony. The orchestral score of Stelvio Cipriani sounds as if it had been raised by Tony Anthony's western "The Stranger Returns." Mario Costa's screenplay takes place on the western border between San Diego and Mexico, which is being terrorized by a well-known Mexican bandit named Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino from "We Still Kill the Old Way") and his gang. They take advantage of diligence and nobody is safe from their depredations. The first time we see Johnny 'Crazy' Johnny Laster, he stops to cool off in a stream and sees a beautiful woman washing her clothes. He crawls behind her and attacks her, but a larger man, armed with a rifle, intervenes and he has to flee. He appears in a nearby town and a gunman who inhales him recruits him to help ambush a rich man, Mr. Powers, on the road and rob him. They end up killing him and not getting money. Mr. Snuff-sniffer accidentally leaves his snuff box at the scene of the crime and the sheriff is arrested on suspicion of murder. 'Crazy' shoots his accomplice from his hotel room so he does not have to worry about being involved in the crime. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a young couple in love is having trouble making their way in the world. Riccardo (Steven Tedd of "Requiem for a Bounty Killer") lives on the ranch of a Mexican couple and helps them raise their real son Juan. In the village, Riccardo's lovely girlfriend, Juanita (Gabriella Giorgelli from "Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dances in the canteen. Riccardo and Juanita plan to get married, but the last place where Juanita wants to settle is on a dusty ranch. She dreams of living in the city, but life in the city requires more money than Riccardo or her. They associate with a blond outside of Glen legend (Paolo Casella from "Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead") and plan to kidnap Nancy, Mr. Power's daughter, when he comes to get his inheritance. Glen makes the fatal mistake of enlisting Johnny 'Crazy' to help them because Glen knows that Johnny needs the money to get women. <br /> <br /> They kidnap Powers' daughter and keep her in a remote cabin with Johnny on duty. about her. Meanwhile, Juanita pretends to be Powers' daughter and appears in the city to get money from Pinky Powers lawyer Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli from "Blood and Black Lace"), but she suspects Juanita does not look like anything to what he remembered Nancy. . Riccardo brandishes his six weapons and warns Pinkerton that they have kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately for Riccardo and Juanita, Pinkerton can only get his hands on $ 50,000 because Machete has hit so much in the hearts of all that the total legacy of the Powers can not be sent through the territory by diligence. Meanwhile, back in the cabin, horny Johnny tries to rape Nancy, but she misses him, knows him with a chair on the pretext that she needs to be alone while she undresses. After she knocks him unconscious, he steals a stroller and takes it back to the city. Johnny recovers, pursues and murders her almost at the same time that Glen, Riccardo, Juanita and Pinkerton meet him on the way. They inform Johnny about the complications created by Machete's reign of terror and give him $ 12,000 as his share of the money. Pinkerton is horrified to see Nancy's blood-stained corpse and threatens Johnny. Naturally, Johnny shoots him in cold blood in the place. <br /> <br /> Things really start to deteriorate as the law in San Diego sets out to capture Machete. Glen, Riccardo and Juanita return to Mexico while Johnny attacks two women on a ranch and narrowly escapes to be caught. He travels to Mexico, finds a whorehouse and is attacking her when a reward throws a revolver in his face. Johnny confesses that he knows where they can find more money if they release him. Machete's men follow Johnny's lead and capture Juanita. The villagers join Riccardo to attack Machete and Johnny rescues Juanita, but she dies later after a large shooting. Riccardo is left standing alone now. Machete and his men retaliated against their stepfathers, not only killing them but also little Juan. Everything that Riccardo and Juanita dreamed of having climbed in clouds of gun smoke for an unhappy ending. Johnny 'crazy' dies and never manages to calm his lust. If you think of the intransigent Costa sagebrusher, "The Beast" emerges as an interesting study of characters and an exercise in black cinema in a western environment where everyone is punished.
