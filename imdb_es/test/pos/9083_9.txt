This film is excellent from start to finish about a group of medical students who come together and literally kill each other by stopping their hearts and then reviving themselves. Then they investigate what happens from "near death" experiences. As each one goes through the experience, they feel harassed by their deepest fears that seem to materialize as reality. This ranges from dead children with hockey sticks to dead parents who seem to be up. <br /> <br /> The cast is first class and Oliver Platt is hilarious in one of the best roles of his career. I'm not a big fan of Keifer Sutherland but even he does an excellent job. This is a movie that I can watch again and again!
