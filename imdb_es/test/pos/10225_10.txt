This movie is a perfect example of Barkers' cinematic gifts to the horror / monster genre. I thought that this movie did a great job keeping the feeling of the novel and the comics (or, in fact, the comics may have been in second place, I forget it). This movie was made for Barker fans. It is useful to have read the book beforehand, but it is not so important if you can follow a movie. I saw anyone who is in the vicinity of this movie, I read the book and then I saw the movie again. You could find a new respect for the movie. I came to this movie, I'm already a big fan of Barker, and having read the book before, I loved the movie instantly. There are great cameos, makeup, writing, direction, etc. in this film. This movie does something that most monster / horror movies fail miserably, they show monsters. They are there in full color, not hidden in the shadows, and they take most of the screen time. Unlike other movies that use quick cuts or trick lights to hide the creature, this film celebrates the grotesque and places them in the forefront as the good boy. Two thumbs up Clive. We are waiting for the usual thief :)
