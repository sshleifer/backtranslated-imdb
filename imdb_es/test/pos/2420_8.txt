I read some reviews of the film and I had the impression that it was not as good as the previous installments of Karate Kid. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt that this fourth part of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike previous versions, the karate student is a teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path, rather than a male teenager. Maggi finds this a bit more challenging, but is up to the circumstances. The twists of the plot are credible and predictable. I discovered that the bad guys are a bit one-dimensional, but this weakness is present in all terms to varying degrees. The work of the camera is impressive and it slides through a beautiful landscape from time to time. The Zen monastery is both austere and charming. Zen monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the "Bowling Zen" scenes, which are a humorous counterpoint to Zen's more serious archery scene. The quality level of the film is like a good television series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band playing "Listen to Your Heart". The lessons in the film are valuable and worth learning. They feel faithful to the spirit of karate and take care not to glorify the combat part too much. In general, I enjoyed it.
