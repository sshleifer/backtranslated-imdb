I really loved watching this movie. I think it's a brilliant and underestimated film by Alfred Hitchcock. Everyone is familiar with the famous scene of the Statue of Liberty, but before that there is a great movie. Robert Cummings is excellent in what I consider to be his best role, and the beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she is also very talented. But I think Norman Lloyd gives the best performance. His character, Fry, is so evil and tortuous. Even though he is not in this for long, the movie would not be the same without him. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is a great movie that all Hitchcock fans should see. I give it a 10 out of 10 !!
