I was very impressed by this film directed by (Luigi Bazzoni). The story was about a young translator who suddenly lost the memory of the last three days and suffered nightmares about the astronauts on the Moon. She can not explain how this has happened to anyone. One day he receives a postcard from the island of Garma, where he will visit. strangely, although people seem to know her even though she has never been there before. Also his dreams of astronauts on the moon come back with her. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a very strange Italian movie that sometimes seemed very disturbing and there were also strange images in the movie that seemed to linger. with you during all the time you were watching the movie. I would recommend this movie to people just to see how good it is. VERY RECOMMENDED!
