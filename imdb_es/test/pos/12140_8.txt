This is a black and white film from France, <br /> <br /> A simple plot, gangster in the race looking for and getting help, etc. We have seen this type of film many times over the years. What makes this film different is mainly its performance and style. All the actors act in silence, nobody screams and almost nobody loses their calm. There are quite a few deaths, some surprising ones. There are also beautiful women, but there are no sex scenes. Nor car chases. <br /> <br /> WE'RE ONLY talking / It is very comforting to hear people talking, and here we must also read the subtitles. <br /> <br /> The performance is almost perfect for everyone. . especially the protagonist of <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura and in a vital role BUT smaller, Jean Paul Belmondo. These 2 actors were among the best. <br /> <br /> I said that the movie has flaws, there are some script deficiencies in some places, they are minor, acting is the thing in this movie. The production is also first class. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
