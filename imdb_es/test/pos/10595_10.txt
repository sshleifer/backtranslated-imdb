totally cool movie of the CKY team ...... (not the Jackass boys ..... johnny knoxville, chris pontius, steve-o, etc. are not in this <br /> <br /> movie) . Okay, maybe they're not the best actors, but it's not what you call a serious movie ... but yes, it's fun and it's totally fun to watch. Who does not want to see Don Vito dressed like a Roman emperor! <br /> <br /> a total must if you like live the bam or CKY ............ an incredible soundtrack provided by the almighty HIM, CKY and others ...... Check out the additional features on the DVD, especially Bran's free style <br /> <br /> Chinese rap number two ...... seriously hilarious ... ...... watch this movie. ....... you will not regret ........ 10/10
