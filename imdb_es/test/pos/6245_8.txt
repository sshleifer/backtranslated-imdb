"Tourist Trap" is a strange thriller that came out in the 70s, it's about 5 friends Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott), who came across a closed museum, SLASUS'S LOST OASIS, a curious and disturbing museum on the road. This gold mine of decaying mannequins, but strangely realistic, is directed by Slausen (Chuck Conners), an eccentric, but seemingly harmless. Slausen has a warning for young people: stay away from Davey, the lonely and disturbed brother of Slausen. <br /> <br /> The curiosity of young people is the best of them and they will explore. The trap has jumped! In the midst of flying objects, slamming doors, scarves that strangle on their own, empowered by some hidden force, the trap slowly approaches the group. Davey and his army of murderous dummies do the fast and brutal work of friends, until only one remains. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a Slasher movie, "Tourist Trap" still contains elements of slasher movies like the chase scenes, the stalking and the fact that the killer wears a mask. <br /> <br /> The seemingly telekinetic abilities of the killer to lock the bolts and animate the wax mannequins are used to great effect. Perhaps the most terrifying thing about this movie are the mannequins, which are certainly terrifying enough to start with, but here are the creeps. The film is successful despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meager budget. These wax figures are shamelessly plastic mannequins from the store, but this only serves to be even more disturbing when their eyes move with an incredible human. The acting is pretty good. Chuck Conners offers a full and spooky performance as Mr. Slausen, Jocelyn Jones is Great as the female lead.
