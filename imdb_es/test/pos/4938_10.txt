This is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boyfriend or family. Basically, one of those movies that feel good that you want to share with your loved ones ... without all the girls shit you find in many American movies that feel good. This movie is cheerful but it makes you think and it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Only a really simple but universal plot. I would think that most people could relate in some way to this movie. The characters in the movie are incredible and the actors do a great job absorbing you in the movie. And the film is finished off along the way with a hilarious and faithful Jewish humor to life. Last night I saw the movie for the first time, and now I want to recognize it. :)
