I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since working in the wine business, I really wanted to see this documentary, and I was not disappointed. Reportedly, extracted from more than 500 hours of images, the good news is that Nossiter will launch not just a theatrical cut, but a ten-hour and ten-hour series of the DVD movie next Christmas (ThinkFilm is distributing it). The bad news is that it is still a difficult beast to handle. When it was shown in Cannes, it was about three hours long. For Toronto, it has cut about half an hour, but still reached 135 minutes. Now, for me, that's fine. I love wine and I love hearing about the controversies in my business. But not everyone wants that. <br /> <br /> Nossiter travels all over the world, from Brazil to France, to California, to Italy, to Argentina, talks to winemakers and public relations people, consultants and critics about the state of the art world. wine. . The issue that arises is that the globalization and undue influence of wine critic Robert Parker are forcing a kind of equality in wine. Small local producers are being bought by larger conglomerates (both American and local), or are being pressured by market forces to change their wines to suit the palate of Mr. Parker, who dictates the taste to most of the Americans (and the world). ) markets. <br /> <br /> It's a complicated subject, and I can understand why Nossiter wants to let his subjects talk. There are Robert Mondavi, patriarch of the Napa wine industry, and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to buy land in Languedoc faced opposition from local authorities and government officials. There is Aim√© Guibert, founder and winemaker of Daumas Gassac, iconoclastic opponent of Mondavi's plans and crossed with wines that express local terror. There is Robert Parker himself, who expresses a certain discomfort with his influence and refuses to stop writing about the wines he prefers. There is a "flying wine maker", Michel Rolland, consultant to dozens of wineries around the world, who advises them how to make Parker-suitable wines. There are many more fascinating personalities in this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you are a wine lover, you will want to look for the ten-part series as well as the theatrical version of this film. But even if you do not like wine, the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization are changing many of the oldest and most established traditions in the world. The effects on local cultures and economies can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
