Michael (played by Steven Robertson) has cerebral palsy and lives a quiet and bland life in the residential home of Carrigmore. When a newcomer to the house, Rory (McAvoy), befriends him, he proceeds to show Michael how to live beyond disability. Despite, or perhaps because of, Rory's incapacitating disability (unable to move everything except his head and a few digits in his hand), Rory is fiercely independent and extremely rebellious. Its effect on Michael's silence and reserve is spectacular, and the two soon leave the care home to establish lives in the outside world, where they enlist the help of Siobhan (Romola Garai) as a care assistant. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the gems of the year! As in the In America of last year, the film goes from being extremely funny, to anguished, moving, annoying and truly moving without it once appearing as the sweet saccharine. O'Donnell, who knows exactly where to pull the strings of the heart and where to simply let the story and the characters do their work, has created a wonderful movie that tells everyone to look beyond the surface and see what's inside. . <Br /> <br /> The true strengths of the film come from the main actors. So convincing are your characters that you really think they are disabled. In order to transmit humor and sadness as well as great presentations, it is incredible. The couple really seems to be a close friend, and as their story unfolds, you care about them. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best examples of movies this year, and tells a very relevant story in a simple way. If this movie does not touch your heart, you must contain pure ice inside.
