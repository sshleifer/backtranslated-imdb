Do you like explosions? What about fighting? Well, this movie has both. You know the other thing without which you can not have a movie: a motorcycle to kick ass, the guy who bounces on someone's head and hits her at the same time. You bet that the stabilizer has one. There is even a classic cliff scene. <br /> <br /> In general, I am very proud to have seen this movie ... and even more proud that my review is the first ... YES!
