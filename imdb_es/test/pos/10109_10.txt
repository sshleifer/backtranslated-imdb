The beauty. The horror. The poetry. The horror. The innocence The blame. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's all I should write in this commentary for A HISTORY OF TWO SISTERS. The best thing is to watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I did not even know a single thing about the story of the two girls when I entered this movie. I just took a look at the pretty cover, I did not even read the synopsis on the back and put it in the DVD player. I only knew that he won several prices at festivals around the world and that he was highly recommended. <br /> <br /> The cover of the DVD read "The most terrifying film from THE RING, THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER". Although the frightening part could be right, you can forget about the rest, because the only thing that ONE STORY OF TWO SISTERS has in common with those movies is ... a ghostly apparition with long black hair. It is even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous Japanese films, because this Korean film has much more to offer and, in fact, is a bit more complicated and smart than the others. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply a small masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without telling anything about the plot): The film itself caught me off guard at least twice with witty surprise twists. And just when you think you've come to a conclusion (whether you get it or not, that's irrelevant at the moment) and you think the movie will end ... this movie continues a little more. The cinematography is amazing, with bright colors during the day and dark shadows at night. The camera work is excellent and the director sometimes chooses innovative angles, if not, impressive. Some shots are pure poetry (for example, the photo above with the two sisters in the lake). Everything looks very elegant. There are only four main characters, but the intrigue that surrounds them is intense. The story itself starts a little slow, but there is a lot of variety in the tone and emotions to keep it interesting. There was even a scene (when the girls went out to the lake) that suddenly reminded me of the CELESTIAL CELESTIALS of Peter Jackson. But when the horror is activated, it is quite effective. There are also some successful surprise shocks in him. Damn it, I jumped up from my couch. The musical score is great, and at times when it is not supposed to be scary, I could not help noticing that I had an Italian feeling. A little strange for a Korean movie. But nevertheless, a great score. A lot of attention was paid to every detail of this movie, including a perfectly balanced surround sound. <br /> <br /> I also think that calling A HISTORY OF TWO SISTERS just a horror movie does not give you enough credit. It is more a mysterious horror drama that works both psychologically and supernaturally. No matter how you see it, this is the Asian horror that is among the best. It may not be bloody, but sometimes it is quite scary and the subject is quite disturbed. So, if you have not seen it yet, look for a copy, insert it into your DVD player, continue with the flow and make sure you pay full attention to the movie for 110 minutes of run time. <br /> <br /> There, I hope I have done a good job praising him without spoiling anything.
