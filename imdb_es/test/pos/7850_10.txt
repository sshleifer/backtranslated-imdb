This film has some pretty shocking scenes and themes, considering that it was made in 1971. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman do an excellent job in the film, as do all the cast members. <Br /> <br /> Set during the Civil War, the film begins when a wounded Yankee soldier, Johnny, played by Clint Eastwood, receives shelter and help at a girls' academy located in the south. <br /> <br /> The principal of the school, Mrs. Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), the only teacher, Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), and a small group of half-grown girls have been without a man among them for perhaps a little too much time. <Br /> <br /> While their allegiances are with the Confederation, their emotions and physical needs definitely take them in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to convince the women on his side and prevent them from giving them to the patrollers. <br /> <br /> However, the feelings were revived with incestuous behavior, an adulterous father. a brutal rape and inexperience of teenagers combined with jealousy: turn things around with some unexpected consequences for Johnny and the residents of the school. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
