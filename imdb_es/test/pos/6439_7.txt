The 1978 adaptation had all the ingredients of a potentially wonderful movie. It is based on an absolutely charming book by Charles Kingsley. He has a truly talented cast of artists like James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention the vocal talents of David Jason and Jon Pertwee. There is also Lionel Jeffries, the director of wonderful classics like The Railway Children and Amazing Mr Blunden, and although the film is good for the most part, it was also a little disappointing. I did not have any problems with the performances, particularly those of Mason and Tomblinson like Grimes and Sir John Harriet respectively, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are credible as Tom and Ellie. The cast of voices is also commendable, especially Jon Pertwee, who expresses charming characters in their own right. I also liked the incidental music that is so fascinating and beautiful, and the script was quite faithful and, in general, well written, especially at the beginning. The characters, especially the Water Babies are very charming, and the villains are sinister and funny at the same time, I loved the part where Tom and his friends helped the Water Babies to escape, seeing the shark chasing the electric eel with an ax it was very funny. However, I will say that the film seems outdated, especially the animation sequences, the live action parts were not so bad, if you forgive the camera work quite dark. The animation of the character was quite flat, and the backgrounds were sometimes a bit boring, although there were some nice moments, like the scene with the Krakon and, of course, the first encounter with the Water Babies. I also had mixed feelings about the songs, the Water Babies song was beautiful, but I found the first song forgettable, when Tom ends up underwater. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song, which is like marmite, or you love it or hate it. Personally, I do not know what to do with this song, it was fun to listen to it at first, but once it's in your head, it might be annoying. As much as I like Lionel Jeffries and his films, his address lacked the wonder and magic it usually does. All in all, it's certainly not a terrible movie, but it could have been artistically better. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
