This movie was fun from START to FINISH. Everyone in the movies was laughing out loud during the movie! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl of Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes, etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was very funny, she really did well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters were not so funny even though the film focused on them ........ In short, this is a great movie to watch and see . Your girls (yes, guys, it's a girls movie from beginning to end!). Enjoy!!!
