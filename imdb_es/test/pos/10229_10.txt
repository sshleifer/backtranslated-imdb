As an avid reader of Clive Barker, I really anticipated this film before its release ... I was not disappointed. "Nightbreed" is a horse of a different color. Rich in the underlying decadence of Western civilization and with an alternative existence as we had never seen before. Barker is at his best when he allows us to take a look at his world of unprecedented horror, however, he shows us the other side of the coin. Here the "Monsters" are horribly beautiful beings, while humans are deceptively ugly creatures of self-indulgence. We soon learn that we are wrong all the time. By far, my favorite performance by the often-wasted Craig Sheffer, and the added advantage of David Cronenberg as "Decker" is a cast that looks better than you think. The "Monsters" are represented without problems by a group of teachers of English creatures, many of whom also gave life to the "Cenobites" in "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" Doug Bradley himself. "Nightbreed" is a must for any fan of the horror genre, and anyone who needs a little more (Something) of their horror story. This is Clive Barker at its best.
