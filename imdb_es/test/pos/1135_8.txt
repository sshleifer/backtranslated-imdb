I really like this show !! As part of Greek life, I can say that some things are too exaggerated, but in general they are still very funny. <br /> <br /> Rusty is a nice main character, his roommate is HILARO and the whole cast is entertained in his own rights. I like to focus on individual situations as well as interpersonal relationships with organizations. <br /> <br /> This program covers everything, and they do it without cursing or anything else so bad (how could it be on ABC? Family?). <br /> <br /> My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and almost all of Kappa Tau. This show is a great launching pad for them and I'm excited to see what doors this opens. <br /> <br /> Please renew this show next summer, ABC Family. Like I said, love, love, I love it!
