This movie had many ups and downs ... The story is solid, as he tells the saga of Ma 'Barker as he grows, and then his adventures with his children and the FBI ... Teresa Russell is very talented and her beauty even shines. Through, like Ma 'Barker, in Public Enemies. The direction of Mark L. Lester, although not as good as in "85's Commando, was still very interesting. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts, plays an ephemeral role as a security guard, became a bully ( and in Ma's lover), and Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute, who hangs with the gang, Frank Stallone, plays a bully who helps the gang, and while one of his exploits, he gets one of the children into trouble from mom, it comes out of him, in a final like that, so to speak ... <br /> <br /> I was perplexed, intrigued and captivated, throughout this movie ... So I wonder what movie they will see all these others who voted so low! .. For all those who wondered ... Umm, the FBI was really so bad at the beginning, it did not have guns like the ones the outlaws had, and therefore they were at a disadvantage, every time They got into gang shootings from that era, and from everything that I saw in the 1930s, I knew it was more realistic than many other movies that portrayed that time ... It's in many ways, like a train crash happening ... You do not want to see atch, but you only have too ... Enjoy !!!
