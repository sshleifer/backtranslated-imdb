This movie is truly unique. It really captures the spirit of the work, but makes it entertaining for the modern generation. The romance between Tromeo and Juliet was believable and erotic, not carried out by many adaptations. It's also so funny that I was almost crying with laughter. <br /> <br /> As with most of Troma it's in your face, taboo subjects, gore and sex, and yet I add a very good performance and an argument from Shakespeare. You really have to see this movie to believe it! <br /> <br /> There are some hilarious jokes in the credits (the best credits I've seen since Hot Shots) lots of Troma in jokes, as well as in general satire and Shakespeare refs. And Lemmy from the Motorhead house narrates. I lent this movie to a friend and I had an almost impossible job to get it back. The best of Troma, this movie is really a jewel and is among my 5 best favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Although it is not the kind of movie you would see with your mother and could offend some people. For anyone who gets bored with the cinema of the mill, with a strange sense of humor, YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.
