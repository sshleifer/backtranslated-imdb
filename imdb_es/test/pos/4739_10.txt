If you want to see real evidence of what an errant and uncontrolled government can do to "unpopular" people, this film provides it. Read what some people are saying about the "Patriot Act" passed after 9/11 and then watch this movie. Worth it? Do we really want to give our liberties to these people? Regardless of what you saw on television, you are not fully informed until you watch this movie. I apologize for mentioning another critic, but it is necessary to repeat it: Roger Ebert of Siskel & Ebert said: "What is interesting is that if you are looking for people who are unbalanced fanatics ... you can not find them among the Davidians of Rama, find them among the FBI and alcohol, tobacco and firearms, I think those are the people in this film who deserve to be feared. " I believe that all the people responsible for September 11 should be brought to justice, but I think the government has not shown a record of honoring its duty to protect the rights of people, and this film demonstrates it dramatically.
