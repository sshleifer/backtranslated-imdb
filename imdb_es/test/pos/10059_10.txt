Why does everyone feel that they have to leave this movie constantly? It's cute and fun (exactly what it's supposed to be). Anyway, Madonna was not willing to prove her worth as an Oscar-winning artist with this movie! She was just doing what the character wanted, and she did it well. I loved her in this movie; It's my second favorite movie of Madonna after Evita. The soundtrack is also excellent. It's not better or worse than any cheesy movie of the 80s. For all the critics, just do not take it so seriously and you'll have fun watching it. Madonna is a goddess !!!
