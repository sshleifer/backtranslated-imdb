The Twins Effect - Chinese Action / Comedy - (Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung) <br /> <br /> This vampire action comedy is one of my favorites due to the fact that I was completely entertained throughout the film. First, the characters are memorable, bringing a lot of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are naturally beautiful, charismatic and humorous. This movie was my first exhibition for them, and all I wanted to do was get through my TV screen and give them a BIG HUG REALLY. The remaining cast fared well in his supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, "The Duke," Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong and the evil vampires (one of which seems eerily familiar to Will Ferrell). Even the abominably horrible Ekin Cheng was good in this case. Good characters are important, of course, because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between sequences of action. <br /> <br /> And speaking of action, this movie has a lot of things. More importantly, there is a quality emphasis on fighting choreography. An aspect that helped in this sense is the outstanding weapon of the protagonists? A sword with a retractable spearhead rope. This weapon, in itself, opened a variety of movements that otherwise would have been impossible. Josie Ho and Gillian Chung, in particular, perform some perverse aerial maneuvers using these devices. <br /> <br /> In addition, the game of the sword is excellent, and is highlighted by two great sword fights. one that takes place during the opening train station sequence and the other that occurs at the end of the church. In fact, the hilt maneuvers shown in this movie made other overrated fans very bad, and I really feel sorry for those who cite the horribly choreographed crap seen in Ashes of Time, Storm Riders or A Man Called Hero with the well planned and executed sequences with precision that are seen in The Twins Effect. It is not even close. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why this movie receives so many criticisms. I am sure that the apologists of the "Golden Age" of Hong Kong will hate this because it does not fit into their narrow vision of what the Hong Kong action should be. We must learn from the fall of John Woo, a pony of a trick who never learned to reinvent himself. We do not need another clone. We need something different. The effect of the twins is a good example. <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that I was really disappointed in other Chinese films with the same actors and actresses. This applies especially to Ekin Cheng, whose other films almost always suck. and yes, this includes the overestimated and exploitative wuxia shit mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even the Twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when they were both leading actresses in a movie, although they have managed to make some good movies when one or the other takes the lead (eg, Beyond Our Ken, Good Times Bed Times, House of Fury) or when one or both are in support roles (eg, Color of the Truth, New Police Story, Just One Look). The Twins Effect 2 should have been a direct sequel, instead of a familiar fantasy. I'm still looking forward to seeing Charlene and Gillian form a team to kick some butt in another movie, but the fact is that The Twins Effect hits all the cylinders, optimizing their charisma while avoiding a descent into the nuisance (as in Protégé de the Rose Noire). <br /> <br /> In short, this film has everything you need to entertain yourself. And can I remind the reader that it is precisely this? ENTERTAINMENT ?? that judges the greatness of a film, rather than dramatic artistic elements or senseless awards from established academies of critics who generally have no idea what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> In the end, the effect of the twins is a CLASSIC that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 stars <br /> <br /> PS ?? Hollywood executives decided to sacrifice this film when it was released in the United States by renaming it The Vampire Effect and trimming 20 minutes of images, which include parts of the action scenes. However, the final fight of the United States version has a better soundtrack than the original version. Therefore, I bought both versions, which allows me to first see the original up to approximately the 1:20 mark, and then swap discs to see the final fight in the US version. UU
