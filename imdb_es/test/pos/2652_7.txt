A film, first of all, must be a good narrative. It must be entertaining, and entertaining does not necessarily mean "laughter", and does not necessarily mean "light". It basically means that you are not bored while you watch it. <br /> <br /> As bright as it may be in 2001, it is a difficult movie to watch, especially for the current generation (video games / iPod). Its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (for example, the attempt to rescue the member of the crew that floats in space) will increase his patience. On the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the film is well directed, the end makes you think and the score ... the score is chilling, especially when the crew of the transporter approaches the artifact on the moon. Boy, I had goosebumps, big time. This does not happen often when I watch movies, and it is a testament to Kubrick's management skills. <br /> <br /> It is considered a classic, and many people consider it the best science fiction movie of all time. That's just why it's a good reason to see it if you have not done it yet. However, just because everyone else thinks it's a brilliant movie does not mean you have to force yourself to like it. Either you will like it or not. Maybe the slow pace is not so bad, after all. Directing your attention to something rather static and slow for 2 1/2 hours could teach you a lesson. It will undoubtedly be a different experience to all these fast-moving images that we are subjected to these days (whether commercial, music videos or video games). <br /> <br /> I myself believe that it is a "memorable" movie. But I'm not eager to see it again in the short term (unless I'm in a particular mood for slow-paced movies). <br /> <br /> Therefore, 7 stars out of 10 of me.
