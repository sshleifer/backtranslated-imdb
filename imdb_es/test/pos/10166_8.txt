"The man who knew too much" (1955) is Alfred Hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on holiday in Morocco, where they were trapped in a nightmare that includes the murder, espionage and murders. And worst of all, the kidnapping of his 10-year-old son. The film that Hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great diversion. Stewart and Day have a good chemistry together. The film is full of wonderful comic scenes and dialogues, as well as scenes of suspense suspense. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of "Que Sera, Sera" proved to be a genius because the song seldom fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie as "Que Sera, Sera" made "El hombre" I knew too much. " <br /> <br /> Hitchcock also treats us with the live music of Arthur Benjamin "Storm Cloud Cantata" for almost ten minutes, while the scene is being performed at the Royal Albert Hall in London, where the murder of a very important politician and both, the scene and the cantata are simply wonderful.
