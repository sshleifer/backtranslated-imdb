Witticisms, colorful characters, family relationships, coping with difficulties, living with fun and humor. This movie has everything and more. What a great story of 'each man (and woman)', with a plot and a first level script. It offers clean fun, lots of laughs, lots of smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family. Other critics describe the history some. I'm just going to offer this comparison teaser? is part of "Best of Show", "Grumpy Old Men", "Millions", and some other comedies and movies of life in one. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie probably had a limited release and is probably not very available for rent. But now it is on DVD and I recommend it for your purchase. If you like fun and entertaining movies for the family, you can not miss the "Manna from Heaven". This film is a safe cure against fire for the blues or to ward off the gloom on days of bad weather or in difficult times.
