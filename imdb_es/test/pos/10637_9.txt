I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. The Pianist reinforces the "Austrian = grim" thesis I am making. Isabelle Huppert won a well deserved award for Best Actress at Cannes for her portrayal of a woman who, in her effort to achieve the artistic ideal, loses her humanity. Trapped by her talent, she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only express themselves in a twisted and terrifying way. When a younger student falls in love with her, our hopes increase, but soon they become frustrated when we realize that they can not experience love as others can. It's too late for her, and the last 30 heart-rending minutes of the movie lack the beautiful music that lasted the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it describes.
