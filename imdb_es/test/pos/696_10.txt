When I was a teenager, I watched this movie every time I was on TV (and I was in MUCH) because of its witty and attractive humor for teenagers. It may not be what critics consider to be a 4 star, but I love it for what it is: a fun comedy meant to please the audience. The teen actors are from my generation (probably the reason I love the movie so much) and it was like a fantasy cast of everyone's favorite television shows in the early 90s: Full House, Family Matters, Fresh Prince, all the shows were represented and the result was probably the best movie for teenagers of the 90s. Although it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen film writers consider vital for success among young demographics (or perhaps In his absence), I highly recommend it to pre-teens and teens everywhere.
