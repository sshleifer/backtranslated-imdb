"The Falcon & the Snowman" offers some of the best performances of its two leads. Hutton, in a brilliantly underestimated role, calmly portrays the confusion and anguish of a man who apparently becomes a traitor for no other reason than rebellion against his father. Penn, as the co-conspirator basically along with the drug trip and money, explosively turns one of the best performances of his career with multiple talents.
