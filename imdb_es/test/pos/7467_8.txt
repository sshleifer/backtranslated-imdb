I had the pleasure of seeing these two chairs from (one of) executive producer at the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laughed at very different times from the rest of us. <br /> <br /> Filmed in the Canadian Atlantic, the film is about three teenage girls who, in one of the last summers of their youth, spend a great deal of energy sleeping with a 30-year-old married man, despite of the protest. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a watch, but the humor was oriented to a completely different demography than the one I lived in (Man 18-25), so I shook my head at the character's antics instead of laugh Despite this, the story is strong enough to defend itself and make it entertaining, without much laughter.
