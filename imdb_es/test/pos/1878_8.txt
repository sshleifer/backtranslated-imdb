an amazing fact for the science fiction channel movie that far surpasses many of the previous poor efforts that they have generated. Bruce Campbell is in excellent shape as a potential investor who finds himself involved in a bizarre experiment led by a delusional teacher, Stacey Keach, and his half-hearted assistant, Ted Raimi. The movie is pure b-movie and it's great to see Keach and get on the screen with Bruce, and the fact that a lot of the movie works exclusively on Bruce's comic performance is what makes her hilarious, and makes me ask : Why is not this guy commissioning more of his scripts? It is a sick world. Definitely worth a watch.
