Interesting cartoon, included in the DVD of "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra". I especially like the way color was used in the background art, very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department usually had a very low budget (and the results seemed to be so). <br /> <br /> I wonder, however, how a certain ... um, finger gesture ... once overcame the censors. Of course, the gesture in question was seen much less frequently in 1937 than it is today. However, you would think that someone besides the animators would have noticed, especially because it is seen three times in the scene in question! And depending on the context, I suspect that its inclusion was intentional, something that the animators slipped in just to see if the censors had noticed!
