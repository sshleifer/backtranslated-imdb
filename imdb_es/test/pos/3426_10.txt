The process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This film does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I think everyone should see this movie, as I believe that few people outside of South Africa understand their past and what is being tried in the process of Truth and Reconciliation. Almost all countries have a part of their own history that continues to be a source of continuous hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand the ways of dealing with the past. What is happening in South Africa should guide us all. I found it believable, moving and sometimes annoying. There were no outstanding performances, but this added to the strength of the narrative. Once again, the BBC has been instrumental in taking a complex theme and producing a first class film.
