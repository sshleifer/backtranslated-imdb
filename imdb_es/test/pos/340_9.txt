Kannathil Muthamittal was simply one of the most moving and sincere films I've seen in a long time. the story of an adopted girl who on her ninth birthday learns the truth about their kinship. she struggles to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist. <br /> <br /> The greatness of the film lies in its simplicity. Mani Ratnam generally has a tendency to create exaggerated and pompous exaggerated characters in this film, each person seems real and their interactions are moving and sincere. This is the reason why it is ranked as one of his best films. <br /> <br /> The film is emotionally exhausting and attracts the viewer's heart, keerthana as the amudha of 9 years and Simran as his adoptive mother. Simply brilliant Your relationship is the cornerstone of this movie. There are some notable flaws here, particularly the scene in which Amudha learns that she is an adopted child, is jarring and seems totally unreal. It is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would give such news the way they did. Another flaw is, surprisingly, the brilliant songs. Once again, they seem forced and excel, they do not agree with the rest of the script. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this is still one of the most moving and beautiful films that have come out of India in a long time. . This beauty is not only in the script or the characters, but also in the technical brilliance. Ravi Chandran's camera work is pure poetry. All characters perform well and realistic humor, especially in flashback scenes, are entertaining. <br /> <br /> A sincere 9!
