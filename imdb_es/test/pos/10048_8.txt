Although this movie changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, sometimes fantasy is more pleasurable than real life, and nothing could be more real than the fact that Errol Flynn plays Custer. This is still the best movie made about Custer. The music of Max Steiner is magnificent and also throughout the film is played the Irish song "Gerry Owen", which was the favorite of Custer. The movie should have more villains, because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland flows like nowhere else in his films together, and director Raoul Walsh, with his experience in external scenes with many actors, is at his best.
