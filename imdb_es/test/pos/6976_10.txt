In some scenes in Rain People, the forerunner of Francis Ford Coppola at its height of the seventies, is the mark of a situation similar to the Easy Rider of 1969, but not exactly in the same frame of reference. Here we have a drama about people disconnected from society, in a way alienated by the elections or by the limits imposed by one means or another. It is one of those rare original dramas in which some scenes are unique as total knockouts. Even with such a low budget of strings and a very carefree attitude, so to speak, about the filming of the film, Coppola can capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and the unexpected and curved degrees of a character in front of the impotence of another, or vice versa, or both. And, as one might be inclined to see that it's a lot about the cuts of suburban life of the 1960s, it has that escapism from the movie mentioned above, but of a more concrete, almost timeless quality, with the drama and the underlying problems. . In a way, if Bergman were on his way as a filmmaker of almost twenty guerrillas to discover the strange truths of strangers every day, this could be. <br /> <br /> But together with everything direct and direct. Sometimes, self-conscious photography (although also with a more documentary approach sometimes, similar to its indeterminable characters), the actors fit in their place. Shirley Knight, an actress with whom I am not very familiar, has a complex and divergent role as a pregnant wife who escapes in a sort of existentialist enigma of what life should have. There are moments of some impressive performance on her part, and one of my favorites (if it's not my favorite) is when she calls her husband for the first time. A scene so tense at both ends, and every little gesture and inflection of a word, so much about it is spoken with very little. It is extraordinary in ways that reflect others in Coppola's films. Then comes the character of the 'murderer' played by James Caan. This, too, is a dangerous character, as it is a mixture of childish bewilderment and fun with marked memories. Think of Forrest Gump if you did not manage to overcome soccer and ingenuity. It is one of the best, in fact, being the most minimalist, for a guy who usually plays tough guys in movies, here is also a part of the story and the character of Knight. Also very good in a supporting role is Robert Duvall as a policeman with a rough side and a rather rough past; as an early sample of other defective characters that he would play later in his career. <br /> <br /> So the characters, and what Coppola runs the risk of having a concern in them, are really what makes the film, as any story there is, it is definitely not solved in the usual way what can you think or hope for? The last ten minutes or so are like the others in Coppola's work, where the specific tragedies on all sides are undermined by the emotional and psychological implications that this will leave on the principles are amplified to the sublime and the sad. This is, for its moment, brave on the part of what it is trying to be represented (both in freedom and in the defects and ambiguities) in the subject. And the style of the image adds a kind of fragmented view to everything with fast flashbacks that are graphic and self-contained in contrast to the longer shots in some crucial scenes. It is a road movie of its time, but it also has much more work than it would under another filmmaker with less possibilities of assuming the nature of these marginalized characters. One of the best movies of 1969.
