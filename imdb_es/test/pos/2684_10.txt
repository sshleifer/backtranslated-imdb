This is the best comedy period. It is so understated! Witty witty humor, great casting! Jerry Stiller is the jewel of the show, incredibly funny and quirky, just a comical genius! Doug and Carrie have great chemistry! So I do not see what it's all about when it comes to Everybody loves Raymond. It is highly overrated with unconvincing jokes, especially forced humor and, simply, not the witty show. I do not remember having laughed in more than 1 episode. King of Queens is a strange comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you a serious laugh and is usually caused by Arthur Spooner. I think it's time for this comedy has the hype it deserves and not the lame Raymond & CO.
