Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown), an underworld leader to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one opens the door, Jimmy decides to take a dip on the beach to spend some time, but you realize that your clothes in the sand have messed up and the 10 thousand is gone. Jimmy calls Pando to tell him the problem, but he does not want to hear it. Pando and his boys do everything possible to locate Jimmy, which means no more Jimmy if they put their hands on him. So now Jimmy is hiding to organize a robbery to a bank to recover Pando's money. Also along this mess, he meets the sweet and innocent Alex (Rose Byrne) and, together, they go for a walk through the King Cross in Sydney. <br /> <br /> "Two Hands" is simply an exciting choice. -up movie that is fast, stimulating and incredibly cool. What you have here is practically a movie of urban gangsters with a shabby backdrop and violence on your face? How cool are you? Well, because it takes us to the underworld, where the Australian culture shines with criminals wearing thongs (flip flops) and shorts for feet, cars made and a can of beer in hand. And let's not forget the Australian sense of humor, dry and sarcastic. You can say that it owes a lot to the likes of "Pulp Fiction", "Goodfellas" (one of my favorites) and "Lock, actions and two smoking barrels" for their inspiration, but for me, it still stands on its own. The film has a real mix of happy moments, but also a medium streak with some unexpected shocks and black humor that can be really disturbing. You just do not know what's coming and it has a nice touch of irony (especially the ending) and great timing with your humor. A scene that involves a robbery to a bank will have you in stitches, I guarantee it. The outline of the plot is really a story of maturity (or on the path that was not taken), with a love story and a gangster element to finish. Most of the subplots were intelligently constructed and intertwined, well, maybe it could have gone without the supernatural element that involves Jimmy's dead brother, but in the general context, the diverse plot seems to fit. An intense, natural and clear dialogue filled the scandalously colorful script, with quick strokes of Australian / twang slang - I am just dinkum! <br /> <br /> What really made the film was the performance of Bryan Brown of Pando. He simply gave his character a person so despicably charismatic / unpleasant that when he was not on the screen his presence was still felt. He gave his character two faces: one is a puncture, but the other is such a good guy. A young Rose Byrne shines with her nervous and sweet personality Alex. She looked radially beautiful and added a bubbly personality. Then you have Heath Ledger who fits like the naive Jimmy. Great cast of support involved with people like Susie Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Vidler and Steve Le Marquand. These raw performances are achieved and, from that, fascinating, fun and credible characters are obtained. The sound tracks of Pumping Rock that overflow from the seams with characters like Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd provide a great atmosphere. The fact of being shot at the site at King Cross in Sydney really helped to excel by having a life of its own and showing the Australian way of life. The tricks of the sliding camera captured the backdrop of the city in an excellent way, especially the penetrating nightlife. This was a movie that when I finished I was totally satisfied with what I got. In general, a crime thriller that accomplishes what it was intended to do ... a fun, intelligent and crazy roller coaster of emotion and excitement. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's a successful Australian take on "Lock", Stock and Two smoking barrels "by director / writer Gregor Jordan in his debut film.If you find it, do not hesitate to give it a try.
