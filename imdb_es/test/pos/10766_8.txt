I thought this was a very good movie. Someone said he was "sick" and they could not see him. I think that if you realize that you have a grade of R, you will be prepared for nudity and the use of drugs. It's a good story and the acting is incredible. It just can not be a crass to appreciate it! Basically it is a mother who uses drugs and wants to clean herself, so she calls a very rich old friend and he takes them to his property and crazy things happen. I guess it's a drama. I'm so sick of people who do not like movies because of curses or nudity. That is the world in which we live. Obviously, you do not feel comfortable with yourself if you can not see things like this movie. And it's classified as R. So, that should tell you from the beginning that it's not all happy and peachy rainbows. I liked. I think you will too!
