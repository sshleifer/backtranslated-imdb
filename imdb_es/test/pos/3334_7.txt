The above summary does not really intend to be a blow against this movie, since the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar ("The Saint") meets a lady in distress and comes to his aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was accused of accepting a bribe. On the way, he encounters some interesting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearly" Gates) and during his deciphering of this not particularly convincing mystery (none of them really is), Templar is extremely erudite and simply great. George Sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated Brit who does well and once again manages to make an excellent film from the B-detective series. Nothing particularly special, but a family and windy product that will please fans of the genre.
