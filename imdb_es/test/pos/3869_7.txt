Bart The Genius Although it is not the first episode of the Simpsons, Bart he Genius more or less is the first typical episode. No tricks or theme, it's just the typical Simpsons episode in the configuration. It always seems to me that it is an episode that grows in you. There are certain elements that do not interest me, largely the animation of spots that can be forgiven. But over time, I like this story of its uniqueness. <br /> <br /> For example, it would be very difficult for a live action sit-com with a standard budget to do this episode because of the several different sets that are shown in this episode, the computer bays in the Ms. Melon's class, the opera, etc. My point is that with that, The Simpsons realize one of the greatest strengths of animation. The sheer lack of visual limitations compared to live action. <br /> <br /> In the point of view of writing, it is also highly intelligent and novel. The concept is quite unique, and in particular the problems faced. Instead of the old man sure that the work was too hard, it was simply Bart's social isolation from his peers that failed him (although the outbreak of scientific experiments may prove otherwise ... which I also think is one of the best visual gags of the series.) The ending seems a bit unoriginal, largely because the Bart who ran naked in his room to avoid Homer was already done in shorts, but it's still fun for Marge and Lisa's short back and forth, even if it's not for something else. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it's a very good episode, with many new interesting points in the series, although it's not exactly perfect. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the now iconic name of Kwijybo was, of course, released in the world.
