I gave this one a 10 because it's the best movie of its kind ... a good old T & A movie in the shade and the spirit of "Animal House". I saw this with a similar movie called "Swap Meet" and both were good of their kind ... a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest ... there are more breasts in this movie than one could imagine for an R-rated movie. From beginning to end, it seems that they continue to appear on the screen (scenes of sunbathing, bedroom scenes and, of course , the game of climbing football). Also, a memorable kissing booth (give me a kiss, Clutz!) Everyone seems to be having a good time in their roles (several fellow Playboy, Danny Bonaduce, several well-known actors of television and film, etc.). The only complaint I have to register is that the character of Lisa London is called by her last name "O'Hara" and not as a good name of the 70 as "Olivia" (or even Ora or Ona or O ... ?? !!). I saw this again in the late 1980s with my now ex-wife (very well endowed) and I could not believe that I was really enjoying the movie. I was probably jealous! Once again, this movie is an excellent way to spend a Saturday afternoon ... do not think too much!
