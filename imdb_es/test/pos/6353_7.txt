Hummmm, ... Another Keystone comedy set in the park !!! It seems that the number one place to shoot was in this same local park, since many of the Chaplin and Arbuckle films are there! And, although this is another one, it is different enough and it is well done that I still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Fatty is interested in a Mabel Normand younger than usual. I think she's supposed to be a little younger, although in the eyes of her mother she's too young to be interested in men. Well, Fatty does not share his feelings and soon he and Mabel flee to have fun innocently. Things get complicated when the mother's clock is stolen. Fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel as a gift ... and MANY problems arise. <br /> <br /> The decent pace and the fact that this movie was not based too much on cheap slapstick but on a reasonable plot make this a cute and nice little movie.
