I can never imagine if this is the most artistic telenovela ever produced, or the soapiest art film. Never mind, John Seale's cinematography is absolutely dazzling. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for once, it rises to the film. If there is a flaw, it is in the original novel, not in the beautiful film by Anthony Minghella. It is likely that anyone who has a problem with its length has not read the book and probably can not read it. I do not like repeated adjectives, but the purpose of this fact is to dazzle. <br /> <br /> Apart from the story, the players excel. But it is the Australian sense of light and shadow that finally triumphs. Like a Dutch antipode master, Seale uses an explosion of light, where Van Rijn would use the shadow. You could cry for such magnificent cinematography.
