The existentialist experiment of E. Elias Merhige in the enduring is definitely a hell of a boring clock. This is like something Alexander de Large was forced to see in "The Clockwork Orange". But, in spite of how unintelligible this film really is, it is a success. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this and you have not seen the movie yet, it's too late. For me, at least, the reward (after 3 separate visits with many interruptions between you) was to see the list of characters * after * the story was told. That's when the simple message comes home. But I wonder if Merhige could have told a 5-minute story at about 30, instead of 78. <br /> <br /> However, seeing that the cast of credits is prominently displayed on the cover of this film, the Cat is already out of the bag and surely you will only appreciate this movie if you appreciate the realization of existentialist films since the beginning of the 20th century. Even then, you could vomit. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but I entrust Merhige with a work of art, even if it can not be seen)
