I have seen Jimmy Stewart in all the regular roles, but it was said that the "Spirit of St. Louis" was one of his favorites. A poor box office performer when it premiered, this movie has largely been forgotten today. In telling the familiar story of Lindberg's famous flight in 1927, Stewart at first seems to be misunderstood, and his familiar voice never lets you forget who you're looking at; He feels like George Baily again. But, obviously, Stewart worked hard on the paper and does everything right, so in a short time he will not mind that Stewart was 20 years older than the man he is representing. Stewart Lindberg is so good, completely American, apple pie that you get the story, and you realize that Stewart had the intention of portraying Lindberg with all the outstanding, yankee-know-how he could muster. above. Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the USA. UU., And Stewart seems determined to keep up appearances. <br /> <br /> Flash backs are used with intelligence to keep what is really a pretty boring story, and I was surprised. Subtle references to faith that were dispersed throughout the film; Lindberg tries to teach a desperate priest how to fly, only to be confronted by the priest for his beliefs, or Lindberg refuses to wear a San Cristobal medal offered to save weight on the plane, only to find the medal hidden in his bag lunch after he had crossed the Atlantic. For me, this is a film that is not about a man's epic journey into the unknown, but he realizes that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel.
