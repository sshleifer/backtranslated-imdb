After watching this movie I experienced a new sensation. I had seen a movie in which the lead actor had presented a performance that almost rivaled the Chevy Chase legend in 'Fletch'. This does not mean that the benefits are comparable, but that both offer a virtually impeccable delivery of their lines. That actor is Marc Singer! Singer is Jack Ford, the 'Droid Gunner' of the title, who earns his living collecting the reward for androids. There are some mutants, topless pleasure droids (!), A Scandinavian smuggler, and possibly an unenthusiastic attempt to make a statement about the class or maybe even globalization or ......... well, actually no matter. What matters about this movie is the dry way in which Singer delivers his lines, resulting in a split mood! What matters about this film is that director Fred Olen Ray seems to realize that science fiction would rarely work, and when his budget is tight it is better not to take himself seriously. Olen Ray has said that everyone involved in this movie had a lot of fun and this is transferred to the movie. I dare to criticize a film that allows itself to portray futuristic Earth as eternally dark and with neon light, and then ends in a "pipe and valves". 'warehouse. Self parody is a very redeeming quality. To summarize, Fred Olen Ray is an ambassador for the realization of independent films and Marc Singer the perfect protagonist of the film B. If only Olen Ray could work on Tim Thomerson for the equation, we would have a film in our hands.
