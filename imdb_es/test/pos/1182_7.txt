A competent comedy that offers laughter for the fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. I guess this movie was made for those who enjoyed the two films of GRUMPY OLD MEN, as there seemed to be a group of teammates who stood out for the comic duo in their twilight years. The idea is certain: Matthau, a clumsy player who owes thousands of dollars, tricks his unsuspecting friend Lemmon into taking a free cruise with him where they can meet rich old ladies; The problem is that they have signed up as Dance Hosts and Matthau can not dance. <br /> <br /> OUT TO SEA is a fun movie, and not all the laughs are found courtesy of Lemmon and Matthau. I discovered that Brent Spiner (better known as Data STAR TREK: NEXT GENERATION) is very humorous as the coordinator of dances that breaks balls. As head of the two major actors, he manages to find them in the department of laughter. Although the film does not really need any, there are also one or two love stories that are also found here, with the participation of Dyan Cannon (who looks pretty good during his years).
