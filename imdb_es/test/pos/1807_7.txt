There were many foolish teenagers who got 80s sex movies and many slasher movies, but there were only a handful that were made thinking, they made you laugh and they captured the right period of time; This was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, and also Forman who, unfortunately, of his biography, has disappeared from the attention of Hollywood. I would love to see this posted on DVD with a special version with comments from Cage and Forman. I wish, I know. When you want to plan a real weekend of 80's movies, rent this, Sure Thing and 16 candles and the Breakfast Club. It will take you back to a time "Totally Rad" that seemed at that time, it was much simpler. Memo to the studios: Time to launch the DVD!
