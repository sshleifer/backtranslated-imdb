I saw it for the first time on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with good music. Kristine was on the cover of Playboy, and the central page, as a souvenir. She is really cute and cheerful and has a lot of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and that's why I watched her in other things. She is in "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" by Steven Spielberg and "The Main Event" by Barbara Streisand and "Meatballs" by Bill Murray, as well as many television shows such as Night Court and TV movies. My friends and I really enjoy it. But her starring role in Alice in Wonderland puts the focus right where she should be, right on Kristine as the center of attention, probably the prettiest and sexiest girl I've seen in the movies.
