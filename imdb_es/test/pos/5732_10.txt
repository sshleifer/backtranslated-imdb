My local PBS station, WHYY Philadelphia, recently showed "The Elegant Universe." After three hours of seeing it, in addition to my brain ache, I learned everything about wormholes, quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternate universes. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the program was about "String Theory" Physics, a semi-new branch of physics that makes many of the ideas of science fiction not only possible, but PROBABLES. With "string theory" it sounds like wormholes, alternate realities and alternate timelines are possible and it could only be a matter of time until we have the knowledge to use them. <br /> <br /> Although I may not have given new information to someone familiar with the subject, I found the program VERY interesting and informative. It was very understandable to anyone who has just presented this topic.
