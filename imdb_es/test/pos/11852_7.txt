[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> Written by her husband and wife Wally Wolodarsky (who also directed) and Maya Forbes, this independent film is one of the best romantic comedies of recent memory. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr takes a break from playing weasels and is a nice guy who faces the fact that his girlfriend wants to sleep with other people and is also allowed to do so. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good at "Tully," plays with energy and vulnerable with great enthusiasm. Too bad he does not get the recognition he deserves. <br /> <br /> Good supportive actions also help enormously. Lauren Graham, who made "Bad Santa" memorable last year, plays the tired and cynical sister to perfection, Bryan Cranston (the father of "Malcolm in the Middle" on television) gets some funny and obscene moments, and Andy Richter plays a genius Chico who falls in love with a single mother: Helen Slater in a credible, though familiar, role as a mousy woman. <br /> <br /> What surprised me most about "Seeing other people" was how much fun it is. There are some genuine laughs here. Ed's first attempt to have nonsense sex has some great lines, and there are a lot of problems that cause one of the most sincere reactions of a man when masculine fantasy is modified. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is not unusual, but I liked that it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought it, to the chagrin of Ed (Mohr). Given the gender, you know that no matter how good your intentions are, Alice's plan is doomed. We see how the couple works through this strange situation. Initially, Alice and Ed are enthusiastic about the idea, but then the human element establishes it. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Forbes and Wolodarsky do not turn this into a cheap sex game. Yes, there are sex and nudes, but there are also real emotions at work here. The "other people" of whom Alicia and Ed become friends do not want to be the object of casual sex; They have feelings too. In one case, too many feelings. <br /> <br /> Of course, some scenes are too funny, the Richter-Slater plot is not necessary and Alice does something really unusual. But that is forgivable because Mohr and Nicholson generate a tremendous intimacy and honesty; Check out the scenes where Ed rummages through Alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to his announcement about the end of the experiment, that no matter how much we can enjoy his little game, we root ourselves. for this couple to succeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie had little or no publicity and limited release. The Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies tend to deviate from the little fun, turgid and unsurprising, would do well to learn from this smart and funny movie.
