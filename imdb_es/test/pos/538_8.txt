Susan Sarandon She made this movie for me. I have never appreciated his performance more than I did in this movie. She really acted like she was Adele August. I can appreciate the actors and actresses who abandon their individual personality and create a character that is truly credible. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as her characters developed throughout the film. The film was about them, so the other characters were peripheral. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a grade of eight, but Susan received ten from me because of her performance. Regarding the relationship films, Beaches and Terms of Endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie, but I highly recommend it.
