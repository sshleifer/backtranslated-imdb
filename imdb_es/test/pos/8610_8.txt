This movie is a fascinating drama about the making of a movie. The Actor and the Actress really do not support each other, but we prepare for a scene in which they are going to have sex: her for the first time, by script. The actress shows little emotion inside or outside the camera in the plot, apart from that it is freezing in the first scenes on a beach. The actor is self-absorbed and increasingly challenges the direction of the Director, Jeanne. I could not help being drawn to the drama of "how is it possible that these two are going to ACT in their own way through a sexual scene?" That drama in itself becomes more exciting than the real nude and the previous game made for the cameras. It's not that Roxane Mesquida is not charming and worth seeing her naked! However, there is a fairly young stage hand that walks through some scenes as an extra. I think it's her on the far left of one of the images (2 of 9) here in IMDb. I do not even know if this girl is credited, but when she happens (fully dressed, of course) with a sure indifference with her short blonde hair, SHE is sexy! WHO IS THIS GIRL ???
