"Miss Cast Away" is a fun game, which dispenses with the serious development of the plot or character to include as many gags as possible. It is best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such entertainments and perhaps, has taken some drinks. Most of the jokes are based on current events, so in future years this film can become a capsule of the reference time of pop culture of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The conversion from 30i to 24p of the footage creates a brusque appearance in some parts, most notably the opening aerial shots. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Micheal Jackson is, in fact, a strange event that is not a kidnapper. But, for my part, I find it encouraging that Mr. Jackson has shown a useful interest in one of his proteges even after he (the director) has passed from the stage of a pretty preadolescent child. <br /> <br /> The effects work is not as bad as a review suggested. Most of it was done by a one-man team in a short span of time consisting of animator William Sutton, whose name seems to have been omitted in the IMDb credits. His work is an extraordinary achievement and it really helps fill the gaps in this movie. I hope you have finally been paid!
