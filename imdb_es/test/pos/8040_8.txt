It worked! The director Christian Duguay created a very intelligent action / spy thriller. The actors Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn gave a high performance. Too bad we could not see Aidan Quinn in other movies like this until now. He was simply the best in the role of Ram√≠rez / Carlos so he should have won the Oscar. The photo was very beautiful. The scenes are fast from start to finish and the story does not let you get bored. The film is too undervalued and I recommend it to anyone, otherwise you will miss something great. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. That's why I give it 9/10.
