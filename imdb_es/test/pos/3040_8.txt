I just saw Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves much to be desired, it is a very moving and comforting study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and education in a prejudiced south and the creativity of a teacher to connect with students despite the different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and preparing them for all the challenges that life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept that we all must remember. The thread concerning the Vietnam War sounds true even today. It is worth taking a look.
