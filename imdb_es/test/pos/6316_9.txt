There are movies that are just a different version of another, not remakes, but similar to others, it is not. Although he talks about Mafia, he looks differently and, often, it seems a secondary issue. I went to see that movie on a case-by-case basis (because the other's theater was full) and in the end I felt satisfied. I was surprised, due to its black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting elements to analyze. It does not follow the classic forms of the movies, it's simply different and I think it's not the only one I like. I am also very happy because he is Italian, and I was afraid that the Italian directors and producers were not brave enough to change the subject. In this movie you can also see the new Italian style, but it is not blocked in the clich√©s. I hope it is understandable enough, I know it is difficult, I also hope that this film can be exported outside our borders, it is a good product to export. I also want to point out the music, very good soundtrack, the film needs it due to its long silent pause and they are perfectly covered by that music. Many congratulations to the director, and thank you, the cinema needs these films.
