There's not much of a plot for this movie. There is a rich owner of a baseball team that dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for negligence. Not much more than that, but ... NO MATTER! <br /> <br /> It does not matter because you have some real actors that give life to your dialogue, and because of the cast, you have something hysterical. scenes and even if you're not laughing, you have a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays Charley, whose wife recently passed away and who finds herself the object of desire of several women in the hospital. He is happy to try everything on the menu available to him. Then he meets Anne Atkinson (Glenda Jackson) who, at first, is a patient in the hospital (his first scene is very funny) and then they meet again in a panel discussion of a television panel, where they do not agree almost every topic that is discussed. <br /> <br /> Charley begins to like Anne, and vice versa, except that she is very big with monogamy in the men of her life (her husband was a cheat) and they decide to give her a chance: two Weeks of fidelity. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal anything else, but I want to mention the chemistry that Matthau and Jackson have on the screen. In general, he is not the first person who comes up with a middle-aged romantic comedy, but his contact with comedy is very light and pleasant. She is matched every step of the way by Matthau, who is more charming than ever. He does not have to play Mr. Sensitive or Mr. Macho to get the girl, he just has to be himself. <br /> <br /> Art Carney is an uproar on its own as a practically senile doctor. The scene in which the ashes of the owner of the baseball team are buried in the plate is priceless. He also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with Richard Benjamin. Richard does not have much to do in this movie and most of the time he's just the direct man of Carney and Matthau; the role does not affect his considerable talents, but he had to have had a good time doing this comedy. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended ... 8/10 <br /> <br /> PS. FYI - Matthau introduced Jackson to his first Oscar for Best Actress, and Jackson presented him for Best Actor in Art Carney for his role in 'Harry & Silly'.
