Rickman is sexy and good, but the "stranger" is less convincing. Reedus is a bit sexy, but he's not a consistent actor. This could be the director's fault in this case. We're supposed to find it in the extreme. because he is "pretty" - but that is not enough. The frustrated wife is almost convincing: 7 years of marriage and the character of her and Rickman should be more resolute with each other, whether their roles are incompatible or not, and should have patterns. I understand, although I think the wife is a bit rigid in her role, and she does not feel convincingly attracted by the "stranger", so it is a flaw. We are not sure what it is. I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (luckily he slips into the American pattern). Disappointing but with a great performance.
