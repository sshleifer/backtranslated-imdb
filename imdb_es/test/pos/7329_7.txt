I was quite surprised to see the low rating that this film received here, and personally I consider it a fun for the family. It revolves around a young teenager, Sandy Ricks, who is sent by his mother to Coral Key to spend the summer with his uncle Porter. While there he befriends a dolphin named Flipper. Many adventures occur in the middle of the predictable link between the nephew and uncle, as well as a little romance for Sandy with a local girl. <br /> <br /> I'm a huge Crocodile Dundee fan. I absolutely loved Paul Hogan in his role as Crunchy and funny Uncle Porter. For starters, you have an endless amount of Spaghetti-O in your home to serve as your usual meal, heated with a blowtorch! Choose Wood, Frodo from The Lord of the Rings, he seemed competent enough to play young Sandy, a boy who at first did not much like his forced summer vacation spot. <br /> <br /> Of course, the dolphin is magnificent and there are some wonderful underwater scenes. Located in the Florida Keys, it was apparently filmed in the Bahamas. This Flipper adaptation is a great family entertainment, a sweet, sentimental and fun movie that is infinitely superior to many of the film offerings for young people today.
