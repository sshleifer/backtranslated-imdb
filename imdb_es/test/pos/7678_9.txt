It is a pity that the Gershwin family and Goldwyn Estate have removed this great film from the screening, thus depriving the public of seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances that have ever been grouped into a single film. <br /> <br /> It is also true that the singing voices of Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge were dubbed for this film, and that is used as one of the reasons why the Gershwin do not want this film to be released again . <br /> <br /> Despite the flaws in the film and the creative differences between the Gershwins and the Goldwyns, this film has some of the most notable performances that have been committed to the screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey deserve special praise. <br /> <br /> This movie was the swan song of the great independent producer Samuel Golwyn. It was also ironically, Gershwin's greatest shame. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a loss for the wonderful black actors who appeared in it. Because we can no longer see them at their best.
