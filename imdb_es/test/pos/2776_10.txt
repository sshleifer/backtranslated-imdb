Susie Q. is one of those rare and sweet movies that give you a feeling of warmth. It's bittersweet, but healthy, and its characters are fun and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the clich√© stuffed animal movie that would bore me after five minutes, but I was wrong. It made me cry sometimes, and the plot was tempting, which made me encourage the good guys. I loved the movie, and I still remember it today, 9 years later! I highly recommend it to ANYONE, and the movie is family oriented, so you will not have to worry about inappropriate content. Indeed, if Disney were to show more films that are on par with Susie Q., it would be the most popular family oriented channel in the world. Now if only Disney will show it just ONE more time! ^ _ ^ Come on Susie Q. !!
