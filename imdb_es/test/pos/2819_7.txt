------ Spoilers ----- Spoilers ----- Spoilers -------- only a few small ones <br /> <br /> Saw this on the Satilite channel, the first ones were lost 30 min of the movie, you will keep this brief and informative commentary. <br /> <br /> The movie is basically about 5 characters, the acting is very bad for a few characters. A girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people, but it is counterproductive and the 3 kidnap the 2. This is one of those types of movies where script writers try to be reflexive or philosophical, mysterious and ... point; but in their own way, personal, without thinking that they fall terribly short. As one of the captives that is supposed to be some kind of nerd psychologist, it seems to be the role, but his tongue can not speak it. The writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8-letter words in an amateur way, without knowing it, I think the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. I would like to be able to give an example, but I can not remember any, exactly as it was said. The ending was also bad. But the only captive acted like an older and relatively wise lady, although she, like the rest, had many clich√©s. <br /> <br /> So, why would I give this film 7 stars? If I thought all the above? Simple, I give the seven stars to LISA KELLER, a sexy and $$ mom. SHE IS FINE lol. I am an appreciator of beauty, and she is exactly that. But do not confuse me because I'm not a pervert and this movie is NOT a porn in any way. There's something about her that I can not explain, but I like it. I remember the scene where a captive broke free and, while looking for a way out, he runs into Keller. She tries to make her way but has no chance. He pulls her down, kneeling on the stairs and lowers her pants, without panties;). Now, although she has an INCREDIBLE ass, and I think that this picture leaves nothing to the imagination for 30 seconds, it was her facial expression that attracted me. She wanted it, and that look made me think she was behind that. I would have started that booty! After that expression, I could no longer look at it objectively, I was IN LOVE. Hahaha I'm glad I saw this movie, but if Lisa Keller had not played the lead role, I would have changed the channel ... well ... after having seen the scene I mentioned earlier. I'm a fan of LISA KELLER, but it seems that she is not a consistent actress, since this 2003 movie is the last one. But I'm waiting for another movie with her in it.
