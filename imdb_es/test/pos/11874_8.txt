One Night at McCool's is a very funny movie that is smarter than it should be. Its form is more sophisticated than I expected, and its randomness was excellent. The thoughts behind the movie (mysogeny, sadism, stupid men) are childish. What I have to say about this movie is that it not only hates women, but detests men. He has no sympathy for any of the men, really. It seems that it is because of the form, but the end says it all. Nobody cares. <br /> <br /> The form has the first 2/3 of the film counted in flashback by three characters: Dillon, the stupid bartender; Reiser, the mysogenistic stupid lawyer; and Goodman, the stupid, holier than your cop. Therefore, history is always perverted by its own altered images and realities. The barbecue fantasy of Reiser is a great touch. In the end, we never know the truth and nothing is what it seems. Dillon was never so innocent, etc. <br /> <br /> Actually, the rest of the movie is also funny. From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the film to the excessive evidence of Tyler's manipulations, the film seems to have its own energy. Everything is out of place, and nothing seems to make sense. Do we really care if he does? No. <br /> <br /> It is also a very dark comedy, but it has a superficial presentation. Think of nurse Betty, or Jawbreaker. Very caramel coated on the outside, dark chewy on the inside. If you like your movies random, dark or just purely bad, watch this movie. This one will satisfy your impulses by the strangeness of One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> 8/10
