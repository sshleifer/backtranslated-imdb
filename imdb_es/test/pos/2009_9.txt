This new Jeskid movie is amazing! Take a look and you will be surprised. The story of Emily Waters, once a girl from a broken home, whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her sketchbook. Until one night his drawings were actually manifested and saved, and now, using this power, fight against those who would do evil. Both the live action movie and the hand-drawn animation combine to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and leave you impressed. The music is also incredible, it really intensifies the emotional experience and draws you deeply into the conflict. Directed by Jesse Cowell and animated by Erica Langworthy, starring the beautiful Marissa Parness, with music by Nico Audy-Rowland, Daniel Collins, Jeff Strathearn, Matt Sisco and Selcuk Bor. Support this movie and support Jeskid, he is a very talented guy. Go see his movie Shades of Gray too.
