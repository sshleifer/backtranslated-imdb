This movement is absolutely, undoubtedly one of the best movies of its kind, or any other. Kubrick is not only one of the best directors of all time, but his entire filmography must be put in a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a different journey to everything I've seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors who can attract him and keep him captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of an extended dialogue or a development of the plot. Only with images throughout, 2001 can present an image of the future that is sublime and horrifying. 10 out of 10, without a doubt. For my money, there's nothing better than 2001: A Space Oddysey ... now, the sequel, 2010 ... that's a different story.
