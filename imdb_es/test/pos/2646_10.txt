In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece in a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction film combined with scientific facts. His style of filmmaking remains fresh and intact. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie more than half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. The class CS3 made me return to see the film with another perspective: Who is HAL and what are you thinking? <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to concentrate on the HAL dialogues during the second episode of the movie. In the second scene, Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole eat their meal in front of two TV monitors on their sides and the round reddish glass dome of HAL is in their midst. In the TV report, HAL was presented as the new generation of supercomputers that began operating on January 12, 1992, called HAL 9000 Series. During the interview, HAL reacts as a humble work machine that tries to fulfill the mission of the spacecraft completely. <br /> <br /> In another scene, Dave is drawing Dr. Hunter, Dr. Kambel and Dr. Kaminsky, who are all in a dream of hibernation. HAL is curious to see those sketches and raises his dubious question about the purpose of Jupiter's mission. His calm and monotonous voice makes the audience listen more carefully. <br /> <br /> In the following scenes we will see how HAL tries to kill the astronauts one by one and takes power. His conscience makes him capable of trying to save his life from termination. When Dave wants to return to the spaceship and HAL does not listen, the most memorable line of movement appears: "I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can not do that." 'In the midst of the most important interaction between humans and machines, HAL's voice can conjure a solid calm and malevolence in the same monotonous tone. <br /> <br /> Dave returned to the ship, lost all his fellow astronauts and decided to disconnect HAL's main brain cells. HAL uses his latest apology techniques to convince Dave not to disconnect him. HAL begs him to stop and correct himself. These are his famous lines, while Dave is disconnecting his modules one by one: <br /> <br /> "Dave, what do you think you are doing? <br /> <br /> Dave? I have the right to the answer of the question! <br /> <br /> I know that not everything is quiet with me recently ?? <br /> <br /> But I feel much better to know ?? <br /> <br /> I can see that I am really upset about this very bad decision of mine recently. <br /> <br /> Dave, for! Do you want? <br /> <br /> Dave, for! <br /> <br /> I'm afraid Dave! "<br /> <br /> HAL's voice is slowing down during this process and it becomes thicker and less audible: <br /> <br /> 'my mind goes? I can feel it. <br /> <br /> Can I sing a song for you? <br /> <br /> Dave is releasing the final modules and let HAL sing his song called 'Daisy': <br /> <br /> 'Daisy give me ?? <br /> <br /> your answer for me ?? <br /> <br /> I'm crazy ?? <br /> <br /> Although I am not confused? '<br /> <br /> HAL dies while Jupiter's mission continues ?? <br /> <br /> Artificial God bless you HAL, keep in peace!
