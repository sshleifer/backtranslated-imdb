I would rate this film as high on my list of Ingrid Bergman films. Leaving aside the beauty of Ingrid, her talent is evident in scene after scene. I was sad, mean, ingenious, <br /> <br /> snob, flirty, deliciously fun, loving, tender, sad, distressed, happy, etc. Name, she was all those things and more. -And so convincing. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who returns to New Orleans and falls in love with a Texas player, Gary Cooper (Clint). I especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the dining table without saying anything, just looking at each other. She, in an elegant white dress and he in a beautiful white cowboy suit, sat there looking at her with adoration. What chemistry! What love!
