I can not imagine why it has not been released theatrically yet. He has a great cast, with Sutherland, Lane and especially Chris Evans doing a spectacular job. Wake up, studio executives! <br /> <br /> The story is based on the experiences of the author / screenwriter, growing up as the "poor child" in an extremely rich community, where the class is everything and makes a difference in all aspects of life, from clothes to justice. <br /> <br /> During the questions and answers of the film, the author was asked about his experiences and, in particular, about what we do not know about the ultra rich. He said that they are not stupid, that they are very intelligent (as opposed to how they can represent themselves), they have plans and they are a threat! <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie is extremely timely
