This three-hour Chinese epic, set in 220 a. C., may ultimately constitute a familiar theme of an Emperor's idealistic dream of peace through unification that transforms into a corrupt isolation, and there is nothing intrinsically challenging in the film, but it is a compelling narrative, replete with intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid strokes. Even for those who are not attracted to such historical spectacles by themselves, it is an amazing feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the attempted coup of the Marquis is one of the most amazing evocations of physical space and grandeur in the memory, and the battle scenes. They are memorable both in their scope and in their immediacy. The title summarizes the use of the film of convincing contrasts: enormous views of the plains against intimate horrors; the noblest of the reasons against the most degraded; Hope turning into dust. If you've never seen a three-hour Chinese epic, this would not be a bad place to start.
