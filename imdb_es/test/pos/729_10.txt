It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you do not have to throw a lot of money in a movie to make it good, nor will it guarantee that it's worth watching), but I think that does not make sense. . If you expect fast cars, T & A or a movie that spells for you, then do not look at this, you will be disappointed and stupefied. <br /> <br /> This movie was completely nice, it kept us on the edge of our seats and it made us really think. The writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows until the end, just remember to keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Note: the scenes from the school were filmed at McMaster University and most of them the rest were done in Toronto.
