Written by science fiction veterans Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. This spatial fantasy is well directed by Robert Parrish. The experienced American astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) accepts a manned flight on the other side of the sun. The mission must be controlled by Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) and his scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry) of the Euro Sec Space Agency (Ian Hendry) will accompany Ross. The two will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same orbit identical to the Earth ... except that it is always hidden on the other side of the sun. Ross is the only one who returns to earth and has an incredible story to tell. Special effects can be better than the story line. However, it's fun to watch it. The cast also includes: Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom.
