Christopher Nolan's first film is a black and white film "without a budget" about an unemployed writer who begins to follow strangers, which in turn leads to theft and also to violence. Is very good. <br /> <br /> As in his last film 'Memento', he does not present the story linearly. Instead, jump a bit so you end up sucking and trying to put everything together, and the early, seemingly random shots take on importance as the movie progresses. This style also means that the turns are much more effective. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing them if you have the opportunity (especially if you like your later work and / or Film Noir)
