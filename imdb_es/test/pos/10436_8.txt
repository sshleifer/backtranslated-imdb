The first time I saw this movie was when I was about 12 years old. It has been one of my favorites since ... It's so perfect in all its glory, with an incredible soundtrack, a cheesy dialogue, and it was both hilarious and terribly sad. The first movie where I really had an attack at the end ... I will not ruin it for you, but boy, it's a tearful tear ... I remember feeling so sad for Gary! What a great group of characters in this movie is great! Everyone is so great, even the nerdy girl that does not like Gary ... (although he had a nice body). I can not believe that all the girls are going for Rick, it's a seedy ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck! ha ha ha ... When you are watching this movie, prepare for many sexual jokes with sexually transmitted diseases (almost). But a story of love in the heart with real problems, dealing from insecurity to life-changing decisions that make you think and feel a genuine pain for the cast. I love this movie !!! If you like Valley Girl, another classic of all times you will too!
