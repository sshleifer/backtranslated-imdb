I hate vampire movies. That said, this was very interesting for me. I want to point out one thing though. "bakjwi" literally means bat in Korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see Count Dracula or vampires becoming a bat and flying or wuheva. We also know that bats are mammals that can fly, so many classify them as "exceptional". While watching the movie, I realized that the subject of the bat is deeply rooted in this movie, rather than simply to establish the connection between the bat and the vampire. <br /> <br /> Duality of human nature = if you ever read Aesop's fables, there is a fable in which mammals and birds are fighting and a bat can not seem to take sides and tries to play both sides to your advantage. Mammals and birds discover what this bat has been doing and they expel it from their lands at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> The two contradictory sides of human nature are constantly in battle throughout the film, for example. the blind friend of sang-hyun, the effort of sang-hyun to quench thirst and sexual desire, play tao-ju on both sides, his life boring and current against his emotion in search of vampire adventures, etc. (It will not ruin too much, you have to see the movie) and this theme is very well presented on a plate with delicious faces of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, revenge, whatever! <br /> <br /> I Feel Many Would Do It Find this boring and too long movie, but this movie is very new and fresh, something I have not yet seen b4. I would not say that this is the best work of CW Park, but it is a lot. def The most strange to understand but at the same time intriguing!
