Okay, the first time I saw "Talk Radio" was in a video store for only $ 2.00 on VHS, believe it or not, I looked at it and thought it might be Howard Stern, because I looked at it for about thirty. seconds, then I just did not see it again. Then I went to another store about a month later and found "Talk Radio" on DVD for only $ 5.00. So I see that it was directed by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. So after the movie I was speechless. I have never seen a movie like this. Here is the main plot, then I will tell you what I thought. <br /> <br /> This is a Dallas radio broadcaster, Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio broadcaster who talks about what other people are talking about and he interuptates, and he's taking everything seriously. Now, a network wants to put its program live anywhere in the United States. So Barry's program receives many interesting phone calls like Chet (a neo-natzi), Kent (a drugged child of rock n roll), John (the rapist) and others. . Now some of the callers sound like the same actor / actress. But I still think it fits me. <br /> <br /> Now what I love about this movie are the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. The dark background music also fits very well. He has a flashback scene in the movie and also how he started with the radio, which I think went well. <br /> <br /> But the good thing about the movie is ending. I was surprised, and it makes you feel a little paranoid about phone calls and everything is wonderful. It also tells you how to say the right things to people in a big city like Dallas. One of the underestimated / weakest films of Oliver Stone mentioned, but I think it is the best in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But definitely get this movie if you like movies with paranoia, it looks like a movie with a dark environment and sinister music. in the background. I keep watching this movie many times when I'm bored, as an important fact, I saw it tonight. Yes, if you really want to give the movie a sinister touch, look at it at night with the lights off. It may seem crazy, but it makes the movie better! <br /> <br /> Another thing that I forgot to mention is that the reason why I do not think the movie has gone so well was maybe from my point of view because of the title. 'Talk Radio'. It does not sound very complicated or anything, it's a bit simple. A better title like the book "Talked to Death" or perhaps "The Abusive Radio Host" or something striking and not simple "Talk Radio". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Oliver Stone usually did not do Universal, I do not think so. Paramount could have been a good company. I do not know, something about this movie did not do so well, but I love it. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage."
