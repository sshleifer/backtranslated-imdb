I read the book in a summer book club, and we all loved it. My friends from that club agreed not to watch the movie, so that the book is not ruined. I did not agree, and I saw him recently with my younger brother and my parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very faithful to the book, without losing its own spirit. The theme of the "new child" was shown enough so that we can get an idea of ​​it, but that's not what the story is about. <br /> <br /> The performance was not the best I've ever seen, but it was still good, and especially the children had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting, and the plot was beautiful and not too exaggerated. It was a movie for children that also works well for adults or teenagers. <br /> <br /> I wish Beatrice had a bit more of a tough girl attitude, but she was still a great character. Mullet Fingers was a bit like I had imagined, except that her hair was a little dyed, with blond hair and dark brows. Roy worked very well as the little boy and the new kid, especially the interactions with their parents and friends. <br /> <br /> The message and the ending (which I will not discuss what I did not like) came together to make a great animation movie for a rainy day. In general, this was a great movie that you can watch again and again when you need to remember that the world is not a horrible place, after all.
