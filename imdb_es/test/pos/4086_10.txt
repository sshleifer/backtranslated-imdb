Television produces dozens of real crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and you can rely on Court TV for some every weekend. So I began to see The Morrison Murders thinking he knew what to expect: a more or less competent account of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle and beautifully acted drama that absorbed me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Both brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in Luke's challenging role. Georgia's appearance was in almost every frame. If he had any complaints, it was Gordon Clapp as the sheriff. He just does not look or act like a southern lawman from a small town named Byron Calhoun. It looks and sounds like Medavoy, and Medavoy is not right for this part. <br /> <br /> But this is a minor issue: it's worth seeing the Morrison Murders, and not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you're going out, record it. You will not regret.
