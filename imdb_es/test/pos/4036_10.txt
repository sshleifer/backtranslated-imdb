I thought that the story came to its place very well. I really liked this movie. If you are going to fight with a Bridget Fonda movie, you can simply rot. I thought that the bad idea of ​​movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently someone does not believe it. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking about buying it. I want it to be my first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I prefer not to start an online discussion with someone I do not know and who is about a movie. If anyone could kindly retract what they said about the story, I would be more than happy to retract my insult. However, if you feel that I am not worthy of a retraction, you may feel that you are not worthy of a retraction either. But I can not control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, you do not have to make a retraction, but I would appreciate it greatly.
