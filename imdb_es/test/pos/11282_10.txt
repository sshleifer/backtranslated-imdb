This is not a story. It's a lot of psychic needles that reach your subconscious. If you wait for a story you will get bored. But if you surrender to him, you will be inside his dream world in 10 minutes. The vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape leave room for their own fantasies. The strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of the crucifixion of Christ, the pulsating light and the dark and deep shadows, all come to your subconscious to fill this mental space. I found myself trembling and unable to escape in front of my television. It was like dreaming with wide eyes. A strange nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience ... it moved me deeply and marked me to live. It freed my mind and gave me one of those rare experiences of loss of personality and my fusion with the world of archetypes. A little freedom for the soul. However, a violent freedom ... It is not a good movie, but a very strong and unforgettable one. Literally my text does not have spoilers. For me, the great surprise of this movie was its incredible intensity, and describing this can be understood as a spoiler. The less you know about this movie as you watch it, the better.
