It is surprising that a production like this is done these days, especially for television. Considering the strong sexual themes and scenes of explicit sexual relationships, not to mention lesbianism, this has been given excellent treatment and guidance. <br /> <br /> The sets and the costumes are impeccable, the address is elegant and the characters are nice. There is a good deal of humor, but it has surprisingly dark interludes. The protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not devoid of happiness. In addition, this production avoids the error that most movies / programs make when it comes to homosexuality / lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems that for people to feel comfortable watching gays and lesbians on television and in movies, most programs fill it with clich√©s and make the characters obsess about being homosexual. It is not like this. In Tipping the Velvet, the protagonist is not aware of what it means to be a lesbian! <br /> <br /> The BBC has done some wonderful productions in the past, and this piece from the adventurous era only confirms its level of excellence on all fronts.
