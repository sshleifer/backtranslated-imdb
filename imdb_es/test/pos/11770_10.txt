This is an amazing movie, and if you have not seen it, you should go to the video store at this time and rent it. First of all, the cast is excellent. Not only does he have current stars, such as Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but he also has old-time stars like Judge Reinhold. He also has numerous cameos from actors such as Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second, the story was also pretty good. It was interesting how they took an argument for a stoner movie and they almost made it dramatic. Take the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a funny face like "Half Baked" it has a true life lesson image like "Traffic". So look at this movie, if you're a fool, it will give you an idea of ​​something you love, if you do not take drugs, it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either party wants you to see.
