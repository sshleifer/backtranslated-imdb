This is what you should remember about this movie ... IT IS A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN !! I do not know about the rest of you, but I'm a child of the 80s. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. So, naturally, I love this movie. But if you see the other Rainbow Brite movies, this is by far the best. But, as I said, it's a movie for children. You have to judge it as a movie for children. Children do not care if the performance, animation or script is fantastic or even good. All that matters to them is what happens to the characters. If the good guy (or the girl) wins, then it's a great movie. If not, then it's bad. You all know what I want to say. You were all children once.
