This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. I took a new time and place. It was as if he were there with Ray through his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx transformed into Ray. During the movie it was Ray. In addition, Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were excellent. The film was well projected and directed, the music was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie four (4) times with different people and the last time was as enjoyable as the first time. I will buy the DVD as soon as it is released. This is a movie that will be seen again and again during the next years. <br /> <br /> Thanks for an excellent experience.
