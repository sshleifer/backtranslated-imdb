I saw this in the screening at GenCon in Indy. I had a little time to kill and decided to check it. It touched about 1000 people in a ballroom full of living rooms. <br /> <br /> Oh, what a ride! The script was tight. The time of action. The perfect rhythm The exhibition of the excellent character. One thing I really appreciated was that I knew this was not a big budget movie. However, it soon became clear that the creators pushed their sets and effects as much as they could despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film was directed to a certain audience, players and table players, the creators make no effort to hide that. But other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. To go for the jugular in scene after scene and not worry about if the mom who is watching "understood", they laughed in a big way over and over again. But there is enough universality there that Mama laughs too, even if she is not involved in all the jokes. I think I often watch films that strive to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator to attract most people, but the film ends up suffering for it. <br /> <br /> But not this movie. In fact, this movie was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around its finger from the initial credits. And, while the viewers around me * really * wanted to like the movie, they were not pushing, players can be among the most critical niches in the market. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I could see this in a big crowd. At least 10 times the audience was having such a good time that they burst into applause in a joke or scene during the movie. How often does that happen in the projections? It should not be surprising that there is a standing ovation when the closing credits were released. <br /> <br /> For my part, I can not wait for this to be published. After it was over, one of the producers said they were filming for a simultaneous TV / DVD release. That date can not come soon enough.
