This movie moved me more than I expected and I was completely ready to cry. The performance was mainly performed in this film, with excellent performances by Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the cast of cast. These actors played such intensely human characters that they stayed the rest of the night with me, and I had trouble shaking this war drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but they did not let themselves be carried away. They did not focus, but they added to the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never become my favorite movie, since that title will always belong to The English Patient, but it is among the first five. The story itself was well developed and remained quite unpredictable. I did not find myself guessing which line was coming next. A heartbreaking story about humanity and war. In fact, this movie was so real that it was hardly noticed that it took place in the 19th century. It seemed to apply to all times.
