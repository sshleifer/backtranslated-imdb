This is one of the best television productions of a musical. I have listened to the album of the cast of Merman, the album of Angela Lansbury, I have seen Tyne Daly live and I have seen Rosalind Russell's film countless times. I think Bette is, if she's not the best, tied with the best. She captures not only the bravery, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I was never a fan of Natalie Wood, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb, in what is possibly her best role. Everything, from the costumes to the sets and the supporting performances, is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the always reliable Christine Ebersole, are hard to beat. It was assumed that there was a television production of Mame a few years ago, with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best bet (word game) for Aunt Mame.
