This is a film about a six-year-old boy from a village in Maharashtra (a state in India) and his grandfather coming to Pune (a city in Maharashtra) to treat the child's eyes. Here, the grandfather comes to know that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they must be removed to save the child's life. The film has to do with the main characters and their feelings and actions until the operation. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a typical Indian clich√©, so do not expect to see songs, romance or melodrama. This is a highly elaborate sensitive film that resorts to silent expressions instead of along the upper dialogs to get the point. Witness the scene where grandpa is told about the need to take the eyes of the child. The performance is superb, heartbreaking dialogues. his heart is turned off by the grandfather who has the difficult task of telling the boy and his mother about the operation. <br /> <br /> The handling of the subject has been excellent. The film was made under great difficulty by the director, Sandeep Sawant, who had to knock many doors to gather the Rs. Budget of six million (approximately $ 130000). even then the final product looks polished and has decent production values. Also witness the subtle contrast of the town of the city shown by the director by incorporating some random shots of the child's life in the town. Sawant definitely seems to prefer village life. <br /> <br /> Everyone's performance is excellent. Amruta Subhash as a social worker is competent and adds the required human touch to her role. Sandeep Kulkarni as a doctor is excellent, showing the perfect gestures of a doctor. Ashwin Chitale as the child is a natural. He does not seem to be acting. Everything about him is natural and does not seem forced. <br /> <br /> But above all, Arun Nalawade is the grandfather. He is amazing in his role. mere words can not describe their work. It is a performance to appreciate forever. <br /> <br /> Shwaas is a sincere effort to make a good cinema. It should not be ignored just because it shows that if things stay simple, the results can be really amazing. 10/10.
