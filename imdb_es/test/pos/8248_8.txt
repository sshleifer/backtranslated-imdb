David "the debonair master" Niven plays the Big Boss (IVAN) who takes advantage of the unfortunate Richard Jordan (PINKY) by forcing the hapless ex-convict to exploit his new and ill-found position in a bank. Elke Sommer (Miss PELHAM) provides the feminine interest, whom Pinkie can not resist. <br /> <br /> It seems that they could not choose a name for this movie, so they used four ... does it make sense ??? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this turns out to be one of Niven's last roles. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is fun and worth seeing if you manage to capture one. of your rare television shows or late at night. <br /> <br />
