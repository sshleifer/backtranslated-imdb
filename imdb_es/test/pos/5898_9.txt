This American masterpiece reached the perfection that folk art manages, from its beautifully misleading and suggestive title to the magnificent performance obtained by William Wyler from the non-professional amputee Harold Russell. <br /> <br /> Did the film summarize both the dream and the reality of the post-war world? Did this intimate commitment to the psychological facts of American life give you an almost universal audience? But, unlike contemporary images and the preceding "messages," was not it preaching? It showed Americans as they are, presented their problems as they saw them and provided only partial, temporary, personal solutions, as they themselves would accept. The values ​​of the image are the values ​​of the people who compose it. <br /> <br /> William Wyler, an outstanding director, triple Oscar winner for the best image, adds an air of distinction to melodrama, epic and westerns ... With his distinctive visual style and his taste for solemn material, he earned the reputation of a meticulous and serious artist ... Wyler's deeper use of the deep focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content ... <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three men who return home after the war to a small middle-aged American community, and find it difficult to continue where they left off ... The three heroes are: a middle-aged sergeant (Fredric March), magnificent as the devout man of family that manages to break the ice with his family; an incisive Captain of the Air Force (Dana Andrews) who returns with an unfaithful wife; and a tormented sailor (Harold Russell) who has lost both hands in service, replaced by hooks in real life ... <br /> <br /> Winner of 7 Academy Awards, including Best Film, "The best years of our lives "is eloquent and compassionate, a deeply personal film with moving scenes without words: <br /> <br /> - The first words of the sergeant's loving wife when she unexpectedly arrives home:" I look terrible It is not fair for them to explode in us in this way. " <br /> <br /> - The involuntary sobbing of the sailor's mother when she first sees the mechanical hands of her son ... She lets go: "It's nothing!" <br /> <br /> With her dry martini voice, Myrna Loy charmingly combines her qualities as a wife with those of a mother; Teresa Wright is charming as the nice daughter of the sergeant who falls in love with the pilot; Virginia Mayo is hard as the dazzling blonde wife, whose first loves are money and the good life; and Cathy O'Donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the sailor's girlfriend ... <br /> <br /> Situations and even some of the characters seem a bit obvious, but this is an excellent example of high quality filming. in the forties, with cunningly spaced smiles and tears and a movie that says what is needed on a vital subject ...
