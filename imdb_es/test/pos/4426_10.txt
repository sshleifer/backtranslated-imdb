I just returned from seeing this doc, nominated for an award from the academy, and I was moved and interested in exploring the works of this guy who had never heard. Of course, I am someone who is captivated by beautiful architecture, so I realize that others will not care. <br /> <br /> We can only imagine if there were a couple of more visionaries in Philadelphia at the end of the 60s when Kahn's plans were a possibility, what a wonderful city center there would be. If you are wondering if you will see more about the Bangladesh building at the beginning of the film, be patient, as it will ultimately provide the climax of the film. <br /> <br /> Your son's personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting, sometimes moving and even funny at times. There is one of the most comic anti-visionary slides ever captured in the camera. <br /> <br /> To round off the positive points of this document there is a moving musical music with excellent expressive strings music. And expressiveness is an important point that is found in Kahn's architecture. The points pointed out by other architects about the spiritual nature of the matter, and how the buildings of Kahn made it join the general experience of this film.
