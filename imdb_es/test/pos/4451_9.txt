This film shows a serious side of what is often considered a gore-fest by fulci. There is not much blood and guts here, but a good story about the murder and the lives affected by it. <br /> <br /> A real find, considering that it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary. <Br /> <br /> Check this, but keep in mind that it is hard to find. <br /> <br /> Ron
