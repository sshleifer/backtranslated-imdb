I do not know why the critics call it strange and macabre. I really do not do it Dark-yes, weird-no. It is sad and with many emotions, especially with the story of Pinguin. They say it has elements of S & M, but I really do not find anything of that kind, except Catwoman's whip. <br /> <br /> This movie is deeper than its genre and the villains are not just crazy monsters dressed as in a masquerade. They have strong motives with strong feelings involved. Catwoman (a great performance by Michelle Pfeifer!) Is not just a sexy girl who likes steel jewelry; he is in his personal crusade and in Pinguin ... well, at the end of the movie you really feel him (strong performance by Danny DeVito). Once again, I believe that Michael Keaton is the best Batman and that he is wearing his costume well. <br /> <br /> You can totally see it's a Tim Burton movie, because it has an unusual style and it's a very talented guy. But also the music is fantastic and it fits with the emotions.
