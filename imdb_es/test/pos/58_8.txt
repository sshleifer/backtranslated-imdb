Excellent editing, outstanding performance, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and a very pleasant musical soundtrack. This film goes back to the 40s to discuss the racial differences in lifestyle and the effect of disaggregation, while weaving the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays the young character of Terrence Howard a wonderful work that reflects the life and times of his education in the small city of New York State. The audience laughed, wept and burst into applause for the film and its director. <br /> <br /> Soon it will be shown on HBO (February 7, I think) - turn on the TIVO and enjoy a great story!
