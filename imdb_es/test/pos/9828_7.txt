Of all the actresses in today's movie, Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice if I had to select one to be stranded on a desert island. <br /> <br /> I could see it simply, for example, sitting in a chair for a couple of hours. So it's hard for me to be completely objective with respect to one of his films. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed this movie and its history, per se, more than indicated by the average ranking among the many people who commented on this site previously. <br /> <br /> However, Harrison Ford is not one of the actors, whose performances I enjoy the most. But he's one of the few who has reached the level of going from 7 figures to 8 per movie, so who am I to argue? <br /> <br /> Ford, although he is often funny in his acting style, and sometimes seems to be in dire need of an antacid and an injection of caffeine - and "Random Hearts" is in this grouping. <br /> <br /> His obsession with probing losses, which both he and Thomas have suffered with respect to their husbands, is understandable, given his profession as a detective, but not at the level presented here. Although not far away, he crossed the line in the "annoying" category. <br /> <br /> However, most of the scenes after he and Thomas became involved were interesting and well-interpreted. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a 9 *, but I downloaded it. a couple of levels, based on Ford's overall performance, and another, because it contained a bit more strange elements from strange plots than seemed necessary.
