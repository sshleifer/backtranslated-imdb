"Please, do not kill me! I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It is difficult to describe this show. It's like a dramatic drama. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the series is that some of Assy's phrases are absolutely horrible. Breaking gems like "Goodbye, Blimp", Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at the points. Unfortunately, at other times, the show seems to drag at a slow pace, which makes it almost difficult to see. This is definitely the kind of show that you will love or hate, essentially there are no intermediaries. It's not the best program on {Adult Swim}, but it has some strengths. It's worth looking just to see if you enjoy it. I know I did it.
