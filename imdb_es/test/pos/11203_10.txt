After the collapse of Yesilcam (Turkey's response to Hollywood) in the mid-1990s, but the most expert observers could have foreseen such a recent reaction in the Turkish film industry, possibly based on the work of former photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan. br /> <br /> Uzak is the director's third feature film and forms a kind of trilogy with his two previous paintings (Kasaba and Clouds of May), following similar themes and techniques. The film shows Mahmoud, a commercial photographer, who lives alone in a small apartment in Istanbul that only occasionally visited his rough and married lover. Yusuf, his nephew, left his home in the village after the closure of a factory and the loss of his job. The younger man stays with Mahmoud as he unsuccessfully searches for a job in the city, drinks in cafes and nervously watches young women he never approaches. <br /> <br /> The title of the film translates as "Distant", and the film beautifully illustrates every possible connotation of the word; Yusuf's physical distance from his home, Mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him and the generational distance between the two men. <br /> <br /> Ceylan's films rarely contain intense dramas, instead they allow rich and complete characters to develop from the inside. Hermetically framed, static shots. Acts as a director, producer, writer, director of photography and co-editor, and plays friends and family in many of the roles. One would expect such a limited and isolated approach to filmmaking to lead to films that are difficult to infiltrate and connect with the majority of viewers, making Uzak's undoubted humanity all the more impressive. <br /> <br /> Ceylan is, however, a better film formalist than playwright, taking the reins of film language teachers such as Ozu and Tarkovsky. After seeing Uzak, I can think of some that adapt better to the task.
