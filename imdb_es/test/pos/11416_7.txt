I'm a huge horror fan and I really enjoyed this remake. With all these remakes of terror floating I think this is one of the best attempts. <br /> <br /> I saw him with my two little sisters and I think he did it even better, as they were quite scared. Also with the screams on the screen "Do not do that!", "Not in that way!", Etc. I thought there were some small moments of great shock and that increased the tension. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle is Absolutely Awesome in the lead role and a very good actress, so she keeps your attention well. <br /> <br /> In general, a decent movie.
