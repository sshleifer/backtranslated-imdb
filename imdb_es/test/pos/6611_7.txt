For me, this film deserves a lot of praise, because although I'm not a surfer or a skater, I remained inspired throughout the documentary. <br /> <br /> The depth of the story and the development of these two extreme sports emphasized what They were able to do for two groups of individuals. The dedication that these individuals had / have is truly inspiring and it was thanks to them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys founded. <br /> <br /> Unlike most other documentaries, this was intelligently prepared, the amount of recorded material that was recorded and survived over the decades is outstanding and it was because of this that some of the best editions that I have seen joined together and resulted in the theme remaining focused. Without the need to replicate the recent images of the most famous surfers and skaters that is still popular today. <br /> <br /> The film explores areas such as success, how to achieve new tricks, win competitions and gain fame. In addition to failures such as injuries or burns. <br /> <br /> It was also satisfying to hear the experiences of skaters and surfers, and not second-hand information. This resulted in a better image to be drawn. <br /> <br /> In general, a truly exceptional effort.
