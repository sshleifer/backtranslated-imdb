A beautiful film, ingeniously filmed with attention to the details of the era of war, and (considering it is set during World War II), minimal violence. <br /> <br /> A small cast weaves an emotional journey through the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the separation of loved ones while the pilots leave for England (the separation of the spaniel will touch the hearts), scenes of fire, love, friendship and betrayal. The theme of treason runs through the film, from the betrayal of love to the betrayal of friendship and, finally, the betrayal of the communist regime to the former pilots of the postwar RAF. <br /> <br /> A desperately sad movie. all the more because it is an exact fact. I would recommend it to everyone.
