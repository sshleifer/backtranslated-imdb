I saw The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal place to see anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the night. The technical elements were well combined and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and equipment well. But it was the story and its delivery that really made this short shine. The strict script of Duncan Rogers was just what he needed this night of "shorts". It did not meander, as did several offerings, nor did it preach to us. The Reader was a simple story in its best form, well played by Rogers and beautifully acted. Duncan Rogers is obviously a director with the ability to put all the pieces together, I'm looking forward to his next finished project. K.
