This Popeye caricature of World War II had some very good visual gags on it, and is decidedly above average for its genre. It was also well drawn, with some great angles, good detail and ... well, many interesting views. <br /> <br /> What it amounts to is Popeye at sea in his little boat and accidentally running on a small Japanese boat, with two guys on it. (By the way, why did the "Japanese" always photograph themselves with big, round glasses and crooked teeth?). <br /> <br /> Anyway, these innocent-looking Japanese sailors want Popeye to sign a peace treaty. Oh, boy, thinks the gullible Popeye, "wait until the Admiral sees this!" In one of those scenes of great works of art to which I referred earlier, little by little we see how that little Japanese ship is really a great destroyer ... and Popeye is in the depths ... um, water! "Oh, double crosses of Ja-pansies!", He yells at our sailor man. <br /> <br /> How to get out of the situation is fun to watch.
