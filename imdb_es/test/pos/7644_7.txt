I saw this movie on HBO and had a great time. <br /> <br /> The director has done a great job. I found myself totally absorbed in this movie once it started. The performance of Norman Reedus is great. I expect more chilling movies from him. <br /> <br /> I was so absorbed that sometimes I wanted to grab a Norman gun and shoot that snake. Hehe I like movies when innocent girls play tricks with men in a very clever way. The ending was what I wanted :)) <br /> <br /> This movie is full of twists of moments. You wait for this but something else happens. <br /> <br /> At first, those scenes of massive images were really painful for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Although it was not shown when Norman Reedus changed the tickets? Or is I standing next to the fridge? :)
