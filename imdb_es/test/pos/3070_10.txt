SPOILERS AHEAD ------------------------- Mel has it running. From the initial credits to the final credits, this film has direct laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comic force. Cary Eewes takes the film most of the time, but the cast of support fills with force when the plot moves away of Robin Hood. From the beginning, this film proclaims that it should not be taken seriously. If I took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts about modern antics, I would get this movie. What makes this film special? Throughout the film, you see that blinken and acuhu walk side by side becoming great friends like the companions of Robin Hood. But, Blinken is never told or fails to understand that he is black, until the crowd says "a black sheriff", Blinken repeats "He is black". That is a timeless scene. Simple one of the funniest movies of our time.
