This is one of my favorite comedy movies. Chris Farley is very funny, since the imbecile is prone to accidents and David Spade is perfect to play the straight man of Farley. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the two is brilliant. The scene in which the two are in the car singing along with Superstar by The Carpenters is a classic. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley was a great comic actor with incredible potential. Unfortunately you will be missed. <Br /> <br />
