This is a film that should be seen and treated as a work of art. This is a work of alien love on the part of the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima that is full of truly artistic elements. The film jumps from color to black and white, from past to present, fictional works of Mishima for him. All without being confused in the least. The only thing that bothers me is that the whole movie, with the exception of the spoken parts of the narrator, is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but has not found won. Criterion, if you are reading this, this is a movie that should be released under your seal with as many extras as possible. This movie really deserves more. 10/10
