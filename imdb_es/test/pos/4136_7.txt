It would be imprudent to judge that this narrative or documentary is more authentic than the other. Both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality, as producers seek to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives. As both formats generally leave some issues unchallenged due to the "sub-plot complexities" and screen time, it denies viewers the opportunity to open debates and continue to investigate and construct the real truth. In addition to the inability of the viewer to evaluate the sources (for example, comparisons with written history) and the logic behind the arguments, the story can be open to distortion through narrative and documentary. <br /> <br /> For most people, the documentary can be seen more truthfully as it generally involves testimonials from real participants and real-life footage. However, these visual elements are selected and edited, to be organized so that producers can present their version of realism to the viewers. In The Real Buddy Holly Story, Paul McCartney seeks to establish Buddy Holly as family and friends remember him and how Buddy had influence in the rest of the world of music. The testimonies may have been distorted, since memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make Buddy a legend. The documentary corrected the film's version and covered other events, such as there were 3 members of Crickets and that Buddy's music was actually heard outside the US. UU At that time (I had to embark on a world tour!). However, he did not enter into a deep discussion about what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. The criticisms and / or negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary while the producers seek to present a Buddy that the world should have remembered. Eventually, we can not build the whole truth, since we only limit ourselves to the past "realities" that the documentary tells us. <br /> <br /> Personally, I prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual images, which helps us reconnect with the collective memory of that time. It gives audiences a more constructive structure of history, and this leads to a better retention of memory for audiences when they retell the story. There is also an element of flexibility that allows filmmakers to express their opinions and points of view on certain topics. In The Buddy Holly Story, racial problems were highlighted and viewers can relate to these issues with respect to current situations. <br /> <br /> Moviegoers constantly seek to revisit certain emotions when they watch a movie and use these emotions. Audiences may choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to offer. In most stories, people are more likely to remember selectively the struggles, the inspirations, and the way the story ends. Through The Buddy Holly Story, we remember the difficulties that Buddy and the Cricket had, how Mary had been a source of encouragement and that Buddy Holly was a great actress until the day she died.
