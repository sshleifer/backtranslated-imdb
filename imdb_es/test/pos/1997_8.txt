I've actually seen the movie several times. And what I want to say about it is that the only thing that made this film was high-ranking was the incredible performance of Burak Altay, absolutely nothing more than that. Not even the stupid model named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names in the movie ... Burak is definitely very talented. I have seen some work that he did and has done. Although this is a kind of horror movie, it is doing a very good job in comedy films and also in dramas. I bet most of you saw Asmali Konak the movie and the television series, those two would be an example ... All I'm going to say is that it's better to be aware of the new works coming from Burak and then they will see . Keep the good job brother, a lot of love ..
