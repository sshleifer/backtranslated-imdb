I only gave him this nine stars instead of ten because I really do not approve of pornography so much. Pornography has a useful purpose in society (I can not say that I can always think of one), but I probably do. <br /> <br /> personal views put aside, I really thought that this movie was quite funny. I did not buy this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will see something about 'Alice in Wonderland'. I have almost all the versions on DVD, so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this. I must admit that I scandalized beyond my expectations, and that everything would have been completely offensive if it had not been so fun. Also, the music is very good and I like musicals. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can make a good musical nudie. anyone who has seen 'The First Musical Nudie' knows what a scent bomb was. Considering that Bill Osco worked with a low budget, 'Alice' is quite remarkable as a musical (it's better than some musicals made with expensive budgets). <br /> <br /> The movie can not totally escape the filth of porn. . Usually, I see the XXX version in search of a total shock effect and some of those scenes are outrageous (they scandalize because we're talking about Lewis Carroll). I found myself feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene in which 'Alice' (Kristine DeBell) begins to masturbate. It made me feel like a voyeur and the free lesbian scenes with 'Alice' and the kittens were too racist. <br /> <br /> However, the film has a great sense of humor about everything. There is a particularly funny moment during the queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says "Who do I have to F --- K to get out of this movie?". Hilarious. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that buying all the sex is good for you. Test your philosophy here, but sex is human and nothing human disgusts me (I do not know if I really feel that way, but I could not resist saying it) some people think that everything should be about sex. I dont know. My God, it only shows some responsibility and decorum. This movie definitely earns points for those who have sex, but it would not pressure your luck, the next time you might scare someone. I want to say that we are dealing with children's literature here.
