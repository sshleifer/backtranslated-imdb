I see many vampire movies. I know vampire movies. Hammer movies have always been my favorites. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a fun movie from the beginning to the end. The dubbing is not great, but I also like Godzilla movies, so I'm used to badly dubbed movies. Anyway, I really liked this movie. The SFX are great. Even though Jackie Chans part of the movie has nothing to do with the plot and it seems to be added to sell the movie, he is nice in it. Fang's work is excellent. The acting is not good, but this could have something to do with the defective dubbing. Maybe the real language would sound better with the movie if I could understand it. I'm sure the movie Gone With The Wind sounds worse in another language. <br /> <br /> I own this DVD and I would not like it. I have it sitting on my shelf next to the Hammer Films DVDs.
