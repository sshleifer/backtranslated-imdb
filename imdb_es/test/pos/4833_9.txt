This movie is chilling in a way that is hard to describe. While it is quite accurate in its description of previous events and in the subsequent investigation of the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993, seen now after 9/11, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to call this film prophetic, but it certainly makes the common wisdom of "cheat me once embarrassed you, cheat me twice embarrass me" comes alive. <br /> <br /> Our government learned nothing from the 1993 attempt at the World Trade Center and the subsequent readings of the September 11 Report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeated. <br /> <br /> Some people have criticized the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States are partly responsible for the Islamic terrorists can carry out their evil plans, but that is misguided of all the possible ways. <br /> <br /> Surely the people who support this argument are not supporting: Prohibition of freedom of expression, freedom of the press or freedom of religion? Certainly, I hope you are not supporting the officials of our government so that they can enter the home or office of any person to search without cause or without a court order. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the FBI, the INS and even the local police could have obtained arrest warrants based on the information they had in their possession, but chose not to do so for a variety of reasons . Also, no matter how unpleasant or ignorant it is, it is not illegal to speak ill of the United States or its leaders. In the same way, it is not illegal to have weapons or pray to Mecca. <br /> <br /> Consider this, until Lee Harvey Oswald fired his rifle at President John Kennedy, in fact he was not breaking any laws. Living in a free society has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> However, Path to Paradise is a must-see movie and I'm afraid it will never be seen by so many people. As far as I know, it is not on DVD and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known rebirths. <br /> <br /> I'm not really surprised, people do not like to document their failures and this movie certainly shows that the various agencies that had to protect us did not do their job well and for the most insignificant reasons, such as jurisdictional disputes and the refusal to share information. <br /> <br /> This is a shame. as Path To Paradise is well done and touching and as many have said before, the final scene where Ramzi Yousef (played by Art Malik), the bomber that built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt to destroy the two towers is flying After the World Trade Center after his capture and extradition, he simply says: "The next time we will bring them both down" is a cinematic moment that froze me in place for several minutes.
