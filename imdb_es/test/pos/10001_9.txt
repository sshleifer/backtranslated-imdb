As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the history of the sport, I was pleased by Disney's sensitivity to golf class issues at the beginning of the 20th century. The film showed well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself, from the trauma of his childhood to being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in English golf society. In the same way, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a simple caddy before the eyes of the Americans of the upper crust who mock his attempts to rise above his position. <br /> <br /> However, what I liked the most is how this class theme manifests itself in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes his son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior. <br /> <br /> Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the film was not the actual site of the historic tournament, the small freedoms taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There is a little Disney moment at the pool table; Otherwise, the viewer does not really think of Disney. The ending, as in "Milagro", is not a Disney creation, but a story that only human history could have written.
