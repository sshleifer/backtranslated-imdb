I must have been around ten years old when my uncle and my brother took us to see this martial arts movie in "DRIVE IN" in the entrance circle in Long Beach. The title was "HAMMER OF GOD", which I can never forget for some reason, but what I do remember are the different scenes that have left a mark on my mind forever. <br /> <br /> My brother always reminds me of the film, even though it has been forever, it seems that we have seen the movie. Every once in a while, I looked for them in the rental stores and from time to time I checked the web and for some reason it seems that it is never available or nobody knows what movie I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I only knew if I was available, I would love to buy that movie. If someone is aware of your availability, please inform me.
