I am sure that the people of the USA UU He does not know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they should not talk about what they do not know. And you must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocritical as the United States. The only places where consensual sex between teenagers is illegal are the United States and Islamic nations. In France, for example, the age of consent is 15 years. In Brazil, of 14 years. In Spain, of 12 years. Therefore, the adolescent actors, aged 16 and 17, at the time of production, are not doing anything illegal. Nudity is not considered great in almost all civilized countries. And only a phenomenon could consider the love of a teenager as a child abuse.
