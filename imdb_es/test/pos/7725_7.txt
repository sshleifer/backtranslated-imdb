This is a good movie with good performances by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia. Of course, Vicente Aranda is a legend of Spanish cinema and surely one of the great directors of Spanish cinema, but I do not think that this is one of his best films, even if he is well. The script plays with the introduction of Merimeé as a character, it's a nice touch but it's incredible. The music is composed by José Nieto, Spanish National Film Award. I want to say that this movie is very good in all technical aspects. There are very good actors in support roles such as Antonio Dechent, Maria Botto and others. I give it 7 out of 10 because I think this could be a better movie, but as it is, it is not boring at all.
