I am very impressed by the reviews I have read of this film, generally well read, thoughtful and informed, obviously by people who like and think a lot about movies. I could not add anything to the excellent review work that IMDb members have already done. If I may, I would like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the criticisms: Mr. Baseball was American and behaved in an ugly way, but he was NOT an ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and exactly the opposite of Mr Baseball. Homer was an archetypal American and archetypal engineer: he went to Vietnam to work with people, he respected and liked the people he met, he used appropriate and sustainable technology in collaboration with his hosts, and he was appreciated and respected by them precisely. Because it exemplified democratic values ​​and American virtues. His ugliness was purely facial, just superficial; His personality and humanity were deep and genuine. <br /> <br /> Mr. Baseball exemplifies all the rude, ignorant and insecure donkey that Europeans and Americans often inflict on other cultures; Homer Atkins, the ugly American, was the other side of our coin, representing our humanity and decency. I think ugly Americans still far outnumber Mr Baseballs; They are still our last, best hope.
