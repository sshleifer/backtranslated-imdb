The biggest problem faced by the television program Key West was that it was advertised badly. If you saw the ads, you would think it was a jiggle, and you will be very disappointed. It was a much more complex show than that. <br /> <br /> I happened to be in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew, and I think I actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the Rum Runners cast. Of course, that was before the success of the show. I saw that the sailboat that was in the opening happened a few times, and I talked with the guy you see who cuts the coconuts in the opening as well. He was a real local. Yes, I would love to see this on DVD.
