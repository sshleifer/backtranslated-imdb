I took the first projection of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows that he can act beyond Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as the dominant mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope this movie is picked up by a US distributor so that everyone can see it. This film is not only about driving lessons, but about life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his dominant mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life. It is an incredible movie, an incredible director who took his own life and put it on the screen for all to see, and all who can, should.
