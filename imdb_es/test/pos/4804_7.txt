The only thing that can be said about RUNNING OUT OF TIME is that it is a very intelligent movie. It is interesting to note that the writers of the film are French, which may explain the "out of the ordinary" atmosphere of the film, since it does not fit with what is commonly called "Hong Kong cinema". <br /> <br /> The film is about a thief who plans to take revenge on some criminal types with the help of an equally intelligent policeman. But first he has to convince the policeman to join his personal crusade, and thus begins a series of games in which the thief puts the policeman in his plan. <br /> <br /> A whole smart movie. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (visit www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film or complete reviews of other foreign films)
