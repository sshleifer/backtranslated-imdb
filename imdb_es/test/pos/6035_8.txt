This episode of Columbo is one of the best and perhaps one of my personal favorites. The cast includes Rosemary's Baby John Cassavetes as the teacher, his wife played by Blythe Danner (the mother of Gwyneth Paltrow) and her mother-in-law played by Myrna Loy (one of America's most important actresses of our time). Anyway I do not agree with anyone who criticizes this movie. This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast that does an excellent job in performing. I love seeing Columbo with his beloved dog whom he never mentions in the series. This time, the episode focuses on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of the attractions of L.A. Of course, Columbo is as interested in classical music as in anything else related to a crime.
