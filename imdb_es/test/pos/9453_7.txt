The film was great and everything, but there were many mistakes in the "soccer" scenes, I wonder if any of the guys who were working on the film had seen a football game before ... First of all, I do not understand how I wanted to try with the male team? In football, boys and girls can not play on the same team and these are the rules of FIFA. And do not make me talk about who, when they discovered that it was really a girl, they let her keep playing ...! Secondly, players can not paint their faces with colors and play like that, once again the rules of FIFA are not mine. <br /> <br /> and they did not start me in the way they scored goals, it was ridiculous, completely unrealistic. and all the players seemed not to know Jack about football. <br /> <br /> and when the duke was training Viola, why did they just concentrate on shooting what happened with the pass and the dribble? Or was he firing his only problem? And why on earth were all the posters on the wall of his room for the Chelse players? Do not other players like other teams? It was as if this was the only team they knew ...! but other than that, the movie was good and I enjoyed the rest, just the training and the game scenes were not realistic for me. They really should have consulted someone about them ...!
