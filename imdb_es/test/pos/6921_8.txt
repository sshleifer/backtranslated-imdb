I'll tell you what was excellent. Dylan Moran is simply the funniest actor on the screen (and on stage) and with Micheal Caine as his partner is not bad either, both are great to see them in a really fun movie. It is true, not all gags are removed, but it is worth staying with those who do, but it does have Micheal Caine with a dress (worth the total cost of the entry) and every time that Dylan Moran appears in the screen, it looks more like Bernard. black movie. The story is about two actors (Moran and Caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters acting different characters to deceive them all, but getting away with it is a different matter. basically "the actors" is a great British comedy that somehow was missed by many, seriously if you are Moran fan (or want to see Micheal Caine in a dress) definitely see this
