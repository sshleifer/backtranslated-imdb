If you like Cagney you will like this movie. It has the pretext of American integrity at any cost, personal or social. Cagney plays the head of weights and measures in New York. Cagney confronts crooked politicians, the underground criminal, a prominent philanthropist and simple shopkeepers who add a few ounces to the price of a chicken. The chicken scene is hilarious where Cagney finds a weight placed in the cavity of the birds by an unsuspecting butcher. The chicken is thrown around the store in a hilarious scene about who controls the "evidence". If you like old phones, there are interesting scenes of dials, telephones and even strange telephone cables. Compared to a lot of movies made today, this is pure entertainment and includes mystery with comedy and a message that says that honesty must be, above all, the guiding principle of humanity. Done in simpler times, it reflects a world that we can not find today. Fashion (especially hats), outwear and automobiles play a prominent visual role in the definition of this little film.
