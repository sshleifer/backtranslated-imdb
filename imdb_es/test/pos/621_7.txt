Mute Witness is a modest but very solid thriller that never received the attention nor the good comments it deserves. The movie ?? Written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller. It is a tense and action-packed thriller with aspects of black comedy and terror influences. Without mumbo-jumbo senseless or endless twists of plot, directly to the mysterious point. Mute Witness deals with the vicious theme of 'snuff' movies and develops effectively in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** As production costs are cheaper there, a film crew from the United States moves temporarily to Russia to shoot a horror movie. An old hangar is used as the location of the film. The make-up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and, while trying to find a way out, witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff film. She is trapped and tries to escape but, because she is mute, she can not ask for help and can not explain what she saw to the police properly. The girl's life is in real danger now, since there is a whole hidden network behind these tobacco productions and they do not want the witnesses to be alive. *** End Spoilers ***. Mute Witness contains multiple highly exciting action sequences and is quite bloody. Some of the mysterious clues are kept secret until the end. Regarding the similar theme, I would say that it is definitely better than the most famous '8 mm', directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage. The performance in Mute Witness is not great, but the main actress (who is also Russian) looks very cute. Sir Alec Guinness also makes a special appearance. And a very good one, I can say. Surely recommended with guaranteed fun and fears.
