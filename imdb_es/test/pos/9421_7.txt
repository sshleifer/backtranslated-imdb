Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson respectively, the second of the Universal series, where it is again established by means of a written prologue that the famous detective is legendary and extends in time. This helps set things up comfortably here in the "current" era of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> In this offer, Holmes goes through a few different disguises (with Rathbone's very salient features, it's likely that people would not really recognize his true identity?) since he protects a physicist from the hands of the Nazis, as well as Professor Moriarty (now played by Lionel Atwill), the best nemesis of Holmes. The scientist has developed a bomb visor that will help a lot in aerial bombardment, and he promised his plans to the British. But Moriarty wants to seize him so he can sell them to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> A good entry prompted a little by the participation of Atwill, now evil and evil, now played as Moriarty (although George Zucco was not left behind). himself in THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES). It is always intriguing to see Holmes and his greatest enemy engage in witty jokes together ("the needle to the end, eh, Holmes?").
