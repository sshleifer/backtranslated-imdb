I hope that, from his seat in the comic throne of Heaven, Spike Milligan can see and enjoy this movie, since Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy took a book that the author himself said that writing it "almost drove me crazy" in a joy of seeing . <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the Irish city of Puckoon and the problems that arise when the division between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, working its way through the center of the village and, More worrying, through the middle of the cemetery. This means that some dead, buried in the Catholic cemetery, are now in the Protestant north, and so the local priest, assisted by a variety of eccentric premises, aims to push back the bodies of darkness and thus avoid the British bureaucracy. border guards. <br /> <br /> It inspired the work of choosing the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes to play the role of Madigan. He brings an innocence to the role, especially in his pieces for the camera (which is usually where he interacts with the voice-over of Richard Attenborough, supposedly playing the writer / director of the film). Daragh O'Malley, who plays Father Rudden, is also worthy of considerable praise; and the rest of the cast, from household names like Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones to people with what would normally be called "small parts," such as Spike's daughter, Jane, who plays Madigan's wife, gives 100 %. It is not small, to the wonderful characterizations given by Spike in the original book. <br /> <br /> I could argue that the film is a bit too long, or that the Irish accent of Elliott Gould left a bit to be desired, but it would be only minor points and would not take away from the excellence of this film.
