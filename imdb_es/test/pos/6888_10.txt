I love the Promised Land. The first episode I saw was while I was on my 2003-2005 mission. I really loved the rich family background represented in the show. Here there was a family with struggles of their own, but instead of dwelling on them; They would come with love to other people who may have had the same problems, in an effort to forget about themselves and go to work. This is what made me fall in love with the show. All the actors; especially Gerald McRaney; I had demonstrated the true meaning of "Family", which has left an indelible mark on my life. I have traveled the same path as them, but it took me a long time to develop that kind of character. I love this show so much, that I wanted to share it with friends; but I was really shocked when I heard it was taken off the air. I thought and I still think that they should bring it back! So many lives can benefit from the means inspired by heaven. I sincerely believe that this show was divinely inspired; Because it brings the spirit every time I see a single episode. This show really (in my book) has really defined what a "Promised Land" is. It is the Love that you have in your heart for others; which takes you to a higher destination. The spirit of love is one of the most powerful messages in this series, and all I can say is: "Give it back". -Robert
