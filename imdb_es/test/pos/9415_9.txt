One funny thing I will say from the top, is that I am not the biggest fan of Seisun Suzuki. In fact, I have seen a good number of his works (thanks to a retrospective that the film festival had) and his films seemed too small to me as Yakuza, for my taste. Then, I entered the Princess Raccoon, distrusting what I was going to see. Boy! I was out of combat! 'Raccoon' is Suzuki's attempt for a musical, using the elements of Japanese opera mixed with many modern elements (both auditory and visual), Raccoon is a pleasure from start to finish. The main actor, Joe Ogdari, proves that he is one of the best actors in Japan in this role. I must admire that younger Japanese actors still play roles that take place in Japan from feudal times and dress in samurai clothes to achieve maximum effect. The story itself becomes a bit confusing, if you do not follow it closely, but even if you do not, get ready for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has.
