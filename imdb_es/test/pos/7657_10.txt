This is not "direct cinéma", in fact it is its opposite. The second installment of the gypsy trilogy by filmmaker Gatlif, this French play produced by Michèle Ray-Gavras, is a masterpiece of the film, not a documentary, nor fiction in any way. Instead, Gatlif has chosen different places on the route from India to Spain, where the Roma have a strong presence and, with the help of art directors, has organized several musical numbers that tell us how live, sing, dance and fight gypsies and they have survived. The film may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the Rom tribe is of Indian origin, mostly questioned by those who see a direct link to the Hebrews (so, somehow, it's not surprising that they have also been persecuted by the Nazis.) But above any anthropological argument, this is a work of great beauty, strong colors and wonderful songs and dances.
