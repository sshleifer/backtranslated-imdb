I saw this movie as part of the Midnite Madness in Sitges. Established in the eighteenth century in England, the plot covers the life of Arthur Blake from his first departure as an apprentice of grave robber to his final confession on the eve of his execution. <br /> <br /> The plot progresses through a series of misadventures in which Arthur and his partner encounter various unpleasant characters and strange situations. <br /> <br /> The first thing that catches the attention of this film is the precision with which they managed to capture the aspect of the horrors of the Hammer period: the atmosphere is ready. with a lot of cemeteries full of fog, scenes of rambunctious taverns and an excellent set design. <br /> <br /> For a movie titled I Sell the Dead, I expected the emphasis to be mostly on terror. Do not get me wrong, there are some moments of nerves and gore, but the tone is very funny, driven by the situations in which the characters get into and their dialogue. The closest comparison to the scenes between the two protagonists (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the interaction of the character seen in the classic English comedies Only Fools and Horses, Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise. <br /> <br /> The performance is strong and the cast of very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm elevates the film above many of those seen in Sitges. <br /> <br /> In general, the film offers something very different from the current crop of dominant horror. And it will leave a smile on your face.
