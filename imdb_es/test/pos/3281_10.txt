Trey's favorite since the first race of season 10 and also one of my personal favorites, Manbearpig presents the adventure of Al Gore before going into global warming and before the movie, it was a similar adventure, Al Gore was also trying to to realize the world about something that can change the Earth, something really dangerous, this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig, Al Gore had only one thing in mind: to know all the Manbearpig and kill them! Al Gore here is more than funny, all those who see him feel sorry for him and yes, they can be childish, making tantrums since nobody believes him, but he's just a demented son of a bitch. Basically, four children are trapped in a cave due to Al Gore, but he certainly does not have that in mind, there is no room for any other topic, it is only Manbearpig that concerns Al Gore. Those four children are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan. Basically, Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and the four children were only playing in the Al Gore game. they are just children, damn Manbearpig. ") So in this part we have, on the one hand, all the things with the rescue team that also sympathize with Al Gore and, on the other hand, we have an episode of Cartman not much fun but not We are surprised Cartman attitude after he finds a treasure inside the cave, certainly everything related to this treasure is fantastic and it is great because you will see a Cartman sick in both directions, is really sick for children and really sick for And in the end Al Gore kills Manbearpig! This character is fantastic and I am cereal! Fun fun in this episode, a highly re-observable 10 of the 10
