I have just seen Nightbreed for the first time since I saw him in the theater almost 20 years ago, and although I remember that I liked it at that moment, I do not remember having been dragged by it as it was today. I really can not complain about anything in this movie. Craig Scheffer is excellent as the main character of Boone. I never understood why he has not had a more successful career, because most of his first jobs are outstanding. As good as Scheffer is, Cronenberg is even better. His interpretation of the psycho Dr. Decker is unforgettable and steals the show. The rest of the cast, which includes Doug Bradley, is very good, except for the ridiculous about the redneck sheriff. The images are good, and in some shots great. Danny Elfman's composite score is as good as it is, and among his best works. The ending was epic, with uninterrupted action for about twenty minutes. In general, Nightbreed is a great achievement for Clive Barker, and it is located as my favorite of his films, a bit ahead of Hellraiser. 9/10
