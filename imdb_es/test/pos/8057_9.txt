To see the fictitious biography "The Phenix City Story", I claim, is to enter fields where American filmmakers rarely venture, director Phil Karlson got his job as director of the television series "The Untouchables" TV based mainly on " Kansas City Confidential "and this movie; and it has become one of the most admired and most imitated films ever made. The rarest feat for US filmmakers UU It seems to be the movie or series of television against crime, centered on the hero; I remind the viewer how the producers of "Cain's Hundred" and "Hardcastle and McCormick" and even "The Untouchables" had to work to produce everything but episodes largely dedicated to the non-fictional activities of criminals rather than those of your criminals. ethical opponents. This powerful, seminal and very rough film has its own style; and his lesson seems to be the attention to detail about opponents and victims of criminal organizations, as well as members of their gangs. There is a twelve minute prelude to the film, in which the reporter Clete Roberts interviews the true participants of the city of Alabama who had fought against their corrupt gangs. The problem arose from the presence of Fort Benning across the river and the existence of almost a century of vices in the area. The film details the return of John Patterson from Germany, where he has been a prosecutor. His father, defeated by the attorney general of Alabama, refuses to join his search for the 14th street directors despite several provocations, including the beating of his son, avenged by Patterson against his tormentor. There are several well-developed characters, including Ellie, who works in one of the clubs and his honest boyfriend, the union leader, the Pattersons and John's wife, Ed Gage, the operatives of the lords and Zeke Ward, a black man honest. victimized by their opposition to them. The cinematography of Harry Neumann and the artistic direction of Stanley Fleischer are in B / W and are very similar to the news and movies, which adds to the realistic power of the film. The music of Harry Sukman contributes to the film effectively. The writer Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur produced a quick and direct story that is divided into parts. The first part illustrates the rule of the rulers from within one of their clubs, showing the fate of a victim who is beaten and then picked up by the police in the pay of the Mafia. In the second part, Albert Patterson refuses to oppose the leader of the mafia, the intelligent Rhett Tanner. In the third part, the young Patterson returns and, after several incidents, including the fact of having to hit the mafia thug to get revenge for his own beating, decides to take care of his father as state attorney general. His wife is horrified; and the mafia kills the daughter of Zeke Ward and throws the body in the house of Patterson with a warning that their children will be next. A few other incidents, including the loss of a trial in which the Pattersons demonstrated that the thug killed a friend of his who had found the car involved in the girl's murder, and note that the investigation declares accidental death, convince Patterson runs, and he wins the Democratic nomination statewide despite the statist tactics of the mafia, and is killed immediately. John Patterson prevents a crowd of vigilantes from starting an open war with the 14th Street mafia and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law from Phenix City. The clubs are closed and the equipment confiscated, but not before the child inside is murdered by the mafia thug, and Zeke Ward must stop Patterson from killing Tanner instead of handing him over to the law. The end of the drama is optimistic; but the forecast for the town is less optimistic than the painted one; In fact, the mafia tried to return and then moved to Tennessee. In this well-acted classic of crime-themed films, Richard Kiley is young but very strong as Patterson, interpreting it without an accent. John Mcintyre as his father is very good, while Edward Andrews as Boss Tanner is the prize caliber. Others in the cast include Kathryn Grant as the girl from the interior, Ellie, Jean Carson and Kathy Marlowe as the mafia, John Larch as his bully, Biff Mcguire as the young victim, James Edwards as Zeke Ward, Lenka Peterson as the wife of John, and Some actors of good character as settlers and mafia bosses. It's hard to suggest enough about the realism and lack of posture in this movie; It is undoubtedly one of the best management efforts of Phil Karlson. Karlson also did "The Scarface Mob" and then also "Walking Tall". A serious and inspiring look at the ease with which complacent citizens of a democracy of public interest can accept tyranny, and how a few honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights.
