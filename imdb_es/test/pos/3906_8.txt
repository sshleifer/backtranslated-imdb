I remember seeing this movie when it came out as a t.v. Movie of the week in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen this movie in more than 30 years, I remember how creepy it was ... the body of the sister in the basement, the storm outside, the creepy house without electricity and a murderer still on the premises. <br /> <br /> They just do not make TV Movies like this one anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underestimated actress and I liked not only in "Betwitched", but in several of her post-Bewitched roles, like this one and 1975 "The Legend of Lizzie Borden". <br /> <br /> I really want someone to come out with a DVD that has several of the TVs of the 70s Movie of the Week on a DVD. Would not it be amazing to see "When Michael calls," "Bad Ronald," "Do not be afraid of the dark," "Crowhaven Farm," etc., all on one DVD? I know there is a market for a DVD like this for all the baby boomers that we grew up in the sixties and seventies. Maybe, if we're lucky, someday someone will offer us a DVD with a great selection of t.v. movies like this
