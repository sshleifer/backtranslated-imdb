No one said that on "The Big Trail" and I thought it would be natural. However, this was one of the best westerns I've seen and I'm a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies. The scope and feel of this image is simply amazing and, as someone mentioned in his commentary, it has the feel of the 3-camera triptych of "Napoleon" (1927). Today, the cost of production and, especially, the cast of thousands, would be prohibitive, but Raoul Walsh did it. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent, although John Wayne was better when he had no lines and just swirled around. In particular, Tyrone Power, Mr. was a perfect villain: I had never seen him before and this was his only image that spoke. Ian Keith was a snake, but The Brendel is an acquired taste like comic relief. It can be funny or annoying, but it's mostly the last thing, and it appears at the most inappropriate times. <br /> <br /> It's a little too long and the Indians took a while to appear, but this is as close to a documentary about Manifest Destiny and as true to life as you'll see, and a must-see for fans of movies, regardless of gender preference. When the settlers arrived in California, I was exhausted.
