I have never read a novel by Jacqueline Susann, but I have also seen Valley of the Dolls, based on another of her books. On both occasions, I thought that the movie is probably better than the book and it will improve even more with age (certainly unlike books). The reason is that a film focuses more on a specific style of fashion, design and behavior patterns. And in this aspect The Love Machine offers a lot. The scenery fits perfectly with the story. And all the characters fit, too. They are perfect in the way they complete a well-balanced general image. They are superficial and do not develop, it is true, but in this film I would not like it to be different. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings takes up the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a scam. He is a fashion photographer, he looks visibly aged and seems to start going to the seed. Robert Ryan retakes the role he played in Caught by Max Oph√ºl, it is Smith Ohlrig once again, greedy, bored and bored, without inspiration and without inspiration. It is possible that Ryan did not want to be in this image and act accordingly, on the other hand, he could have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. No matter what happens, it fits the image. Dyan Cannon is great (a fantastic wardrobe!), Dominates all the scenes she is in and is involved in the two highlights of the film: the burning of a luxury bed and the fall of the character of Hemmings with a Academy Award statuette. <Br /> <br /> The title, The Love Machine, is, of course, ironically. Robin Stone is a kind of Barry Lyndon from the pop era (by the way, the film IS a little kubrickysh). That he chooses a TV station to reach the top seems to be a mere coincidence. He sees love (that is, sexual favors) simply as a means to personal progress. There are quite terrifying indications of a problematic sexuality that are not explored in the film. Homosexuality is treated very lightly, probably not the standard for the most important films of the time. The open cynicism of TV executives should not fear comparison with other good films on the subject, such as A Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show. They are producing garbage, they agree with each other that it is crap and they know that they are going to make a lot of money with it. <br /> <br /> I did not regret having spent 108 minutes with this movie and I would not be surprised if it acquired a cult following, provided it was given the opportunity (ie, a DVD release).
