For many, the hit series was ten years of black humor loaded with affectionate parodies of classic movies and a hilarious variety of more than a hundred characters with instantly recognizable slogans. Few programs have survived the transition from radio to television, to the stage, to the cinema, but the League of Knights has achieved it with a proper aplomb. <br /> <br /> The talented writers / interpreters had initially planned a medieval adventure in the style of Monty Python, but as soon as they started writing, they soon realized that the characters they had lived with had become very real and deserved better. With that, the people of Royston Vasey realize that their existence is under threat, as the writers decide to ignore the fictional city and work on a seventeenth-century game instead. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Michael Sheen playing a lot in the invisible league. Jeremy Dyson member, The League plays rather unpleasant caricatures of his real-life characters, as well as the familiar faces of Tubbs ("I did a little fishy brown"), sexual predator-inducing nightmare Herr Lipp, butcher Hilary Briss and an unlikely hero - furious The businessman Geoff Tibbs. The new faces appear when the third reality appears, this is where we treat the charming and funny cameos of veteran actors and popular television stars. For many, these will be about 90 minutes really nice. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalpse is not going to please everyone. Work at this level of postmodernism has been done several times before and may seem too familiar to audiences angry about the successes of irony-ridden teenagers initiated by people like Wes Craven who has a New Nightmare. It also takes a lot of confidence in an audience to keep up with a high concept story, so there are moments of exposure and dialogue that only serve to confirm what most of the audience already knows. Comedy as a genre is a formula, but now it has not been heard that a British film does not rely on the huge catalog of television stars to fill brief amounts of screen time. It is also difficult to believe that the creators wanted to kill their descendants, perhaps that is why the inversion of roles does not always reach normality. Would Hilary Briss have wanted to try to save Royston Vasey in the series? <br /> <br /> However, although the deliciously dark vein of the program has almost completely disappeared, but possibly it is more accessible to her. Much will be said about the development of the character and the efforts to humanize the likes of incarnations of a joke like Herr Lipp. This is where you can find an impossible level of depth along with a stinging satire of biting satire and disposable takedowns. The feeling is there with a lump in the throat but no sugar covered thick enough to intrude into the action. The music is good, the performance is exemplary and the animation is wonderfully perfect; A nice throwback to the work of Terry Gilliam and Ray Harryhausen. In summary, there is much to like about the Apocalypse. Like so many transfers from television to film, it was never easy to find the line between preaching to the converts and introducing the uninitiated into the elegant and distinct voice of the League. But no matter what your preference is, this last trip to the city where 'Never Never Leave' is full of hope and, ultimately, very moving.
