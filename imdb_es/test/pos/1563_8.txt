I just saw this on the cable. I liked. He kept my interest and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple was very good and good at being subtly creepy. The cinematography is not so good, but the video in bad condition also adds to the feeling of realism, so it's an exchange, you know? Sometimes the girl would hit her with the New England accent. The accent of a kind of come and go. Anyway, I thought the movie was well done in general, though. The plot was strong and there was a dramatic tension because you felt that there was a subtle mystery, although things seemed mundane. Good job in a low budget. Another good filmmaker SUNY Purchase. Way to follow.
