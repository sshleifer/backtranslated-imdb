I am surprised that of all the criticisms I have seen, no one has noticed one of the main points of this film, or at least how I saw it. It looks like a great homosexual fantasy, camping clothes, a glorious and naked Fernando, a defined sexual tension between Ariel and Prospero, and like a final climax, a group of men in tight sailor suits dancing the horn. All this approach, once you get used to it, gives you all kinds of fantastic scenes and images. The vision of an innocent Ariel being dragged into an unpleasant Sycorax to execute "his earthly and hated commands" is one of the darkest I've seen in a Shakespeare film. However, by the end of the film, I had grown tired of the style and the dance of the final speaker was too much for me. Still in general it is an interesting interpretation of the work.
