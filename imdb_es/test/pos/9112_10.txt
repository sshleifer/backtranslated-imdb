I'm a big fan of Tenacious D, and I think this is not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining one. It's not a minute of laughter, but that's not what D intended it to be. I went into the movie watching all the HBO shows, I memorized both albums and that made it even more enjoyable. Lots of internal jokes from previous Tenacious D albums, and HBO shows. As I already knew the new album, I knew the 40 minutes of the film because it is a musical comedy. I would say that it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. Definitely. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie now!
