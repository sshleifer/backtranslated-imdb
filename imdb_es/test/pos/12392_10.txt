François Truffaut, young man of the "Cahiers du cinema", main bastion of the so-called New Wave, made a great show of hating this film and even accused him of dragging French cinema to mediocrity. Translation: Truffaut, who was sexually repressed, was already jealous of the way Carné could make a great success of a story that pressed all the right buttons of her audience and involved her in something important with all the trappings and seduction of the sensuality. In other words, where the general public and many critics saw a perceptual sociological analysis wrapped in a beautiful film, Truffaut saw "Girls on the Loose." <br /> <br /> Carné, after all, had everything that the New Wave would lack: intelligence, refinement, humor, a great talent as a narrator, a great ear for dialogue, a dazzling technical brilliance, ability to make his actors do what he wanted them to do, and a good dose of good taste. In comparison, Truffaut is a provincial drilling that has nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Tragic 1950s remake of "Pride and Prejudice", the French response to "Rebel Without a Cause", an updated version of "Children of Paradise", "Les Tricheurs" tells a story of young people disgruntled Parisians who have been lost in an environment of existentialism, sexual liberation and lack of respect for traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics perceived the opinion of Carné on the subject as the moralizing inclination of an "older person", while I think that what happened, on the contrary, is that Carné, being gay and knowing one or two things about the repression, it felt like something untold. sympathy for iconoclastic young people in their history. In addition, being a French film, there is no doubt that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, something that had yet to be deciphered in American films such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One." <br /> <The young people of Carné are all extremely beautiful, elegant, smart, spontaneous and intelligent. They are gods and goddesses. They drive the latest Vespas and the right cars. The cut of their suits, dresses and jackets was a highlight of the fashions of the last century. His haircuts are still stuck on the wall of his local hairdresser. The shape of their body, which they achieved and maintained effortlessly, remains the modern western ideal. They listen to the best jazz musicians. Can they move, be sexy and make love? even though the pill has not yet been invented. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are defined by the gang code and their own heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and commit a sin of romantic love. The only bad thing about them is that their elders do not speak to them and vice versa. The incidents that are shown in this film have many languages ​​that are debated for a long time in France about the amorality and nihilism of young people, while making it a great public and critical success. <br /> <br /> This film is very elegant and beautiful, I suspect that the older viewers who saw it wished they could be like the people shown in the film and a few young filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers like Truffaut developed a bad case of jaundice that reflects how they could never make a movie as sexy or popular as this, although they would be very good to finally aim at the nihilistic bits. On the other hand, given a certain cliché aspect of the script (amorous misunderstanding that leads to a medical emergency), one can only be surprised by the horribly pious and puritanical mishmash that the Americans would have extracted from the same basic script if they had dared to address the problem . Affair. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film was filmed in the same basic places as the American musical "Funny Face" a year earlier. Where Hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of the Rive Gauche and existentialism, Carné restored its tragic and ironic dimension. Watch this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
