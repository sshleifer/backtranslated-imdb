I think I share the same psychological perspective of the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, but we share a synthetic mind: the world is not empty of metaphysics in the midst of total coincidence. Barely governed by man or perhaps by a poet and prime minister, so that as a social and cultural "low pressure area", Poland could play the role it played in World War II, being critical of Jews but often no less critical with oneself. There is innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's worldview, like symbols in Catholicism: the white Virgin against the black Madonna. In Rouge, the Black Madonna is the one the judge fell in love with as a young man. The flashbacks are magically and realistically intertwined with the present, although they are totally casual, as the camera simply swings to the other side of the street or the red jeep of the then young judge who passes by the young woman's car after that she accidentally hit her dog. That we jump through time in those same camera movements, is what we get later. His love had no answer, so his life was not as he had planned. He lost his ability to love other people and animals. Being a judge, he feels that he is really spying on other people's lives and when he retires, he just keeps on doing it, spying on his neighbors this time. The innocence and sense of rectitude of the younger woman (literally) who accidentally enters her life, gives her back her good judgment and it is through her that she spontaneously confesses her espionage behavior to her neighbors and the police, accepting and even clinging to she. Stones consequently thrown through their windows. In the process, the story is repeated between this man and the woman he loves, although this time he is old and the woman is not the same. Kieslowski could have fought with this part because the old judge is his alter ego, and it is said that Iratne Jacob infatuated him. Both women play the same essential role in their psychology, of the only (!) That possesses their heart and soul and, therefore, can do or break it, even as an elder! It is as if the 'powers in the air' were or God was joining them. The coincidences are * also * casual to be casual or even good luck. There must be some mystical, supernatural or theological source that influences these profoundly unfathomable life decisions. The study book fell and opened on the page the question of the exam is another example of this. Or at the moment when the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman, the wind outside the opera house suddenly closes the doors and breaks the windows. The gigantic image of the young woman predicts that of television, after the drowning accident on her trip through the Canal. These moments are accentuated effectively through the human voice of the liturgy or what sounds like that (Van den Budenmayer).
