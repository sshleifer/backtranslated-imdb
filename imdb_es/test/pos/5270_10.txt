I consider this film as one of the most interesting and fun films of all time. He has so many highly intelligent thoughts, that anyone who thinks the film is horrible did not understand it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it (in all 3 of Schneider's films) without a doubt. Several universities in Germany and throughout Europe have conducted studies on how to see things Schneider. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and one of the jazz music in Germany (maybe Europe). It is mainly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So, if you do not like it, that's fine, but please, do not try to convince others that it could be stupid, cheap, boring or not fun. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you were willing to study the art of H. Schneider, you would have to "surrender".
