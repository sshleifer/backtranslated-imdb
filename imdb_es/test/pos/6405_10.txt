It is a pity that this wonderful place on the small screen bright had so much talent in writers and actors, a scenario so wonderful that it was the last escapism for those who were in a closed land, in a state of sun deprivation. Many of the actors went on to bigger things ... another indicator that there was something wonderful that was unfortunately lost. I lived in Columbus, Ohio at that time, with all the great family of my (now ex) husband in a chorus of "NO NO !!" every time it would be taken up by a baseball game. <br /> <br /> Someone who wrote here mentioned that he was facing 'Rosanne' ... ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ Everything is what I wrote here he mentioned that he was against "Rosanne" ... Yes, FOX really wasted something wonderful that one and nothing will ever equal ~! Thanks for the memories of it.
