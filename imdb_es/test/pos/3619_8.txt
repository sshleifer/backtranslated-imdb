As is often the case when you try to take a book of more than 400 pages and put it in a two-hour movie, you lose a lot. Here the director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) assumes an extremely ambitious project and almost succeeds. What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that somehow seems incomplete. <br /> <br /> There is a lot about this movie that is wonderful and fantastic. The cinematography of John Toll (Director of Photography for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winner of the Oscars for both) is splendid. Working with Madden, the options for the places on the Greek island of Kefallonia are excellent and the visual images that are obtained by photographing these majestic places with variable light are exuberant and beautiful. Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, which gives the city an authentic feel. The soundtrack is also fantastic and the passages and mandolin voices of the Italian soldiers are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Madden does an excellent job bringing us the Italian occupation and romance, which occupies most of the film. . There are numerous sweet and fun moments throughout this segment. However, when the drama of the battle is ready to unfold, there is not much film left on the reel and this component is extremely hasty and abbreviated. While the battle scenes are well done, after the battle it is obvious that more and more compromises are being made to prevent the film from running for too long. When we get to post-war scenes, the treatment is simply skeletal. Another negative aspect is that the DVD is particularly lacking in features. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is charming in romantic leadership as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing instead of fight. When he has to fight, Cage changes without problems to a man of fierce principle and resolution and, in some way, remains credible in both people. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, offers an uninspired performance like Pelagia. In part, this is because Cage dominates the screen, but Cruz seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. She allows the character to be objectified as Corelli's love interest instead of establishing her as a powerful character in her own right. <br /> <br /> John Hurt gives a fantastic performance like that of a wise doctor, who knows a lot about humans. Nature as medicine. However, Christian Bale seems a bit upset and rigid as Pelagia's fianc√©. <br /> <br /> I qualified this movie with an 8/10. Despite some drawbacks, this is a moving movie that is worth seeing. Photography alone is worth the price of admission.
