For a movie like this, there's always something to follow in the next few years. Clive Barker, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is partly Gothic, partly mythological and all horror in the middle. "Nightbreed" are a group of mutants that only come out at night and go through the place called Midian. Now, a man named Boone (Craig Sheffer) says he suffers hallucinations and goes to this psychiatric Dr. Decker (David Croneberg) who "helps" Boone with his problems. Unaware of this situation, Decker claims to be a purist who only likes hatred in disguise. Boone, however, enters Midian and states that he is one of the mutants there. But a mutant named Peloquin (Oliver Parker) sees Boone as flesh! However, his bite saves Boone, so after he was killed by a gun, he is now one of them. After being tricked by Decker, Boone goes to great lengths to protect Lori (Anne Bobby) from him. Lori saves a mutant from the sun and, in return, helps others as well. I liked the mutant lady, one that gives her a "kiss of death" full of smoke, and the porcupine woman who dreamed of Boone to demonstrate her power that is so seductive and deadly at the same time. I have enjoyed this horror movie all the time, and the rule is that you never trust a shrink. Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars!
