This is the best role of Kellie Martin underestimated. Based on a true story, it tells the story of Fusia's attempt to save members of the Diamant family and other Jews he knows over time. One of my favorite scenes of all time includes a heroic act of the little sister of Fusia. All children should see this scene. Models of this type are very few and far between. The film is well written and performed. I am a lover of the movie and this film qualified with a 10 in the imbd rating system. It is in my 25 best films of all time and should be published on video. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
