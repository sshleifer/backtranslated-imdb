This film is what most of the industry has forgotten how to do: family entertainment, that is, something that is enjoyable for people of all ages. This Wallace & Gromit in particular can be enjoyed by everyone, from small children who like colors and cute bunnies to their grandparents who understand the references of adults. <br /> <br /> This movie has an address as good as the one I've seen, and I mean it literally. It is also full of small snippets of humor, and each scene has so many comic details in the background that I will have to buy them, if only to read all the posters and prospects in the world of W & G. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this movie at least twice more in theaters and then buy it on DVD. You should also see it.
