I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I consider it one of the best of all. I just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a business trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed and then I asked the stewards to play again and they did it. Thanks AA. The performance of the whole team is first class and especially of Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but of all the actors, in fact, the acting is excellent. I love the whole cast, they are very funny. There is a great advantage in the King of Queens that I love and rarely seen in today's television comedy. Both Leah and Kevin play so well that every situation is believable and fun. I just bought the second season while I was in Az this week and I intend to buy the full game the next time I'm in the USA. UU My son who is 20 years old also loves this show and his brilliance is that he has the magic to reach different generations. I would like to thank everyone involved in this amazing program. It is very appreciated to see this type of television programs in what, in my opinion, is a time of poor television fair in general these days, with the exception of the repetitions of Seinfeld and others. like ... Thanks for a great show ..
