This is one of the most outstanding horror movies I've seen in my life. Forget the exorcist and all the other exaggerated horror movies that exist. John Carpenter made an epic of horror with great force with excellent performances by Kurt Russell and his extraordinary special effect and a great soundtrack that will pursue you forever. The best thing about this movie after 17 years is that it has no date, it looks fresh and new and you do not get many movies like this one. In 1982, this was against E.T. and, of course, it became a box office bomb. Over the years, THE THING followed the worship of video and television sales and so many new fans. In the end, this film gives a good blow and for me, as it never gets lost, it's an advantage to scare you and for me that's a horror movie. Long live John Carpenter!
