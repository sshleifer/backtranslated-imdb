My original title for this review was to be: "End disappointments, the movie triumphs". But I actually thought about this on the way home. It is not the fairy tale most of these films, they take turns to be different and, although their ending is initially disappointing, it sinks slowly and hits the core in a satisfying tone. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a man named James Aaron (Jeff Garlin of Curb Your Enthusiasm, who also wrote and directed) a troubled actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and deals so much with his obesity as of his inability to find someone to love. <br /> <br /> Yes, it sounds corny, but you experiment with elements that make it unpredictable, and it actually makes you want it to be longer. The end came abruptly and made me say: "Is that all?" But once it starts to charge its toll, it really makes you smile. <br /> <br /> It has many seriousness tones at all times, but do not fear, because it is also very fun. Some scenes offer great laughs, and those who have seen Jeff Garlin's stand-up will recognize a couple (mainly when giving a speech on the day of their niece's kindergarten class and the bombs). Start with a serious note that you do not expect, but what follows is fun, entertaining and quite moving too. It's the kind of movie you're still watching and that you always enjoy. And as I said before, while the ending may seem absurd at first, once you take some time to think, it's real joy.
