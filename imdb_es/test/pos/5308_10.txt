The United States of Leland was an incredible movie. I kept going through my TV guide without knowing what it was and without having the opportunity to sit there and get into it. Then, one morning, when I got up early, I saw that it was about to begin. So I decided to look at it. I had the time and interest to see it. When I saw that Ryan Gosling was in the movie and then that he was the main character, I was immediately absorbed and could not move from my couch. The struggle that Leland is going through is such an inspiring story. Everyone has to deal with the same kind of thoughts throughout some moment of their life, be it a small detail or something as big as what is happening. I have to sit down and watch the movie again just to see all the things that I missed the first time. As a general comment ... I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Gosling fan or anyone who likes a good movie with a good real story. The fact that there are so many other great stars that have also had excellent performances is just an additional BONUS! So do what you can to see this movie, I can almost be sure it will not be a waste of time.
