'Doppleganger', (or 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as it is more commonly known) was written (with contributions by the late Donald James) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their television 'Supermarionation'. 'Thunderbirds'. <br /> <br /> The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun and proposes that a manned flight be sent there. The committee resists at an exorbitant cost and files the project. But when a security leak is discovered in the agency, fearing that the Russians will arrive first, the project receives a green light. <br /> <br /> US astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) joins British scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry). After weeks of exhausting training, the Phoenix take off and head for the unknown. <br /> <br /> Three weeks later, his ship crashes in what appears to be a mountainous and gloomy landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is seriously injured. You see a light moving towards them ... I'll leave the synopsis here. Up to this point, the film has been exciting, with excellent special effects (by Derek Meddings) and music by the resident composer of Anderson, Barry Gray (why it has not been aired in C.D. is a mystery). But when Ross and Kane land, and we discover the secret of the alien world: it is a duplicate of ours, everyone in it is the same, the only important difference is that things are reversed, it becomes less interesting and it ends. With an anti-climax shredder. I think the cinema was the wrong place to make this idea, in fact, Gerry and Sylvia later did something similar on their show 'Space: 1999'. Ross risks (and eventually loses) his life in an effort to return to Earth, his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar that it might not have bothered. <br /> <br /> Roy Thinnes had recently made the television series 'The Invaders', and offers a competent performance (it's a pity that there are no more scenes like the one where he spends with his wife). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but he disappears from the story too soon. Several actors appeared in the '' U.F.O. 'of the Anderson. like Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and miss Nicholas Courtney ('The Brigadier' ​​from 'Dr.Who' on a small piece of paper). But the honors act for the late Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', head of Eurosec. The character is not far from 'Sir John Wilder', the one who played in 'The Power Game' by A.T.V. Webb is such a cunning character that it's wonderful to see. The contribution of Herbert Lom (as a spy with a hidden camera in a false eye) is little more than a cameo. <br /> <br /> As I said, the special effects are wonderful, as are the sets. So it's worth watching the movie, but do not expect it to happen much once the action moves to the mirror planet. With a more solid script, this could have been another 'Planet of the Apes' or, dare I say it, '2001: A Space Odyssey'. <br /> <br /> In Anderson's productions, he made the future look like a Great Place, an adventure park where science was great, everyone had luxurious cars whose doors opened vertically, attractive women, and absolutely No suggestion that something is wrong in the world. Now we are in the future and people are still watching 'Coronation Street' every two nights. What a disappointment If a mirror of the Earth really exists somewhere, you expect it to be a better place than this. If all the women look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I'll be on the next flight!
