"Plots With A View" from 2002 is a charming little comedy that only the British could do. The film's sense of humor is slightly morbid and black and yet very friendly and, at times, very slapstick-ish. It's the only film by director Nick Hurran that I've seen so far, and although I do not intend to watch any of his other films at the moment (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), it's very enjoyable and fun. very funny. The film takes place in a small town in Wales, where Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn) is married to the city's biggest drunkard and adulterer (Robert Pugh). The local mortician Boris (Alfred Molina) has been desperately in love with Betty since childhood, but has always been too shy to confess his love. In addition to being desperately in love, Boris has other problems, since the eccentric American mortician Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) opened a flourishing business at the funeral in the same city ... The strange British wit of the film should entertain everyone with meaning . of humor, and the story sometimes becomes quite strange. In addition, "Plots With A View" benefits from a wonderful cast. Brenda Bethlyn, who already proved to be a fun lady in "Saving Grace" in 2000, is the protagonist and, once again, she is very funny and very kind in her role. Alfred Molina, who plays his shy admirer, offers a great performance as always, and Robert Pugh fits perfectly in the role of Betty's evil husband. The beautiful Naomi Watts is also excellent as the "secretary" of the husband. I am becoming a bigger fan of every movie I see. However, the most important role is that of the incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors). Walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric marticist who organizes funerals that are quite unorthodox. In general, "Plots With A View" is a very entertaining British comedy that I highly recommend.
