Have not you played the game? Do not bother This is for Final Fantasy VII fans who beat the game, and no one else will appreciate this rare gem of a movie. Do you want to see it and love it? Buy the game, beat it and then look at it. When was the last time you saw an excellent movie based on a video game? Okay, this is all. <br /> <br /> The story takes place two years after the game and no brief summaries are offered to refresh your memory (although I doubt that many would forget it), and go straight to the hour and Adventure of forty-one minutes. <br /> <br /> All your favorite characters are there, including Cait Sith. The voice acting is excellent in the Japanese version, all the characters are released perfectly. The cloud sounds harsh and melancholy, Tifa sounds kind but strong ... Aeris is also perfect, it sounds exactly as I had imagined. Cait Sith sounds less cute than I imagined, but it worked very well. <br /> <br /> The character models are spectacular, excellent textures and lighting. The environments are impressive and the battles are choreographed so that The Matrix blushes. The amazing camera work comes through bicycle chases, for example, where your eyes just scream with satisfaction and your lungs breathe heavily without consent. <br /> <br /> The music is the typical quality of Uematsu, which means it is first class. . Family melodies are reconstructed to accompany Advent Children's graphic jump, which adapts very well to the visual aspects. There is even an internal joke for fans that involves music, it will surely make you smile. <br /> <br /> I did not see it with subtitles since I'm half Japanese, so I can not say that. The subtitles are good. In Japanese, however, the dialogue is very good and each word sounds as if it came from real living beings, not just actors. Awesome. Someday I'll see this again with subtitles to see the differences, since I've played the Japanese and American release of Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, buy this movie The day you go out or pre-order it. If you have not played the game but you want to see this movie very badly, do not waste your time: buy the game, return it and then come back for this DVD. I will not tell you not to watch it, but to play. It will make the experience much better and will not leave you in the dust scratching your head. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends: it's time to start an adventure again with your brave companions!
