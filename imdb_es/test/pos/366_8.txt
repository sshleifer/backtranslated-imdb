This is a well-crafted piece of everyone's favorite suspense master. As usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the time of the film). The first part of the film did not seem very exciting to me, but the last one certainly made up for it with one exciting scene after another. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for the role of Guy Haines. Somehow, I did not find it very credible. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines like the sinister 'bad boy' Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> In general, I would highly recommend it.
