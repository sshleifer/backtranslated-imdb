This mystery / psychological thriller is one of the best I've seen in my life. All actors provide a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who was transformed from the nervous star at first through the strange events of which it is part in the cold star. You learn a lot about the real emotions of the people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself. The film in movie situations at the beginning and during the game played by her "acting coach" is fascinating. Also the music of Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've heard. You will not forget this movie!
