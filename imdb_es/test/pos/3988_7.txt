I totally disagree with the person who commented on this movie for the first time. For me, this story is about a man with a growth hormone disorder who goes to great lengths to find the love he craves. Doing everything possible to fit into the society that did not seem to accept it. <br /> <br /> Then he met someone who treats him with the love of the best friend and was shown the way to receive the love he always wanted. to have. The man who created all that happiness on his return received something important from the giant, which is the love of the family and the spouse. <br /> <br /> and the comedy, is just part of making the audience feel some bugs of laughter in a certain part of the shows. <br /> <br /> and I must admit, it made me tear a little.
