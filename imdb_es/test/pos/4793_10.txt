The theme of religion in Buñuel's films is a point that, as a consumer of films, as an art consumer or as a person, has barely to analyze. One can see a satirical Buñuel in "La Voie Lactée", "Un Chien Andalou" or in "L'Age d'Or". It is very hard and effective in your criticism, but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like "Nazarin", after seeing this work, you begin to be questioned about its author. And much has been questioned about what seems to be a contradiction to Buñuel's thought, but it is better not to call it this way, I think there is no contradiction in his work, only that the point of view of Buñuel's religion is very diverse as unique in the movies. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film is based on the novel by Benito Pérez Galdós, who told us the story of Father Nazario, who lived a simple and humble life dedicated to God and to help everyone. I lived in a simple and poor region. Also lived Beatriz, who is an abused and abandoned wife. She does not find any sense of her life without her violent and macho man. She has a kind of repulsion towards him. On the other side is Andara, one of the village prostitutes. Father Nazario has been stolen again, he blames Andara's cousin. Andara listens to this and tries to fight unsuccessfully with the priest, who does not believe in violence. That night, Andara discovered that her cousin is actually a thief, who stole her buttons. Andara struggles with her cousin with terrible consequences. With this, Andara seeks the mercy of the priest. Nazario decides to help her, knowing well that this could be against her church, obviously this will have some consequences. From here, Nazario is going to be a pilgrim. Without anything, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to be with him, and be like him, to serve God. <br /> <br /> If it's the sweetest Buñuel movie I've seen so far, it's also the most spiritual. Here it is clear that what most confuses people with the contradiction is that here, we do not see a Buñuel against the power of the church, we see a Buñuel whose film is about the church, but not the typical satirical form and cool. . Anyway, I do not think the correct word is a contradiction, actually I find it nice and well done and, despite containing such religious themes (like her "Voie Lactée") I found it more like a spiritual movie but do not try to play in diversity the catholic religion as perhaps he will touch it, and laugh at it in other films. "Nazarin" is from Father Nazario and his perspective, God and the same religion, but all this is analyzed in the spiritual life of this man. <br /> <br /> The other two women are not a Contrast, but as very well two other perspectives of faith. First we have Beatriz, the battered woman, who loses all faith in life, first with her husband and then with a girl who was in her family. This girl was very sick. Next to her was also Andara, the prostitute who runs for justice. In the family of the child, only religious women, there is great pain, but faith becomes Father Nazario when he arrives with nothing in this city. He blesses the child, a word later, she is fine. The priest wants to keep walking, but Beatriz and Andara have regained faith in their lives and want to dedicate their lives to God with Father Nazario. After some complaints, Father Nazario decides to be with them, discovering with some things to the end how he feels with regard to faith, to God, to religion and to the person in need, to the people who must request charity to survive . This last problem should be noted as a possible explanation for the end of the pineapple. In this final we listen to the drums (similar to the one of "L'Age d'Or) and a father Nazario, who asks about these things, when he rejects the fruit for the first time and finally decides to receive it as a symbol of the need or such Once, in response to his spiritual journey, which begins to be a priest, in the meantime, the two women must remove the father, Andara, his crime (Beautiful scene where he thanks a man who helps Father Nazario in jail and then she condemned the man who hit the priest in jail) and Beatriz because he prefers to be with his macho man, even though he treats her badly, just because she does not accept that he falls in love with the priest, Father Nazario - and here is perhaps the place unique in the cinema to criticize the church: to contradict the church, the religion it serves. <br /> <br /> Father Nazario is that, then, it is a (soft for a lot, but not for me) critic for something in religion (Father Nazario helps a woman who is guilty of a crime, of a sin) but above all it is an analysis of faith and life of Buñuel, and really got it, with a beautiful, tender, sweet and unforgettable film, which is, without a doubt, one of his best. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the mistakes. ... well, if there is one.
