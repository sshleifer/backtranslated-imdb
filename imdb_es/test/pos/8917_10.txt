Do not be fooled: this is not another tired example of the girls from outer space who claim to be the French ski team Come to Earth to collect as many sperm as possible, although the synopsis may suggest otherwise. This movie is a jewel, an absolute jewel that has enriched my life from the moment I saw it. Hilarious, exciting, action-packed and surprisingly erotic, "Ach jodel mir noch einen" is a Euro-Madcap Tour-De-Force, a highly underrated Bavarian classic. <br /> <br /> Stop everything you're doing and exhausted to rent, or better yet, BUY this movie immediately.
