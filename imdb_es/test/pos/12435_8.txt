This movie is just lovely. It's fun as hell and as old as the hills. The acting is excellent and it is fascinating to see postwar Britain and how we behaved in those days. This seems to have been a runner prior to the St. Trinians movies (given the connection of Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford, there is also a very young George Cole who appeared in many St. Trinians films) but I do not understand. the connection. It was shown on BBC4 recently after a biography of the creator of St. Trinians Ronald Searle, however, I missed enough of the biography to lose the connection with this movie. Anyway, a great movie in its own right and something that should be preserved forever.
