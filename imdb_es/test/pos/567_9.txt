I saw this movie with my mother. She is 81 years old. She was raised to be an intolerant. She even recognizes this. I do not think she really understood what was happening, she had already decided that the child was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and they remained faithful. That is the true faith. Return to the movie I was disgusted by the police force and its ineptitude. I am very happy that this public defender has been chosen to work in this case. It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person who cared enough to see through the garbage that was given to them. I could tell when one of the cops was lying. I would not look the defender in the eye. His eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished for the color of their skin. I read the book about the black man who was dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I do not remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites doing what they want with blacks. I am sure that the child in the film will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comment from her. I want to congratulate the director and producer of this film. I feel that the exposure they gave to this flagrant injustice was a necessary project. I am an avid indie movie viewer. I feel they are well written and have substance. I'm glad you picked up this movie on the shelf. I felt compelled to write a comment because of how strong I feel about the film and the prejudice that still exists in our modern society.
