The movie of the 1990s with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger is full of praise, and I enjoyed it immensely, but this original TV is just as good and, in a way, more appropriate. Claire Bloom is not a blatant Joy, but she continues to trust and throw her hat to her favorite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of her best performances). <br /> <br /> Calmer, quieter and less emotional. of what Attenborough's film may be, but it does justice to what is a wonderful work full of meaningful dialogues. You will still cry for this version, but maybe you do not have the musical indications to get going. <br /> <br /> There is room for both, and having seen this on stage, I would say that the Ackland / Bloom one is a little more faithful. But both are excellent.
