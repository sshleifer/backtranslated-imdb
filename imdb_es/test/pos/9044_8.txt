This is a 1972 Disney movie. At the moment, I was eleven years old and I enjoyed this movie a lot. Feeling nostalgic, I bought the three DVD series from the Dexter Riley movies and even now, at 46, I still enjoyed them. It was fantasy, magic and clean fun. And it still is! I was not sure which of the three films came first, then second and last. So now I have the official dates. On December 31, 1969, the computer used tennis shoes: on July 12, 1972, now you see it, now you do not see it, on February 6, 1975, the strongest man in the world. I still think that the intermediate film was the best. The special effects were incredible in 1972 for us, the children. I definitely recommend it to all ages.
