A fantastic movie with great Australian talent. Director Mark Lamprell dealt with potentially sobbing topics in a humorous and refreshing way. Definitely the highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival. The veteran of the Australian film, Sam Neill, as always, was fabulous in the role of Frank's university professor and the new talent Matt Newton gave a performance in which people will say "you know, Bert Newton, the father from Matt! " Come out and watch this movie !!!
