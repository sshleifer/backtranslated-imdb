First of all, I would like to say that this movie is the biggest thing that has happened to humanity. It's the best of all the excellent Muppet movies and all the other movies that exist! So BOO-YA for Jim Henson! <br /> <br /> This movie is the first of all Muppet films and the best. (Boo already) It's about a frog (kermit) trying to do in Hollywood. Along with the incredible friends you meet along the way, some of the best songs that have been made and that will become classics are presented, including "the rainbow connection". <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to say that Seeing this The movie was the greatest thing of all! If you have not seen it already, turn off your computer and take it to your nearest video store! (If they do not have the movie muppet, they would demand BIG TIME)
