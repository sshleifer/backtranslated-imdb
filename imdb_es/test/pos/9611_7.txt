Crimson starts with some jazz music, so I liked it immediately, but as the movie progressed I began to wonder if music was not the best part. We have some thieves pulling a jewelry heist and when one does something wrong, the alarm goes off and the police chase them and when the car turns on a blocked street, one of the thieves (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, whoever is here ) gets Shot. Now, it seems he might die, but with the help of a drunken doctor and his mad scientist friend (and wife), he is saved, with a part of the brain of some nightclub owner called "The Sadist". The sadist is unfortunate because the knights who kidnapped him lost his knife to remove his head, so to insult the wound (or, in this case, death), they take off his head with a train, leaving the body to the disposition of the authorities. find, oops. Once the brain transplant is complete, Naschy wants to devastate any woman who approaches him, because now he has the mentality of his donor. Well, of course, all this is quite unlikely and has medical equipment that seems to have been bought at Radio Shack, and in general it's pretty corny and sordid. But it has a good appearance from the early 70's and the music is great. This is not so much a horror movie, but rather a thriller with a lot of bullies fighting on the lawn and babies and other bully-type things, but it's strangely entertaining in a way that I can not begin to describe. 7 out of 10
