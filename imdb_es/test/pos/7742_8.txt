I can not say what the source of this movie adds, but this is one of my favorite movies of Paul Mazursky (director and co-author). This is a repetition of Shakespeare's "comedy", but totally eliminated from the stage. Without much text, Mazursky and the star Cassavettes make visual a crisis of passion and purpose of middle age. Desperate to refocus, Cassavettes retreats to a remote Greek island, where the locals and the island itself weave a bit of magic. Especially with Raul Julia, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, this is an emotionally satisfying and visually beautiful adult fantasy. And fun. It was not a huge blockbuster, but when it is sold on a DVD, it will be sold.
