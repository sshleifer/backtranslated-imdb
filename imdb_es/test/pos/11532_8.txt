I have seen this movie three times and each time I appreciate it more. I think Jordana Brewster should have received an Emmy nomination for her real and natural performance. Many of us who were Phoebe's age at this moment in history happens to understand how real it is. Life for most of us is not a romantic or harshly cynical pessimism. It's a blurry balance, and this movie captures this balance. It is also well built, with so many fine details in its composition. Whether we like the film or not, judging by the extraordinarily high scores it gets from the demographic of women under 18, we can know that this film reveals an important truth about how young women in the world look.
