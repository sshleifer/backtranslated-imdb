This is one of those movies where it's easy to see how some people would not like it. My wife has never seen him, and when I looked at him last night, I waited until she went to bed. I could have had fun with a couple of small fragments, but I know I would have had enough in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Head has nothing to do with a conventional story. The film is firmly immersed in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as a filmic surrealism in a few words, or as a kind of acid postmodern journey through the cinematographic genres. If you're not a big fan of those things: psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernity and the "acid journey aesthetic" (assuming there's a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this movie. On the other hand, if you're a fan of those things, you should run and buy Head now if you have not done it yet. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film has never received much respect. That probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. After all, he's starring in The Monkees - Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and The Monkees was a musical group of actors reunited by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to be friends, bubble gummy Beatles for a series of TV. In their time, they had as much respect as, say, Menudo, New Kids on the Block, The Spice Girls, etc. As a fellow IMDb critic aptly points out: "Maybe people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a silly pop band made at the Beatles factory, refused to see (Head)." <br /> <br /> The Monkees and Head have never been able to get rid of that negative public perception. It's a shame, because there was a lot of talent, both musically and otherwise, in The Monkees. It's probably weirder than Rafelson, who runs here and co-produced with Schneider, and Jack Nicholson (yes, _that_ Jack Nicholson), who wrote the script and also co-produced, decided to take The Monkees in this unusual direction. It's as if New Kids on the Block suddenly released an album equivalent to Ummagumma by Pink Floyd (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, the songs in Head, written by The Monkees and frequent collaborators like Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a quality similar to Floyd's, somewhere between the era of Syd Barrett and the immediate aftermath of Barrett. This is much more prominent than any similarity of the Beatles. Some people have complained about the music in the movie, but for me, all the songs are gems. For that matter, some people do not like the Barrett (or other) age of Floyd, which is so difficult for me to empathize with. <br /> <br /> But what is it about Head? The basic idea is that The Monkees is making a journey through several film genres: there are scenes of war, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, scenes from the west, science fiction scenes, romantic scenes , and so on. . Except that, in the reality of the film, this happens mainly (if not exclusively) in a studio. At the root, we're watching The Monkees shoot a movie. Of course, all the scenes in the different genres have something surreal and refer to themselves, and they, and the individual shots within a scene, tend to lead to each other using the logic of the dream not very different from the program of Monty Python television. Like a dream, Head tends to waver between a good dream and a nightmare, while often it is one that would make you laugh while you sleep (something I often do, by the way). <br /> <br /> Technically, Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the above. There are scenes with extensive negative images, there are many very fast cuts (including a great sequence that presents Davy Jones and Tony Basil dancing alternately in a black and white room, with a combination of black and white inverted in each one, that from time to time). when it alternates between two frames at a time, there are a lot of strange segments, there is an animated cow mouth, there are odd editing devices, and so on. For my money, I wish this was not just a relic of the psychedelic era This is the kind of artistic approach I enjoy, it seemed like a good idea back then and I still think it's a good idea, I would like to watch movies like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou using (2004) using this kind of extended techniques. that would make the film surreal. <br /> <br /> Interpretatively, some people who are not so in tune with the aesthetics of acid travel have complained that it's basic. you b.s. Offer meanings for something destined to have none. I do not agree with such a pessimistic / nihilistic vision; The intention of Head was to have many meanings, and not only films without conventional arguments have multiple interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have many interesting things to say about The Monkees: the film comments postmodernly on its manufacturing status; pop star - long before Pink Floyd, Head combines pop stardom and violence, from images of war to images of fans dismantling their idols cannibalically; and naive ideas oriented to the United States about international perceptions and respect: foreigners well armed in a desert surrender to Micky Dolenz just because he is an American, then blow up a Coca machine (again in the desert) for him because he is thirsty and can not be accessed. The film discusses many other topics, from the big industry to the police, polls, spectators (especially in relation to tragedies), and so on. Head is full of ideas, appropriate enough, with intelligent and multifaceted things to say about them. <br /> <br /> Head deserves to be considered a classic: basically looking for the same vibe as Yellow Beatine from The Beatles. Both debuted in November 1968, quite interestingly, and both were conceived as a kind of summary of psychedelic aesthetics. The yellow submarine was not very successful. The head is all that Yellow Submarine should have been.
