I have taken another look at this film and I still consider it pretty good. Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars that can really act. She occasionally appears in the soft core as "Body of Love" and "Lady Chatterly's Stories" on Showtime. I thought that Nicole Hilbig was also fine with her nice body and her lovely accent. Too bad it is not in more movies.
