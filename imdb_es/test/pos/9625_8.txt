This is my favorite kung fu movie. It has a very authentic flavor, seasoned by a mysterious music (of the traditional Chinese instruments, I think), and some wonderfully exaggerated melodramatic moments contrasted by the very affected comedy. In fact, when trying to create their own "western" genre (ie, a cowboy movie), the Chinese invented a completely new animal, marked by the fight of kung fu and its associated sound effects. <br /> <br /> The Story of Five Fingers Death is simple, a story of revenge (for killing a loved one) and the search for the main character to master the "iron fist technique" that will allow you to rid the holy revenge of his enemies. There is even a love interest, although awkward and polite (found in most Chinese films of the time). However, the final result is excellent and much more authentic than any Bruce Lee movie.
