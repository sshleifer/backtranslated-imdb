I saw this at the premiere of Accent Underground with the short films. At first the film seemed boring and old-fashioned and I turned it off after the first hour. I was a little drunk and tired. <br /> <br /> I went to bed, and I was not kidding, I had a nightmare with this movie. Within half an hour and hour of falling asleep. I could not stop thinking about why, so I got up, turned on the TV again, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well done, Mr. Alex Frayne, you have succeeded in implanting your film in this old and cynical head of moviegoers, and that needs to be done. So 10 out of 10 for you. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I love this movie of yours, but it has had a lasting impact despite its shortcomings and low budget, etc.
