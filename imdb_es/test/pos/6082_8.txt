One of the most charming elements and, for me at least, the most powerful of Anthony Minghella's best-selling winning film "The English Patient" is that, in the mid-90s, Hollywood was in the initial stage of losing the value for great new projects, a film was created that brought back the very powerful footprints of the majestic and wonderful majesty that created films like "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" (1956). "The English Patient" contains a lot of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a time of prolonged duration that almost does not seem very long, and fascinating characters with histories and pasts. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient", based on a novel of the same name by Michael Ondaatje. , is like "The Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the sense of how it is constructed. It is a mixture of two stories: the past and the present and everything revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the years after the Second World War. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who has been marked for life by a plane crash, and has been treated in a church isolated by a single nurse played beautifully by Juliette Binoche. In addition to bonding with his patient with hoarse voice problems, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger arrives (Willem Dafoe) and the two men seem to know each other. <br /> <br /> It's just one of the two beautifully designed stories that shape this film. The other, told in a flashback, is the patient's past, before it healed and died in a bed. The history of the present mingled with the patient's past and his love story that tragically changed his life forever. <br /> <br /> To be frank, "The English Patient" is a love story combined with an epic sweeping sensation. It mixes magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how exciting, how obsessive and how charming it was on the screen. Usually, in love stories, such as the later "Cold Mountain" by Minghella (2003), the romantic elements seem much more lustful than obsessive. Some of the scenes of love present elements that can be associated more with lust than with love, but even so, because it is very well developed and does not rush or explode out of proportion, we can believe that there is a true love and sure between both. These characters reminded me a lot of "Vertigo" (1958) to the extent that filmmakers and artists convinced us that these were two real human beings who really fell in love with each other. . I was especially captivated by the performance of Juliette Binoche, who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked that Willem Dafoe interprets the kind of cynical and questionable character that is always essential to interpret. And, of course, I can not leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portraits of two very passionate lovers. <br /> <br /> Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I described it as a perfect movie. There are two flaws that I can not see. Number one, it's a bit too long and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are some unnecessary subplots. I was not thrilled or particularly interested in the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this element of the plot comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly there, but in the movie, it seems a bit distracted and the relationship between the two characters did not. fascinate me. I was much more interested in the character of Fiennes and his relationships with his two main actresses. <br /> <br /> However, these two flaws are easily pardonable, even if they slow things down a little. Left aside, "The English Patient" is an extraordinary achievement of filmmaking. For me, it was a kind of crazy mix between "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), two notable and best films, and this effective combination proved worthwhile. It is a real pity that Anthony Minghella has left us. Because he was a truly gifted filmmaker. This is all the evidence that anyone needs.
