First I remember having stumbled upon this madness of brothers Zucker and Jim Abrahams, in the early days on Comedy Central. In those days (the 90s), its programming consisted of Benny Hill reps and the original MST3k, complete with a host with a beard. <br /> <br /> Capt. Frank Drebin (played by Leslie Nielson, the stone face and the filibuster), is a process created first from the amalgamation of several stereotyped protagonists of the police television (I think Dragnet knows Starsky and Hutch the Show), boiled in a bottle full of well-known television shows show plots and scenarios. This is distilled, 3 times to produce the purest policeman ever made. Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now, save it for later). Frank Drebin has no idea in most cases, is a terrible driver, a terrible shot, male but sensitive and vulnerable. He is a master of the police investigation methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny, the old leather and glitter shoe, Shine Boy). This does not make him a bad cop. The cops are also lucky. Captain Drebin (note that he is a captain here) has perfected it. Together with his partner, Nordberg, and the rest of the force, they parody perfectly the police drama in the course of 6 golden episodes. <br /> <br /> The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialogues and quotations. Most gags are a bit old-fashioned and stupid. Magic never came from sight gags, however. At its core there was a conversation and activities without meaning and frank in the foreground, with crazy things happening in the background. Movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags in this series. Think of Monty Python's and now for something completely different ... <br /> <br /> If you liked Airplane 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3 or Top Secret, you will definitely enjoy this. <br /> <br /> I've always liked series more than movies, although I saw them first. Why? 2 words: No O.J.
