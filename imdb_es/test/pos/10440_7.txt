Reality before television reality? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A precursor to "Say Anything" that is spicier? I can not decide, but the soundtrack * is * that of the 80s - Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie, and U2 - I can not believe this, they would never unite all those genres in a teen movie today. <br /> <br /> I remembered this as a teenager, mainly the sexual parts and not a hint of altruism. Why? I was a horny teenager in the 80's. Seeing him again, I can not describe how much I love that Rose, played by Kimberly Richardson, turns out to be the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 90s, and I was almost 30 when I was in Last American Virgin. playing at 16 years old - fantastic! Complete cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy, with a sincere icing.
