For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another valuable experience. Okay, you do not need to read anymore. <br /> <br /> I already believe that most of the readers are older than the two protagonists of this image, so I must say that Ponyo is not so much a family movie as an opportunity to remember the feeling of being a Little boy: Discover the world as you wanted to see it, create your own rules and boast of exuberant enthusiasm when doing things on your own for the first time. Ponyo moves away from many of the problems that films tackle for all ages. Never condescend, all the characters have good genuine hearts and credible problems. <br /> <br /> The two main characters can be two of the most credible children I have seen on the screen. They are not simple minded, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and they learn the ways of the world. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify. Many films consider children from abroad, like the adult who looks at a world in which only a child could enter. Ponyo brings everyone back to that world. In Ponyo, you will find the first time to learn and choose what interests you the most, which the film values ​​with great esteem. It is worth remembering, feeling it again.
