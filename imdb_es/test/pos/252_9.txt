He took a loan from Columbia so that Gene Kelly's MGM home studio would realize his creative talents and give him some control over what he did in his own films. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's movie for GIs and their fantasies during World War II. Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn, where Rita is a prominent dancer and Phil Silvers, the comedian. Of course, Kelly gets a little confused there. <br /> <br /> Hayworth draws the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother. In some flashback sequences of the gas light era, Hayworth also plays his own grandmother with Jess Barker playing the young Kruger. You may remember that Jess Barker was the husband of that other legendary redhead, Susan Hayward. <br /> <br /> Broadway producer Lee Bowman is also attracted to Hayward, but is not interested in nostalgia. He wants it for his Ziegfeld Follies magazine and, in fact, the largest number of Cover Girl is the main song of the film. It is well done in Follies style. <br /> <br /> Hayworth also sings A Sure Thing in a number of gas light era and in the only song in the series not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, Hayworth also makes an old number of the room poor English music John. When I say sing, as everyone knows Rita's words. Nan Wynn sings here. <br /> <br /> The biggest success of the series is Long Ago and Far Away, presented by Gene Kelly. It was one of the greatest successes of the era of the Second World War and one of the best sellers that Jerome Kern wrote. In fact, it's being the favorite of one of my aunts who with my uncle will celebrate 60 years of marriage this September. Long Ago and Far Away were nominated for Best Song, but lost with Swinging on a Star. <br /> <br /> What really sets Cover Girl apart and what makes her a key movie for Gene Kelly are the two numbers Put Me to The test and the number of Alter Ego. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer had rejected at MGM, to give Kelly creative control of his own material. Kelly later said that the alter ego number was one of the most difficult things he had tried in his career. In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. <br /> <br /> In fact, after one more loan movie, Christmas Holiday at Universal, Louis B. Mayer never lent Gene Kelly the rest of the time he was at MGM. And he got creative control from that moment. <br /> <br /> With that dazzling technicolor cinematography and Rita's red hair and Gene Kelly's limitless creativity, Cover Girl was and is a classic and always will be.
