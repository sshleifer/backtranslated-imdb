This was a very faithful presentation of Lewis' life in the mid-1950s. The dialogue about theology and the jokes with his colleagues followed was exceptionally good. Michael White's book, "C.S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia" treats this time frame in a very parallel way. The performance of Joss Ackland was excellent to catch the carefree Lewis. The film took great trouble to be presented in a precise English environment. The development of a strong bond between "Jack" (his preferred name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, Joy's son from his previous marriage, was nice to watch. The film avoided the unpleasant element of the problem with the drink of "Warnie" Lewis (Jack's older brother), but it would not have moved the story, so it is better to leave it aside.
