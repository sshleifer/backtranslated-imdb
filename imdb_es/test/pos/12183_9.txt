*** It may contain Spoilers *** Well, it was not exactly as good as expected, in fact, it was very different from what I thought it would be, but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Usually, I do not care much about that kind of music, but in this movie it worked perfectly (ie, it's a rock star), but anyway I loved Stuart Townsend in this, and Aaliyah, although she had a small part of the movie was incredible. <br /> <br /> And even though Tom Cruise played Lestat in the Interview with a vampire, I must admit that I'm glad he rejected the role, although I usually hate it when they use it. different people to play the same characters in sequels and similar things. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was great and I enjoyed watching it, even if there were parts that could have been better. Great vampire movie.
