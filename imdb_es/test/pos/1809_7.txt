This typical teenage movie is one of the best, besides that the story is good, the music is well accompanied by the movie all the time. <br /> <br /> Although I do not enjoy the classic movie unless it is a classic script and better written, this is exceptional. Maybe the style and language of the hair should change a bit, in the 80s I think that offensive language is rarely heard. <br /> <br />
