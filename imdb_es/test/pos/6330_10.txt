Bergman is a sublime director of comedy and writer. This fact is evident in "En lektion I kärlek", where the comic elements range from pure scenes to deep but very emotional scenes. This film paves the way for the later comedies of Bergman "Sommarnattens leende" and "Kvinnodröm", all of them starring Gunnar Björnstrand and Eva Dahlbeck. This is an excellent film with which to start your Bergman experience, sharply portraying the emotional problems of both young and old. The cinematography of Martin Bodin is amazing, for example, in the picnic scene. In short, the film is a perfect example of a successful comedy, with a clarity of depth that even surpasses some Bergman comedies.
