When I saw the trailer for the first time, I have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection. But after finding out, I decided to buy it. When I bought the entire collection in a set of boxes, it was absolutely what I wanted to see. It was very fun, and the characters were very good. The favorite characters in the program are: Marion, Carrot, Haze Knights, Big Momma and Dotta. I also liked the opening and ending themes. The program also has some great voice talents from Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas and others. But nevertheless, this show is one of the biggest. So if you want to see something great. Then this show is the indicated one.
