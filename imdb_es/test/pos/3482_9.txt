I usually do not comment on movies because I'm in the movie distribution business, but I must say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no speeches or exploitation of disabled people to try to make this movie more "Hollywood". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor that he could not look away from him if he tried. I was also impressed by Steven Robertson. I can not believe that this is your first real movie. Brenda Fricker has a small role, but as usual, she is outstanding. This is a movie for everyone to see how lucky we all are. If you like Awakenings and Mask, you will enjoy this story. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie.
