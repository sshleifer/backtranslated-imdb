Destined to be a classic even before it was conceptualized. This game deserves all the recognition it deserves. At a time when first-person shooters like Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are attracting the full attention of computer gamers, graphic adventures are an extinct race. With a great game of words and humor, The Curse of Monkey Island is a game enjoyed by people of all ages. Life can only improve after playing The Curse of Monkey Island. * prediction * the sequel Escape from Monkey Island is already destined to be a classic too. I guarantee it.
