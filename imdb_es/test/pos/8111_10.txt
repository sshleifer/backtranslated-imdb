The Great Dictator is a film beyond excellence. Charlie Chaplin manages to be extremely funny and witty and, at the same time, offers a strong statement in his satire against fascism. Chaplin's anti-Nazi discourse at the end, with its values, is one of the great moments of cinema. Throughout this film, I felt that there was a superior form of intelligence, beyond genuinely intelligent cinema, at work.
