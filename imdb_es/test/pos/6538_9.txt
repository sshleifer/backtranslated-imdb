I do not understand why everyone hates this movie, aside from the fact that they are just jealous that their musical careers never took off like the mega Popstar Aaron Carter. Like it or not, Aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could dream, so it only seemed natural to him to make a movie. Lou Pearlman and his company have been known to overexploit their protected pop, remember the foray of Justin Timberlake in the television movie Model Behavior? Okay, this movie is not large scale and impressive, but it's not supposed to be. It's not about impressing people or being an Emmy Award winner, it was released directly on DVD. It's just a cute little movie about a clumsy teenager who gets her dream of being with her favorite Popstar; I know many of you have had that dream at some time or another about your favorite singer, do not deny it. He is sweet and gentle, and I applaud him for not entering the realm of sex, violence and vulgar language that seem to be getting more and more into our movies nowadays. Where is the decency? Where is the line Teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies, at least this is more tolerable to me than Bratz (also known as Slutz) with all the fake girls running around "Oh , Mah Gawd! " in tank tops and miniskirts, it's better than those gore fest movies like Saw. I'm sorry for the main character's girl because she was a nerdy girl in high school who loved Aaron Carter and NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and other pop music and they still do; and like the character of Aaron, the "testofobia" would be crushed, especially in mathematics. If you judge this movie solely because of the fact that you do not like it or that you are jealous of Aaron Carter and his fame, then, of course, you will hate him and spoil him in the comments. The only reason why Britney Spears dribble in Crossroads scored higher is because she has tits. Accept this movie for what it is, not for what you want it to be. I think this happy movie for teenagers ends on a high note and makes you want to sing.
