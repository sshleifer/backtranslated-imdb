I could not believe the sweet eye from beginning to end. Being a fan of films directed by masterminds of music videos. I am pleased to report that the photography in this film is a splendor for the eyes. There are so many rich and complete images that are put before me, that every time I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with the previous films I've seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also from former directors of music videos, the use of color to capture attention is used extremely well. Although the characters could have developed better, the action and costumes were well worth the price of admission. I recommend you buy this for your DVD collection. Even if you have not seen this on the big screen, you will not be disappointed. I know it was not.
