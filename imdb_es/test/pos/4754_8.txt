This movie has a great chase scene, if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other, it looks a lot like the soundtrack of the movie's bullet, you will hear the change of a speed of 4 and they will show the brake pedal in the Roy Schneider's car, it's an automatic brake pedal! I think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad Richard Lynch is looking at the driver of the car he's in, like he's crazy! ........ the thief who runs the garage is also the guy who in the first rock movie, the rocky boss. Good movie! Also, when the door is broken, you can see that the guy sitting in the car has just opened the door, the one who helps him get out of the car looks like Mr. Brady from Brady's group, is not it?
