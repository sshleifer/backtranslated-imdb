In general, a well made movie. There were some parts that made me shudder, and other parts where I raised my hands, but I came away with something more than what I said. <br /> <br /> I think the movie suffers from some Excess of serious ambition. Without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in Ramayana are far above what this film represents. The Ramayana is an epic. It is not a 200 page book that represses women in India. The film is about two married girls in a very distinctive Indian family. While the basic principles of the "unwritten laws of family tradition" seem to be those of conservative India, let me assure my reader that (having lived in Delhi for 12 years) I found complete parts that simply did not touch those bells. I want to say some things and some actions are very true, but some other things are out of place. Especially today. <br /> <br /> Delhi is complicated. India is complicated. The director tries to simplify both. And it fails miserably enough in that. <br /> <br /> Why in English? Can you imagine a movie about American Indians in English? Or the French who speak in English. Seriously jarring. Even the server spoke in an English with a fluent accent (albeit with a touch of colloquialisms in the language for "credibility"). <br /> <br /> But the chemistry between the drivers is palpable. If you like the heat, this is a movie for you. I think that is the greatest salvation: the development of a true love story from real life. <br /> <br /> If this movie were about Radha and Sita, then I would get all the qualifications from me. And when it came to them, I could have made a subtle statement. But this movie goes out to say that this is what India is and what Indian society is like. And in that sense, it is as successful as it is failure. Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt. The dark secrets of India are not being revealed. Only two girls are falling in love. As it happens elsewhere.
