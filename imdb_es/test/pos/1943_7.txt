I was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when I came across this movie. I was so clear about teenagers in the early 80's, and I called my mom "hahaha, I turn to the channel and all that, the boy seems totally like dad was a kid". <br /> <br /> Um. Yes. It turns out that this movie has to do with my father and his friends. <br /> <br /> Even without it being a loose base based on my father's childhood, I'd say watch this movie! <br /> <br /> It's just ..... weird to say the least, the apathy instilled in the teenagers even back then. This is a good "human interest" and shows some strange aspects of the psyche.
