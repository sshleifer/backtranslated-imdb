"River's Edge" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and during a year that also saw "Blue Velvet", you know that's saying something. Seen today, he has lost little of his power and is still much better than the overrated "Children". The previews of "Children" were played as an exhibition of the deterioration of the nation's youth. In reality, it was little more than an exploitation film based mainly on a shock value. "River's Edge" was touted as a teen exploitation film, but in reality it was much better. The only times that go from being annoying to unpleasant is the constant image of the dead naked body. Outside of that, the film is stimulating and, despite all its minor flaws, quite realistic. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves, known for being a wood artist in particular, offers his best performance as a burned teenager. . Ione Skye is equally nice and nice. Dennis Hopper (on the way back with this, "Blue Velvet", and "Hoosiers") gives great performance as the leftovers of the creepy but pathetic hippie generation. Crispin Glover, although always entertaining to watch, seems a bit out of place as the fool and leader of the group. The best performance however is definitely Daniel Roebuck. Like the assassin John, Roebuck is terribly emotionless. It's a shame he has not become a bigger star, since he's a much better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is fantastic and daring. Do not confuse this with another stupid clich√© from the high school movie, like "The Breakfast Club." This is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this film are encouraged to watch a 1981 Canadian film called "Out of the Blue," directed by Dennis Hopper. It is another surprisingly bleak examination of the generation gap and, despite its obscurity, may have been an influence on "River's Edge." (7/10)
