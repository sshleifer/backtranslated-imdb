'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic movie in itself. It's nothing like the book, which can disappoint your ardent followers. However, seen by itself, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the performance is not so bad either !! Nicolas Cage was brilliant, very different from his usual action hero characters. Penelope Cruz is excellent and really keeps the film together. I think this film should be judged as an individual project, not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres resigned from the screenplay rights to the film, so the film is an interpretation of the director, John Maddon. Go and see this movie with an open mind, you will love it; Because below is the moving story of love and war.
