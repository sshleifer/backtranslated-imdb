Despite subsequent claims, this first talkie melodrama has very little in common with "Citizen Kane": it is a biopic of a plutocrat of ruthless but human fiction, told in flashback but jumping around time. The screenwriter, Preston Sturges, does not show any of his latest gifts for sparkling dialogues, and none of the thousands of "Kane" film innovations are evident. Still, it's very visible, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old man make-up makes him look like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore, a little beyond his prime, and not He is physically well-matched - playing a multifaceted woman behind man. There is also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous fatal women in film history, sending the last third to the reverberations of ecstatic soap operas. The impression that survives is outstanding and missing audio fragments, and there are some holes in the plot that remain open (how would you know who your son was if you are sleeping with both?), And the music is terribly bad. For all that, I was quite fascinated.
