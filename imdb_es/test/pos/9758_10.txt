I can not believe that 25 years have passed since I first saw this story on television. I remembered being very touched and I was lucky to get the VHS tape several years ago. I did not see him until recently. I have seen it again and again since then. I must have seen it 10 times in the last 2 weeks. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, the story is convincing and I am ashamed to say that until now I have not appreciated the talent of actor Bryan Brown. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half, when he gave Jean the stolen medicine in Malaya, contrast with his very reserved and nervous body language that is shown in the second half: in his first drink together in Caines and in the tour of the farm. . We have to wait until the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene to see his show of affection for Jean. The same dancing eyes that first revealed their admiration in Malaya. Who would not want to be your Mrs. Boong? <br /> <br /> While Joe went from being an arrogant figure, almost larger than life in the jungle of Malaya to a middle Joe in his own backyard, Jean took the opposite path; his experience in times of war seems to have given him a new confidence. He did not waste time and it was after what he wanted. He took steps to take what he could get, exactly as Joe had once told him. <br /> <br /> For me, all these transformations help to show that this is more than just a love story; This is a story about growth, courage and fragility in life. The lawyer-Noel is both a sweet and sad figure. He also gave Jean a lot, gave his last hope of love. In the end, he did what true love requires: he put his happiness above his. <br /> <br /> I liked the fight between Joe and Jean that was not in the book. I thought it was an appropriate and necessary addition because it helped bring out the internal struggles with which both had to deal to make their life together. <br /> <br /> Now, I am older, maybe I understand life, Love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. <br /> <br /> However, I am surprised to see that B. Brown has blue eyes in the promotional photo shown on this site. Definitely not in "A town like Alice." Well, 25 years is a long time!
