I just received this movie for Christmas and I have already added it to my favorites list. A beautiful and simple story that makes a beautiful movie. Who could not love Uncle Felix or not have his mouth water at the sound of all that food? The points are going to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander Yardley and also to Reginald Gardiner, who played John Sloane, the unbelievably boring bride. Truly a gem to be seen every Christmas.
