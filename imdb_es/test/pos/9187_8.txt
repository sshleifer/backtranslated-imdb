This movie was not about stereotypes, dance moves, or collection lines, really. This film is about the vulnerability of people's hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action, and that such a trite film genre could succeed in that way. I do not intend to sound too pleased with this movie, it was not "innovative" in any way, but it was a movie that is worth seeing. Was it credible? No. New York could not be so simple and there has not been any human being in the history of humanity who has Hitchhpah. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not those that can get any girl, at any time, excluding the rakes in seven figures, of course. What worked best for this movie was its true focus on the dramatic side of things, not just comedy. It was a fun two hours, no doubt. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, immerse yourself in the characters and smile.
