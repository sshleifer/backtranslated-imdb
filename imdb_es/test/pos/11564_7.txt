The Dakota incident is a curiosity for several reasons. It will be obvious from the beginning that it was done long before anyone had ever thought about political correctness. Although, the character of Ward Bond softens the edge with "maybe we can communicate with them, after all, they are also human," kind of dialogue. His part is next to the preacher trying to communicate with the Martians in the War of the Worlds. In fact, it's strange. The title is also curious. The use of the word "Incident" brings an importance and sophistication to the movie that probably did not affect the box office. The devised assortment of characters and Linda Darnell's elegant dress and hat are wonderful old-fashioned touches that make Dakota Incident a cool western artifact since the mid-1950s.
