This movie was really different from what I had imagined, but it exceeded my expectations. This film has the exact mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in that order). Without being condescending or wise, it reveals the open and subtle problems of our capitalist, democratic and high-tech society. It makes you laugh instantly and stay in thought later. For those of you who liked "wagging the dog" and wished to have human and human politicians, this movie should definitely be the choice! <br /> <br /> "politicians are very similar to diapers: they should be changed frequently and for the same reasons".
