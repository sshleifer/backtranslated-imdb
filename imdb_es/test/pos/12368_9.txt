On New Year's Eve, the tubercular sister of the Salvation Army Editor (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit her on her deathbed. Meanwhile, the alcoholic David is telling two other drunks in the cemetery the legend of the Phantom Coach and his coachman: according to the legend, the last sinner who dies in the New Year's change becomes the collector of souls, gathering souls in his coach When David refuses to visit Edit, his friends argue with him, fight and David dies. When the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died late last year. George picks up parts of David's odious life and in flashbacks, shows how mean and selfish David was. <br /> <br /> "Körkarlen" is an impressive and elegant silent film, with magnificent special effects (for a 1921 film). The characters are very well developed; however, the story is dated and there is a strange and inexplicable situation, when Sister Edit says she loves David Holm. Why should an enlightened woman love a man so despicable that he wasted his life corrupting other people? Despite being religiously dated in the present days, it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption at the end. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Carroça Fantasma" ("The Phantom Coach")
