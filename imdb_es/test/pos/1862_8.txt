Paul Bettany played a great role as the tortured father whose favorite child tragically dies of an illness. For that, he deserves all the credit. However, the film focused mainly on that, maintaining Darwin's adventures while gathering data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and completely skipping over disputes about his ideas. <br /> <br /> Two things bothered me terribly. : the soundtrack, with its moan, practically pushing the sadness down the spectator's throat, and the trailer of the film, showing some beautiful landscapes, the theological reflections of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle. against blind faith, which distorts the film completely. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, if one removed the scenes from the film trailer of the film, the result would be a non-descriptive family drama about a little The death of the child and the hardships of his parents as a result . Clearly, it is not what I expected from a film about Darwin, although the film was beautifully performed.
