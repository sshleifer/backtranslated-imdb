This movie was incredible. I was crying at the end of the movie. Okay, I know that the performance was horrible, but that's not the important thing. The message came loud and clear about God's love for us and the sacrifice of Jesus. The film was realistic and showed real human feelings, whether it was Pete's anger at the teasing of the blonde girl or the guy asking questions. But he also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with Christ. The cars were awesome and the actors were very hot and that attracted my attention. But what I liked most about this movie was the clear message of the Gospel. The mother and the pastor supported Ben on his new journey with Christ and tried to be a godly example to others. Nicky D showed that it does not matter if you have everything the world has to offer, without Christ, it does not matter. Nina showed how a wrong but good person can easily overlook the brand. I loved this movie and I think it will bring many teenagers to Christ.
