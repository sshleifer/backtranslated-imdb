I probably would not have bothered to comment on this movie if I had not been bothered by the constant references that were made here in North America as a porn movie. Our obsession with what is, or should be, considered pornographic remains a relic of the 'guide' provided to the filmmakers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and now it is really time to relegate it to the past. So far we have not advanced much beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now call "soft" and "hard" pornography, and both carry the same pornography label. It's time we all recognize that neither the release version of this R-rated movie (soft porn?), Nor the unqualified version (hard porn?) Available on DVD were pornographic in any way. <br /> <br /> In the legal terms of pornography are defined by their ability to deprave or corrupt. Many classic books such as Lady Chatterley's lover, Fanny Hill, Women in Love, The Story of 'O' or Moll Flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content, have been proven by a jury and have been approved according to this definition, but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they consider a legal mistake, and apply a simpler test that is too strict when applied to books or movies that are very close to the line, but it serves to quickly eliminate most others from any porn stain. Although the Hayes code would have qualified AIW as unacceptable both for its nudity and its descriptions of sexual activities, in practice most people today accept that the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage development of stable long-term family relationships. in which the participants find real compliance, it can not be considered pornographic (this does not mean that works that show unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognized as pornographic, only that they may need a more sophisticated evaluation). At AIW, we have a film about a young librarian who has had a fairly protected education and keeps her suitor close at hand because of the feeling that this is what morality requires her to do. After he feels too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her, she falls asleep and dreams of being transported to a Wonderland (very close to Lewis Carrol's) where all the people she meets are totally uninhibited about their sexual needs. She is surprised, but she is a kind person who takes things as she finds them, so in a short time she finds that her own prejudices gradually melt. He wakes up when his boyfriend returns to break his adventure, but his attitude towards him has changed so completely that their relationship has been completely restored, and the film ends with them living "happily ever after" with their children in a home with a white . A fence and a dog of the family, an end clearly aimed at those romantics who are still very young at heart. <br /> <br /> Pornographic? - Hardly <br /> <br /> Display suitable for children? - Well, probably not at all, unless they have very progressive parents. <br /> <br /> Qualification R? - PG would be more appropriate today. <br /> <br /> Is it entertaining for viewers in most age groups? - Yes, but the movie has its flaws. These are discussed in many of the comments here in IMDb. However, most commentators appreciated and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I think the only pornography associated with this movie was a claim by a "scientific proof" anti-pornography activist that a photo from Kristin de Bell magazine was a photo montage of face images of a ten-year-old boy with several body parts of adult models. These and other comments seriously damaged the career of a promising young actress, but today the film seems on the way to becoming a cult classic. Several productions of home videos have been released in VHS and DVD format; the last was a DVD containing the classified and unrated versions of the film, released by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Copies of this were available until a few months ago, are now almost sold out and mail order sellers still have copies In stock, we are selling them many times at their original price, a situation that usually results quickly in the appearance of a new DVD. This interest continued almost 35 years after the release of the original film points to an almost classical state. <br /> <br /> The commentators in this database are expected to provide viewers with a useful guide on whether a movie is worth watching or even compiling. My comments here were meant to highlight the continuing damage to the industry that still results from the pressure on core studies to respect the self-censorship recommendations that originate in the Hayes Committee. In this database, such general comments are marked very quickly by readers as "not useful" and I rarely do them; but fortunately I still have room to add that, in my opinion, this movie is quite unusual and worth seeing or even buying. It's flawed, but Kristine deBell offers a great performance and the film offers a quite unique and rewarding visual experience. In general, I would rate it with 7 stars and I will buy a copy of the next DVD edition if it appears. If Ms. DeBell is still alive today, I would love to hear her comments about the attempts to suppress this film and the late recognition she has gradually achieved.
