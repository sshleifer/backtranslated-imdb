If you are very sensitive when it comes to extreme racial stereotypes, this caricature is not for you. But if you are very interested in seeing a rare war animation, go ahead! <br /> <br /> In this caricature, Popeye is patrolling the seas and discovers what appears to be a Japanese fishing boat. The two Japanese fishermen cheat Popeye into thinking they want a peace treaty signed. But appearances can be deceptive; The fishing boat turns out to be a Japanese navy ship! What follows is considered today as a propaganda that increases morale. <br /> <br /> Be forewarned, representations of the Japanese in the movie are made in a petty way. Keep in mind, however, that there was a war at that time. But I highly recommend this caricature to those who are interested in the era of the Second World War.
