I expected this to be the same as the others, try to be scared, ends up looking like nonsense. At some point along the line, the writers must have realized this and, therefore, took the film in a totally different direction, basically ignoring the other films. This feels like a different movie instead of the fourth entry in the Child's Play series. The new idea works by making it the best of the series by far.
