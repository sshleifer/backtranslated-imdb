EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! WELL FROM CUBA, Jr. I should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie! He was the movie! While the film may be missing in some areas, Cuba was incredible ... and for me, this is the best role he has ever played! The scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break and cry IN THE THEATER! I guess I could really relate to this movie because I saw the same treatment of people like that in my own school while growing up ... what a tragedy! Seeing the radio and the "real" coach at the end of the movie was also really special! If you can see this movie and you are not moved to tears, you need a heart check! If you liked "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you will also love "Radio"! I wish they made more movies like this ... Radio is the real deal!
