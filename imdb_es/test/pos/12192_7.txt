Despite criticism from critics, I liked this movie. In fact, I liked it better than Interview with a vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) more than Cruise's attempt. All the main players of the series were present: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and a half dozen others (although most of them are in cameo). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse de Talamasca). Also, despite other criticisms, I think that this film and the music were faithful to the portrait and the spirit of Anne Rice, at least as I perceive it. Aailiyah was quite good as Akasha, in attractive places (her first entry scene and mini dance). The film did not capture the breadth of the series of books, but I thought it was a good complement. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of this series due mainly to the style, sensibilities and treatments of Anne Rice. And I found this film as a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.
