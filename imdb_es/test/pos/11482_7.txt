It is important and fair to remember that, at the time of this short film, there was a state of war between the United States and the Empire of Japan. Add to that the enormous ill will that created the beginning of the war, as well as Bataan's Death March and other incidents, and the only surprising thing about this short and others is that there were no more of them. Another thing: my only problem with this short is that it seems to be funny, but it is not. I'm not sure that someone related to him really tried to make the jokes work, or even that they cared. It would have been much better if they had done what Disney did with Education For Death and they would have been totally serious. But this short has a bad reputation and should not be judged out of context. The times were different then and that is an important consideration. Anyone who spends energy trying to save the world from a 60-year-old caricature needs to step back. Like me, spending energy defending that same caricature. This should be available to interested parties, even if it is not widely available. It is not a good caricature, but sometimes life is not good. Recommended
