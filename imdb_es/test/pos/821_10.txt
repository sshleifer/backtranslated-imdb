Van Damme has made some great movies over the years and this reaches ten in my books. From the Mexican stage to the five-star fight scenes, this movie was incredible. The film deals with border patrols that protect the territory that is the border of Mexico. Navy seals are smuggling drugs from Mexico to the United States of America (USA), Van Damme and Scott Atkins give impressive performances as the police and the villain. Although this movie was not as good as it was until death, it still gave the action, the acting and the movie a five-star look. I always look forward to these b-grade action movies and they keep improving. Make them come, van damme. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you enjoyed movies like - Until death, The hard body and the second in command.
