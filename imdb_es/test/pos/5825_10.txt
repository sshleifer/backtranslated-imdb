Oz is the television program that is intensive adrenaline without stopping. It is a show that is not aimed at a large audience, but at a specific one, since its themes are very oriented towards adults. Obviously, he did not achieve general success as this was impossible, but he was very famous among his audience and many famous actors, either as guest stars or became part of the show. <br /> <br /> Oz is a series of fiction stories based on a prison located somewhere in the state of New York. There are many different ethnic groups that play a somewhat equal role in being represented. These groups are Muslims, homeboys, Aryans, cyclists, Italians, Latinos, Irish, Christians, gays and others. Some have some type of affiliation between them, such as cyclists and Aryans, while Aryans are the enemy of numerous groups, such as Muslims and homeboys. <br /> <br /> At Oswald Penitentary (your official name) there is a policy that allows too many members of no ethnic group to be allowed. It is the maximum security prison and the regular prison that is sometimes sent or sent to prisoners in the program and is called "general population" or "pop gene". The main character of the show is Augustus Hill, who also tells the story before and after the main segments, crossed between a type of documentary and a biographical one. Hill is destined to use wheelchairs as a consequence of his unknown past. It is part of the "other" group, which has individuals who do not fit into the other prison gangs. <br /> <br /> Of the many groups, the smallest are the ones that can best be avoided by avoiding problems. of the times when the greatest are occupied in conflict with each other. Some of the most notable characters are the following: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is in charge of his Irish compatriots and somehow always voluntarily engages in lethal activities for the weakest link. 2) Miguel √Ålvarez is the Latino who has constant problems to overcome his popularity within his own gang and with others. 3) Simon Adebesi is the Nigerian who was the former leader of the Homeboys gang. It is also physically quite large and solid. These two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful inmates within Oz. 4) Karim Said is the Muslim and black nationalist who is very defined in his opinions and wishes. He fights for the rights of his people on many levels through the spectacle, from his own Muslim group to his broader black group and even fighting for all groups against the unfair rules of authority. The character seems, in a way, identical to Malcom X, the famous fighter of black rights who was also Muslim. <br /> <br /> In general, by its genre, Oz is possibly the largest (fictional prison program or show based on ethnic relations). If it does not sound like your own type of series probably should not be tested, but if you're interested, it's definitely worth seeing. The biggest problem with the program is that it is addictive, some may feel bad seeing much of this type of material. Researchers discuss whether it is harmful or not, but in the end it is only a reflection of the society of the world in which we live today. This means that it is like an informant and an indicator of the world that an aggressor.
