If Sicily is a Baroque territory, with its double perspective, that is part of the realism challenge of this film. And it is an exuberant pleasure here, to overcome Fellini with not one, but three film directors, in addition, of course, the current Bellocchio, who has made some really great films and should not be sensitive about his honor. There is a variety of shots and improvisations of casting in "I promessi sposi" of Manzoni with, somewhere, the current marriage. It is also considered that Sicily is a territory of skirmishes (you already know this version of the island, so there is no spoiler involved), a comic version that makes it worth seeing the work of Sergio Castellito with guard dogs on the floor of the great room of a palazzo.
