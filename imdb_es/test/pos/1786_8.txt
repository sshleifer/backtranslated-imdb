A year after her first triumphant special, "My Name Is Barbra", Barbra Streisand regrouped with her production team to produce this special follow-up on CBS-TV in the then revolutionary color. The first broadcast in March 1966, "Color Me Barbra" follows a format similar to that of its predecessor: three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the corridors of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she dresses as a period maid, runs through the galleries and becomes part of the work of art through song. Streisand expresses a variety of moods, from the comedy of "Minute Waltz" to the melodrama of "Non C'est Rien" in a Modigliani painting to the beatnik-style frenzy of "Gotta Move" set in abstract art. . My favorite moment in the special is when it transforms into a dead bell of Queen Nefertiti while singing a disturbing rendition of "Where or when" by Rogers and Hart. <br /> <br /> It opens with another comic monologue full of nonsense. On this occasion, in French, the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly colored circus mix where he interacts with the animals, including his beloved poodle Sadie. Find an appropriate context for "Sam, You Made the Pants Too Long" with a group of penguins and compare their profile comically with that of an anteater with "We Have So in Common". As with the first special, the program ends with a fascinating solo concert in which he sings some chestnuts, "Any place where my hat hangs is at home", "Where do I go?" and "From here, from now" between them. It also includes the brief introduction that filmed in 1986, ironically dressed in white, when the special was released for the first time on VHS. The juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in its first special, and Streisand, 23, is at its best.
