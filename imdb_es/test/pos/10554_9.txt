My father the hero is sweet, funny and cute. Gerard Depardiu is amazing as Andre, a divorced father who takes his fourteen-year-old daughter Nicole (Kathrine Heigl) to the Caribbean for vacation. While there, her daughter meets a guy named Ben (Dalton James.) To impress him, she tells him that Andre is her lover and her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and ran away with her pimp Everyone on the island soon gets the impression that Andre is a child molester, Andre is in between two relationships, one with Isabelle (Emma Thompson, who makes a cameo at the end of the movie) and Diana (Faith Prince of Spin City). My father, the hero, has many fun times, like when he's in a talent show and everyone tells him to play something French, so he plays Gigi's "Thank Heaven for Little Girls." Everyone gets angry and leaves. My father the hero does not deserve a 5.1 I think he deserves a 9.0.
