Now, I realize that most of the people here mistreat YOUNG WARRIORS-type entertainment or call it "so bad that it's fun," but let me clarify something: actually, it's a low-quality action, if you're willing to see such The cinema without critical eye. In fact, it is much more entertaining and stimulating than most action films of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The key is in the theme of the film. I always like films that approach the subject of vigilantism, especially when ambitiously probing the psyches of the characters involved. YOUNG WARRIORS may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first DEATH WISH movie (and yes, I think the first had both elements), but it is trying to be different from Cannon movies of all levels. the period in which it is genuinely unique. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple (do not worry, there will be no spoilers): a group of university student pranksters change their attitude when one of the members of their family is assaulted by a tough street gang. Students take to the streets in an effort to combat street crime in general, since they do not know who the responsible gang is. Finally, they acquire some heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and prowl the night fully armed. However, these are not Schwarzenegger types; they are vulnerable and inexperienced beginners who make considerable mistakes almost every time they throw themselves to clean the city (usually with their fraternity pet). Finally they realize who the gang is and they go after them, but by then they will not wait for a standard climax in which the good guys leave unharmed. <br /> <br /> One thing about the movie that struck me as strange but effective is that most of the first act does not offer any indication that we will see action or violence later on, as it is treated as a comedy of ridiculous fraternity that you would see in Up All Night of the USA. UU Actually it shows at one point). The configuration of the comedy actually made me forget that the VHS cover showed a guy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun strapped to his back. Then, when the violence finally arrives, it's not funny or cute at all ... it's surprisingly disturbing. From that moment, the film becomes an inflexible and blood-filled action thread that contains some amazing shootings and gore. <br /> <br /> The performance, although it is nothing special, is much more passionate than I anticipated. James Van Patten, who plays the protagonist, gives it all and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of film. The rest of the cast is equally committed, including the always reliable Ernest Borgnine as the hero's police father. The cinematography is also above the average and the action scenes are handled with a level of seriousness that I personally did not expect. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people thought that this movie was worthless, since a large part of it is extremely dated, but those facets seemed very good in themselves. Van Patten's character is studying animation and his patented style work of the early 80's that is exhibited in several scenes is the psychedelic wet dream of a lover of retro movies. I'm sure that most contemporary viewers would cite those moments as low points in the movie, but I do not agree. In addition, the soundtrack of Joe Walsh, which seems like it could only have been recorded in '83, seemed particularly appropriate and enjoyable, no matter how "old" it looks today. <br /> <br /> YOUNG WARRIORS is one of my favorite 80s Action Movies and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the genre to take a look. Unfortunately, however, it was only published on VHS as of this writing, and is not shown on television these days. A good presentation on DVD would make me walk around the moon around my living room with such intensity that I am sure my ankles will swell. Meanwhile, I implore everyone to go to Ebay or Amazon and pay the ten dollars or whatever for the old tape from the big box. It really is a remarkable element of the ambitious cinema trash.
