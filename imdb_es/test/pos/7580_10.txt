I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story and attract people in just seven minutes. I think a good movie is one you do not want to end. Eric did a great job developing the character of the microbe and making it look "human". I loved the music and the voice used for the microbe. I hope to see what Eric has reserved for us in future movies. This is a movie that I did not want to see in the end. Great job.
