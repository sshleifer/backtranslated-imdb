One of the main aspects of "Malenkaya Vera" (called "Little Vera" in English) is that it was the first film of the Soviet Union that presented a sex scene, albeit a short one. The title is important: Vera is the Russian word for "faith", identifying that Vera punk (Natalya Negoda) has little faith in the Soviet system. And as the movie shows, there is not much faith in it. The opening scene shows the grim industrial city of Zhdanov, almost a hell on earth. When Vera's lover, Sergei (Andrey Sokolov) moves with his family, unexpected events occur. <br /> <br /> As in many Russian films, the names of people describe their characters. For example, there is Viktor (remember that "winner" means winner). In general, this is a good look at the Soviet Union when it was collapsing, and we can see why it collapsed. Really good.
