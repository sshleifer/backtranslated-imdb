First of all, this film is a piece of reality very well done artistically. Some type of combination between "American Beauty" and "As good as it gets". And, of course, something specific for all Russian films (of course, the valuable, no dirty propaganda!): The problem of man's loneliness ... or negative propaganda!). A film about ordinary people, their problems, the lack of satisfaction, especially for young people, the fear of touching the real and too dirty face of society ... and the false "solutions": alcohol and violence. .. and probably the only real solution: true love ... Of course, it is very well "located" in the space and time of the "Russian perestroika", but it is valid for the whole society (except a perfect one, but not worry, it is not possible to find it) in our land!). For the last time - definitely recommended ...
