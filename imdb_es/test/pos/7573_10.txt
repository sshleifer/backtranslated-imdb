The ending of Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters was the best movie I've seen in my life. The person in the story that I liked the most had to be Cassie played by Emily Osment. Only for your energy and for how your mind says. For example, when Anna calls from the city, Cassie wants to respond and she says, "Hello, Anna, guess what, Grandpa got lost but now he's back and he's not a good man!" I loved all Sarah Plain and high movies for my rating. I think Sarah Plain and tall was number 3. Skylark was # 2. End of winters was # 1! If I could live in a family of the past, it would have to be the Witting family. I think there are so many good parts in this movie that I can not name them all. I think they chose the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie, so if you ever want to see a movie from the past, I would highly recommend Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters end.
