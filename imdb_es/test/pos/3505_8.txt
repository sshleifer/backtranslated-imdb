Ali G Indahouse has to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and Cohen's portrayal of a British gangsta is very funny. This movie has a cult classic written everywhere, and it has some really cool lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good movie for parties that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. Definitely vote for Ali G and keep it real.
