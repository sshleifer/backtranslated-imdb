A GOOD THING: this hidden treasure of a criminal drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end. An example of low-budget cinema at its best, writer / director Skip Woods apparently uses everything he could find (eg, Lamborghini, super model, cow phone) and an ear for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and all its camera configurations. <br /> <br /> ANOTHER GOOD THING: This movie seems to be made for the DVD era, with several segments that comprise a larger story (similar to the work of Desperado by Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez). Each "chapter" of the film features the main character of Thomas Jane who spends a day at home and encounters quick and memorable performances by Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter, James LeGros and an unforgettable role by Paulina Porizkova . <br /> <br /> Even another good thing: it's not exactly a "good" thing, but it's incredibly shocking and memorable ... Every person who watches this movie remembers an important scene. As much as Deliverance is remembered for its horrible violation of Ned Beatty, on Thursday it will become the film in which a woman rapes a reluctant man by force. Unforgettable. <br /> <br /> A BAD THING: the title makes people think that it is somehow related (or a derivative of) the "Friday" movie series that presents Ice Cube. <br /> <br /> DEGREE: A +
