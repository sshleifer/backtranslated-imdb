Uzumaki (which is Japanese for "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd movies I've seen. A city becomes obsessed and then consumed by the vortex pattern in very grotesque ways. The fingertips are cut, people commit suicide in the washing machines ... simply the wild and crazy Japanese horror. Possibly as psychologically damaging as "The Ring". Generally it is not as scary as "The Eye", but the image of this is more sickly than most things in "The Eye". And not as bloody as "The untold story" ... but that does not mean there is not a good amount of blood and dismemberment. Seriously, if you like horror movies and especially Asian horror, you should add this movie to your list. Some parts are a bit strange with the sound effects (the story is adapted from a manga comic book and it looks), but it really fits. Unlike some movies that try to capture the original source ("House of the Dead"), it does it perfectly. The most original movie you'll see ... not only this year, but probably never. Recommended!
