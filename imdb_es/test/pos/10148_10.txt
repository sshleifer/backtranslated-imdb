The man who knew too much of 1956 is an exceptional entertainment. To those who prefer the 1934 original, I will tell you that it is faster and more ingenious. However, even though the American version was (God forbid!) A great budget success, I think it makes the British version come out of the water. I think this is one of the 10 best Hitchcock exploits, since he made more than 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time. I find many things to love: <br /> <br /> 1) James Stewart, the favorite man of the United States for so many years, does an excellent job playing the anguished father here. He can make any movie enjoyable, and by working with such a nice character in such an exciting story, he encouraged me very intensely. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing compared. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes, Doris Day. Despite all the criticism directed towards her, I believe that she turns the loving wife / mother into an extremely understanding person. I do not agree with the negative comments towards his character; the fact that it is gentle and kind does not mean that it is docile and defenseless. I do not want to ruin anything, but she makes a crucial discovery for herself after her husband has failed. She gives the story a level of warmth that simply was not there in the first, and for those who care about that, this version is the way to go. And I loved That It Will Be; I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and deservedly won his Oscar. He elevated the film to another level. <br /> <br /> 3) The Albert Hall sequence. I do not think it was too long; I think the suspense was built all the time until that incredible crescendo and Hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the killer was really scary. <br /> <br /> 4) The ending really put a smile on my face; Even after the aforementioned scene was over, I found that the rescue scene was exciting and it was great to see the lovely family again. The last line in the movie is very funny. I do not think the movie started slowly; Hithcock was trying to get us to meet and like the McKennas and he did a great job. I was not a big fan of the child who played with Hank, but I had no problem with him. Since Hank was the son of Ben and Jo, I was also worried about him; It's not like I'm a brat or something. <br /> <br /> I did not find any major flaws in this film and so many major and minor virtues. Way to go Hitch!
