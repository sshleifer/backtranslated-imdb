Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of young and old audiences around the world, and his most recent film work is "Ponyo," a children's tale of fairy tales about elements of the Little Mermaid story. Of course, like other Miyazaki classics such as "Spirited Away" and his latest film, "Howl's Moving Castle", "Ponyo" is full of a creativity that only adults can truly appreciate, but this is clearly more of a story for children that Those recent efforts. It is a magical story best described as beautiful and adorable, that points to charm rather than conflict. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" is the story of a childlike fish with the insect eye of the same name, the daughter of an underwater wizard, who longs to escape from the sea and become a girl. When she does, she quickly befriends a young man named Sosuke. In the process, she gains a strong magic and, unknowingly, causes the world to lose balance between land and sea, and a giant storm drowns most of the city at the top of a cliff where Sosuke lives with his mother, and threatens to end the world. <Br /> <br /> Like "Howl's Moving Castle," Walt Disney picked up "Ponyo" for a US release and dubbed it an impressive selection of Western voices, even choosing local products in the younger brothers from the Disney band, the Jonas Brothers. (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) to express Sosuke and Ponyo, respectively. They also play characters such as Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Ponyo's father), Tina Fey (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (mother of Ponyo's sea goddess) and a trio of hilarious old women played by Betty White. Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is definitely there to make this movie attractive to the American public and Disney is approaching. <br /> <br /> But voices are of little importance in a Miyazaki film, which has to do with visual creativity. A fan of transformations and animation of fluid and fluid movements, creating a fairy tale partly underwater must have been a joy for Miyazaki to work on, and perhaps even his complete motivation for choosing this story. Among the highlights are the drops of water that Fujimoto sends after Ponyo that move like live waves, as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and impressive storm scenes make "Ponyo" as impressive as any other movie of Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> As a children's story, however, "Ponyo" concentrates its efforts on being adorable. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is poignant, even if Noah Cyrus screams childishly when Ponyo enthusiastically embraces human life can be a bit annoying. But however charming many of the imaginative elements and romantic relationships are, there is very little antagonism or danger. Miyazaki's previous films have clear villains, but the conflict in "Ponyo" actually narrows as the story progresses. Sosuke believes that he lost his mother at one point and, in the background, the idea that the world is mad and that humans should be ashamed to pollute the sea, but "Ponyo" has almost no tension. The most obvious is that his climax runs without incident, despite how nice all the characters are. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" will surely satisfy Miyazaki fans in every way with his imagination, and newcomers will still be hit by his simple but visually ambitious narrative, but this is clearly more of a movie for children, better for families and other people who love fantasy regardless of their form or target audience. It's not exactly what you expect from Miyazaki considering his recent work, but it will surely be remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
