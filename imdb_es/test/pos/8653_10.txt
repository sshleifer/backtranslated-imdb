The movie is a great reflective watch. I think it's a movie about how you'd like it to be if you lived in a world created by catalogs. The scenes are perfect recreations of an Ikea catalog that even look at the furniture on your TV. When they enter the kitchen, they discover another perfect image of what a kitchen would look like in a catalog. When reborn or whatever you want to call it, return to the harsh reality of life. I love the part when he tells his new love that he has left his partner. He makes fun of commercial happiness by saying that you can have everything and, at the same time, it is good to have the same things, but some things that you do not want to share. A film without children also by Say is a perfect ten.
