Forever Strong is one of those sports movies that you can really see. It reminded me a lot of Remember the Titans because it included comedy, sadness and simply amazement. I saw it in a pre-selection and all my friends liked it and they put it easily in their 2 best sports films. The acting is great in the movie. Although it is similar to Remember the Titans, there is something very special about this movie. I feel that this is definitely worthy of Oscar and I will receive many awards. Everyone should go to see this movie and it's worth paying $ 10. I'll have to see it again when it comes out because it was so good. I can not say anything bad about the movie.
