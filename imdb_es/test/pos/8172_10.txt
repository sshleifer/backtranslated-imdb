Having grown as a Mormon and dealt with church fanaticism towards blacks (I was not allowed to have the priesthood of the church when I was a member). I was not aware of the organizations' policy of excommunicating homosexual men and women until I left. the church in 1966 - (I was 20 years old). I was surprised when I learned that friends who were homosexuals were excommunicated even after serving missions. LAST DAYS expose the persecution of gay members to Mormons. The movie is very delayed. He does an excellent job of showing how the two leading males reconcile, while they manage to grow and develop more fully as individuals. LATTER DAYS has a great heart, wonderful original music and a touch of additional class by Jacqueline Bisset. The film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the confines of organized religion and regains his soul.
