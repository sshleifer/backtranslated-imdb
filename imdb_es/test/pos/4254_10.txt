I saw this movie in his brief career in the "art house" cinema in '69. I found it so funny that I literally spent part of the movie on the floor, having laughed so hard that I fell out of my seat. In retrospect, years later, I thought Melvin Van Peebles had done it. When I mentioned it to a friend, he said that a friend of his, Downey Sr., fulfilled virtually all the roles that did not act in the film: director, writer, producer, etc. He was right, of course, and my memory was wrong. except that this was one of the funniest movies ever made. The part of "the Arabs" was particularly priceless.
