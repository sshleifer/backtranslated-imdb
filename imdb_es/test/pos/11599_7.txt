I saw this film at the Locarno Film Festival in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 7/10 because of its Pleasant moments. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers ahead * <br /> <br /> It has some really nice cinematic moments, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> Although my general feeling is too long (more than 2 hours and 40 minutes) and contains too many dialogues. And there is almost no dancing. <br /> <br /> Clearly, a Bollywood movie like Lagaan or Devdas is a kind of film quite different compared to Chokher Bali.
