This is the first movie I've given a 10 in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word of mouth to promote it, here it is. A box of $ 4 thousand is a disgrace. People do not know what it is about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that's just a reason to go see it. How many people knew that Jackson could sing, and damn well too. You listen to books and movies mocking that it's about salvation. After seeing this, you can never forgive such a trivial use of the word. Yes, it's a stark truth, sexy, at home, strange and in your real face. Is not that the best reason to watch a movie? Those who understand my meaning will not be far from seeing this another week.
