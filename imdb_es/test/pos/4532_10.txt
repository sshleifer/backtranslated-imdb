It's possible that this movie did not seem like much to some people, but it had everything I wanted in a comedy. drop funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of really moving scenes, great actors and almost everything that is supposed to be a good movie. despite the fact that David Spade played his usual sarcastic character, he made this role an unusual performance that I think he had never overcome until he came to the screen with dirty Joe. Regardless of whether some people were not fans of Chris Farley, I watched this movie when it came out and my friends and I still talked about that ... 11 years later. this movie was what finally told me that Chris Farley was the real deal. He's the best comedian I've seen in my life. in the words of some, it could be clumsy, intelligent, funny, serious, crazy, sober and moving or depressing at the same time. They are not the same words but the message is all that counts. One of the true great actors of our time, and one of the true great comedy of all time. along with good acting, good story, fun moments, serious scenes that sometimes make me cry. This film is at the top of the hordes as a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world of the late great Chris Farley. No actor before or since has captured my interests in a film since then. Because no actor before or since has put so much into his films. This movie is worth it, if you have not taken the trouble to see it the next time you rent it.
