I really enjoy this movie. The first time was in Turner Classic Movies. All the actors did very well, but Brynner steals the show again as usual (it's so sexy!). This is one of the movies in which you see Brynner's emotions. Actually, this movie is the first time I see him laugh because he plays very strong, big and serious roles in other films. In this film you see a masculine, hard and sensitive side of Brynner. Brynner seems to be a "man of the ladies" in this movie. It's amazing how Brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian language that drives me crazy. love. I do not understand when Brynner and Kerr (both have very good chemistry) star in a movie together and then Brynner always dies at the end, somehow reminds you of "The King and me".
