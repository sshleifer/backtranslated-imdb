It may contain spoilers <br /> <br /> This historical movie was so refreshing. Although it may be exaggerating the actual events, it shows the ruthless nature of Emperor Qui, who was later infamous. And there was not a single computer generated person in it. I think it's great that China has produced such an epic movie. The costumes and settings were beautiful, the performances were also excellent. Dignity in the face of death is an important theme in this film and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also enjoyed a small allusion to the terracotta warriors, a 3D map carved of the conquest of China with individual soldiers. The Emperor Qui, of course, later, buried with his life-size terracotta warriors. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even if he only had a small scene. <Br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
