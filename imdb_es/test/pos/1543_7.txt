The premise of the story is quite common; the average family wants to get out of the rat race; he wants to find simple life ... so they move from Sherman Oaks, California to Lake Tomahawk; children on their backs. <br /> <br /> The lake is beautiful, they have rented an old house ... but wait; There may be something in the lake; People are being killed, and nobody knows how (no matter why). Gerald McRaney is excellent, a familiar face for lifelong viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; Since this movie was made in '88, maybe the writer should produce a sequel. <br /> <br /> You'll also enjoy Barry Corbin as the eccentric city, and Darryl Anderson as a military-looking Bruce Dern / madman. <br /> <br /> While the plot of the story is a bit exaggerated; if you are a movie fan, you will be reminded of similar "Psycho" scenarios; ""Release""; as well as other horror stories of that genre. Several shots and camera sequences will give you a déjà vu feel. <br /> <br /> Sit and enjoy; If you do not take it very seriously, it's very entertaining. and better than, for example, the most recent movie: <br /> <br /> "" I know what you did last summer ""; It seems they made better movies in the good old 80's.
