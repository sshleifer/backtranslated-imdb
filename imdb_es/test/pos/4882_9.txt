Finally!!! A good movie made about the most demented serial killer in history. For those less familiar with Ed Gein, he was basically the madman who was known to steal tombs and skin his victims (which most horror fans had scammed). Shot in a vintage style that perfectly reflects the grim plains of Wisconsin, this is easily the most atmospheric horror film yet to represent Gein and his horrific murders. Kane Hodder (Jason of Friday the 13th of the series) and Michael Berryman (Hills have Eyes I and II), offer chilling performances in this opus of serial killers that easily leaves behind the mediocre attempts of Gein. Until now, I would say that this is one of the best horror movies released this year (Tourists = 0).
