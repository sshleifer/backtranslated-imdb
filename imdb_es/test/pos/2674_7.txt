As far as the Christian film is concerned, it's typical. In the absence of a mega budget, they do the best they can. Sometimes they fall short, sometimes they reach the mark. This almost successful, the great performance can only take a movie so far. A combination of H.P. Lovecraft and Frank Peretti were a good idea. All I needed was a better background story and better character development to make a great movie. The images are not so bad, it is also smart to keep the demons at bay until the last minute helped keep the suspense at a good pace. However, a better ending could be used. It is not a bad premise to have terrorist experiments that go badly. Much better than the typical Hollywood treatment of the demonic realm. Maybe someone will finally make "This darkness present" like a movie.
