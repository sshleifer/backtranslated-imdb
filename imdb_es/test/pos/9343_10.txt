John Landis really surpassed himself when he directed Michael Jackson's THRILLER as a short film. Of course, it is corny, the dialogue is terrible and everything seems too corny, but nevertheless it is perfect. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date are at the cinema to watch the latest horror movie. . When everything becomes a bit too graphic for the date, she leaves. Michael continues. On the way home, they decide to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. There it begins. <br /> <br /> The real suspense dance is amazing. It's full of Jackson's trademark moves, as well as some memorable zombie moves. It does not seem rushed at all, nor too long. Everything looks like a movie and it's really scary. Of course, it is one of the most famous music videos of all time and is probably the best music video ever made. <br /> <br /> In general: Look at it, really. Those 13 minutes will be some of the best past looking at a screen. (5/5)
