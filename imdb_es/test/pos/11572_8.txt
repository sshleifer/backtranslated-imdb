"Thesis", "Open your eyes" and "The Others" were proof of Amenabar's talent and ability as a filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) they were also defective films in their attempt to outwit the audience, always offering a twist the screw too many, favoring cheap emotions, twists and turns about depth and resonance. Luck for all Amenabar chose a theme for his new movie that would not allow a surprising ending, focusing on the characters and the emotional ties that bind them. <br /> <br /> The result is a small miracle of a film, beautifully written, photographed, qualified, acted and directed. Everyone involved in this film offers high performance, behind and in front of the cameras, from the wonderful cast (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due√±as give the film an amazing authenticity) to the exquisite Aguirresarobe . lenses <br /> <br /> The film tackles many relevant themes and emotions effectively, addresses the heart and mind with the same power and delivers a final blow that stays with you long after the credits end. This is a brilliantly executed film that will not only become a milestone in Spanish cinema, but will surely become a welcome surprise when it is released abroad (Sony Classics paid a record $ 6 million to distribute it). surprise if he manages to enter the Oscar race ... There is no stopping. Amenabar ... <br /> <br /> Good job, Alejandro!
