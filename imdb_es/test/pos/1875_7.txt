It's really been a long time since someone created a movie like this one. A so-called B movie Maybe it was not a great movie, but it's fun to watch, the classic Bruce Cambell, has its good parts, fun, disgusting, even artistic. <br /> <br /> ****** Spoiler Ahead ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---- --------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------- <br /> <br /> The part where his wife, as a robot-avenger doll, She's about to die, I do not know about you, but she made me feel so strange, so sad and disgusted in a good way. I compare this scene with the Fly 2 scene where your dog dies as a monster. It makes you think, oh my God. <br /> <br /> ---------------- ------------------- ------- ------------------- ------------------------ ------ - ------------------------- <br /> <br /> ******** No more Spoilers ****** *** <br /> <br /> If you're a Bruce Cambell fan, you definitely want to have this movie in your collection. If in general you are interested in movies, maybe you want to. Think that the objective of the movies is to make you smile, make fun of you (although do not worry about that) and make you have a good time with your friends. Attention, I said friends, it is not possible future bride.
