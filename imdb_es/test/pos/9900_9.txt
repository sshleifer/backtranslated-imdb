Morris and Reva Applebaum had been the toast of Broadway in its heyday. At ninety, Morris is a widower. He summons his children, the psychotherapist and the BMW car dealer, and his daughter, the writer and television producer, to attend a party in his honor, after which he himself will undergo euthanasia. The literal-minded creatures that are, take what he says at face value. He guides them, their grandchildren, and others, including an African-American and Jewish psychiatrist who remembers Godfrey Cambridge, in a happy chase through Manhattan while trying to stop or dissuade him. <br /> <br /> The comedy totally works. The performances are excellent. Peter Falk is in top form. This film does more than deserve an audience: it deserves popular success.
