Although this was a movie of only less than forty minutes, it is one of the best directed and acted stories I've seen. Achieved in less than 45 minutes what most films can not in more than 90. <br /> <br /> It is the story of two brothers, one of 18 and another of 10. They come from a family of farmers poor in Mississippi. Both are trapped in war and in the conflict of duties, love for the family. <br /> <br /> It made me cry, especially because the whole movie is very well acted and directed, also tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other is left behind. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie completely as more than excellent!
