(Very mild spoilers, a scheme of the basic plot, without real details) <br /> <br /> IF you enter this movie with low enough expectations. I saw this movie in a free projection a few days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go ... was because it was free. I expected some giggles, but since I've never been a big fan of Tenacious D, not much more than that. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes of the film are very funny, as we are given a look at Jack Black's humble Christian origins in a Midwestern city in the United States. The film then takes us years in the future, to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the second half of the film details his quest to obtain the legendary "Pick of Destiny". Once again, the beginning of the movie was a funny laugh, and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. That said, there were times when he felt a little long; It's only 100 minutes, but it still looks like it should have been a little shorter. The story is as absurd as it seems, and this is not a movie that you see if you want a real plot. Which is fine, except that it means that many of the jokes are very unpredictable ... and when they fail, they fail badly. The same with the songs; It's a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... then they continued anyway. <br /> <br /> I'll say that the R rating really saved this movie from the bombing; The mood of the D simply could not work without references to the curse, sex and drugs. But unless you're a true fan of the band, or at least you know you appreciate their comedy style, I would recommend that you save some money and resources. "Choose" will make you laugh a little ... but is it worth paying $ 9? I do not think so. I was tempted to rate it with a 6, but as I think many would enjoy it enough to justify its presence in theaters, a 7 seems more appropriate. Just make sure it's your style.
