This is a profound and moving work on the creation of art, which is only human and can not be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what ultimately constitutes family, that is, all of us . I was very touched by the family discussion that Nathaniel had with his sisters about his father's deficiencies, since he settled in a beautiful house that seemed to radiate the heat that Lou had created. And although Esther seems so cold in her discussion of Lou's inability to make money, one can appreciate how, in many moments of her life, it must have been a counterweight to her impulses. Nathaniel did a great job of showing how all the people in Lou's life fit in and completed him, and he became as important a part of his work as his own genius. Yes, even, or perhaps especially, our failures make us who we are. And, of course, there are the buildings. I had only met Lou Kahn by name and I really did not relate his name to his work, they are evidence of grace. Maybe one day there will be a building in which we all fit, and it will undoubtedly look like a Lou Kahn building, perhaps the unbuilt temple in Jerusalem. Maybe there is salvation
