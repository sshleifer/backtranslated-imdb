The robust David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and the drugged Dr. Abner Perry (a deliciously dotty Peter Cushing) pierce their way to the core of the earth in their spiffy mole machine. The duo discovers an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous giant beasts and humans that are used as food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men. Director Kevin Conner, who works from a blithely silly script by Milton Subotsky, maintains a constant and energetic pace at all times and treats the exceptionally silly premise with an astounding seriousness, which gives this image a certain rather serious quality which is fun and endearing in equal measure. The special effects of loably hokey (not so) are quite (unintentionally) fun. The cheesy variety of low-priced creatures, in particular, are positively side-cut: grumpy men in rubber clothes, pterodactyl men, rude men of nice men, and an incredibly ridiculous hilarious frog that blows up nicely. A culminating point that destroys The intestines occur when McClure mixes it with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. Another scene that is priceless represents a dinosaur that grabs a doll in its enslaving jaws. On the other hand, we also received some fighting and an exciting climatic revolt of slaves. It's a pleasure to see Cushing cheerfully divide him into a wide and rare comedy part and become an unlikely, but enthusiastic, arrow shot action hero in the last third of the movie. The always exquisite Caroline Munro looks positively delicious like the alluring Princess Dia, plus Cy Grant has good support turns like the gallant warriors Ra and Sean Lynch as the cowardly traitor Hoojah. The carefully varied note of Mike Vickers alternates between cheerful orchestral music and synthesizer material. Alan Hume's crisp cinematography adds a brilliant glow to infectiously insane procedures. A complete riot of riots.
