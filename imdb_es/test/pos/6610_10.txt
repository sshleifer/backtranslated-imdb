In the genius of the mid-70s, a disheveled group of young teenagers from Venice, California, from broken homes and the bad side of the city known as the Z-Boys, became a professional skateboard world in their ear with his fierce punk attitude and radical unconventional driving. style and unbridled spirit of pure aggression in your face, revolutionizing the sport in the process and paving the way for the many extreme variations in the sports that emerged in its influential wake. Director Stacy Peralta, who is one of the legendary Z-Boys, recounts the incredible feats of this amazing ragtag team in a fiercely powerful and visceral way that is both informative and tremendously entertaining: fast and agile editing, rhythm incessant and fast The stark photography offers a hell of a buzz of infectious kinetics, which projects a sensation of pure joy and an energy full of energy that is a total pleasure for the eyes. Even better, this documentary does not disinfect or romanticize their subjects: these boys of the rough class were so fiercely competitive and got away with it that they all split up when the appeal of fame and fortune manifested in their lives. The final destiny of certain boys is touching and heartbreaking, with the qualification of Jay Adams, talented and spontaneous, of the skate rat, as the saddest and most tragic: he lost his chance in the big moment and ended up in jail. The other types are very colorful and nice too; The charismatic ball of arrogant and defiant fire, Tony Alva, in particular, is presented as an arrogant but impressive piece of work furiously assertive. Wonderfully narrated with deliciously easy and windy nasal indifference from Sean Penn. The fantastic rock soundtrack also smokes seriously. But what really makes this documentary a winner is its complete and refreshing shortage of pretensions: it's as dynamic, exuberant and extraordinary as the glorious and outrageous Z-Boys.
