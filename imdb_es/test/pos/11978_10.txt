All the people who voted a meager 1 in this movie, this is all I have to say: you have not matured enough to enjoy a cinema of this kind. It takes some dedication to achieve that level of appreciation. And that is the segment of people to whom this film was directed. It's not an average viewer by chance! . Return to the movie This was a gem and definitely an inclusion in the Bollywood Hall of Fame. It would give you an all-time rank of # 2, surpassed only by the legendary Gunda of Kanti Shah. This movie had an impeccable story and created a beautiful mix between fantasy and science fiction. In fact, the Pan Labyrinth would have been ashamed of the balance created between the parallel stories. And now I really need to mention the star cast and even the interpretations of them (it's a word from NOW) (a special mention goes to Mr. Nigam for the best debut in any movie about this land). All the actors in this film were chosen with great care and the paper was made to measure for them (and also for their age, I should add). Manisha Koirala still seems to be 18 years old and wow man, with that figure I would have also raped her. Are you wondering where this rape thing came from all of a sudden? Yes, a violation is what the premises of this film are based on. And that's not like average Bollywood movies. If you are an atheist or an agnostic by chance, this film is again a necessity for you. Because this movie can heal your faith. I do not think I'll go too far saying that this movie can cure cancer. Only the people who need it most can not appreciate its power, charm and eternal beauty. Tchch, how unfortunate! <br /> <br /> It just fails in this movie: In your dreams, baby! This was impeccable. <br /> <br /> Only one minor complaint: the director could not star in Mithun Da either. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin it for you anymore. Just go and look at it. TODAY. And if you like it, here are some more recommendations from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, the old horror films of Ramsay Brothers, Loha, Indra the tiger and Sivaji.
