For the sake of propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was transferred to the present. One of the results is "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon," starring Holmes, Basil Rathbone, along with Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Karen Verne. Holmes's task is to deliver a scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) and his weapons design to the British government before the Germans can catch him. Once the man arrives in England, however, his problems are just beginning. Can Holmes decipher the message that Dr. Tobel left before falling into the hands of the vicious Moriarity, saving the weapon and possibly also the scientist? This is an effective story of Holmes, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and the blackout of England. The series worked well today. It was not without its problems, but those problems had nothing to do with the period of time. Whose idea was it to make Watson an idiot? The characterization of Nigel Bruce, aided and abetted by the scripts, has always been the false note. I much prefer the characterization of Edward Hardwicke in the series of Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes: there he is attractive, intelligent and a credible companion for Holmes. In the Rathbone series, Holmes is often condescending and treats Watson as the foolish fool he is. However, in this particular film, Watson has the opportunity to be quite useful in several parts. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am a complete sap for the recitation of Richard II by Rathbone - "... this blessed plot, this Earth, this England". I can not imagine how much it meant for the British to see the film in 1942. Sherlock Holmes really served his purpose.
