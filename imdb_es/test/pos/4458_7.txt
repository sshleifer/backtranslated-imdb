If you like who-dun-its, you will like this movie, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), that Fulci has made. <br /> <br /> It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to annoy anyone. <br /> <br /> Many would be offended by a local beauty who tries to seduce a 12-year-old child. She was joking, but she was naked, and he would have taken the opportunity to break her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest. <br /> <br /> Young boys are appearing missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can? Do not jump on the first man, it's too early, and he's too obvious. <br /> <br /> Anyone familiar with Fulci can guess who the killer was, who died a violent death at the end. What crazy reasoning he had.
