I've been waiting for this movie for so many years! Best of all, it is up to my visions! This is a must for any fan of Tenacious D or true Jack Black. It's great to see JB, KG and Lee on the big screen! It's not a true story, but who cares. The D is the best band on earth! I had the soundtrack of the movie last week and I listened to it non-stop. Watching the movie was pure happiness for me and my husband. We both met Jack and Kyle after 2 different concerts of Tenacious D and we also saw them when they did a tour with Weezer. We left that concert after the D finished playing. Nobody can beat their show! Long live the D! :RE
