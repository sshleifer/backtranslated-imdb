Although it does not seem very promising for a long stretch, the French Cancan de Renoir ends up being a charming and effortless film. The story is a cliché: a laundry girl, Nini (Françoise Arnoul), is discovered by the owner of a nightclub, Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops her current girlfriend, who returns for her former lovers. Nini has to choose whether to return to her humble life with the baker, continue with the show with her employer, oh, or become a princess, since a prince also falls in love with her at some point. I'm glad that the film has not chosen the most obvious option, as a smaller film would have done. The film ends with the opening of the new Danglard nightclub, the Moulin Rouge, and a couple of magnificent numbers of songs and dances. The first one, "Complainte de la Butte", which also provides the basis for most of the film's musical score, is simply one of the most beautiful songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote it. If you are a fan of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 Moulin Rouge movie, you will recognize the melody as it approaches the beginning of that film, sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although it's not very prominent in that movie, everyone I know who owns the soundtrack loves it. In addition to having one of the most beautiful songs ever written, French Cancan also has one of the most beautiful and beautiful women on the screen. It's hard not to fall in love with that girl. 8/10.
