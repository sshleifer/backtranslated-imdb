It is definitely a "must see" for all black movie fans. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a good script and a clear and clear direction in which it joins a team of first quality, it works like a well oiled watch to produce a psychological thriller of crackerjack. . <br /> <br /> The wonderful characterizations articulate the powerful message of racial and religious tolerance of the film. It is difficult and almost unfair to highlight a particular performance because there is not a weak link in the whole company, but Robert Ryan, the obnoxious and violent white supremacist, is really creepy. <br /> <br /> Making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. Now, all these years later, at a time when contemporary films are dominated by ridicule about rude language, naked breasts, bad acting and deafening soundtracks, it's comforting to return to the basics of quality filming with a show like "Crossfire". <br /> <br /> Another low-budget gem from the Hollywood archives.
