Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He is a great actor and I could be his girl at any time. He is very well. He was so sad at the end. I will not ruin the end but wow. The girls are so vicious. Your girl was wrong. If Eddie were my man, he would never be disrespectful. Those gangsters were scary. The moral of the story is Trust No One. Your friends will hurt you if they can. Oh, and Eddie, tell your girlfriend that you're mine, she should move the eggs! I would suggest watching the movie. Why? Becasur I said it. He kept my eyes on the screen. My sister also loved it, so I'll see it again because now my friends want to see it and it's worth seeing twice. Peace, happy new year!
