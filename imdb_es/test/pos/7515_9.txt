Read a biography of the late George C. Scott and you will discover why he had such a huge talent. An interviewer asked him what his secret was when creating each character he played. Scott replied, that he possessed within him a blazing fire that drove him. In one of his last interviewers, he sadly revealed that he had lost the way. This was not the case when he starred in the movie "The Hospital." In this offer, he plays the talented Dr. Bock, medical director of one of the best hospitals in the country. However, life has caused him some crippling problems, such as losing his wife to a divorce, getting away from his promising children and, worse still, believing he is physically helpless. At this point, he is now becoming complacent, moody and frequently fantasizes about various ways of committing suicide. To add to his growing list of personal obstacles, his main reason for being, his hospital has been besieged by students and neighborhood protesters, incompetent doctors like Dr. Welbeck (Richard Dysart) and a mysterious doctor of medicine. who is killing patients and doctors alike, because he believes it is "the Wrath of the Lamb." (Barnard Hughes). Few options are left for Bock. One is the promising doctor Brubaker (Robert Walden), whom he trusts saying: "If there were an oven around here, I would put my head on it". The second is a delicious young woman, named Barbara, who is attracted to Bock because he acts like a wounded bear. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the screen and Arthur Hiller did an extremely good job of directing this dark, dramatically interesting story, but a vehicle, however, illuminated by the fire of George C. Scott. ****
