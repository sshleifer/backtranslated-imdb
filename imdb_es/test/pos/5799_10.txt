It is difficult, today and in the United States, to understand this movie. We have nothing, really, to compare it. Here is an attempt at comparison: it is as if during the last years of Saddam's government, a filmmaker in Iraq could make a film that, for the first time, showed life as it was lived in that country. The life of a normal girl, with all the terror and repression in every rule. Then the film was displayed freely in Iraq. If I could imagine that unlikely event, then I might have an idea of ​​what happened with this movie in the last years of the Soviet Union. Before this film, the Soviet cinema was highly censored. Soviet films would only show an ideal life in the worker's paradise. Then suddenly this. Alcoholism, random sex, the desert and unpleasant territory that was the Soviet city, the suffocating contamination, the proletariat victimizing each other and with themselves, the absolute despair: everything is there. The people were stunned. Soviet women used to cry during the screenings. Many would say that this is the story of their lives. It was a cultural earthquake that filmmakers only dream of achieving. Without a doubt, it accelerated the dissolution of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> By reading the comments here, I can see that few understand this movie. One says it was innovative because it contained real sex. For Soviet viewers at that time, sex was a minor event compared to the fact that it portrayed reality for the first time in Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> Others compare it to current movies like "As good as it gets" They could also compare Homer's Illiad with John Grissam's latest novel. They just do not compare. This is not just a movie, it is a social document and a transforming social force. He needs to be seen that way or he will not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Other critics see it as a movie about a dysfunctional Russian family. It is even said that it is difficult to feel sorry for Vera because she keeps coming back with her family. The point is that Vera and her family are symbols for all of Soviet life. There was no other place to go, because the family on the block and in the next city were the same. This was life in the Soviet Union for most people. <br /> <br /> This is a film that can be seen on many levels: as a drama crosses the landscape of despair, as a social document that shows the living conditions of the time, as a political document that shows the The attitude of the people and many of the reasons for the break-up of the Soviet Union, and as a moral document, shows the evils of a dictatorship that is out of control and the cruelties that the victims will practice among themselves. <br /> <br /> Little Vera clearly shows the human cost that socialism finally assumes in its victims, despite the good intentions that the system may have. In doing so, it helped to end the Soviet regime, thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history. This film accomplishes what only a few films have achieved. Not only is it an impressive representation of history, but it also becomes a force in that configured history.
