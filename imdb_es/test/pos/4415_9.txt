I was a high school student in high school when "Flesh" came to the giant screens, but I was fortunate to see it in the midnight movie theaters in New York City only two years later. <br /> <br /> Flesh is the first part of a The so-called "trilogy" of the films, with Joe Dallesandro, as an object of desire. It is called "Warhol", but it is more the work of Paul Morissey. Essentially, the story refers to the exploits that surround a day in the life of a male con man (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young, beautiful and a little naive ... but he manages to take home the bacon to his wife, for reasons that should not be explained to fully appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> Of special interest to movie fans is that this movie (along with the two remaining trilogy), had no script, per se. The superstars of Warhol received a simple premise ... and the words and actions that the viewer sees are quite natural (even sometimes ridiculous or unwise). But in general it works ... "Rolling Stone" pointed out in his review that the film was better than "Midnight Cowboy", a movie of the same year, more polished by Hollywood (winner of an Academy Award for Best Film), with great name talent (I also admire the film) ... but FLESH, being improvised, was somehow more heartbreaking and realistic, without the need for complex plots or any "cause de celebre" ... or any other cause. absolutely! <br /> <br /> The movie grossed more than $ 3 million and was an absolute sensation, particularly in the German market (which, ironically, thought they had been given a "censored version" of the film due to post-editing ... see the note below). <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the movie is a lot "cut and paste" with "pops". "clicks", "flashes" and dialogue, literally cut half of the sentence. It is almost as if Warhol / Morissey were claiming a simple truth that it is a "day in the life" of a superstar, fragments of their voyeuristic tendencies. Much better than Warhol's previous works: 8 hours of sleep and the Statue of Liberty as a movie of more than 20 hours. <br /> <br /> FLESH, in my opinion, is the first of Warhol's films that is actually digestible (given a wide palette) and Warhol / The Factory's first legitimate response to the Hollywood phenomenon of "stardom" " <br /> <br /> As the first of a "trilogy", it represents a young and desirable, naive male icon, sought after, responding to invitations to please his family. Subsequent films would show the "same character" with a different set of values. (See "Garbage" and "Heat")
