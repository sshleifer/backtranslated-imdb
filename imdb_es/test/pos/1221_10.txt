This movie was great! Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they did it. Tasha Smith was as funny as the cousin, and she could not stay out of business. Presence prevented him from his girl, when he needed her. Aloma was sweet and played like a dear grandmother. She really reminded me of my grandmother. And, oh, I can not forget the stripper, he was so focused, and I did not know if he should cover my eyes or smile while watching. He revealed his sensuality on the big screen. Damn! he was fine! Tangi looked impeccable and sexy, and she climbed a step from Felicity. Throughout the film there was a lot of "A", list of actors and actresses. It was fun, sexy, crazy, touching, affectionate, emotional and wonderful. This movie is one that I must see! Go to DVD now if you do not have it!
