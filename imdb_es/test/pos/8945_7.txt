A comical trip to the funeral business, usually somber. It's easy to see, and even offers Blethyn & Molina to steal a scene from an old Fred & Ginger movie. Walken is exaggerated as an enthusiastic competitor of Molina in the business of the company, trying to bring a new style to an old Welsh town. We see a couple of very funny examples of the "new style". The plot is complicated when Pugh has an affair with Watts, and she suggests that they do it with Blethyn. Meanwhile, Molina has rekindled her long romantic feeling for Blethyn, and convinces her to fake his death so they can flee to the southern seas, and dance away their days together. During the "false" funeral, Blethyn learns about the infidelities of their husbands and plans their revenge. Look to see what funerals should probably be: a celebration of life!
