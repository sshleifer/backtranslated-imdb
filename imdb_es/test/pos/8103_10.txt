"The Great Dictator" is possibly one of Charlie Chaplin's best-known films. He is notorious for his brazen satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Until I saw it, I only knew of its fame. Now I know how much the movie deserves. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film shows the exploits of Tomania's dictator, somewhat clumsy, ambitious, fused and impressive, Adenoid Hynkel; and with him, his close and dear staff: Field-Marshall Herring and Herr Garbitsch. In addition, it carries the exploits of an amnestic, emotional and often awkward Jewish barber, veteran of the First World War. <br /> <br /> Stopping with the plot, I would like to say that this film has several qualities that make it unique and wonderful. While the comedy is decidedly verbal and slapstick and incidental, the whole movie shows how serious it takes Nazism or aggressive nationalism as a subject with several interludes. Chaplin's impeccable acting skills extend the length and breadth of the film, continuing to stir it until it simply explodes. The position of Paulette Goddard as an ambitious Jewish revolver and the delivery by Henry Daniell of a nasal line, calm as death, serious as a heart attack makes it a wonderful vision. <br /> <br /> In addition, One aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it does not shoot. It is not "concealed", it does not have to be covered up. It is an obvious, brazen, obvious manifestation of both Hitler and Nazism. <br /> <br /> To summarize briefly, look at it. Just look at it, you'll see.
