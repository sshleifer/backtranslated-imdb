I've been a "big" Rush fan ever since "moving images" and this concert is simple and an example to all who are fans for whom Rush is so popular. They fully agreed to have played their biggest concert so far and, despite the rain on a football field, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during "yyz" that the whole crowd begins to sing in a really classic way, in perfect sync. They really play all the favorite songs of all with a real "lust" that rarely happens. You get the best seat in the house for one of your best concerts. The second DVD is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in Brazil and shows you many of the things behind the scenes and allows you to see them not only as musicians but as real people in their daily lives. This DVD gift set is a must for any Rush fan, young and old, and is definitely a guardian for your DVD collection. There is even a concert CD for those who just want to listen to the music. This DVD is worth it!
