This is a fantastic movie. The performance is one of the best I've seen. Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful, and automatically attracts you to the movie with her credible acting. The cinematography was very ahead of its time. When I saw it, I could see parallels of the cinematography used today. This is truly an innovative film. Due to the cinematography and the acting, the audience can feel the change of tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment of the film changes. It is a very moving and powerful piece. My friend told me that I should see, and I definitely agree with her. This is one of those movies that you see and never forget. Everyone should see this intensely moving film. This should be included in the "Movies to watch before ________ (whatever)" list.
