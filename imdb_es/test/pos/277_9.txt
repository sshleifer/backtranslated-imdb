So real and surreal, all in one. I remember feeling like Tessa. Hell, I remember being Tessa. This was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending. I especially liked the tangents of the protesters. It's good to see the symbolism in a movie without being hit in the head with it. If you have the opportunity to see this, take it. It's worth the 30 minutes.
