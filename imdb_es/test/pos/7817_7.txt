There are a number of comments that comment on the cast of this film. Suffice it to say that Alex Cord has a great advantage alongside Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. What worries me is that many of you may not be aware of the (at least) two existing versions of this movie. In the US version, Clay McCord gets an amnesty from Governor Lem Carter and then leaves the city to be redeemed. I agree that the ending is less than satisfactory. However, in the original Italian court, Clay McCord leaves the city (unarmed, as he handed his pistols to the Governor) and is assaulted by the bounty hunters who have been slowly depopulating the city of bandits from Escondido. The Bounty Killers are excited about the prospect of splitting the $ 10,000 reward, but are disappointed to find McCord's amnesty agreement in the corpse pocket. As they move away, a comment is heard: "If this amnesty continues, I'm going to start hunting buffalo!" . Only this takes a minute to pray ... One second to die and places him on a uniform playing field with movies like Keoma and The Big Gundown. As they say the final credits in the Italian court "FINE".
