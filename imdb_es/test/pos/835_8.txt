The original female convict scorpion is a masterpiece of all time. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was not as good in my opinion, although it is still notable for the fact that it took the idea of ​​the original and created something with a completely different style. The director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same again with this film; The story is a little different here, but still managed to take what made the previous entries were excellent and better than many movies of this type and create something quite original around it. Once again, the action centers on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a. "Scorpion") and this time she is out of jail and does not like the idea of ​​going back. After escaping from pursuing police officers, one thing leads to the other and Scorpion finds himself meeting a prostitute and her retarded brother. The prostitute ends up being impregnated by the retarded brother (...), while Scorpion is kidnapped and imprisoned by someone he made an enemy in jail. But Scorpion does not like to spend time behind bars and it's not long before she does what she does best. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great start when we see Scorpion cut the arm of a collector. I try to take her back to jail. From there, however, the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the two previous films. That does not mean that there is not much action yet: Scorpion still spends a lot of time in "revenge mode" and the film is not exactly deficient in general. Meiko Kaji, once again, repeats her role as the sinister title character and is another discreet, almost speechless performance. However, his presence on the screen is excellent and he manages to have a threatening presence despite being only physically small. The structure of the plot of this film is similar to the other two in that everything becomes a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two, so this section occupies a large part of the film. There are a few surreal sequences, not as many as in the first film or as far as in the second, but the film continues with the rest of the series on that point. In general, I would say that this film is between the first two in terms of quality, not as good as the original and slightly better than the second.
