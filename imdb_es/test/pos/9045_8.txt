It may not be 10 out of 10, but for me the jokes did not fail. I've seen it many times when I was younger and again on DVD, I think, and I laughed every time. The humor is simple and fun, this movie was just one of the many small movies that Disney was launching at that time. I found the parts where people outside the invisible circle saw invisible people. There were expressions that have no price Great movie, if the opportunity arises to see this, I recommend seeing it for a good laugh of fashion. My favorite character in all Dexter series would definitely have to be Dean Higgins, I love his voice and to hear him angry, especially when he saw that his expression at the end was just hysterical for me.
