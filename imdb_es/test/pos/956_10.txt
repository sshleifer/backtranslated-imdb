If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli "Okkadu", you will find that this is very similar in the story line, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu, not in Andra Pradesh. Although this is a new version of "Okkadu", you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique movie, Vijay and Trisha make a great couple. A few negative points were when the character of Vijays slaps the character of Trishas for going to buy a gift, he never apologizes and she still stays with him at the end. Good action and songs make this a great movie in general. I recommend it. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10/10, one of the best I've seen.
