I am a big fan of the 1995 version, which I have seen many times and consider an excellent and subtle film. Yesterday I bought this version of 1971, a bit hesitant, but now that I've seen it I'm glad I did, because it's more true for the book and for Austen's ideas. The 1995 version has a more dramatic power largely because it sharpens many of the characters. In the 1995 version, Lady Russell is more cunning, more manipulative and less truly awaiting Anne. Sir Walter is even more vain and insipid; Elizabeth is more unpleasant; Maria is more unbearable; Mr. Elliot is more elegant; Lady Dalrymple is a lot stupider, but I think the characterizations in this 1971 version are closer to the book, Austen's vision and the real people of the time. The 1971 version also includes more key lines and scenes from the book, including especially the key scene in the field where Anne listens to Wentworth talking to Louisa (or is it Henrietta?) About the importance of character strength. I found the act more subtle and evocative than many of the critics here, but acting in the 1995 version is more powerful. I agree with the criticism that the actress who plays Anne is too old for the role; I searched for his entry in IMDb and he was 38 years old at the time of filming, when his character is supposed to be 28 years old. However, I thought that his performance was subtle and effective. Wentworth is the right age and I found it very convincing. In particular, this 1971 version of Wentworth has much more sense of his humor and jokes; The one in 1995, much more than the sense of power a boat captain would have, and more passion. The admiral in the 1971 version lacks the abrupt presence and human warmth of the 1995 version and lacks any feeling of power that an admiral would certainly convey; I found him the only truly weak element in production. I agree with the others that the staging of the "fall" scene was too harsh, and it seemed unconvincing that she had been so hurt by such a small fall. However, it could be that he hit the back of the head at the edge of the stone step, which, if so, would produce a very dangerous injury and make the scene more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version. , where it falls further but is free of any sharp edges that can cause a major head injury. As for the costumes that some have criticized, I'm not an expert and I can not answer, but I'll point out that none of the Navy characters (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version wear their uniforms, while in the 1995 version, they all constantly wear their fancy uniforms. I suspect that the 1971 version is the right one, and it always bothered me a bit in the 1995 version, since the officers are always in uniform when the nation is clearly at peace and the officers are separated from active duty. My father and my grandfather were captains of the US Navy. UU They were commanders of aircraft carriers and submarines, and did not spend every day while on leave or in their free time in their gala costumes. I doubt it was different 180 years ago. The uniforms give much importance to the 1995 version, and I prefer it, but I doubt that historically it is true that these officers wore their uniforms as often. Finally, it is true, the production values ​​of the 1971 version are much lower than those of the 1995 version, but given the year (1971), the TV format and the budget, we can not blame the artists for it . Contemporary viewers who can make a mental assignment to the lowest production values ​​can find this version well worth their time.
