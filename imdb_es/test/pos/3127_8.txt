A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross a harsh country on their way to a new settlement. This low-profile Western is unusual for Ford, as it lacks big stars. Johnson gets the maximum turnover, but his role is basically supportive, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than to provide love interest. The best performance is given by Ford's favorite, Bond, who is the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him get a leading role in the feature film "Wagon Train" by TV Western before his untimely death at the age of 57. With a beautiful cinematography, Ford considered this one of his favorite movies.
